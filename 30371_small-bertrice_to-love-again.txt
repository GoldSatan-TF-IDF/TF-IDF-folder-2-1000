bertrice small to love again prologue britain ad the celtic warrior a catuvellauni by tribe lay facedown in the mud upon the smoking earth his naked body battered and broken was painted a vibrant shade of blue around him a thousand more of his kind lay dead or dying while roman legionaries moved methodically over the battlefield administering the coup de grace to those unfortunate enough to still be clinging to life he could hear the calls of the carrion birds gathering and a shudder ran through him nearby a party of roman officers stood watching turning his head slightly he viewed them through slitted eyelids recognizing to his amazement the emperor himself the warrior moved his hand stealthily toward his javelin slowly his fingers closed about its shaft feeling the comfortable familiarity of the smooth ashwood he was barely breathing but it did not matter breathing hurt too much now with superhuman effort he pulled himself stiffly to his feet then howling like a demon he hurled his weapon directly at the roman emperor exhausting every bit of his remaining strength to the warriors deep disappointment a tall young tribune standing in the group reacted far more swiftly than he would have thought possible and flung himself in front of the emperor taking the full brunt of the javelin in his kneecap the catuvellauni warrior had no time to admire the young mans bravery he was already dead his head severed from his neck by a second tribune who had leapt forward in his own defense of the emperor the head its long hair bloody and matted rolled across the ground stopping at the feet of the emperor claudius looked down and sighed deeply he recognized the head as belonging to one of the personal bodyguards of the catuvellauni war chief he had noticed the boy when the catuvellauni had come to talk peace even as they were treacherously massing their forces in an attempt to drive the romans from britain the young man had a smallish but very distinct birthmark upon his left cheekbone claudius physically impaired himself was quick to notice others with impairments of any kind he shook his head sadly he did not like war so many young lives like this one wasted young men fought wars but it was the old men like himself who planned those wars he turned away from the severed head giving his attention now to the tribune who had shielded him from certain death how is he the emperor asked the surgeon who was kneeling by the tribunes side staunching the copious flow of blood hell live came the dour reply but there will be no more soldiering for this one caesar the javelin by the grace of the gods missed the artery to his heart it has chipped the knee bone and damaged the tendons the boy will walk with a marked limp the rest of his days claudius nodded and then he asked the injured young man what is your name tribune flavius drusus caesar are we related then the emperor wondered aloud for he was claudius drusus nero distantly caesar who is your father titus drusus caesar and my brother is also titus yes the emperor said thoughtfully your father is in the senate he is a just man as i recall he is caesar you are the tribunus laticlavius of the fourteenth the emperor said noting the young mans uniform you will have to go home now i fear flavius drusus yes caesar came the dutiful answer but claudius heard more than just disappointment in the young mans voice you do not want to go home he asked is there no young sweetheart or wife eagerly awaiting your return then how long have you been with the fourteenth flavius drusus almost three years caesar i had hoped to make a career in the army i am the youngest son of titus drusus there are three older than i am my eldest brother will follow in our fathers footsteps of course and gaius and lucius are both magistrates another magistrate from the drusus family and we could easily be accused of a monopoly flavius drusus finished with a small smile then he winced and grew pale as the javelin was drawn from his leg claudius almost groaned in sympathy with the young mans obvious pain although the titular secondincommand of his legion a tribunus laticlavius was really an honorary post there were six tribunes in each legion and five of them were usually battlehardened veterans the tribunus laticlavius was always a youngster in his teens from a noble family sent to spend two or three years with the army to shape him up or get him out of trouble or away from bad companions usually at the end of his term the tribunus laticlavius went home to a magistrates position and a rich wife the emperor turned to the legionary commander is he a good soldier aulus majesta the legionary commander nodded the best caesar he came to us like they all dogreen and wet behind the earsbut unlike the others ive had to put up with in my career flavius drusus has been eager to learn he was to stay on until one of my other tribunes retired in another year then i planned to move him up in the ranks he looked down at the young man pale with his injury what a pity caesar hes a good officer but i cant have a tribune with a gimpy leg now can i it wasnt a question claudius was tempted to ask aulus majesta what a mans gait had to do with his ability to make good military decisions but he refrained from it his own limp and stammering speech had made him a laughingstock his whole life he had been considered unfit for anything even by his own family but when his dreadful nephew caligula had been murdered and deposed the army had turned to him to rule rome claudius was more aware than most of the disadvantage flavius drusus faced prejudice of any kind was difficult to overcome you must be rewarded for saving my life he said firmly i but did my duty caesar the young tribune protested and in doing so you have lost your military career the emperor replied what will happen to you when you return home you have nothing being a younger son in saving my life you have in a sense lost yours flavius drusus i would be unworthy of the noble tradition of the caesars if i allowed such a thing i offer you one of two choices think carefully before choosing return to rome with honor if you desire i will give you both a noble wife and a pension for all of your days or remain here in britain i will give you lands that will be yours and your descendants forever i will also settle a sum of money upon you that you may build a home flavius drusus thought a long moment if he returned to rome noble wife or not he would be forced to live in his fathers house which would one day be his eldest brothers house his pension would probably not be enough for him to buy his own home the noble wife would be some younger daughter with little of her own how would they dower daughters or successfully launch their sons careers if he remained in britain however he would have his own lands he would not be beholden to anyone he would found a new branch of his family and with hard work become a rich man in his own right i will stay in britain caesar he said knowing that he had made the right decision and that titus drusus corinium told his children in the summer of ad is how our family came to this land some three hundred and sixtytwo years ago the first flavius drusus was still alive when queen bodicea revolted against rome though the town of corinium where he had settled was not touched by the revolt he realized then that perhaps our family would be better served by making alliances with the local celtic tribes rather than by sending for roman wives so his sons married into the dobunni tribe and the sons and daughters who came after that have intermarried with both celts and roman britons until this day and now rome is leaving britain tituss wife julia said good riddance her husband answered rome is finished the romans just dont have the good sense to realize it once rome was a great and noble power that ruled the world today it is corrupt and venal even the caesars are not what they once were the julians died out long ago and in their place have come a succession of soldieremperors each backed by a different set of legions you children know that in your own short lifetimes the empire has been split with britain and gaul being broken away and then patched back again there is even an eastern empire now in a place called byzantium better we britons be rid of rome once and for all that we might chart our own destinies if we do not the saxons immigrating from northern gaul and the rhineland onto our southeast coast will push inland and overwhelm us altogether the young people grinned mischievously at each other their father was forever preaching gloom oh titus his wife chided the saxons are only peasant farmers we are far too civilized to be overcome by them too civilized aye he agreed perhaps that is why i am afraid for britain he picked up his younger son gaius who had been playing quietly on the floor when a people becomes so civilized that it does not fear the barbarians at the gates then the danger is the greatest little gaius and his children will be the ones forced to live with our folly i fear cailin britain ad chapter oh gaius how could you kyna benigna asked her husband irritably she was a tall handsome woman of pure celtic descent her dark red hair was woven in a series of intricate braids about her head i cannot believe you sent to rome seeking a husband for cailin she will be furious with you when she finds out kyna benignas long soft yellow wool tunic swung gracefully as she paced the hall it is time for her to marry gaius drusus corinium defended himself and there is no one here who seems to suit her cailin will be just fourteen next month gaius his wife reminded him this is not the time of the julians when little girls were married off the moment their flow began and as for finding no young man to suit her i am not surprised by that you adore your daughter and she you you have kept her so close she has not really had a chance to meet suitable young men even if she did none would match her darling father gaius cailin has but to socialize like a normal young girl and she will find the young man of her dreams that is impossible now and you know it gaius drusus corinium told her it is a dangerous world in which we live kyna when was the last time we dared venture the road to corinium there are bandits everywhere only by remaining within the safety of our own estate are we relatively safe besides the town is not what it once was i think if someone will buy it i shall sell our house there we have not lived there since the first year of our marriage and it has been closed up since my parents died three years ago perhaps you are right gaius yes i think we should sell the house whomever cailin marries one day she will want to remain here in the country she has never liked the town now tell me who is this young man who will come from rome will he stay in britain or will he want to return to his own homeland have you considered that my husband he is a younger son of our family in rome my dear kyna benigna shook her head again your family has not been back to rome in over two centuries gaius i will allow that the two branches of the family have never lost touch but your dealings have been on a business level not a personal one we know nothing of these people you propose to give your daughter to gaius how could you even consider such a thing cailin will not like it i warn you you will not twist her about your little finger in this matter the roman branch of our family have always treated us honorably kyna gaius said they are yet of good character i have chosen to give this younger son an opportunity because like the younger son who was my ancestor he has more to gain by remaining in britain than by returning to rome cailin shall have hilltop villa and its lands for her dowry that she may remain near us it will all work out quite well i have done the right thing kyna i assure you he concluded what is this young mans name gaius she asked him not at all certain that he was right quintus drusus he told her he is the youngest son of my cousin manius drusus who is the head of the drusus family in rome manius had four sons and two daughters by his first wife this boy is one of two sons and a daughter produced by maniuss second wife the mother dotes on him manius writes but she is willing to let him go because here in britain he will be a respected man with lands of his own and what if cailin does not like him gaius kyna benigna demanded you have not considered that have you will not your cousins in rome be offended if you send their son back home to them after they have sent him here to us with such high hopes certainly cailin will like him gaius insisted with perhaps a bit more assurance than he was feeling i will not allow you to force her to the marriage bed if she is not content to make this match kyna benigna said fiercely and gaius drusus corinium was reminded suddenly of why he had fallen in love with this daughter of a hill country dobunni chieftain instead of another girl from a romanobritish family kyna was every bit as strong as she was beautiful and their daughter was like her if she truly cannot be happy with him kyna he promised i will not force cailin you know i adore her if quintus displeases her i will give the boy some land and i will find him a proper wife he will still be far better off than if he had remained in rome with his family are you satisfied now he smiled at her i am she murmured the sound more like a cats purr he has the most winning smile she thought remembering the first time she had seen him she had been fourteen cailins age he had come to her fathers village with his father to barter for the fine brooches her people made she had fallen in love then and there she quickly learned he was a childless widower and seemingly in no hurry to remarry his father however was quite desperate that he do so gaius drusus corinium was the last of a long line of a family of roman britons his elder brother flavius had died in gaul with the legions when he was eighteen his sister drusilla had perished in childbirth at sixteen his first wife had died after half a dozen miscarriages kyna the daughter of berikos knew she had found the only man with whom she could be happy shamelessly she set about to entrap him to her surprise it took little effort gaius drusus corinium was as hotblooded as the celtic girl herself his proper first wife had bored him so had all the eligible women and girls who had attempted to entice him after albinias tragic death once kyna had gotten him to notice her he could scarce take his eyes from her she was as slender as a sapling but her high full young breasts spoke of delights he dared not even contemplate she mocked him silently with her sapphireblue eyes and a toss of her long red hair flirting mischievously with him until he could bear no more he wanted her as he had never wanted anything in his life and so he told his father kyna was beautiful strong healthy and intelligent her blood mixed with theirs could but strengthen their family titus drusus corinium was as relieved as he was delighted berikos chieftain of the hill dobunni was not we have never mixed our blood with that of the romans as so many other tribes have he said grimly i will barter with you titus drusus corinium but i will not give your son my daughter for a wife his blue eyes were as cold as stone i am every bit as much a briton as you are titus told him indignantly my family have lived in this land for three centuries our blood has been mixed with that of the catuvellauni the iceni even as your family has mixed its blood with those and other tribes but never with the romans came the stubborn reply the legions are long gone berikos we live as one people now let my son gaius have your daughter kyna to wife she wants him every bit as much as he wants her is this so berikos demanded of his daughter his long mustache quivering furiously this was the child of his heart her betrayal of their proud heritage was painful it is she answered defiantly i will have gaius drusus corinium for my husband and no other very well berikos replied angrily but know that if you take this man for your mate you do so without my blessing i will never look upon your face again you will be as one dead to me he told her harshly hoping his words would frighten her into changing her mind so be it my father kyna said with equal firmness she had left her dobunni village that day and had never looked back though she missed the freedom of her hill country her inlaws were loving and kind to her julia her motherinlaw had wisely insisted the marriage be postponed six months so that kyna could learn more civilized ways then a year after their marriage was celebrated she and gaius had left the house in corinium for the family villa some fifteen miles from town she was not yet with child and it was thought the serenity of the countryside would aid the young couple in their attempts sure enough when kyna was in her seventeenth year their twin sons titus and flavius were born cailin came two years later after that there were no more children but kyna and gaius did not care the three the gods had blessed them with were healthy strong beautiful and intelligent even as their mother was berikos however had never forgiven kyna for her marriage she sent him word of the birth of her sons and another message when cailin had been born but true to his word the dobunni chieftain behaved as if she did not exist kynas mother however came from their village after cailins birth she immediately announced that she would remain with her daughter and soninlaw her name was brenna and she was berikoss third wife kyna was her only child he does not need me he has the others was all brenna would say by way of explanation so she had stayed appreciating perhaps even more than her daughter the civilized ways of the romanized britons the villa in which brenna now lived with her daughter soninlaw and grandchildren was small but comfortable its porticoed entrance with four white marble pillars was impressive in direct contrast to the informal charming atrium it led to the atrium was planted with damascus roses which had a longer blooming season than most due mainly to their sheltered location in the atriums center was a little square pool in which water lilies grew in season and small colored fishes lived yearround the villa contained five bedchambers a library for gaius drusus a kitchen and a round dining room with beautiful plaster walls decorated with paintings of the gods adventures among the mortals the two best features of the house as far as brenna was concerned were the tiled baths and the hypocaust system that heated the villa in the damp chilly weather beyond the entrance there was nothing grand about the house which was constructed mostly of wood with a red tile roof but it was a warm and cozy dwelling and its residents were happy they had been a close family and if kyna had one regret it was that her inlaws insisted upon remaining in corinium they liked the town with all its bustle and titus had his place on the council for them life at the villa was dull as the years passed and the roads became more dangerous to travel their visits grew less frequent although neither kyna nor her husband remembered the days when the legions had overflowed their homeland keeping britains four provinces and their roads inviolate their elders did julia bemoaned the legions loss for without them civil authority outside the towns was hard to maintain a plea to rome several years after the withdrawal of the armies had been answered curtly by the emperor the britons would have to fend for themselves rome had troubles of its own then suddenly three years ago gaius and kyna had been sent word that julia was ill gaius had taken a party of armed men and hurried to corinium his mother had died the day after his arrival to his surprise and even deeper sorrow his father unable to cope with the loss of the wife who had been with him for most of his adult life pined away dying less than a week later gaius had seen to their burial then he had returned home and the remaining family had drawn in even closer now kyna benigna left her husband to his accounts and hurried off to find her mother brenna was in the herb garden transplanting young plants into the warm spring soil gaius has sent to his family in rome for a husband for cailin kyna said without any preamble brenna climbed slowly to her feet brushing the dirt from her blue tunic as she did so she was an older version of her daughter but her braids were prematurely snowwhite providing a startling contrast to her bright blue eyes what in the name of all the gods possessed him to do a silly thing like that she said cailin will certainly accept no husband unless she herself does the choosing i am surprised that gaius could be so foolish did he not consult with you beforehand kyna kyna laughed ruefully gaius rarely consults with me when he plans to do something he knows i will disapprove of mother brenna shook her head aye she answered it is the way of men then we women are left to repair the damage done and to clean up the mess men i fear are worse than children children know no better men do and yet they will have their way when are we to expect this proposed bridegroom kyna clapped a hand to her mouth i was so distressed by gaiuss news that i forgot to ask him it must be soon or he wouldnt have said anything cailins birthday is in a few weeks perhaps quintus drusus will arrive by then i expect that gaius has been dealing in this perfidy since last summer he knows the young mans name and even his history her blue eyes grew angry indeed i am beginning to suspect this plot was hatched some time ago we will have to tell cailin brenna said she should be aware of her fathers actions i know gaius will not force her to marry this quintus if she does not like him that is not his way kyna he is a just man aye he is kyna admitted he has agreed that if cailin refuses his choice he will find quintus drusus another wife and give him some land still i wonder mother will these roman relations be content if their son marries another girl when they have been promised our daughter there are no young girls of our acquaintance whose families can equal or even come near cailins dowry times are very hard mother only my husbands prudence has allowed cailin the advantages of an heiresss wealth brenna took her daughters hand in hers and patted it comfortingly let us not seek out difficulties or see them where none yet exist she said wisely perhaps this quintus drusus will be the perfect husband for cailin husband what is this talk of a husband grandmother the two older women started guiltily and swinging about came face to face with the main object of their discussion a tall slender young girl with wide violetcolored eyes and an unruly mop of auburn curls mother grandmother who is quintus drusus cailin demanded i want no husband chosen for me nor am i yet even ready to wed then you had best tell your father that my daughter kyna said bluntly although she had worried about broaching this problem with cailin it was not her way to beat about the bush plain speech was best particularly in a difficult situation like this your father has sent to his family in rome for a prospective husband for you he thinks it is time you were married quintus drusus is the young mans name and he is i surmise expected at any minute i will certainly not marry this quintus drusus cailin said with stony finality in her tone how could father do such a thing why should i be married off before flavius and titus or has he sent to rome for brides to wed my brothers too if he has he will find they are no more eager than i am brenna could not help but laugh there is far more celt than roman in you my child she said chuckling do not worry about this quintus drusus your father has said if you do not like him you do not have to have him but perhaps he will turn out to be the man of your dreams cailin it is possible i cannot imagine why father thinks i need a husband cailin grumbled it is too ridiculous to even contemplate i would much rather stay at home with my family if i marry then i must take charge of a household and have babies i am not ready for all of that i have had little enough freedom to do anything i really find interesting for i am deemed too young but suddenly i am old enough to wed how absurd poor antonia porcius was married two years ago when she was just fourteen now look at her she has two babies she has grown fat and she always looks tired is that what father thinks will make me happy and as for antonias husband well i hear he has taken a very pretty egyptian slave girl to his bed that shall not happen to me i assure you when the time comes i will choose my own husband and he will never stray from my side or i will kill him cailin kyna reproved her where did you ever hear such salacious gossip about antonia porcius i am surprised at your repeating it ohh mother everyone knows antonia complains about her husband at every turn she feels put upon and she very well may be though i think it her own fault the last time i saw her at the saturnalia she was unable to stop talking about all her woes she pinned me in a corner for close to an hour chattering its all her fathers fault you know he chose a husband for her how smug she was at the time too she loved lording it over us other girls when we met at the festivals sextus scipio was so handsome she bragged handsomer than any husbands wed ever get why there wasnt a man in all of britain as handsome as he was he was rich too richer than any husbands wed ever get by the gods how she carried on shes still carrying on i fear but now tis a different tune she sings well thats not for me i will pick my own husband he will be a man of character and of honor brenna nodded then you will choose wisely when the time comes my child like i chose kyna said softly and her companions smiled in their agreement when they came together that evening for their meal cailin teased her father i hear you have sent to rome for a very special birthday gift for me father she said her large violet eyes twinkled with humor she had had the afternoon to cool her temper now cailin thought it very funny that her father believed her ready to marry she had only begun her moon cycles a few months ago gaius drusus flushed nervously and eyed his daughter you are not angry cailin had a fierce temper even he could be cowed by it her celtic blood was far hotter than that of her twin brothers i am not ready for marriage cailin said looking her father directly in the eye marriage cailin her brother flavius hooted with laughter the gods pity the poor fellow said his twin titus who is this sacrificial offering on the altar of matrimony to be he comes from rome cailin told them one quintus drusus by name i believe he is escorting the maidens chosen to be your wives dear brothers yes i am certain he is were to have a triple wedding twill save our parents a fortune in these hard times now what did mother say the brides names were majesta and octavia no i think it was horatia and lavinia the two sixteenyearolds paled only realizing it was a jest when their entire family burst out laughing their relief was comical you see father cailin said the thought of anyone choosing their spouses is abhorrent to my brothers it is even more abhorrent to me is there no way you can stop this quintus drusus from coming his trip will be a wasted one i will not marry him quintus drusus will be here in two days time gaius said looking distinctly uncomfortable two days kyna glared at her husband outraged you did not tell me until this man was but two days from our villa ohh gaius this is really too intolerable of you every servant is needed in the fields for the spring planting i have no time to prepare for an unexpected guest from rome she glowered fiercely at him he is family gaius replied weakly besides our home is always pristine kyna you well know it the guest chamber must be cleaned and aired it hasnt been used in months the mice always take up residence there when it is shut up the bed needs a new mattress the old one is filled with lumps do you know how long it takes to make a new mattress gaius no of course you do not let him have the old mattress mother cailin said he will leave all the quicker if he is uncomfortable he will not leave gaius drusus said recovering his equilibrium and his dignity as head of this household i have promised his father that quintus will have a future in britain there is nothing for him in rome my cousin manius begged me to find a place for the boy i have given my word kyna you did not approach him first with this silly scheme to marry cailin off she demanded she was beginning to see the issue in a different light now no manius drusus wrote to me two years ago said gaius quintus is the youngest of his children if he had been a girl it would have been easier for they could have married off a girl with a modest dowry but he is not a girl there is simply no place for quintus in rome the sons of maniuss first marriage are all grown with children of their own manius parceled off his lands to them as each married his daughters were well dowered and wed as well then after having been widowed for several years he suddenly fell in love his new wife livia bore him first a daughter and manius was rich enough that there was enough for her dowry then livia bore manius a son my cousin determined that the boy would inherit their house in rome his wife agreed that there must be no more children but kyna laughed cousin manius dipped his wick one final time and quintus was born of their indiscretion she finished for her husband he nodded aye my cousin hoped to make another small fortune for this last child but you know kyna how bad romes economy has been over these past years the government is constantly spending more than it has to spend the legions must be paid taxes have risen threefold the coinage is so debased now as to be worth nothing my cousin could but support his family there was nothing to give young quintus so manius drusus appealed to me to help him he offered quintus as a husband for our daughter it seemed to me a good idea at the time it was not his wife said dryly and you really should have discussed it with me first i will not marry this quintus drusus cailin said again you have already told us that several times my daughter kyna said soothingly i am certain that your father accepts your decision in this matter even as i do the problem remains however of what we must do quintus drusus has traveled hundreds of leagues from rome to come to a new and better life we cannot send him back to his old one your fathers honorindeed the honor of the whole family is involved she furrowed her brow for a moment and then she brightened gaius i believe i may have the answer how old is quintus drusus twentyone he told her we will tell him that we have decided cailin is too young to marry at this time kyna said we will imply his father misunderstood you that all you offered was to give quintus a start in britain if cailin eventually fell in love with him then a marriage could certainly take place you did not actually make a marriage contract with manius drusus gaius did you she looked anxiously at her husband nay i did not then we will have no problems kyna said relieved we will give young quintus that little villa with its lands by the river the one you purchased several years ago from the estate of septimus agricola its fertile and has a fine apple orchard well supply him with slaves and with hard work he can make it quite prosperous gaius drusus smiled for the first time that day it is the perfect solution he agreed with her i could not manage without you my dear i fear indeed gaius i am most certainly of the same opinion kyna replied the rest of the family laughed when they had recovered from their mirth cailin said but do not make a new mattress mother we want quintus drusus gone from this house as quickly as possible remember there was more laughter this time gaius drusus joined in relieved that a potentially difficult situation had been resolved by his beautiful clever wife he had not made a mistake all those years ago when he had married kyna the daughter of berikos two days later exactly as predicted quintus drusus arrived at the villa of his cousin he came astride a fine redbrown stallion that his father had gifted him with when he departed rome quintus drususs sharp black eyes took in the rich newly turned soil of his cousins farmland the wellpruned trees in the orchards the fine repair of the buildings the good health of the slaves who were working outdoors in the spring sunlight he was wellpleased by what he saw for he had not been overly happy with the plans his father had made for him you have no choice but to go to britain his father had told him angrily when he had protested the decision his mother livia was weeping softly there is nothing for you here in rome quintus everything i have is distributed among your siblings you know this is to be true it is unfortunate that you are my youngest child and i can offer you neither land nor monies gaius drusus corinium is a very wealthy man with much land in britain though he has two sons he will dower his only daughter very well she will have lands a villa gold it can all be yours my son but you must pay the price for it and the price is that you exile yourself from rome you must remain in britain work those lands you receive if you do you will be happy and comfortable all your days britain is most fertile i have been told it will be a good life i promise you quintus his father had finished he had obeyed his parents although he was not happy with the decision they had made for him britain was at the end of the earth and its climate was foul everyone knew that still he could not stay in rome at least not right now armilla cicero was becoming most demanding she had told him last night that she was pregnant and that they would have to marry her father was very powerful quintus drusus knew that he could make life most uncomfortable for any man he thought had made his daughter unhappy it was better to leave rome armilla would have an abortion as she had had on a number of occasions he was not the first man she had cast her nets for nor would he be the last it was really quite a shame quintus thought for senator cicero was a wealthy man but his two other sonsinlaw lived unhappily beneath his thumb that was not the kind of life quintus drusus envisioned for himself he would be his own man nor it occurred to him as he approached the villa of his cousin gaius drusus corinium did he have in mind a lifetime spent farming in britain still for now there was nothing else he could do eventually he would think of a plan and he would be gone back to rome with a pocket full of gold coin that would keep him comfortable all of his days he saw a handful of people come out of the villa to greet him and forced a smile upon his extremely handsome face the man tall with dark brown hair and light eyes was like no drusus he had ever seen but was obviously his cousin gaius the woman tall with a fine high bosom and dark red hair must be his cousins wife the older woman with white hair was her mother no doubt his father had told him that their cousin gaiuss celtic motherinlaw lived with them the two almostgrown boys were images of their father they were sixteen close to manhood really and there was a girl quintus drusus was close enough now to see her quite clearly she was tall like the rest of her family taller he thought irritably than he was himself he did not like tall women her hair was a rich auburn a long curly mass of untidy ringlets that suggested an untamed nature she was very fair of skin with excellent features straight nose large eyes a rosebud of a mouth she was actually one of the most beautiful females he had ever seen but he disliked her on sight welcome to britain quintus drusus gaius said as the young man drew his horse to a stop before them and dismounted i thank you cousin quintus drusus replied and then politely greeted each of the others as they were introduced to his amazement he sensed that his proposed bride disliked him even as he did her still a man did not have to like a woman to wed her and get a proper number of children on her cailin drusus was a wealthy young woman who represented his future he didnt intend to let her get away for the next few days he waited for his cousin gaius to broach the matter of the marriage contract and set a wedding date cailin avoided him as if he were a carrier of the plague finally after ten days gaius took him aside one morning i promised your father that because of the bonds of blood binding our two families the older man began i would give you the opportunity to make a new life for yourself here in britain i have therefore signed over to you a fine villa and farm with a producing orchard by the river it has all been done quite legally and filed properly with the magistrate in corinium you will have the slaves you need to work your lands you should do quite well quintus but i know nothing about farming quintus drusus burst out gaius smiled i am aware of that my boy how could a fine fellow like yourself brought up in rome know anything about the land but we will teach you and help you to learn quintus drusus told himself he must not lose his temper perhaps he could sell this farm and its villa and escape back to rome but gaiuss next words dashed all his hopes in that direction i bought the river farm from the estate of old septimus agricola several years back it has lain fallow since then i was fortunate to get it cheap from the heirs who live in glevum property values are down even further now for those wishing to sell but they are an excellent value for those wishing to buy there was no quick escape then quintus drusus thought gloomily but once his marriage to cailin was settled they would at least be monied when he asked his cousin do you propose to celebrate the marriage between your daughter and myself marriage between you and cailin gaius drusus wore a puzzled face my father said there would be a marriage between your daughter and myself cousin i thought i came to britain to be a bridegroom to unite our two branches of the family once again quintus drususs handsome face showed his barely restrained anger i am so sorry quintus your father must have misunderstood me my boy gaius said i but offered you an opportunity here in britain where there was none for you in rome i felt it my duty because of our blood ties now if you and cailin should fall in love one day i should certainly not object to your marrying my daughter but there was no contract for a marriage enacted between our two families i regret your confusion he smiled warmly and patted the younger mans arm cailin is still just half grown if i were you my boy i should seek a strong healthy woman from amongst our neighbors daughters we are celebrating the festival of manhood the liberalia for our twin sons in a few days many of our neighbors and their families will be attending it will be a good time for you to look over the local maidens you are a good catch quintus remember you are a man of property now no marriage no marriage the words burned in his brain quintus drusus had not been privy to the correspondence between his father and his cousin gaius but he had been quite certain his father believed a marriage was to take place between himself and cailin drusus had his father misunderstood he was not a young man by any means being some twenty years older than gaius drusus or had his father known all along that there would be no marriage had manius drusus tricked him into leaving rome because gaius was willing to offer him lands of his own did manius drusus dangle a rich marriage before his youngest child because he knew that he would not go otherwise it was the only explanation quintus drusus could come up with his cousin gaius seemed an honest man in all respects not at all like that sly old roman fox his father quintus drusus almost groaned aloud with frustration running a hand through his black hair he was marooned at the end of the earth in britain he was to be a farmer he shuddered with distaste seeing a long dull life filled with goats and chickens stretching ahead of him there would be no more glorious gladiatorial battles at the colosseum to watch or chariot racing along the appian way no summers on capri with its warm blue waters and endless sunshine or visits to some of the most incredible brothels in the world with their magnificent women who catered to all tastes perhaps if he could get that little bitch cailin to fall in love with him no that would take a miracle he did not believe in miracles miracles were for religious fanatics like the christians cailin drusus had made her dislike plain from the moment they laid eyes on one another she was barely civil when they were in the presence of their elders and ignored him when they found themselves alone he certainly did not want a wife as outspoken and unbridled as this girl was women with celtic blood seemed to be that way his cousins wife and motherinlaw were also outspoken and independent quintus drusus made an effort to swallow his disappointment he was alone in a strange land hundreds of leagues from rome he needed the goodwill and the influence of gaius drusus and his family he had nothing not even the means to return home if he could not have cailin and the fat dowry her father would undoubtedly settle on her one day there would be another girl with another fat dowry he now needed cailins friendship and the friendship of her mother kyna if he was to find a rich wife quintuss young cousins flavius and titus would be celebrating their sixteenth birthdays on the twentieth of march the liberalia fell on march the manhood ceremony was always celebrated on the festival nearest a boys birthdayalthough which birthday was up to the discretion of the parents on that special day a boy put aside the rededged toga of his childhood receiving in its place the white toga of manhood here in britain it would be a mostly symbolic affair for the men did not normally wear togas the climate was too harsh as quintus had discovered he had quickly adopted the warm light wool tunic and crossgartered braccos of the romanobritons still the old customs of the roman family were kept if for no other reason than they made wonderful excuses to get together with ones neighbors it was at these gatherings that matches were made as well as arrangements to crossbreed livestock they gave friends a chance to meet once again for unnecessary travel on a regular basis was simply no longer possible each party setting out for the villa of gaius drusus corinium made burnt offerings and prayers to their gods that they would arrive safely and return home in safety on the morning of the liberalia quintus drusus said to kyna in cailins presence you will have to introduce me to all the eligible women and maidens today my lady now that my cousin gaius has so generously made me a man of property i will be seeking a wife to share my good fortune with me i rely on your wisdom in this matter even as i would rely on my own sweet mother livia i am certain kyna told him that such a handsome young man as yourself will have no trouble finding a wife she turned to her daughter what think you cailin who would best please our cousin there are so many pretty girls among our acquaintances ready to wed cailin looked at her cousin you will want a wife with a good dowry will you not quintus or will you simply settle for virtue she said wickedly no i do not think you will settle for just virtue he forced a laugh you are too clever by far little cousin with such a sharp tongue i wonder if you will ever find a husband for yourself a man likes a little honey with his speech there will be honey aplenty for the right man cailin said pertly smiling with false sweetness at him earlier that morning titus and flavius had removed the golden bullae that they had worn around their necks since their twin births the bullae amulets for protection against evil were then laid upon the altar of the family gods a sacrifice was made and the bullae were hung up never to be worn again unless their owners found themselves in danger of the envy of their fellow men or of the gods the twins next dressed themselves in white tunics which according to custom their father carefully adjusted since they descended from the noble class the tunics donned by titus and flavius drusus had two wide crimson stripes finally over each of their tunics was draped the snowwhite toga virilis the garment of a man considered grown had they lived in rome a procession consisting of family friends freedmen and slaves would have wound its way in joyful parade to the forum where the names of the two sons of gaius drusus would have been added to the list of citizens it had been the custom since the time of the emperor aurelian that all births be registered within thirty days in rome or with the official provincial authorities but only when a boy formally became a man was his name entered in the rolls as a citizen it was a proud moment the names of titus and flavius drusus corinium would be entered in the list kept in the town of corinium and an offering would be made to the god liber at that time just as their neighbors and friends began to arrive for the family celebration cailin took her brothers aside cousin quintus would like us to introduce him to prospective wives she said her eyes twinkling i think we should help him he will be gone all the sooner i can barely remain civil in his presence why do you dislike him so cailin flavius asked her he has done nothing to you once father told him there would be no marriage between you you should have felt more at ease instead you take every opportunity to snipe at him i do not understand he seems a good fellow to me titus agreed with his twin his manners are flawless and he rides well i think father was correct when he told quintus that you were too young for marriage i am not too young for marriage should the right man come along cailin responded as for quintus drusus there is something about him that my voice within warns me of but i know not what it is i simply think he is a danger to us all the sooner he is gone to the river villa and settled with a wife the happier i will be now what girls do you feel would suit him think you two know every eligible respectable and not so respectable maiden for miles around they laughed in unison rolling their eyes at one another for if there was one thing cailins brothers liked it was the ladiesso much so that gaius drusus was declaring his sons men in order to find them wives and marry them off before they caused a scandal by impregnating some mans daughter or worse being caught debauching some mans wife there is barbara julius flavius said thoughtfully she is a handsome girl with nice big breasts good for babies and elysia octavius or nona claudius titus volunteered cailin nodded yes they would all be suitable i like none of them so well that i would warn them off our cousin quintus the families from the surrounding estates were arriving the twins made their suggestions to their mother and kyna dutifully made the proper introductions quintus drususs handsome face coupled with his lands made him more than eligible he needs three arms cailin said dryly to her grandmother for barbara nona and elysia will certainly end up in a cat fight trying to hold on to him will i have to simper like that to gain a mans attention and devotion its disgusting brenna chuckled they are simply flirting with quintus she said one of them must gain ascendancy over the others if they are to capture your cousins heart men and women have flirted for centuries someday a man will come along who appeals to you so strongly that you will flirt with him my cailin trust me in that perhaps cailin thought but she still felt that the three girls being dangled before quintus were silly creatures she wandered through the crowd of her neighbors filling the gardens of the villa no one was paying a great deal of attention to her for this was not her day but rather her brothers cailin could smell spring in the air at long last the ground was warm again and the breeze mild even if the day was not as bright as they might have wished then she saw antonia porcius but before she might turn in another direction antonia was hailing her noisily and there was no avoiding her how are you antonia cailin inquired politely bracing for the flood of words to come for antonia porcius could not answer the simplest query without going into great detail i have divorced sextus antonia announced dramatically what cailin was astounded this was the first she had heard of it antonia put her arm through cailins and said in confidential tones well actually he ran away with that little egyptian slave girl of mine father was furious he said i must not remain married to sextus scipio under those circumstances then he granted me a divorce she giggled sometimes having the chief magistrate of corinium for a father isnt such a bad thing i got everything of course because sextus wronged me publicly father says no honest magistrate would allow a good wife and her children to suffer under those circumstances if sextus ever comes back he will find he has come back to nothing but i hear they took flight for gaul imagine he said he was in love with her how silly of him her blue eyes narrowed a moment i hear your cousin has come from rome and that your father has given him the old agricola estate i hear that he is divinely handsome my estates match those lands you know my father wanted to buy them for me but your father got to the heirs in glevum first what is his name your cousins i mean will you introduce me cailin the gossip is that he is looking for a wife a rich woman such as myself would not be a bad match now would it she giggled again wouldnt it be nice if we were cousins cailin ive always liked you you know you dont say cruel things about me to the other girls behind my back i think you must be the only friend i have cailin drusus cailin was astounded they were hardly friends at seventeen antonia was her senior and had rarely given her the time of day until today why the silly cow cailin thought she really wants to meet quintus i suppose snatching him from beneath the noses of the others would give her a double victory of sorts she would best those who spoke unkindly of her and she would prove to the world that she was still a very desirable woman that sextus scipio was a cad and a fool how kind you are dear antonia cailin heard herself saying as her mind raced with delicious possibilities antonia might be plump but she was more than just pretty by marrying her quintus would gain a wife rich in both lands and money she was her fathers only child and she would inherit everything he owned one day she was also foolish and selfish sextus scipio must have been absolutely miserable with her to have left everything his family had built up over the last few hundred years antonia porcius certainly deserved her cousin and most assuredly quintus drusus deserved the daughter of the chief magistrate of corinium of course i will introduce you to my cousin quintus antonia you must promise me however that you will not swoon cailin teased her companion he is as handsome as a god i vow i only wish he found me attractive but alas he does not it would be exciting indeed if you and i became cousins she pulled antonia about and said come along now my mother has already begun introducing him to every eligible girl in the province you do not want them to steal a march on you but i think mayhap when quintus sees you dear antonia both your lives will change ohh wouldnt it be wonderful quintus drusus was very much in his element surrounded by attractive nubile girls who were all fawning over him he saw cailins approach with a plump little blond but he waited until she spoke to him before acknowledging her cousin quintus this is my good friend antonia porcius cailin pulled the simpering woman forward antonia this is my big cousin from rome im certain that you two have much in common antonia is the only child of the chief magistrate in corinium quintus well well well he thought little cousin cailin is being most helpful indeed i wonder what mischief she is up to now yet he was curious she had quite clearly signaled him that the blond girl was the daughter of a powerful man and an heiress to boot he couldnt understand why cailin would want to do him a favor she had made no secret of her dislike of him since they had first laid eyes upon one another her candidate for his hand must have a flaw of some sorts then he gazed into antonias limpid blue eyes and decided whatever that flaw was he would certainly enjoy ferreting it out his hand went to his heart and he said the sight of you my lady antonia gives me comprehension at long last of why britains women are so famed for their beauty i prostrate myself at your feet antonias mouth made a small round o of delight while the other girls pressing in on quintus drusus gaped with surprise then the handsome young roman took antonia porcius by the arm and requested that she show him the gardens the couple walked slowly from the group seemingly enraptured by each others company while those left behind stared in amazement is there madness in your family cailin drusus nona claudius asked her tone one of a young lady most put out whatever possessed you to introduce antonia porcius to such an eligible man demanded barbara julius and whatever does he see in her elysia octavius wondered aloud we are younger and prettier by far i did not mean to distress you cailin said innocently i simply felt sorry for poor antonia i just learned that she is divorced sextus her husband ran off with a slave girl i but sought to cheer her up by introducing her to my cousin i certainly never thought he would be attracted to her she is older than all of us and you are correct elysia when you observed that we are all prettier cailin shrugged there is no accounting for mens taste in women perhaps quintus will quickly become bored with her and come back to you all if your villa were not the most remote of all of our homes from corinium cailin you would have known about antonias divorce barbara told her irritably frankly none of us blames poor sextus scipio antonia is selfish beyond bearing whatever she sees and desires she must have sextus claimed he was being driven to poverty by her if he denied her anything her father would upbraid him she is not a good mother and she is cruel to her slaves my father says ohh she is sweet and charming when she gets her own way but when she doesnt beware she wanted sextus scipio because he was the most handsome and the richest man about once she had lured him into her trap however she became once more what she really is a spoilt little bitch you should really warn your cousin i hear nona claudius said lowering her voice so the other girls were forced to lean forward that although antonia got her husbands estate his goods and chattel that sextus scipio and his little mistress escaped with much gold and other coin my father was his banker you know he says that sextus scipio had been transferring funds abroad for months now antonias not telling anyone that shes put it right from her mind the thought of her husband getting away to live happily ever after in comfort is frankly more than she can bear she is obviously casting her nets for a new husband barbara said in annoyed tones and once again it is the most handsome man in the province i suppose he is rich too i dont know why antonia has all the luck hes not rich at all cailin told them hoping to frighten them off and further antonias cause he is the youngest son of my fathers cousin in rome it is a very big family there was nothing left for poor quintus father felt sorry for him and asked his cousin manius to send quintus to us then he gave him the river villa along with all its lands of course he will loan him slaves to work the lands and keep the orchard but my cousin quintus has very little but his handsome face to recommend him antonias lands match those of the river villa nona said when your gorgeous cousin learns that he will be even more intrigued by her antonias a rich woman frankly quintus drusus would be a fool not to have her there is no hope for us i fear do you really think so cailin said oh dear brenna joined her granddaughter as the other girls drifted away you scheme like a druid cailin drusus she murmured the sooner he is married off cailin said the safer i will be thanks be to the gods that he did not like me on sight there is something about him grandmother i cannot put my finger on it but i feel quintus drusus is a danger to me to us all i hope he weds antonia porcius for her wealth and her connections i will not be content until he is gone from our home she looked into brennas kindly face you do not think me foolish to feel so strongly no brenna said i have always said you were more celt than your brothers the voice within calls to you warns you about quintus drusus listen to it my child that voice will never play you false it is when we do not listen to that voice that we make errors in judgment always trust your instincts cailin her grandmother counseled chapter with so many lovely girls in the province to choose from why on earth did quintus marry antonia porcius kyna wondered aloud to her husband and family their cousins very lavish wedding had been celebrated the morning prior in corinium they were now traveling back to their own villa which was some eighteen miles from the town a good days travel gaius and his sons were astride their horses the three women rode in an open cart they journeyed with a large party of families from nearby villas the neighbors had banded together to employ a strong troop of menatarms for their protection along the road antonia is a very attractive woman gaius answered his wife that is not what i mean kyna said sharply and you well know it gaius quintus might have chosen a virgin of good family instead he decided upon a divorced woman with two children and a father who cannot let his daughter be anthony porcius will not be an easy fatherinlaw as poor sextus scipio found to his dismay come now my dear gaius drusus told her you know as well as i do that quintus fixed his sights on antonia for several reasons she is rich her lands match the lands i gave him there is little mystery to it kyna quintus was promised land and a wife if he came to britain of course i had intended that wife to be cailin but since cailin would not have himand indeed if i must be honest she and quintus would have been a bad match quintus chose wisely in antonia he is strong enough to control her it will be a good marriage i thought they made a most handsome couple cailin ventured her mother laughed you would have thought quintus and hecate made a good couple if it would save you from marrying him my daughter now what will you do for a mate when the right man comes along mother i shall know it cailin replied confidently why is it flavius asked that antonia and quintus chose you to be one of their witnesses little sister cailin smiled with false sweetness why flavius did you not know i introduced our cousin quintus to my dear friend antonia i suppose they believe that having played cupid i am responsible in part for the great happiness they have found in each other cailin her mother exclaimed you introduced quintus and antonia to each other you never told me this before i wondered how they met that day did i not mention it mother i suppose it slipped my mind because i thought it of no import cailin answered yes i did introduce them it was at the liberalia when my brothers became men you plot like a druid her mother said grandmother said the same thing cailin admitted mischievously i certainly did brenna agreed of your three whelps she is most like a dobunni celt berikos would approve of her mother cailin asked why did berikos disapprove of your marriage to father she never thought of her mothers paternal parent as grandfather he was rarely mentioned in her household and she had never even once laid eyes on him he was as big a mystery to cailin as she would have been to him my father is a proud man kyna said perhaps overproud the dobunni were once members of the powerful catuvellauni celts a son of their great ruler commius one tincommius by name brought a group of followers to this region many years ago they became the dobunni your grandfather descends from tincommius he is proud of his line and prouder yet of the fact that none of his family until me ever married into the roman race he has always hated the romans although for no real reason that he ever shared with any of us when i saw your father and fell in love with him berikos was quite displeased with me he had already chosen a husband for me a man named carvilius but i would not have carvilius i would only have your father and so berikos disowned me i had shamed him i had shamed the dobunni he is a fool and ever was brenna muttered when word was brought to him of the twins births a smile split his face for the briefest moment and then he grew somber saying i have no daughter his other wives ceara bryna and that little fool maeve were all preening and bragging over their grandchildren but with my one child exiled i was forbidden to say a word indeed what could i have said i hadnt ever even seen the boys but cailin questioned brenna if berikos had three other wives and other children why was he so angry at mother for having followed her heart didnt he want her to be happy berikos has sired ten sons on his other wives but my child was his only daughter kyna was her fathers favorite which is why he let her go and why he could never forgive her for turning her back on her heritage brenna sadly explained when you were born however i told berikos that if he could not forgive your mother for marrying a romanobriton i must leave the tribe to be with my daughter he had other grandchildren but i had only your mothers children it was not fair that he rob me of a place by my daughters fire or the right to dandle my grandchildren upon my knee that was fourteen years ago i have never regretted my decision i am far happier with my daughter and her family than i ever was with berikos and his killing pride kyna took her mothers hand in hers and squeezed it hard as the two women smiled at each other then brenna reached out with her other hand and patted cailins cheek lovingly quintuss marriage had been celebrated on the kalends of june to everyones surprise including his own he was a most proficient manager of his estates including his wifes vast portion the river villa he deemed in too poor repair and had it demolished the fields belonging to the estate now bloomed with ripening grain the orchards thrived quintus comfortable in his wifes lavish villa put on weight his devotion to antonia was astounding though it was his right to take any slave who caught his fancy to his bed he did not do so his stepsons feared and respected him as should the children of any respectable man his slaves found nothing to gossip about their master and as for antonia by early autumn she was pregnant it is astounding gaius said to his wife poor honoria porcius in all her years of marriage could get but one child but her daughter ripens like a melon each time a husband comes through the door well i must admit that cailins matchmaking was a good thing my cousin manius should be most grateful to me for his sons luck quintus drusus however was not quite the man he seemed his good fortune had but given him an appetite for more the civil government was crumbling with the towns themselves he could see that soon there would be no central government left when that happened it would be the rich and the powerful who controlled britain quintus drusus had decided that he would be the richest and most powerful man in corinium and the surrounding countryside when that time came he looked covetously at the estates of his cousin gaius drusus corinium antonia had been recently chattering to him about possible matches to be made for his cousins titus and flavius they were already disporting themselves among the slave girls in their fathers house the rumor was that one of themand no one was certain which for they were identical in featureshad gotten a young slave girl with child their marriages could quickly mean children another generation of heirs to the estate of gaius drusus corinium and then there was cailin her parents would soon be seeking a husband for her she would also celebrate a birthday in the spring at fifteen she was certainly more than old enough to marry a powerful husband allied with his cousin gaiusthe thought did not please quintus drusus he wanted the lands belonging to his benefactor and the quicker he got them the fewer complications he would have to deal with the only question remaining in his mind was how to attain his goal without being caught gaius and his family would have to be disposed of but how was he to do it he must not be suspected himself no he would be the greatest mourner at the funerals of gaius drusus corinium and his familyand the only one left to inherit his cousins estates quintus smiled to himself in the end he would have far more wealth than any of his brothers in rome he thought of how he had resisted the idea of coming to britain yet had he not come he would have lost the greatest opportunity of his life you look so happy my love antonia said smiling at him as they lay abed how could i not be happy my dear quintus drusus answered his wife i have you and so much else he reached out and touched her swelling belly he is the first of a great house antonia oh yes she agreed catching his hand and kissing it antonias sons he thought as he tenderly caressed his adoring wife they were young and so fragile the merest whisper of disease could take them it really seemed a shame that the sons of sextus scipio should one day have anything of his but of course antonia would not allow them to be disinherited though she was not the best of mothers she did dote on her children still anything might happen quintus drusus considered anything quintus drususs son was born on the kalends of march exactly nine months to the day his mother had married his father the infant was a large healthy child antonias joy at the birth of her child was shortlived however for the next morning the two little boys born of her marriage to sextus scipio were discovered drowned in the atrium fish pond the two slave women assigned to watch over the children were found together in most compromising circumstances naked entwined in a lascivious embrace and drunk there was no defense for their crime both were strangled and buried before the fateful day was over antonia was hysterical with grief i shall call him posthumous in honor of his brothers antonia declared dramatically large tears running down her cheeks as she gazed upon her dayold son how tragic that he shall never know them he shall be called quintus drusus the younger her husband told her slipping two heavy gold bracelets on her arm as he gave her a quick kiss you must not distress yourself further my dear your milk will not come in if you do i will not have my son suckling on the teats of some slave woman they are not as healthy as a childs own mater my own mother livia always believed that she nursed my brother my sister and myself most faithfully until we were past four he reached out and slipping a hand beneath one of her breasts said with soft menace do not cheat my son antonia of what is his right the sons of sextus scipio were innocents and as such are now with the gods you can do nothing for them my dear let it go and tend to the living child the gods have so graciously given us leaning over he kissed her lips again the nursemaid took the infant from antonia she lay the child at her masters feet quintus drusus took up the swaddled bundle in his arms thereby acknowledging the boy as his own true offspring this formal symbolic recognition meant the newborn was admitted to his roman family with all its rights and privileges nine days after his birth quintus drusus the younger would be officially named amid much familial celebration you will remember what i have said my dear wont you quintus drusus asked his wife as he handed his son to the waiting nursemaid and arose from her bedside our child must be your first consideration antonia nodded her blue eyes wide with surprise this was a side of her husband she had never seen and she was suddenly afraid quintus had always been so indulgent of her now it would seem he was putting their son ahead of her he smiled down at her i am pleased with you antonia it has been a terrible time for you but you have been brave you are a fit mother for my children he left her bedchamber and made his way to his library the house was quiet now without his stepsons running about in a way it was sad but in a few years time the villa would ring again with the laughter and shouts of children his children a single lamp burned upon the table as he entered his private sanctuary shutting the door firmly behind him only the gravest emergency would cause anyone to disturb him once that door was closed he had quickly trained the servants after his marriage to antonia that this room was his sanctum sanctorum no one came in but at his invitation you did very well he told the two men who now stepped from the shadows within the room it was easy master the taller of the two answered him those two nursemaids was easy pickins a little drugged wine a little fucking a little more wine a little more yes yes quintus drusus said impatiently the picture you paint is quite clear tell me of the boys they gave you no trouble they did not cry out i want no witnesses coming forward later on we throttled them in their beds as they slept master then we placed their bodies in the atrium pond no one saw us i guarantee you it was the middle of the night and all slept we made that pretty tableau for everyone to find before we done the children quite a wicked pair those girls looked the tall man continued he sniggered lewdly you promised us our freedom the other man said to quintus drusus when will you give us our freedom we have done as you bid us i told you that there were two tasks you must perform for me quintus drusus answered him this was but the first what is the second we want our freedom the tall man declared you are impatient cato quintus drusus said noting his look of distaste it amused quintus drusus to give his slaves dignified elegantsounding identities in nine days time he continued my son will be formally named and a ceremony of purification will be performed it is a family event to be celebrated within the home my fatherinlaw will come from corinium my cousin gaius and his family from their nearby villa it is my cousin and his family that i want you to study well there is a celtic festival in may i remember it from last year gaius drusus allows his slaves their freedom that night from sunset until the following dawn i intend to pursue the same custom on that night you will eliminate my cousin and his family as an extra incentive you may steal my cousins gold from a certain hiding place i shall reveal to you when the time comes in the ensuing uproar it will take several days for me to discover that those two new slaves from gaul that i recently purchased are gone do you understand me he stared coldly at the pair wondering if there was a way he could eliminate them as well and save himself the possibility of ever being discovered no he would have to rely on these two if he was any judge of men they would flee as fast as they could back across the sea to gaul beltane cato said beltane quintus drusus looked puzzled the celtic festival you mentioned it is celebrated the first day of may master there is no other spring festival of note how appropriate quintus drusus said with a brief smile i married my wife on the kalends of june our son was born on the kalends of march now on the kalends of may i shall achieve the beginnings of my destiny i do believe that the number one is a lucky one for me he looked at the two gauls i will dim the lamp a moment go out by the garden exit and behave yourselves both of you you must have easy access to the house when my cousin and his family are here if you have been causing difficulties the majordomo will send you to the fields you are of no use to me in the fields in the morning quintus drusus sent messengers to his fatherinlaw in corinium bidding him come and to his cousin gaius inviting him and his family to the new drususs name day and purification it was not until they arrived for the celebration that gaius drusus corinium and his family learned of the deaths of antonias two older sons ohh my dear kyna said kissing the young woman on both cheeks i am so terribly sorry why did you not send for me my mother and i would have come cailin too it is not good for a woman to be by herself in a time of such great sorrow there was no need antonia said softly my little ones are safe with the gods quintus has assured me of it there is nothing i can do for them i must think of the baby quintus will not have a slave woman nursing him i cannot distress myself lest my milk cease that would displease quintus very much and he is so good to me she is mesmerized by him cailin said in disgust she is in love with him kyna answered i think it very convenient that sextus scipios two sons are now gone cailin noted quietly kyna was truly shocked cailin what are you saying surely you are not accusing quintus drusus of some unnatural act he loved those two little boys and was a good stepfather to them both i accuse no one of anything mother cailin said i have merely observed the convenient departure of antonias little boys you must admit that it can but suit quintus that only his own child is left alive to inherit one day all he has gained why when you speak of quintus kyna asked her daughter are your thoughts always so dark cailin the girl shook her head i do not know she answered honestly my voice within warns me against him calls to me of some nameless danger yet i know not what i thought when he married antonia these feelings would evaporate but they have not if anything they have grown stronger each time i am in quintuss presence are you jealous perhaps of quintuss marriage kyna probed is it possible that you regret your decision not to wed him are you mad mother the look of distaste on cailins beautiful face told kyna that she was definitely on the wrong track i only asked kyna said apologetically sometimes we regret what we have refused or thrown away they were called into the atrium where the family altar was set up proudly quintus drusus bestowed his own praenomen or first name upon his son gently he hung a beautiful carved gold bulla about the babys neck the locket held together by a wide spring contained a powerful charm within the two halves that would protect its wearer until he became a man with the dignity befitting the patriarch of a great family quintus drusus intoned prayers to the gods and to mars in particular for this was the month of mars he prayed that quintus drusus the younger would live a long and happy life then he sacrificed a lamb newborn on the same day as his son and two snowwhite doves to honor the gods so that his prayers would be favorably received once the religious ceremony was over the celebration and feasting began each member of the gaius drusus family had brought the baby a crepundia crepundia were tiny toys made of gold or silver in the shapes of animals fish miniature swords flowers or tools which were strung together upon a chain and hung about the little ones neck to amuse him with their rattling and jingling they were the traditional gifts brought to an infants purification and name day quintus drusus was expansive in his good humor sharing wine with his cousins titus and flavius he teased them i hear it said that there is a certain slave girl at your fathers villa who ripens like a summer melon which one of you is responsible eh he poked a playful finger in their direction and chuckled the twins flushed and then laughed guiltily we are not certain flavius admitted as has been our habit from childhood we shared mother was quite angry with us she says we are going to be matched and married before the summer is out lest we cause a scandal titus told his older cousin the girl has recently miscarried at any rate and so we shall never know who the father was though perhaps we would not have known anyway and father says we are not to dip our buckets in any more wells no matter how sweet the water flavius added and have your brides been chosen cousins quintus asked not yet titus replied father would go slightly farther afield than corinium he says it is time for fresh blood in the family i think perhaps he is not pleased with the girls available to us here the selection is not particularly great quintus observed i was fortunate in my darling antonia may the gods bring you both the same good fortune my young cousins and may i live to celebrate the name day of all of your children he raised his goblet and drank they in turn saluted him and what of cailin quintus asked is she to be matched with a husband soon she grows more beautiful every day he looked across the room to where cailin sat with his wife had i not fallen in love with my antonia on sight i should have despaired at losing your lovely sister whoever she chooses will be a fortunate man there seems to be no man who attracts our sister flavius said i wonder indeed if there is any man who will do so she is sometimes strange in her ways our sister there is more celt in her we say than roman blood what a pity if she were to die a virgin more wine master a tall slave stood by quintuss elbow yes cato thank you and fill my cousins goblets too he said jovially on beltane night the bonfires blazed from every hill in the province the celtic celebration in honor of the new growing season was underway and shared by all class barriers seemed to fade as men and women freeborn and slave danced together and shared potent cups of honeyed mead around the fires gaius drusus corinium had just finished making love to his wife in the privacy of their empty house when he thought he heard a noise arising he went out into the atrium to investigate he never saw the two intruders who came up behind him and strangled him swiftly kyna did not realize the thump she heard was that of her husbands body falling to the floor she arose and was but halfway across the bedchamber when the room was invaded by two men i told you she was a beauty the taller said it was easy to divine their intent terrified kyna began to back away i am the daughter of berikos chief of the dobunni she managed to say although her throat was tight with fear the taller man grabbed kyna his mouth pressing against the mouth that had only just entertained her husbands sweet kisses kyna fought her attacker like a lioness clawing and spitting at him laughing the man pushed her upon her marriage bed falling atop her his hands pushing up her sleep tunic the other man was quickly at her head silencing her screams with his hand kyna prayed to the gods for a quick death brenna returned to the villa early she had been chaperoning cailin at the celebration but her granddaughter did not really need her there was no one who took cailins fancy and besides the girl would not go off into the darkness with any man she simply enjoyed the dancing and the singing brenna stumbled over something in the dim atrium bending down she recognized with shock the face of her soninlaw it was blue and he was dead she began to shake with great effort she pulled herself to her feet and then heart pounding she ran to her daughters bedchamber kyna lay naked sprawled amid a tangle of bloody bedclothes brenna crumpled to the floor not even realizing that she had been hit the old woman was certainly easy cato remarked nonchalantly but the younger one was more fun his companion said what a good fight she gave us the girl will be best of all however lets dice for who takes her maidenhead and who gets the leavings before we kill her titus and flavius drusus corinium coming home very drunk with honeyed mead never saw their assassins they were easily ambushed quickly throttled and then dragged along with their fathers body into their parents bedchamber where cailin would not stumble over them the two gauls waited the minutes slipped into an hour and then another where the hell is that girl the shorter slave grumbled we dare not wait any longer cato said he pointed a finger through the window the sky is already lightening with the false dawn we must fire the house so that it seems like just another beltane fire and be gone from here before the servants return the girl isnt worth our getting caught do you think quintus drusus will save us if we do a man who would murder his own stepsons so they could not inherit from him and who would murder his cousins family to gain lands is not a man who would help us in our hour of need indeed i suspect he would kill us too if he could the gold he promised us is in a hiding place beneath the statue of juno in the alcove get it and let us be gone i do not trust that roman scum to give us several days lead hell be after us by tomorrow well fool him though well not take passage for gaul but ireland theyll not suspect weve gone in that direction brenna lay quietly absorbing his words she prayed they would not realize she was still alive when they had gone she would somehow escape to warn cailin of the carnage she stifled a groan almost biting through her lip with the effort her head hurt fearfully she suspected she had lost a great deal of blood but if the gods would just grant her the power to remain alive long enough to avenge kyna and the rest of her family she would never again ask them for anything brenna smelled the smoke of the burning bed and the gauze window hangings heard footsteps moving away from her saw the two pairs of boots as the murderers went out the door leaving it ajar in their haste she did not move she needed to be certain that the two men had gone soon the bedchamber began to fill with thick smoke gasping her lungs burning with the acrid smell brenna realized that she could no longer lie where she was slowly painfully her head spinning dizzily she crawled toward the open door and out into the atrium there was no furniture to burn here as in the other rooms although the atrium was filling quickly with thick black smoke she knew her way to the door nausea almost overwhelmed her and using a pillar for balance she retched racked by dry spasms but she pulled herself to her feet with an iron will brenna stumbled across the atrium to the main entrance of the house pulling on the door handle she staggered out into the cool damp night air and collapsed several feet from the villa there was no one in sight the assailants had gone brenna gulped in the clean air noisily cleansing her lungs of the foulsmelling smoke above her a full moon beamed down placidly on the scene of the slaughter she had to find cailin instead cailin found her she came running down the lane her long hair flying but seeing her grandmother on the ground the girl stopped and knelt down grandmother the house is on fire what has happened where are mother and father my brothers she grasped the older woman by her arms pulling her up brenna groaned ohh you are hurt grandmother why is there nobody to help why are the slaves not back from their celebrations come away my child we must get away from the villa we are in mortal danger help me hurry brenna told her the family cailin repeated already knowing in her heart the answer her grandmother would give dead all of them come now and help me we are not safe here cailin you must believe me my precious one brenna said sobbing why cant we wait for the slaves to return we must inform the authorities cailin said desperately brenna looked into her granddaughters face i have no time to explain this to you now you must trust me if you wish to live a long life come now and help me i am weak from loss of blood and we have a ways to go before we are safe cailin felt frightened where are we going grandmother there is only one place we can go my child to the dobunni to your grandfather berikos only he can keep us safe from this evil grasping her granddaughters arm brenna began to walk tis but a few miles although you did not know that did you your whole life you have lived but a few miles from berikos and you did not know it then brenna fell silent realizing that she needed her strength if she was to get them to their destination alive berikos must know what had happened then if the gods willed it she would die but berikos must know i do not know the way cailin whimpered can you show me the way grandmother the old woman nodded but said nothing more they left the beaten path and brenna led her granddaughter up one hill and then down another they made their way through a small dense wood with only the light of the bright moon to show them the way the night was silent for the creatures belonging to it had long ceased their songs here and there a bird would trill nervously certain that the bright white light signaled the dawn occasionally they would rest but brenna dared not stop for long she did not fear pursuit but rather she feared her own mortality they crossed a large grassy meadow where deer were grazing in the early light and then entered a second wood above them the sky was visibly lightening they had been traveling for some time now and cailin had the feeling that they were moving up how much farther is it grandmother cailin asked after they had been walking for several hours mostly uphill she was weary from the unaccustomed exercise she could only imagine how the older woman must feel it had been a long time since brenna had walked such a distance and certainly never in such a precarious state of health not far my child your grandfathers village is on the other side of this wood the forest began to thin out and the sky was bright with color as they exited from the trees before them rose a small hill and atop it was the dobunni village suddenly a young man appeared before them he had obviously been on watch and was surprised to see someone out so early then his face lit with slow recognition brenna is it really you it is i corio brenna answered him and her knees buckled beneath her help me sir cailin cried attempting to keep her grandmother in an upright position but it was futile corio after his initial amazement at seeing brenna jumped forward and caught the fainting woman up in his arms follow me he told cailin and without so much as a backward glance at her he ran up the hill cailin hurried behind him her face creased with concern her curiosity was strong however and she noted that the hill was ringed with three stone walls behind the third wall they entered into the village corio made directly for the largest house and cailin followed him through its entrance into a big hall a woman fully six feet tall and dressed in a deep blue tunic came forward she glanced briefly at cailin gave a start of recognition then looked at the burden corio carried it is brenna grandmother and she is injured corio said put her there boy on the bench by the fire pit the older woman commanded then go and fetch my medicines she looked at cailin are you squeamish or can you help tell me what you would have me do cailin answered i am ceara berikoss first wife the tall woman said you are kynas daughter are you not you look like her yet there is something a bit different about you yes i am kynas daughter my name is cailin the girls eyes filled with tears will grandmother die she asked i do not know yet ceara answered honestly what happened cailin shook her head i do not know i came home from the beltane festival the house was ablaze and grandmother had collapsed outside she says my family is dead but i know nothing more she was insistent we come here she would not even allow me to inform the authorities or wait for the slaves to return from their holiday berikos brennas voice rasped harshly i must speak with berikos she struggled to rise from the bench where she lay you must lie quietly brenna ceara told her i will send for berikos but if you persist in this behavior you will not live to tell him whatever it is you must tell him rest now ceara what is this i hear brenna has returned another woman not quite as tall as ceara but taller than cailin joined them she had the prettiest sweetest face that cailin could ever remember having seen there was something familiar about it and yet cailin could not place it that face was now puckered with distress as she bent over the halfconscious woman her blue eyes filled with tears brenna it really is you ohh i never thought to see you again maeve brenna said softly but cailin heard the affection in her grandmothers tone you are still a fool i see maeve bent down and kissed the injured womans brow and you are still stubborn and filled with pride my sister sister cailin looked at ceara maeve is your grandmothers younger sister did you not know that child no i see you did not why does grandmother call her a fool cailin wondered realizing that maeves familiar face was a slightly younger version of brennas your grandmother and berikos were not a good match ceara said honestly they married in haste born of their overwhelming lust for each other by the time they realized it your grandmother was with child several years later your grandfather found himself truly in love with maeve and she with him brenna was appalled she feared history would repeat itself and she adored her sister who is five years younger she pleaded with maeve not to wed berikos but maeve refused to listen brenna called her a fool and has referred to her as such ever since despite the fact the marriage between maeve and berikos was a successful one ceara turned to the other woman go and fetch berikos maeve he is at her house corio returned with his grandmothers medicine basket and ceara began the task of examining brennas wound she cut away some of brennas thick white hair shaking her head at the size of the wound this was far more serious than anything she had ever seen brennas hair was severely matted with all the blood she had lost the skull bone itself was open and had a large chip missing from it ceara wasnt even certain she could close the wound nature would have to do the job as gently as she could she cleaned the wound with wine wincing when brenna groaned she sprinkled one of her healing powders generously over it and then bandaged it with clean dried moss she had never felt so helpless in her entire life the girl had stood by her side handing her what she needed and never flinching once her presence seemed to soothe brenna frankly ceara thought that only rest time and the will of the gods could make a difference now corio had gone from the hall for a time and now returned a small bowl in his hand he gave it to his grandmother i thought that perhaps you would want this for brenna he said she smiled up at him approvingly aye tis just the thing here brenna drink this it will give you strength help her to sit up a bit cailin ceara ordered cailin sat on the bench behind her grandmother and gently propped the older woman up what is she drinking she asked noting that brenna sipped the reddish liquid almost eagerly it is cattles blood ceara answered it is nourishing and will help brenna to rebuild her own blood ceara held back a smile at cailins look of distaste at least the girl hadnt fainted ceara a deep voice thundered what is going on is what maeve tells me true cailin looked up a tall man with snowwhite hair and matching twin mustaches had entered the hall he was garbed in a dark green wool tunic embroidered with gold threads at the neck and sleeves around his neck was the most magnificent gold torque worked with green enamel that cailin had ever seen he strode directly up to the bench where brenna lay and looked down hail berikos brenna said mockingly so you are back berikos said grimly to what do we owe this honor brenna i thought never to see you again nor i you you have grown old berikos brenna said i should not be here at all were it not for cailin i would have died in the forest safe in nodens care rather than come to you were it not for our grandchild i am here for her berikos not for myself we have no grandchild in common he answered berikos cearas voice was sharp do not persist in your stubborn folly over this matter kyna is dead a sharp look of sorrow swept over the old mans face and then was gone how he demanded his voice impersonal the pain forced back to where none could see it last night brenna began i went with cailin to the beltane fire but i grew tired and returned home early in the atrium of the villa i stumbled over the dead body of our soninlaw gaius drusus i ran to kynas bedchamber she was dead upon her bed ravaged and beaten to death i never even felt the blow that felled me when i regained my senses i saw the bodies of gaius and our two grandsons titus and flavius near me the murderers were waiting for cailin quintus drusus cailin cried her face as white as milk aye child your voice within did not fail you brenna looked to berikos and continued her horrific tale what of your vaunted roman magistrate at corinium berikos asked her scathingly when she had finished is there no longer any roman justice the chief magistrate in corinium is quintus drususs fatherinlaw brenna said what chance would cailin have against him what is it you want of me then brenna i want your protection berikos though it galls me to ask it i want your protection for cailin and for me the slaves were still away from the villa when all of this happened no one knows that we two alone have survived nor must they ever know cailin is your granddaughter and you cannot refuse me this request i do not know if i will survive this attack i am wounded and my lungs yet ache with the smoke i inhaled it took all my strength to bring cailin here to you berikos was grimly silent you will both have the protection of the tribe ceara said finally when her husband glared at her she said brenna is still your wife berikos the mother of your only daughter cailin is your granddaughter blood you cannot refuse them shelter or protection under our laws or have you forgotten those laws in your ancient lust for brigit i will accept your hospitality only as long as my grandmother lives cailin said angrily when she has passed through the door of death into the next life i will make my own way in the world i do not know you berikos of the dobunni and i do not need you a small winterly smile touched the corners of the old mans lips with cold blue eyes he observed cailin seriously for the first time since he had entered the hall brave words little mongrel bitch he said but i wonder how well your soft roman ways have prepared you for survival in this hard world i am not afraid cailin told him defiantly and i am able to learn i would also remind you that i am a briton berikos i was born here as were my parents and my grandparents on both sides for generations before me i have been raised to respect my elders but do not try my patience or you will find you cannot hide behind the wall of your many years berikos raised his hand to her but lowered it quickly surprised by the venom he saw in her gaze she was not as tall as a dobunni but neither was she tiny she reminded him of kyna in many ways but her spirit was certainly that of her grandmother that spirit was what had attracted him to brenna in the first place unfortunately he had not been able to live with it and brenna would not be tamed he suspected this girl was very much the same cailin his granddaughter she would be a thorn in his side he believed but he had no choice but to grant her his protection and the shelter of his hall you may stay he said and turning abruptly walked away from them brenna sagged against cailin i am weary she said corio ceara commanded take brenna to the empty sleeping space by the south fire pit it will be nice and warm there go with her child when you have settled her come back i will feed you you must be hungry after your journey and the shock of all that has happened the young man gently lifted brenna and moved her swiftly across the hall carefully he lay her in the sleeping space cailin covered her grandmother with a lambskin tucking it about her shoulders she sighed deeply a worried look on her face but brenna did not see she was already asleep cailin started at a touch on her arm turning she looked into corios face for the first time he was a pleasantlooking man with mild blue eyes come and my grandmother will feed us new bread is always best eaten warm we are cousins are we not my father is eppilus cearas youngest son i am only the first of your relations that you will meet your mother had ten brothers all of whom are alive and most have children and in some cases grandchildren of their own you will not be lonely here cailin looked to brenna she was pale but her breathing was steady and even the girl turned away and followed the young man back to where ceara was busy preparing the morning meal the big woman ladled cooked barley cereal into two fresh trenchers of bread and handed them to the couple there are spoons on the table if you are dainty corio told her come and sit down he wolfed down a bite of his bread and cereal they sat and ceara plunked two goblets down before them watered wine she said and then there being no one else in the hall she joined them you remind me of your mother and yet you do not look quite as she looked at your age was she happy with your father oh yes cailin said we were a happy family abruptly the enormity of the tragedy engulfed her only yesterday kyna her father and her brothers were alive there had been no warning at all of their demisenot that it would have been any easier to bear if there had been but to have survived the murderous slaughter of her family only by chance was more than she could bear why should she live when they were all gone it was the very first beltane festival that she had been allowed to stay at unchaperoned brenna had given cailin her head that night and once on her own cailin had begun to see things in a new light all the young men had wanted to dance with her and she danced about the leaping fires until almost dawn she had not been ready to slip away into the darkness with any man yet but drank her first cupful of honeyed mead and felt wonderful afterward cailin thought to return home with her brothers but they had gone off much earlier into the darkness with two maidens she had not seen them again only when the false dawn began to lighten the skies and the music finally stopped did she wend her way back to the villa to discover that death had been there before her now cailin grew pale and shoved the trencher away from her the very thought of food was nauseating ceara divined the trouble immediately it is the will of the gods she said quietly sometimes they are kind and sometimes they are cruel and sometimes in being kind unkind you and brenna are alive this day because your journey in this world is not yet done would you dare to question the wisdom of the gods cailin drusus yes cailin cried why should i live when my family does not what could my brothers have possibly accomplished in this life that rendered their existence no longer necessary in this world they were just seventeen i cannot answer you child ceara said honestly all i can tell you is that everything happens when it is supposed to happen what is death it is but the doorway between this life and the next we need not fear it when your time comes cailin those you love who have gone before you will be waiting on the isles of the blest for you until then it is your duty to the gods who created you to live out your destiny as they have planned you to live it out you can of course whine and despair about the unfairness of it all but why would you so futilely waste the precious time allotted to you am i not allowed to mourn then cailin asked bitterly mourn the manner in which they met their ends ceara said but do not mourn them they have gone on to a far better place now eat your breakfast cailin drusus you need your strength if you are to care for brenna do not treat me as if i were a mindless child lady cailin said then do not behave like a child ceara replied with a small smile rising from her place at the board from the look of you you are a girl full grown and we are not idle people you will be expected to earn your keep which will leave you little time for feeling sorry for yourself she turned from cailin and began to serve breakfast to the others who were now entering the hall do not let my grandmothers bark fool you corio said with a grin as cailin glared fiercely at cearas back she is noted for her soft heart she only seeks to prevent you from hurting yourself she has an odd way of showing it cailin muttered darkly would you like me to tell you about the family corio asked in an attempt to distract her when she nodded he began although our grandfather has sired ten sons only three live in this village my father eppilus and my uncles lugotorix and segovax they are brynas sons the others and their families are scattered about the other hillfort villages belonging to the hill dobunni our grandfather has five wives i thought he had only four cailin interrupted four living but he had a total of five bryna went to the isles of the blest some years back then berikos married a woman named brigit two years ago she is not a dobunni she is a catuvellauni our grandfather makes a fool of himself over her she is not much older than you are cailin but she is wicked beyond belief my grandmother is chief of berikoss women but if brigit decides to oppose cearas decisions berikos supports brigit it is very wrong of him but it amuses him to encourage her in favor of his other women fortunately brigit is content to allow my grandmother and maeve their responsibilities regarding the household such is not her forte she prefers to spend her days in her own house perfuming and preparing herself for my grandfathers pleasure when she ventures out she is accompanied by two serving girls who almost anticipate her every desire they say she holds our grandfather by means of enchantment and secret potions three tall men one with dark hair the other two with hair like cailins came to sit down next to them mother says you are kynas daughter the darkhaired man said are you our sisters child my pretty girl i am eppilus the father of this handsome young scamp and youngest son of ceara and berikos yes i am the daughter of kyna and gaius drusus my name is cailin she replied quietly i am lugotorix said one of the auburnhaired men and this is my twin brother segovax we are the sons of bryna and berikos my brothers titus and flavius were also twins cailin said and then to her great mortification tears began to slide down her face desperately she attempted to scrub them away the three older men looked away giving the girl time to compose herself as corio put a shy arm about his cousins shoulder and gave it a squeeze it was almost the undoing of cailin but she somehow managed to find humor in her situation poor good corio was making an attempt to soothe her while in reality his kindness was close to sending her into a fit of hysterics she needed to weep and to grieve for her family but not now not here it would have to be later when she could find a private place where no one else would see her tears cailin drew a deep calming breath i am all right now she said removing corios protective arm her three uncles met her steady gaze with admiration and eppilus said you still wear your bulla i see i am not married cailin told them inside your bulla there is a small bit of stags horn and a flat droplet of amber within which is a perfectly preserved tiny flower eppilus told her am i not right cailin how did you know what my amulet contains she asked surprised i thought that my mother and i were the only ones to know not even my grandmother knows what is within my bulla it is blessed aye but not by any of your phony roman deities he replied the stags horn is consecrated to cernunnos our god of the hunt the amber is a bit of danu the earth mother touched by lugh the sun the flower caught within it signifies fertility or macha who is our goddess of both life and death he smiled at her your mothers brothers sent you this protection before you were even born i believe it has kept you safe so that you might one day come to us i nevet knew cailin said softly my mother said little about her life before she wed my father i think the only way she could not hurt missing the ones she loved was to put them from her entirely eppilus smiled how well you knew her cailin such wisdom in one so young is to be admired i bid you welcome to your mothers family i imagine that my father did not he has never been able to forgive kyna for marrying gaius drusus and that prideful attitude has cost him so much he loved your mother greatly you know she was his joy why does he hate romans or anything touched by their culture few real romans have been in this land for years now my fathers family has intermarried with britons for so long that there is little if anything roman left in us only my original ancestor was a pure roman his sons married dobunni girls just as my father did our father said lugotorix is a man very much enmeshed in the past britains past the past glories of the dobunni a past that began to fade and change with the arrival centuries ago of the romans our history is not a written one cailin drusus it is a spoken history and berikos can recite that history like a bard ceara who is closest to him in age remembers berikos as a young boy he was always consumed by our people and their past he knew that he would one day rule us and he secretly longed to restore the dobunni to their former glory when the legions left ceara said he wept with joy but in the years since little has happened to change britain still he saw the disintegration of the towns built by the romans and of the form of government that they left in place here vortigern who calls himself king of the britons has never really consolidated the tribes he is old now and has no real power over the dobunni or any of the other celts to berikos your mothers marriage to your father was a great betrayal he had planned to match her with a warrior named carvilius our father hoped that carvilius would help him regain all the dobunni territory lost to the romans over the years but it was not to be kyna loved gaius drusus and our fathers dream was shattered i know nothing at all about my mothers people i will need to learn more if i am to understand cailin said slowly my grandmother says we cannot go back to my home she says my cousin quintus drusus will kill me simply for my fathers lands i must become a dobunni uncles is such a thing possible i wonder you are kynas daughter eppilus answered her you are already a dobunni i i chapter the village in which cailin now found herself was the main village of the hill dobunni celts it was a hill fort typical of celtic villages in britain there were fifteen houses within the walls her grandfathers being the largest all the dwellings but berikoss were built of wood with walls of mud and wattle and had thatched roofs the chieftains house was stone with a thatched roof there were ten other villages belonging to the hill dobunni but each had only eight houses apiece while the houses were comfortable they were a far cry from the villa in which cailin had been raised the villas floors had been made of marble or mosaic the floor in her grandfathers hall was stone while in the other dobunni houses they were hardpacked dirt the walls in the villa had been plaster painted and decorated cailin had to admit to herself that the mud and wattle walls while certainly not beautiful kept out the rain and the cold that was after all the true purpose of a wall in her fathers villa she had her own small bedchamber in her grandfathers house she shared a comfortable sleeping space with brenna it was built into the wall and cailin thought quite cozy you are not at all spoilt ceara noted as cailin shelled peas for her one afternoon i would have thought that being raised as you were with slaves around you you would know little and complain much i was taught cailin told her that in the early days of rome womeneven of the highest social orderwere industrious and knowledgeable in the domestic arts they personally oversaw their households although my fathers family has lived in britain for hundreds of years those values were retained my mother taught me how to cook weave and sew among other things i will be a good wife one day ceara ceara smiled yes i think you will but who will be your husband cailin drusus i am surprised you are not already married there is no one who pleased me ceara cailin said my father tried once to match me but i would not have it i will choose my own husband when the right time comes for now i need to be free to nurse my grandmother and earn my keep there is much i do not know ceara was silent at the lugh festival after the harvest had been brought in there would be a great gathering of all the hill dobunni perhaps there would be a young man there who would please cailin she was fifteen close to being past marriageable age ceara however knew all the young men in the various villages she could not think of one who might be right cailin would need a husband before the year was out brenna would not live much longer than that although she had not seemed injured by the fire at the villa her lungs had probably been seared by the heat and the smoke of the blaze she had never regained her strength the least effort was far too strenuous for her she spent most of her time sitting or sleeping walking even a short distance taxed her so that corio would now carry brenna from one place to another so she might remain a participant in their family life if cailin did not see her grandmother fading away ceara and maeve did daily life in berikoss village revolved around cultivation of the fields and care of the livestock the land belonged to the tribe in common but ownership of stock separated the social classes berikos had a large herd of shorthorned cattle that were used for milk meat and sometimes were sold he owned sheep that grew wool of an excellent quality each man in his family had at least two horses but berikos had a herd he possessed hens geese and ducks and he kept pigs celtic salt pork was famed throughout the western world and the dobunni exported it on a regular basis berikos also raised hunting dogs of which he was inordinately proud cailin learned to work in cearas vegetable garden this was a type of labor her family had left to their slaves but although she was distressed by the condition of her hands after several days labor cailin learned from her cousin nuala corios little sister that a cream of rendered sheep fat and marys gold would cure rough hands or any part of her skin needing attention nuala who was almost fourteen took cailin with her when she watched over the sheep cailin enjoyed those hours out upon the green hillsides nuala told her all she needed to know about her dobunni family and cailin in turn shared her life before her familys murders with nuala she was the first real friend cailin had ever had she was far kinder than the romanobriton girls cailin had grown up with and a great deal more funloving taller than cailin she had wonderful long dark hair and bright blue eyes cailin rarely saw her grandfather and counted it a blessing he spent his nights with his young wife brigit in her house brigit however did not cook to suit the old man so he took his meals in his own hall cailin avoided berikos for brennas sake but he had not forgotten her is she useless as all roman women he asked ceara one day kyna taught her to cook weave and sew ceara answered him she does them well that joint you are gnawing on with such satisfaction was cooked by cailin hmmmmm the old man replied and she tends my vegetable garden for me berikos my bones are almost as old as yours are i do not like getting up and down weeding hoeing transplanting cailin does it all for me now she learns quickly nuala has been taking her out to help tend the sheep cailin nurses brenna too kyna raised her well she is a good girl but we must find a husband for her brenna will not live much longer and after her death cailin will feel that she has no one she has us berikos said harshly it will not be enough ceara told him well the dobunni chieftain said at least she is earning her keep if you are to be believed ceara i am not the wife who is prone to lying to you berikos ceara said sharply you must look to your catuvellauni for lies why can you not get on with brigit he grumbled at her because she has no respect for me or for maeve she takes advantage of you berikos and you let her she calls to your dark side and encourages it so that you do things you would have never done before you married her she is wicked and far too ambitious for a hill dobunni chieftains wife but why do i waste words on you you do not want to hear them i have never lied to you berikos cailin is a good girl ceara finished quietly in midjune the spelt a species of early wheat was harvested in late july the einkorn a singlegrained variety of wheat was harvested along with barley rye and millet the grain to be kept for seed or barter was put in stone subterranean silos closed with clay seals the grain for everyday use was stored in the barns the hay was cut and set out to dry upon wooden racks nuala and cailin collected leaves of woad carefully filling their rush baskets with the greenery when processed it made a marvelous blue dye for which the celts were famous they also dug madder root which yielded an excellent red dye when the two were mixed together a royalpurple resulted which was very much in demand the colors would eventually be used on garments made from the flax and hemp that were also being harvested august first was the feast of the great celtic sun god lugh it was marked all over britain by a general military truce between the tribes the main harvest done there would be a great gathering of all the hill dobunni with games races music and poetry recitals cailin was familiar with the festival in corinium there had been a fair at lughs feast she wondered if she would ever see the town again shortly after her familys deaths her uncles eppilus and lugotorax had made a trip to corinium to learn what was being said about the deaths of gaius drusus and his family stopping at the main tavern they mentioned to the tavern keeper the burnedout villa they had seen some miles from town it appears to have been a recent fire eppilus said casually was anyone hurt lugotorax asked the tavern keeper a gossipy soul with little business this sunny day took a deep breath and replied twas a great tragedy the villa belonged to gaius drusus corinium it had been in his family since the time of the emperor claudius hundreds of years ago nice people a very respectable family indeed there were three children im told two boys and a girl and the wifes mother too all dead now the villa caught fire beltane last and the whole family perished is the land for sale then eppilus inquired politely no said the tavern keeper what was bad luck for gaius drusus corinium was good luck for his cousin quintus drusus that young man came from rome just a couple of years ago married the daughter of the chief magistrate here in corinium a rich woman in her own right now hes inherited the lands belonging to gaius drusus corinium well you know what they say my friends the rich get richer eh as they journeyed back to their village eppilus said id like to lie in wait one dark night for this quintus drusus and slit his greedy throat for him murdering the family was bad enough but you know what brenna told us they did to our sister kyna before she died killing quintus drusus wont bring our sister and her family back among the living lugotorax answered his brother we have to think of cailin now ceara says brenna will not live much longer we must find a good husband for our niece perhaps at lugh eppilus replied thoughtfully when all the hill dobunni are gathered are there any among our brothers sons whom you think would suit the girl whoever he is he must be a man of property whatever father may feel cailin is our blood a troupe of strange dark people in colorful garb traveling in three closed wagons arrived at berikoss village the evening before lugh because of the season they were warmly welcomed and invited to remain for the festivities gypsies nuala said wisely they are very good with horses and some even have a gift for prophecy tis said indeed the next morning as the celebrations began one wrinkled old woman among the gypsies set herself up beneath a striped awning and offered to tell fortunes for barter ohh nuala said excitedly let us have our fortunes told cailin i want to know if i shall have a handsome young husband with an unquenchable thirst for my flesh at cailins shocked look nuala giggled mischievously celts speak frankly she told her cousin i have nothing to offer the old woman cailin said if it were not for your grandmother i should have nothing but the tunic i came in when i arrived here why the only jewelry i possess are the garnets in my ears and the gold and enamel brooch i was wearing on beltane you go nuala and get your fortune told i will listen give her a pot of that salve i taught you to make nuala said it will be more than enough i promise well go in together but ill go first and give her this bronze and enamel pin its really generous but i dont like it any longer the two cousins approached the awning the old woman beneath it was certainly an ancientlooking creature her black eyes surveyed them as they came she resembled a turtle sunning itself upon a rock in the early spring cailin thought come come my pretties she greeted them cackling do you want old granny to tell you the future she smiled a toothless grin at them nuala held out the pin and the old woman took it looking it over carefully nodding with pleasure no one does finer enamel work than you celts she said admiringly give me your hand girl i will see what life has in store for you eh chortling she took nualas hand and looked deeply into the palm ahhhh she said and then she looked again yes yes what is it nuala cried what do you see old woman a strong handsome man my girl and not just one you will be wife to two men you will have many children and grandchildren aye you will live a long life my girl it will not always be an easy life but you will not be unhappy the gypsy dropped nualas hand two husbands nuala looked nonplussed and then she giggled well if one is not enough i shall be happy to have another and many children you say you are certain the old woman nodded vigorously well nuala said its a good fate and i will be happy with it what better for a girl than marriage and children she pulled cailin forward now tell my cousin her future it must be at least as good as mine is give her the salve cailin nuala finished impatiently cailin handed the small stone pot of salve to the gypsy who took the girls palm and peered into it you have but recently cheated death the fortuneteller said you will cheat it more than once girl before your time here is done she looked into cailins face and cailin shivered the gypsy looked down into her hand again i see a man no more than one she shook her head golden towers aiiii there is too much confusion here i cannot see what i need to see she loosed cailins hand i cannot divine further for you my child i am sorry take back your salve no cailin replied keep it if you can but tell me one thing old woman will i lose a loved one to death soon the gypsy took cailins hand again and said you have lost several loved ones recently my child and yes the last tie binding you to your old life will soon be severed by death i am sorry for you do not be cailin told her you have but confirmed what my own voice within tells me may your gods protect you she turned away nuala in her wake the younger girls face was worried it is brenna isnt it nuala asked cailin nodded i try to put a good face on it for her sake she said everyone pretends in my presence that they do not notice but we all know even grandmother she has been with me my entire life she saved me from death and brought me to safety i want so much for her to grow well and live many more years but she will not nuala she is dying a little bit each day and for all my love there is nothing i can do to help her nuala put a comforting arm about her cousins shoulder and squeezed her death is but the doorway between this life and the next cailin you know that so why do you already grieve before brenna has even taken the first step through that doorway i grieve because i cannot take that step yet nuala i will remain alone on this side of the door while my family lives on the other side of that door i miss my parents and my brothers there was simply nothing nuala could say that would comfort cailin and so she remained silent she had all her family yet about her she could only barely imagine what it must be like to be without ones family and that small imagining came close to making her weep attempting to change the subject she suggested let us go and watch the footraces my brother corio is very swift all the young men from the other villages will unwisely try to beat him and they will not cailin asked with a small smile nualas love for her brother bordered on worship no one can beat corio nuala insisted proudly i can came a young voice and the cousins turned to see a handsome young man with dark hair pulled back by a leather thong bodvoc the boastful nuala mocked him you could not best my brother at lugh last why would you think you can best him now because i am faster this year than last bodvoc said and when i win the race nuala you will reward me with a kiss i most certainly will not nuala said indignantly blushing but cailin noticed her protest was not really as vigorous as she wanted it to seem bodvoc grinned engagingly yes you will he said and then went off to join the other young men preparing to race who is he cailin asked bodvoc his father is carvilius headman of one of our grandfathers villages your mother was to have married carvilius but when she chose your father instead he married a catuvellauni woman bodvoc is the last of their children bodvoc likes you nuala cailin teased her younger cousin nuala giggled well she allowed he is handsome and has i suspect cailin told her an unquenchable thirst for your flesh could it be he is the first of your husbands ohh dont tell anyone the gypsy said i will have two husbands nuala begged cailin no man will want to take a chance on me if he thinks by doing so it will shorten his life then i will die an old maid i wont tell cailin promised nuala but let us go watch the race and see if you will indeed owe bodvoc a kiss no one believed that corio could be beaten but to everyones surprise bodvoc finished a full length ahead of the champion this time dressed only in a pair of leather briefs his muscular chest wet with his exertion he strode over to a very surprised nuala you owe me a kiss nuala of the blue blue eyes he said softly and a slow smile lit his handsome features why would i kiss a man whos bested my favorite brother she asked him a trifle breathlessly feeling just a little bit weak in the region of her knees he was so so gorgeous bodvoc did not argue with her instead he reached out and pulling nuala against his body he bent to kiss her nuala sighed deeply and sagged against him for a long moment as her lips softened beneath his she almost fell when he gently released her from his embrace and set her back her pale skin flushed a deeper hue as about her the racers including her own brother chuckled with amusement nuala cailin spoke low the sound of her cousins voice galvanized nuala into action rearing back she hit bodvoc with all her might i did not say you might kiss me you sweaty oaf she shouted and ran from him her dark hair flying she loves me bodvoc exulted and turned to corio tell your father that i want nuala for my wife he said then ran off after the fleeing girl the crowd was dispersing cailin looked at corio will she have him nuala has liked bodvoc for several years and shes fourteen now more than old enough to be a wife its a good match hes eighteen and strong theyll make beautiful babies cailin now we must find a husband for you too cousin i dont suppose you would consider me for a mate would you for a small moment an almost hopeful look entered his eyes and cailin realized to her surprise that her cousin corio harbored feelings for her that if encouraged could grow into love oh corio she said and touched his arm i love you but my love is like that of a sister for a brother i do not think it will ever be anything more she hugged him i think at this time in my life i need a friend more than a husband be my friend the most beautiful girl ive ever seen and she wants to be my friend said corio mournfully i have surely displeased the gods that they would visit such a burden upon me you are a rogue dearest cousin cailin laughed and i do not feel one bit sorry for you your path is strewn with broken hearts that evening cailin got a little more insight into her dobunni heritage when her grandfather stood before a huge audience in his hall and recited the history of their celtic tribe next to him a young harper stood playing his music alternately sweet and wild depending upon the portion of the tale being recited at the time ceara and maeve bustled about the hall seeing to the comfort of their guests but at the high board berikoss youngest wife brigit sat proudly on display in the three months she had lived among the dobunni cailin had seen brigit rarely and she had never spoken with her brigit was beautiful in a cold way with her skin as flawless as marble her icy silver eyes her black black hair she held herself aloof believing that her aged husbands protection was all she needed and when he dies does she wonder what will become of her ceara demanded bitterly one day she will find another foolish old man maeve said matteroffactly no young man would have her as she obviously lacks a heart but an old man can be gulled into thinking he will be the envy of all for possessing a fair young wife in the days that followed the celebration of lugh the final harvest was completed the apples and pears were gathered from the orchards the fields were plowed once again and the winter wheat planted cailin dug carrots turnips and onions for cold storage leave the cabbage ceara said until there is danger of a hard frost its better in the garden but pick all the lentils that are left child i want to dry them out and store them myself look after cailin when i am gone brenna said to ceara one afternoon everything she has ever known is gone from her she is brave but i have heard her weeping at night in our sleeping space when she thinks i am asleep and cannot hear her pain is very great why not maeve ceara asked she is your sister maeve is ever a fool over berikos brenna said and besides cailin has taken to you ceara she will give maeve honor but it is you she trusts and is learning to love promise me you will look after her dear old friend my time is growing shorter with every passing hour but i cannot go easily unless i know cailin has a friend and a protector in you when you have passed through the door ceara promised her i will watch over cailin as i would one of my own granddaughters i swear by lugh danu and macha you may rest easy in my word i know i can brenna said her relief obvious brenna died on the eve of samain six months after incurring her injuries she went quickly to sleep but did not awaken the following morning cailin in the company of ceara and maeve washed the body and dressed it for burial as refugees cailin and her grandmother had possessed little but decorated pots bronze vessels for food and drink small bits of jewelry furs cloth and other things considered necessary to a woman began to appear by the body in order that she be buried properly as befitted a dobunni chieftains wife brenna was interred several hours before sunset when the samain feasting would begin the harper played a liltingly sad tune as the mourners followed the body berikos accompanied his estranged wife to her final resting place along with the rest of the family even brigit was among the official mourners as always she sought to divert the focus of berikoss attention to herself could she not have waited until the new year was begun before dying she whined at her husband it seems appropriate to me that brenna chose this last day of the year to end her existence here and walk through the door berikos answered his wife sharply there will be a pall over the feasting tonight brigit said ceara saw it coming but she was powerless to stop it cailin turned and placed herself directly in front of brigit making it impossible for her to move forward how dare you speak with such disrespect at my grandmothers funeral she demanded is this how the catuvellauni raise their daughters to behave my grandmother was a woman of virtue and kindness she was held in esteem by all who knew her all you care about is yourself and your selfish needs who is this this girl brigit said angrily to her husband my granddaughter cailin he said brennas grandchild ohh the mongrel bitch brigit sneered and there were gasps i am no mongrel cailin said proudly i am a briton do not think your blood so pure brigit of the catuvellauni the legions i am told plowed many a furrow amongst the women of your tribe your roman nose gives you away i am surprised my grandfather did not notice it but he is so overcome with his lust for you that he sees nothing except a pair of full breasts and firm buttocks are you going to let her speak to me that way berikos brigit demanded her cheeks red with her outrage she is right brigit you are disrespectful of the dead and i am overcome with my lust for you berikos replied with some humor she should be beaten brigit insisted are you brave enough to try catuvellauni woman cailin retorted no you are not you hide behind my grandfathers authority and snivel at him when you do not get your own way we all know you for what you arethe plaything of a foolish old man whose lust has made him a laughingstock what will you do when berikos walks through the door himself brigit of the catuvellauni will you seek out another old man to entice with your youth and your pretty face you will not be young forever berikoss face now darkened with anger be silent cailin he ordered her i thought that we had come to bury brenna this day but i hear her voice coming from your mouth excoriating me as she was ever wont to do you speak of respect but where is your respect for brenna that you would disrupt her burial in such a manner now be quiet girl i do not want to hear another word from your mouth this day cailin glared at him defiantly but she said nothing more brigit however burst into tears and ran from them her two serving women chasing in her wake berikos groaned the gods only know what that will cost me he grumbled to ceara and maeve perhaps i should beat the girl cailins anger is but a reflection of her pain berikos ceara said wisely remember that only six moon spans ago her entire family was cruelly wiped out by treachery only brenna survived and cailin lived for brenna she has nursed her devotedly my sister was all cailin believed she had left maeve chimed in now brenna is gone too cailin is overwhelmed with her loneliness kyna was a good wife and mother her family was a close one aye ceara said think berikos how would you feel if everyone you loved and held dear was no longer here and you were the only one left cailin will never be able to replace those she has lost but we must help her to make peace with herself and begin a new life the girl has to learn to hold her tongue berikos replied his ego still stinging at his granddaughters harsh words you had best teach her some dobunni manners the next time i will beat her he threatened he looked over to where the grieving girl now stood some distance from them by brennas grave then berikos walked away from his two wives heading to his hall where the samain feasting would soon start ceara shook her head in despair they are so alike she said cailin may be outspoken like brenna but she is every bit as stubborn as berikos they will clash again you may be certain and brigit will be seeking some sort of revenge maeve fretted she is not used to being insulted in public nor is she used to having berikos not come to her defense at the merest slight that evening ceara kept cailin busy helping with the samain feast brigit in the place of honor by her husbands side had dressed herself with special care her scarlet tunic dress was embroidered with gold at the neck and sleeves about her slender neck was a delicate gold torque filigreed and inlaid with red enamel pearls hung from her ears and she wore her long black hair unbound held only with a goldandpearl band about her high forehead she watched her enemy and contemplated her vengeance nothing she had thought of so far was quite right the time was obviously not right now but when it came she would certainly know it in the meantime she would bind berikos even closer to her so he would acquiesce to whatever she desired when the moment for her revenge was at hand berikos in an effort to mend fences with his young wife told her i will share a secret with you brigit he leaned close to her and his head spun with the intoxicating fragrance she wore tell me she said her red lips pouting seductively and then i shall tell you a secret in return my dear lord i have sent to the saxons for a warrior to come and teach our men what they have forgotten about fighting if all goes as i hope it will we may begin taking back the dobunni lands stolen by the romans next summer with the legions long gone and certain not to return all that are left of the romans are farmers and fat merchants we will destroy them they think the celtic tribes have grown into lap dogs but we will show them otherwise brigit we will regain what is ours with sword and fire our success will encourage the others to take their lands back as well britain will be ours once more it will be like the old days my beauty now what have you to tell me do you remember the gypsies that came on lugh well one of my serving women learned a secret from them that will give you pleasure such as you have never dreamed of my lord her voice was breathy and his heart beat faster with his excitement it has taken me all this time to learn the technique to perfection but i have finally mastered it tonight i shall show you do not drink to excess berikos or my efforts will be wasted upon you she licked her lips suggestively he shoved his goblet aside let us go now he said but if you leave she protested faintly the feasting must be done it is early yet berikos let us wait a bit longer i beg you the samain fires are long burned out he replied my fire for you however blazes hot brigit my wife bank your fire for a little time my lord she smiled winningly will it all not be the better for the waiting she kissed him hard on his lips as my granddaughter so forcefully reminded me this afternoon berikos said grimly i am no longer a young man he stood up pulling brigit with him come the night grows older as quickly as do i they left the hall and ceara smiled bitterly brigit reminds us once again that it is she who guides the old stallion leading this herd i wonder what she did to get him to go so early maeve said some suggestion of lustful games you may be sure ceara said he always had a large appetite for womens flesh his appetite is obviously still large but can it overcome his age you sound jealous maeve said astounded arent you ceara replied i may be considered an old woman by virtue of my years but why should my desires not rise as hot as berikoss desires i would not mind if he visited my bed now and then he was always a good lover aye maeve agreed he was now that we are older no one admires us or asks berikoss permission to share our beds it is lonely remember when we were younger ceara said berikos was so proud of how other men desired his wives when they came to visit it always gave him great pleasure to extend his hospitality to our beds and he had his share of the visiting women as well do you remember the time when those three chiefs of neighboring tribes arrived to discuss an alliance and they admired us maeve laughed at the memory aye they had come alone so others would not know of their coming berikos was forced to parcel us out and then he was left without a bedmate that night brenna was almost ready to have kyna and so she could not be with him the only other women available were all related to him ohh it seems so long ago it was ceara said the old ways are dying and men are not so ready to share their women now as they were then it is too bad isnt it the right precautions kept one safe from unwanted pregnancy but a child from an honorable man was considered a blessing i must admit to enjoying the variety offered on those rare occasions the days were growing shorter with the approach of winter the sun did not rise until late and set by what would have been midafternoon in the summer ceara and maeve decided to visit their sons and grandchildren in two of the other villages before the snows set in as they would be going to the village where bodvoc lived with his family nuala decided to accompany her grandmother you just want to go so you can share a bed space with him cailin teased her cousin you are sure to have a big belly by the time you two are wed on beltane next beltane was a traditional time for weddings among the celtic tribes if i have a big belly when we are finally married no one would be more pleased than bodvoc and his family it would show them i am a fertile field and that bodvocs seed is strong there is no shame in it among our peoples cailin is it not the same for the britons then your blood is so intermingled that i thought you would follow many of the same customs as do the dobunni we follow many customs belonging to the celtic peoples nuala cailin said but among the romans a maiden goes to her marriage bed a virgin that custom seems to have continued among the britons what a pity nuala remarked how can you please your husband if you know nothing of what is involved in lovemaking then her blue eyes grew wide with sudden awareness you have never been with a man cailin have you she said in shocked tones not even corio ohh when i return from visiting bodvoc i shall have to remedy this gap in your education dear cousin it is all very well to be able to read but a woman must know far more than that to please a man in bed i dont think i want a man in my bed just yet cailin ventured you are going to be sixteen in the spring cousin nuala said i will teach you everything you need to know and then we will find a nice man for you to practice on bodvoc would be perfect but you are to marry bodvoc cailin squeaked nervously im not jealous after all you dont love him hes a marvelous lover cailin just perfect for a first experience im certain he would be happy to oblige us in this matter i do not know if i can do such a thing nuala i have not grown up as freely as you have these are not my ways cailin said we do not hold that lovemaking between two consenting parties is wrong cailin nuala explained there is nothing evil about giving and receiving pleasure your mother was certainly no virgin when she wed your father she patted her obviously distressed relative we will speak on this when i return from my visit to carviliuss village cailins mother had never told her these things brenna had never told her these things while many girls her age and younger had spoken of the mysterious ways of love cailin had never been particularly curious about it there had been no man who attracted her enough to rouse her interest while she had grown in height and breadth and her chest had sprouted round little breasts two years ago she had never considered life as a grown woman one day now it appeared that she must ceara and maeve were hardly subtle in their quest for a husband for her their reasoning was sound she needed a protector berikos barely tolerated her and given the chance would have been rid of her by now she no longer had any family oh ceara and maeve looked after her but what would happen to her when they were not here stay away from your grandfather while we are gone ceara warned cailin in the morning of her departure brigit has yet to attempt any revenge against you but she will try particularly if there is no one here to defend you are you sure you do not want to come with us my child you would be most welcome cailin shook her head you are good to ask me but i need to be alone with myself and my thoughts there has been no time for that since i came here i will keep from berikoss sight i promise you ceara i do not want him to disown me as he did my mother at least she had my father to go to but i have no one be certain the slaves have his meals prepared on time and that they are hot you will have no trouble with him then his stomach and his manroot are the center of his life these days you take care of the stomach and brigit will see to the other ceara told her wryly cailin laughed if berikos heard you he would say it sounded like brenna talking i am certain do not fear i will oversee the slaves properly for two days all went well and then in midmorning of the third day brigit came into the hall looking agitated where is ceara she demanded of cailin who was alone at her loom weaving gone two days ago to visit her sons cailin answered politely did you not know it lady know how could i know who tells me anything brigit complained then maeve find maeve she demanded excitedly maeve has gone visiting as well cailin replied the gods what am i to do brigit cried cailin swallowed hard brigit seemed genuinely disturbed and although they were scarcely friends cailin heard herself ask can i help you in some way lady brigits blue eyes narrowed and she observed cailin thoughtfully can you cook she finally said can you prepare a small feast for tonight berikos has an important guest arriving we must extend him our best hospitality she flushed and then admitted i cannot cook at least not well enough to prepare the kind of meal that must be served i am a good cook and with the slaves to do my bidding i can prepare a meal worthy of an important guest lady cailin told her then do it brigit commanded her ungraciously and it had better be good mongrel or this time i will see your grandfather has you beaten for your insolence there is no one here to defend you now she turned and hurried from the hall her yellow skirts thrashing i should have gone with ceara and maeve cailin muttered then she would have been in the soup and what would berikos have thought of his beautiful young wife then the ungrateful bitch well i shall do it because ceara would want me to and she is good to me cailin hurried off to the cook house which was located just behind the hall there she instructed the servants in the preparation of a thick pottage with lentils and lamb while upon the open spit a side of beef was to be slowly roasted there would be cabbage and turnip and onions braised in the coals of the fire fresh loaves were baked that afternoon which would be served with butter and cheese cailin polished a dozen apples to a bright shine and piled them artistically in a burnished brass bowl taking them into the hall to place them upon the high board she complimented the young slave girl who had just finished polishing the board with beeswax the huge table was cearas pride and joy she reveled in the fact that in other halls the high boards were worn and pockmarked by knives and goblets in her hall the high board glowed and shone like new the slave girl brought heavy brass candle holders the mistress always uses these for important guests she told cailin cailin thanked her and set them on the table taking the large fat candles from the serving wench and placing them carefully on the iron spikes that held them she stood back and smiled to herself the high board looked as if ceara had set it herself berikos would have no cause for complaint it was then that cailin realized that someone was staring at her she turned and looking down the hall saw a great tall man standing there his look even from a distance was bold who is that she asked the slave it is your grandfathers guest the girl whispered the saxon cailin turned and stepped down from the dais she walked with measured steps toward the man may i be of service to you sir she asked politely not even stopping to think he might not speak latin i would ask permission to sit by your fire lady the answer came the day is chill and i have had a long journey indeed come by the fire cailin replied i will fetch you a goblet of wine unless of course you would prefer ale wine thank you lady may i ask whom i have the honor of addressing i would give no offense in this hall i am cailin drusus a granddaughter of berikos the chieftain of the hill dobunni i apologize for your poor welcome but the lady ceara who is mistress here is away visiting her grandchildren before the winter snows come we did not know you were expected or she would have never gone has your horse been stabled properly sir cailin poured some wine into a silver goblet decorated with dark green agates and handed it to the huge saxon she had never seen such a big man before he was even larger than the celtic men she knew his garb was most colorful red braccos crossgartered in deep blue and gold and a deep blue tunic from which his chest threatened to burst forth with every breath thank you lady my horse has been taken care of by your grandfathers servants he drained the goblet and handed it back to her with a dazzling smile his teeth were large white and amazingly even more she inquired politely he had shoulderlength yellow hair she had never seen hair naturally that color before nay it is enough for now i thank you dazzling blue eyes the blue of a summers sky looked into hers cailin blushed this man was having the oddest effect on her my name is wulf ironfist he told her it is a ferocioussounding name sir she answered he grinned boyishly i gained it as a mere stripling because i could crack nuts with one blow of my fist he told her chuckling later however my name took on a different meaning when i joined caesars legions in the rhineland where i was born that is why you speak our tongue cailin burst out and then she blushed again i am too forward she said ruefully nay he said you are blunt honest there is no crime in that cailin drusus i like it her cheeks warmed at the sound of her name on his lips but her curiosity was greater than her shyness how came you to britain she asked i was told there is opportunity in britain land there is little unclaimed land left in my homeland i spent ten years with the legions and now i would settle down to farm my own land and raise my children you are wed then nay first the land and then a wife or two he told her in practical tones cailin smiled shyly at wulf ironfist she thought the saxon quite the handsomest man she had ever seen then remembering her duties she said you must excuse me sir with the lady ceara gone the kitchens are in my charge my grandfather is very fussy about his meals and he likes them piping hot stay by the fire and make yourself comfortable i will send for berikos to let him know that you have arrived my thanks for your kindness and hospitality lady cailin hurried from the hall and directed the first male servant she saw to go and fetch his master then she returned to the kitchens to oversee the final preparations for dinner requesting that pitchers of wine ale and honeyed mead be made ready for the evenings meal she tasted the pottage and directed the cook to add a bit more garlic the beef sizzled and spat over the fire it smelled wonderful i sent a man down to the stream to look in the fish trap little mistress the cook told her he found two fine fat perch ive stuffed them with scallions and parsley and baked them in the coals better to have too much than too little im told the saxon is a giant of a man and hes had a long ride hell have a good appetite for his supper im thinking will there be enough orna cailin fretted berikos will be angry if he thinks weve slighted his guest ive never had to prepare for a person of importance before i dont want to shame ceara or the dobunni there there little mistress the ruddycheeked cook soothed the girl youve done well a nice thick pottage beef fish vegetables bread cheese and apples tis a very good meal have we a ham cailin wondered aloud and when the plump orna nodded vigorously cailin said then let us serve it as well and boil up a dozen or more eggs and pears ill put pears with the apples oh please be sure there is plenty of bread orna i will see to it orna said now go and put on your prettiest gown little mistress you are far more beautiful than the catuvellauni woman you must sit at the high board with your grandfather in the lady cearas place tonight hurry along now chapter cailin left the cook house and walked back to the hall she hadnt thought about joining her grandfather and his guest she had taken to eating in the cook house since ceara and maeve had left brigit would not like it at all if she showed up this evening but then brigit could go to hades cailin decided orna was right she must take cearas place cailin hurried to her sleeping space to change clothes to her surprise there was a small basin filled with warmed water awaiting her she smiled the servants were certainly united in their dislike of brigit and obviously determined that she should outshine berikoss young wife cailin drew off her tunic dress and set it aside opening her small chest she drew out her best gown it was a beautiful light wool garment that had been dyed with a mixture of woad and madder the rich purple color was stunning there were gold and silver threads embroidered at the simple round neckline and on the cuffs of the sleeves ceara had given it to her at lugh and cailin had never worn it she bathed carefully using a small sliver of soap scented with woodbine when she had stored the tunic she had worn all day in the chest she slipped the purple garment over her linen camisa corio had made her a pearwood comb cailin smiled as she drew it through the tangle of her thick russet curls a simple fillet of freshwater pearls and chips of purple quartz decorated her head maeves lugh gift to her hearing her grandfathers voice cailin hurried from her sleeping space and signaled the waiting servants to begin serving the meal she took her place at the high board nodding politely to berikos who bobbed his head slightly in her direction when brigit opened her mouth to voice what cailin was certain would be a complaint about her presence berikos glowered fiercely at his wife and brigits mouth snapped shut before she uttered a single word cailin bit her lip to keep back her laughter she knew it was not that berikos had grown any softer toward her but that the old man was wise enough to realize that brigit could not direct the servants to his satisfaction cailin he knew from ceara could brigit sat between her husband and their guest she gushed and flirted with wulf ironfist in what she believed was a successful effort to win him over to berikoss plans for the region the young saxon was polite and more than slightly amazed by his hosts wife he had heard the celts were a hospitable people but a mans wife was a mans wife every now and then his gaze would stray to cailin silent on the other side of berikos her only words were directed to the servants and she managed them well he saw she would make some man a good wife one day if she was not already wed and he somehow did not think she was there was an innocence about her that indicated she was yet a maid brigit noticed that the handsome saxons attention was drawn to her husbands granddaughter a wicked plan began to form in her mind she had so patiently bided her time these last weeks waiting for the right moment to have the perfect revenge upon cailin drusus now she believed she had found that moment cailin had embarrassed her publicly before the whole village and what was worse berikos had refused to discipline the wench how those two old crows ceara and maeve had gloated over it protecting cailin from her wrath but now they were out of the way unobtrusively brigit filled and refilled her husbands goblet first with a rich red wine and then with honeyed mead berikos had a strong head for liquor but in recent years his tolerance had been lower than in his youth the steaming hot pottage was put upon the table along with the beef ham and fish platters of vegetables cheese and bread followed in a burst of generosity berikos nodded his approval to his grandchild the assembled ate and drank the saxon matching the old man goblet for goblet until finally the food was cleared away and the discussion of business began in earnest if i train your young men and lead them berikos what will you give me in return for my services wulf ironfist asked after ten years with the legions i can teach your celts to fight like romans the romans have the best army in the world my knowledge is valuable i must have equal value in return what do you want growled the old man land was the simple reply i have had my fill of war but i will do this for you if you give me land for my own no said berikos no land i would drive all romans and other foreigners from britain and have it belong to our people again as it once did why else would i begin such an endeavor in my old age the only foreigners here in britain now are we saxons came wulf ironfists amused reply the true romans departed years ago and those you call romans are in reality britons berikos their blood has been intermingled with that of you celts for so many generations that they are no longer alien if you would make yourself king of this region i will help you in exchange for land and i will pledge you my fealty but the idea that you can drive everyone from britain but those of pure celtic blood is a foolish and impossible task but if i am successful berikos insisted more tribesthe catuvellauni the iceni the silures and otherswill join me in his enthusiasm he knocked his goblet over but brigit quickly righted it and refilled it berikos drank it down no they will not they too are used to peace now the saxon said they want nothing more than to pursue their daily lives you are living in another century berikos times have changed are changing even as we sit talking this night now we saxons are coming into britain in another fifty years our descendants will be nativeborn as well one day there will come another people after us and they will also overwhelm and intermingle with britains inhabitants until they too become nativeborn this is the way of the world one tribe overcoming another mingling with its blood to become a different people you must accept it for you cannot change it berikos any more than you can change the phases of the moon or the seasons i will train your celts in the military arts so that you may become the strongest warlord in this area if you will in exchange give me my own lands to farm perhaps i will even find a wife or two among your women it is a fair offer berikos berikos said nothing at first in reply to the young saxon he sat silently pondering not really willing to give up his dream until now no one but ceara had dared to tell him that his proposed plans for the region were impossible once he would not have needed to send for a saxon warrior to teach his men to fight for the celts had been famed for their battle prowess but in his time he had seen the men of his tribe grown soft with good living they were content to farm the land and keep their cattle and sheep this was what rome had done to them it had taken the heart from them in eire he heard the celts were still real men they lived to do battle with an enemy perhaps he should have sent to the irish for a battlehardened warrior to reeducate the dobunni in the ways of war he reached for his goblet again and swallowed down the honeyed mead brigit had poured for him it was potent burning as it reached his belly he was feeling tired and confused by the younger mans words his catuvellauni inlaws were nearer to the saxon shore of southeast britain he had arranged for them to find him a respected military man from among the saxons and wulf ironfist had come highly recommended still berikos could not be content with what the saxon had told him brigit leaned over and whispered softly in her husbands ear we can win the saxon over to our side if we are patient my lord she murmured let us offer him celtic hospitality as of old we will send a beautiful woman to his sleeping space to warm his bed to give him a nights sport not a real dobunni woman but your granddaughter cailin drusus we must not allow one of our women to mingle her juices with the saxons cailin is not really one of us is she berikos he shook his head and murmured low to her but what sport can the little mongrel bitch give him brigit she is an untutored virgin all the better reason to give her to the saxon firstnight rights are considered a special privilege among all tribes you honor the saxon by giving him those rights with one he will consider to be of your own blood berikos looked craftily at the young girl next to him she certainly was beautiful he thought grudgingly her coloring was unique and had a certain provocativeness to it it was past time she lost her virginity they would have to find her a husband soon and she would need to know how to please a man no man wanted a bride who was frightened or clumsy in bed he turned back to wulf ironfist we have spoken enough on this matter tonight my young friend i do not know if i agree with you but you have given me pause for thought i am not so old that i cannot change if i must let us speak on this again on the morrow it is our custom to honor a guest by giving him one of our women to warm his bed i will give you my granddaughter cailin she will share her sleeping space with you this night will you not girl if he had struck her cailin could not have been more surprised then she saw brigit smiling broadly at her and cailin knew instantly who had put the old man up to this mischief her instinct was to refuse and flee the hall what berikos was asking of her was unthinkable but then as reason quickly overcame her overwrought emotions cailin realized that to refuse would not only enrage berikos but embarrass him and the dobunni as well she had never felt more alone in her entire life the smirking brigit had certainly enacted a fine revenge she knew that the romanobritons kept their daughters virgins until marriage unlike the celts yet whatever husband they found for her would be a celt he would not consider her lost virginity a deficit she had no other choice well girl the old man snarled threateningly as you will berikos she answered him looking directly into the old mans eyes until he turned away she had never been more frightened in all her life but she would not give brigit the satisfaction of knowing it good good he muttered then turned to his wife it is time for us to retire brigit bid our guest good night i will join you shortly at your house brigit arose from the table all smiles good night wulf ironfist may your pleasures be great and many she tittered i will await your coming with eagerness my lord she told berikos and then with another bright smile brigit hurried from the hall go to your bed space now cailin her grandfather ordered her wulf ironfist and i will have a final cup of mead together while you await his coming cailin stood up and moved slowly from the high board she said no word of farewell to berikos and certainly none was necessary for the handsome saxon who sat with him berikos would surely direct the young man to her sleeping space when the time came she frankly wasnt certain what kind of protocol was involved in such an arrangement it was better she remain silent reaching her sleeping space cailin opened her little storage chest removed her gown and stored it neatly away with her little jeweled fillet should she remove her camisa she honestly did not know she had never in her whole life seen her parents abed together she knew absolutely nothing of what would transpire between herself and wulf ironfist no mother in her culture would discuss such serious matters with her daughter until she was ready to marry as cailin had never settled upon a husband there had been no talk about the intimacies shared by a man and a woman her twin brothers had been as protective of her as were their parents it would be best cailin finally decided to err on the side of caution lest she be considered wanton she slowly slipped off the soft felt slippers she wore in the house and putting them in the chest too she closed it then she climbed into the sleeping space which was set into the stone walls of the building the mattress was newly made filled with a mixture of sweet hay lavender heather and rose petals the inner covering of the mattress was a closewoven linen but the outer cover was a finer soft linen fabric of a natural hue there was a beautiful coverlet of red fox which kept her warm in the coldest dampest weather in a small niche above her head a little stone oil lamp burned illuminating the sleeping space cailin considered dimming it but decided to leave it burning for the present it cast a comforting golden light over everything and she needed all the courage she could muster to face whatever lay ahead wulf ironfist was shown to the sleeping space by a servant sitting upon the small chest he pulled his boots off and set them neatly aside then he stood and removed his tunic and braccos the servant girl who had hidden in the shadows that she might see him nude almost swooned at the sight never in all her life had she seen such a man he had broad broad shoulders and a wide back when he turned to stretch the serving wench was treated to the sight of wellmuscled arms and a smooth bronzed chest his legs were like tree trunks massive and wellshaped covered with a golden down her wide eyes slid down the tantalizing torso following his treasure trail and her mouth formed a small o of worshipful admiration silently the girl backed away envying the fortunate young mistress who would certainly be wellpleasured by the saxons passion this night wulf ironfist undid the thong holding his hair back and the blond mass fell forward touching his shoulders the glow of the light in the bed space was welcoming reaching out he pulled the fur coverlet aside and climbed in for a brief moment he thought he was alone for cailin was pressed against the far wall of the enclosure her back to him and at first he did not see her although he had earlier thought her demeanor a pleasingly modest one he had expected a warmer welcome to her bed was she teasing him or was she merely shy rolling onto his side to face her he reached out and pushed the delightful tangle of her curls aside to bare her neck then leaning forward he kissed the slender column warmly your skin is like silk he told her admiringly and he stroked the back of her neck gently cailin who had shivered just slightly at the touch of his lips on her flesh now shuddered hard at his touch wulf ironfist was not an insensitive man he could see that the girl was holding herself stiffly then he realized that she was also still wearing her camisa an uncomfortable thought crept into his head but he pushed it away for the moment he needed to know more you have not removed your camisa he said quietly let me help you now i did not know if i should came the muffled reply and she seemed to move even farther away from him although he knew it impossible given the dimensions of the bed space i have been told that celtic girls celebrate the mother goddess he replied reaching down to slide the camisa up and off her cringing figure rolling over he tossed the garment upon the chest and turned back to the girl the line of her back was beautiful and her skin was exquisitely fair he touched her shoulder with gentle fingers and she started violently do you not wish to share your sleeping space with me cailin drusus he asked quietly i have been told this is a common custom among your people what is the matter for an unmarried maiden to share a sleeping space with a man is not how i was raised wulf ironfist but i am bound to obey the wishes of my grandfather just a few months ago i foolishly told berikos that when my grandmother stepped through the door from this life to the next i would leave the dobunni that i could take care of myself but the truth of the matter is that i cannot fend for myself no matter how much i would wish to do so therefore i must obey when berikos commands he is not particularly fond of me as it is her young voice trembled slightly at the last you are not a dobunni what mischief was this wulf wondered my mother the child of his third wife was berikoss only daughter cailin said her name was kyna my grandfather loved her dearly i am told but he disowned her when she married my father whose family descends from a roman tribune i liked what you said to my grandfather this evening about us all being britons unfortunately berikos doesnt see it that way cailin went on to tell wulf ironfist how she had come to berikoss village and of her grandmothers death just a few weeks prior i am not unhappy here among my mothers people they are kind and good to me but my grandfather will not forgive me the slight amount of roman blood that flows in my veins she finished the lady brigit does not like you wulf noted astutely no she does not it was she who suggested this arrangement but then it is customary for the dobunni to offer an important visitor a bedmate for the night brigit thinks to kill two birds with one stone she can revenge herself on me and she hopes to influence you to aid my grandfather which will gain her greater favor with him what do you think of his plans for britain wulf ironfist asked cailin he had liked this beautiful and obviously intelligent girl from the first moment he had seen her this afternoon with her bowl of brightly polished apples he did not want to hurt her i think you are right sir and that berikos deludes himself cailin said honestly will you help him turn around cailin drusus and look at me it is difficult speaking to your back he replied and there was just a hint of laughter in his deep voice as he cajoled her gently i cannot cailin admitted you are naked are you not i have never seen a man naked completely naked she amended remembering the wrestlers who had entertained at her brothers liberalia feast i will keep my half of the furs wrapped tightly about my body he promised her only my arms shoulders and head will be visible to you and you must be as tightly wrapped for your own comfort i would not embarrass you cailin drusus but i would like to see your lovely face when we speak it is very dim in this sleeping space i feel as if i am speaking to some disembodied creature he teased she thought a long moment and then said very well but do not look too closely at me i cannot help being shy sir this is all quite new to me though not quite as frightening as i earlier thought cailin rolled over carefully clutching the furs to her chest he smiled encouragingly down at her and she blushed to the roots of her auburn hair will you help berikos she repeated struggling not to burst into tears for her fear had suddenlyreturned at the sight of him and her heart was pounding for a quick moment he caught a glimpse of her eyes they were like wet violets then her lashes swiftly lowered brushing her pale cheeks like dark dancing butterflies berikos it would seem is not willing to meet my price wulf ironfist answered her land cailin said and suddenly she had a marvelous idea i will meet your price sir she told him and in exchange i will ask but two things of you you will find i believe that mine is the better bargain you will give me land for training and leading the dobunni he said quite confused by her offer cailin laughed no you are correct about the dobunnis chances of restoring the celtic tribes to their former prominent position there is no chance but i would be revenged upon the man who engineered the murders of my family and would have killed me but for happenstance the lands of the drusus corinium family are mine by right as the sole surviving member of that family alone i can do nothing to claim my rights my cousin quintus drusus would find some way to kill me to hold on to what he has stolen but you could kill quintus drusus for me wulf ironfist and if you wed with me beforehand then my lands would become yours would they not it is a far better opportunity than my grandfather can give you cailin concluded surprised at her own daring in even suggesting such a thing perhaps she was learning how to survive without the dobunni after all are your lands fertile is there sufficient water he asked amazed that he was even considering her proposition but then why shouldnt he he wanted lands of his own and he would need a wife the girls idea was a perfect solution to both their problems our lands are fertile she assured him and there is plenty of water there are good fields for grain and other fields for grazing cattle and sheep there are orchards too my familys villa is gone but we can build another dwelling sir the slaves belonging to my father will also be mine berikos will have to give us a generous bridal gift as well ceara and maeve will see that it is a good portion wulf ironfist needed no time to consider her offer was an excellent one and only a fool would refuse it i will do it he told her we will wed and then i will regain your lands for you cailin drusus i will even aid that old reprobate your grandfather somewhat we will be forced to winter here during the next few months i will train any young dobunni who wishes to learn the arts of war the final test of their skills will be when we retake your lands from your wicked cousin then berikos may have them if you are right about these people they will not follow him any farther than the boundaries of their own fields he looked hard at her you are clever lambkin reaching out he tipped her face up and touched his lips briefly to hers we will not tell your grandfather of our plans though i will tell him only that i want you for my wife he will not refuse you that she said feeling a flush suffuse her whole body at the touch of his mouth on hers indeed both he and brigit will think it fitting that the mongrel bitch as they like to call me has mated with a foreigner as they call you saxons we have not mated yet he said softly his gaze direct we have not wed yet she countered quickly her heart skipping a beat we cannot insult your grandfather lambkin nor will he believe me overcome by my hot passion for you if we do not do what is expected of us tonight he tangled his big hand in her hair cupping her head i like the color of your hair and the charming confusion of your curls cailin saxon girls have straight blond hair they wear it in two plaits and it is often cropped to their skulls when they wed to show their subservience to their husbands i could not do that to your sweet curls so it is fortunate you are a briton and not a saxon he finished with a smile at her gently but firmly he pulled her head back exposing the line of her throat then pushing her onto her back he pressed slow hot kisses on her milky flesh cailin clutched her furs desperately to her breasts she didnt know what to do she didnt know if she should do anything suddenly his blue eyes were staring deeply into hers she found she could not look away she was growing warm again she thought irrationally longing to toss off the coverlet but not daring to do so wulf ironfist was absolutely certain of the answer he would receive to the question he now asked her are you a virgin lambkin of course she was a virgin her face mirrored her confusion as she alternated between fear of the unknown and curiosity yes she said low im sorry i wont be able to give you pleasure i just dont know what to do i like it that you are a virgin he told her tenderly and i will teach you everything you should know to please us both he pressed a handful of curls to his lips for a moment i dont even know how to kiss she said dejectedly it is an easily learned art he assured her seriously but his blue eyes were dancing with amusement in many it is instinctive when i kiss you just kiss back let your heart guide you i will instruct you in certain refinements later on lowering his head he kissed her gently and after a moment of hesitation cailin kissed him back that is very good he praised her let us try again this time his kiss was firmer and she felt her lips give way slightly beneath his she gasped faintly as the very tip of his tongue brushed sensuously and lightly over her mouth the sensation caused her head to whirl dizzily cailin put her arms about him to steady herself for she felt as if she were falling he released her lips and buried his head in her hair you taste delicious lambkin and you smell delicious i never met a girl who smelled as good as you do why is that he now looked down into her eyes and cailin colored once more will you always blush when i look at you he asked her softly you are so fair your praise is extravagant i think sir she answered him and then realizing that her arms were about him she unwrapped herself from him but he protested her actions i like that you held on to me lambkin i think for all your maidenly fears you know me to be a man who can be trusted i am not a man who scatters compliments like raindrops when i offer you praises it is because you deserve them cailin drusus you are beautiful i have never known such a beautiful woman i will be proud to have you for my wife and i will be jealous of any man who looks at you lambkin we are going to make fine strong children together how she boldly asked him surprising them both he grinned boyishly so you are curious are you then we must continue with our lessons reaching out he began to draw back the fox coverlet cailin cried out softly attempting to stop him but he would not be stayed the look of awe upon his handsome face however when he gazed upon her nudity for the first time gave cailin a tiny glimpse of the power a woman holds over a man he did not touch her at first rather his eyes drank in her smooth fair flesh her small round breasts the graceful curve of her waist her slender but wellfleshed thighs the tightly bunched curls upon her venus mont he smiled almost to himself and touched her there with a single finger these curls match those upon your head he said she watched him wideeyed silent then he said remove my half of the coverlet lambkin she pulled the furs back and caught her breath at the sight he had called her beautiful and yet it was he who was beautiful he had the body of a god surely everything was in proportion perfect perfect proportion there was nothing that surprised her but for the appendage between his legs she stared at it curiously touching it gingerly with a finger even as he had touched her what is it she asked him what use does it serve for you i do not have one wulf ironfist swallowed hard her curiosity was almost detached nay you do not have one but your brothers did did you never see theirs what is it she repeated it is called a manroot and my brothers had them too no i never saw them my parents believed in modesty they said a great many of romes problems today stemmed from a lack of morals they did not believe we should be ashamed of our bodies but they also did not believe that we should flaunt them lewdly what does your manroot do it is the means through which my seed will flow into your womb lambkin encouraged my manroot will grow large and hard i will sheath it within you releasing my seed the act will give us both pleasure where will you sheath it show me she demanded he bent and kissed her once more and as he did so he took a single finger and pushing gently between her nether lips touched the entry to her womans passage there he told her lifting his mouth from hers ohhh she answered that single light touch had not simply startled her it was as if something had burst in her midsection tiny tremors of sensation pulsed throughout her entire being we have a ways to go before that he told her removing the invasive digit i will answer all your questions later lambkin but perhaps it would be better if we did not talk so much right now why do you call me lambkin she persisted nervously because you are an innocent little lamb with your big purple eyes and your naughty russet curls and i am the wolf who is going to eat you up he responded then his mouth pressed down hard on hers he wanted to be gentle he wanted to be patient but her nearness was driving him wild with longing he needed to get on with it and if the truth be known the longer he waited the harder it was going to be on cailin her lips softened beneath his and he pushed his tongue into her mouth she tried to draw back but he held her firmly at first she tried to elude the tongue seeking hers but he would not let her she could taste the honeyed mead on his breath and it excited her tentatively her tongue sought his out joining it in an exquisite dance that gratified both their senses her arms tightened about him once again drawing him half over her her young breasts pushing up to meet his smooth chest pulling away he took her heartshaped face in his hands and covered her face with kisses his lips trailed once again down her straining throat moving into the valley between her breasts when she cried out softly he soothed her no lambkin do not be afraid her breasts felt as if they were swelling beneath his kisses when he cupped one in his hand and tenderly fondled it her cry was one of relief she had wanted him to touch her there she wanted him to keep touching her there her heart was beating so violently that she thought it would come through her chest but his touch was far more compelling now than her fears wulf bent and kissed the young breasts in his charge his tongue began to tentatively lick at her nipples first one and then the other teasing the soft flesh into tight hard spear points of tingling sensation cailins breath sounded ragged in his ears as he finally closed his mouth over her left nipple and began to suckle strongly pleasure he heard her half sob as he moved to her other nipple offering it the same erotic homage he had offered its sister cailin watched him through halfclosed eyes as he worshiped her body she felt weak with unfamiliar longing but in her heart she felt stronger than ever before she realized suddenly that he had swung himself over her as bending forward he caressed and kissed her torso thrusting from his body was was his manroot but it was suddenly enormous it could not possibly fit within her young body he would tear her apart you are too big she cried her voice genuinely frightened her palms against his chest pressing away please dont i do not want to do this thing now she arched struggling against him he groaned it was a desperate sound let me fit just the tip of it in your passage lambkin and you will see it will be ail right just the tip she quavered he nodded gently he guided himself with a hand she was wonderfully moist with her excitement and he easily fitted himself into her waiting passage the heat of her flesh welcomed him as she closed tightly about the tip of his manroot wulf wondered how long he was going to be able to maintain his control she was simply delicious what madness had made him propose such foolishness he wanted to bury himself as deeply within her as he could he took a deep breath there he crooned to her that is not so terrible is it my lambkin the invasion was a tender one she felt it most distinctly the tip of him was stretching her but it did not really hurt her he kissed her lips softly and murmured against them if you will let me come just a bit farther i will give you sweet pleasure when she did not answer him he began to press his advantage forward moving with delicate quick strokes within her while continuing to kiss her mouth her face her neck cailin closed her eyes and allowed him his will although the feeling was new it was not altogether unpleasant in fact she was beginning to grow quite warm and when she felt her body start to move in rhythm with his she was surprised but she could not refrain from the motion indeed as she moved with him she began to find herself overcome with a sensation of overpowering sweetness it was as if a hundred butterflies were caught within her body cailin suddenly took wulf ironfists face between her hands and kissed him passionately for the first time he had watched the changing expressions on her face it was like watching a clear sky turn stormy can you feel the pleasure beginning my lambkin he whispered to her is it good let me complete what we have started i long to possess you completely yes it was clearly said she felt his muscled thighs pinion her firmly he began to piston her with quicker strokes of his manhood faster and faster and faster and then a sharp burning pain overwhelmed her as her maidenhead shattered before the onslaught of his weapon the pain swept up her torso filling her achingly as he sheathed himself completely within her with a triumphant cry cailin gasped as the fire filled her belly her nails clawed at his straining back she would have screamed in her terrified agony had he not covered her mouth with his own at the precise moment he deflowered her he had hurt her he hadnt even warned her of this torture of course he hadnt he knew full well she would have not allowed him the liberty of her body had she known of this horrendous pain she hated him she would never forgive him she she she was suddenly aware of a new and absolutely delicious sensation sweeping over her the pain had vanished as rapidly as it had come nothing remained but warm sweet pleasure wulf was moving again upon her and the honeyed fire pouring through her veins was akin to nothing she had ever experienced before ohhhh she half sobbed as he released her lips oh there was a hot tightness building inside her what is happening to me she moaned desperately as she felt her body beginning to spiral out of control she was soaring it was wonderful she didnt want it to stop up up up she could go on forever like this then the sensation climaxed bursting like a thousand shooting stars inside both her body and her brain ohhhhh she cried overwhelmed by the pleasure and disappointed as she felt the deliciousness melting away as quickly as it had come upon her no cailin said and then she opened her eyes and looked into his more she demanded wulf ironfist burst out laughing but there was no mockery in the sound it was the laughter of a happy and relieved man he smoothed her hair from her face and rolled off of her kissing the tip of her nose as he did so then propping himself up against the wall of the bed space he looked down into her face and said i hope you gained as much pleasure from our passion as i did lambkin then he drew her into the safety of his strong arms cailin nodded turning her head to look up at him her euphoria was abating slightly but she was not unhappy after the pain it was wonderful she told him shyly there is only pain the first time he promised we shall make fine children the gods have been kind to us cailin drusus we are wellmated and wellmatched i think your seed is fierce she said blushing with the remembrance of how she felt it flooding her with sharp bursts perhaps even now we have begun our first son wulf ironfist she finished as they slipped beneath the coverlet again he lay his great blond head upon her breasts and was pleased when she cradled him as protectively as he had her he had come to the dobunni seeking land the gods in their wisdom had given him cailin and a brand new future if we were in your world he said and i had asked your father for you and he had consented how would our marriage be celebrated the ceremony would begin at my fathers villa cailin told him the house would be decorated with flowers if there were any and boughs of greenery finely spun colored wool and tapestries the omens would be taken in the hour of the false dawn and being auspicious the guests would begin arriving even before the sunrise they would come from all the neighboring villas and from the town of corinium too the bride and the groom would come to the atrium and the ceremony would begin we would be brought together by a happily married matron who would be our pronuba she would join our hands before ten formal witnesses although actually all our guests would be present why ten he asked her ten for the ten original patrician families of rome she answered him and then continued i would then say the ancient words of my consent to our marriage whenand whereyou are gaius i thenand theream gaia we would then move to the left of the family altar and face it sitting on stools covered with the skin of sheep sacrificed for the occasion my father would then offer a cake of spelt to jupiter we would eat the cake while my father prayed aloud to juno who is goddess of marriage he would pray to nodens and to other gods of the land both roman and celtic afterward we would be considered truly wed there are other forms of the marriage ceremony but this was the one always used by my family my parents would then host a great feast which would last the entire day at the end of it pieces of our wedding cake would be distributed to our guests for luck then i would be formally escorted to my husbands home you would seize me from the shelter of my mothers arms and i would take my place in the procession we would be led by torch bearers and musicians and anyone along the way might join in the parade indeed this procession was considered the final stamp of validity to a marriage in the old days it is customary for a bride to be attended by three young boys whose parents are both living two would walk next to me and hold my hands while the third would go before me carrying a branch of hawthorn behind me would be carried a spindle and distaff i would have three coins of silver one i would offer to the gods of the crossroads the second i would give to you representing my dowry and the third i would offer to your household gods and would i do nothing except stride proudly along he said oh no cailin told him you would scatter sesame cakes nuts and other sweetmeats among the bystanders when we reached your house i would decorate the door posts with colored wool and anoint the door with precious oils then you would lift me up and carry me across the threshold it is considered bad luck if a brides foot should slip while entering her new home i would not let you slip he promised and lifting his head up he kissed her lips is that all no cailin said with a little laugh there is more as you carried me into the house i would repeat the same words i had said to you at our marriage ceremony then the door would be closed to the crowds outside and we would be alone at last wulf ironfist said no cailin answered giggling we would have certain invited guests with us you would put me upon my feet and offer me fire and water as a token of the life we would share and as symbols of my duty in our home there would be wood and kindling already set in the hearth which i would light with the marriage torch then i would toss the torch among our guests it is considered very lucky to gain possession of a marriage torch then our guests would go home and we would finally be alone he said am i right cailin drusus she chuckled no no he said in exaggerated tones of outrage i would have to recite a prayer first she said a long prayer he pretended to look aggrieved not too long she replied and afterward the pronuba would lead me to our marriage couch which would be placed in the center of the atrium on the first night of our marriage it would always remain in its original position as a symbol of our union tis a long day for a bride and groom he said how do the saxons celebrate their marriages she asked him a man buys his wife wulf ironfist replied of course he usually makes certain first that the maid is of a similar frame of mind then he approaches her familythrough an intermediary of courseto see what and how much they will take for the girl then the offer is formally made perhaps it is accepted or perhaps a little more dickering goes on once the bride price is agreed upon and exchanged a feast is held and afterward the happy couple go homewithout their guests i might add he concluded then he took her chin between his thumb and forefinger say your words to me cailin drusus his voice was soft his tone caressing his manhood beginning to stir once again say your words to me lambkin i will be a good husband to you i swear by all the gods both yours and mine whenand whereyou are gaius i thenand theream gaia cailin told him how odd she thought i waited all my life for the right man to say those words to but never did i think to say them stark naked in a bed space in a dobunni village to a saxon still cailin decided she was fortunate she sensed that wulf ironfist was an honorable and a good man she needed his protection for without her family she had no one ceara and maeve did the best they could for her but they had gone away and she had found herself at the mercy of berikos and his vicious catuvellauni wife it would not happen again then she heard the saxons voice strong and sure and she looked into his blue eyes i wulf ironfist son of orm take you cailin drusus for my wife i will provide for you and protect you this i swear by the great god woden and by the god thor my patron i will be a good wife to you cailin promised him i know he told her then he chuckled i wonder what your grandfather and that witch brigit will think of this turn of events he will ask payment of you for me i am certain give him nothing cailin said he deserves nothing that for which we pay nothing is worth nothing lambkin wulf told her i value you above all women i will give him a fair price of which you need not be ashamed you are too good she said how can i repay you for your kindness to me you might have had a nights sport and then sent me away if you had however i know i ought not have been shamed for it is the dobunni way but i would have been shamed in my heart nevertheless a slow mischievous grin lit his strong handsome features i know just how you may begin your repayment lambkin he said and he brought her hand to his manroot which was again in a state of eager readiness i intend to exact full payment lambkin not just this night but in the nights to come her young face took on a seductive look he had not seen before it is fair my husband she agreed you will hear no complaint from me in this matter my family always taught me to repay my debts then she pulled his face back to hers her lips ready and eager for his kisses chapter berikos looked at his guest you slept well he asked you have reconsidered our conversation of yesterday your granddaughter is a charming companion wulf ironfist replied and gulped down a draught of brown ale i am honored to have had her firstnight rights berikos you have made it plain how much you desire my aid but i in turn still believe your idea is doomed to failure you cannot turn back time no one ever has my friend i will meet your price berikos said desperately land the saxon raised an eyebrow questioningly berikos nodded bleakly you would make a bad neighbor feeling as you do wulf told the old man i would never really be able to trust you unless unless what berikos pounced upon the small thread of hope assign me a portion of land for security now when i have trained your men i will exchange it with another celt living on the saxon shore wulf ironfist said i will have my land and the land you give me will belong to another of your race perhaps not of your own tribe but you celts can work that out amongst you berikos nodded aye we can and when the day comes when we drive your people back to the rhineland you cannot complain to me can you i will have kept my part of our bargain good i agree not quite so quickly my friend wulf ironfist said i want one other thing of you i think you are most apt to keep your bargain with me if we are related by blood your granddaughter pleases me i need a wife her mixed blood disturbs you but it does not disturb me i will pay you a fair bride price for her if you will give me your consent under our laws she must give her consent too wulf ironfist if she does i will be glad to accept a bride price for her berikos answered although i should not you will be doing me a favor by taking cailin off my hands my wife ceara has been nagging me to find her a husband what will you give me for her the saxon tossed his companion a coin it flashed and glittered as it flew through the air berikoss fist closed about it his eyes widened he bit the coin as hard as he could his look one of surprise gold this is a gold coin wulf ironfist one girl is hardly worth an entire gold coin berikos said slowly he wanted the saxons gold but his conscience would never leave him in peace if he werent honest besides the wench has not yet given her consent to the match she has given her consent the younger man told him it is a fair price for it will ensure that you will not take my life when my use to you is over and done with berikos of the dobunni the old man chuckled you do not trust anyone wulf ironfist do you well you are wise not to for no one can be completely trusted in this world very well i accept your terms and the girl is now your wife you may think it a poor bargain when she shows you the rough side of her tongue but i will not take her back he spit in his right hand and held it out to the saxon who spitting in his own right hand clasped berikoss outstretched palm in a firm grip agreed berikos but i will not regret the bargain i assure you cailin will make me a good wife her mother taught her well the duties a woman has to her husband and house aye the old man responded softly kyna was a good girl good morning and was your night filled with many pleasures brigit tittered entering the hall her skyblue tunic dress with its silver embroidery floated about her gracefully as she came smiling falsely indeed lady my night was a very good one wulf ironfist answered wulf has agreed to aid us berikos said pleased he explained to his young wife the land transaction involved and he concluded i have given him cailin as a wife you have done what brigits eyes widened with shock this was not at all the way she planned it she had intended only for the saxon to roughly violate cailin and break her spirit she wanted the girl shamed and hurt wulf asked me for cailins hand berikos repeated her tainted blood does not bother him my granddaughter has agreed he held up the coin saying wulf has given me this for the wenchs bride price it is gold your father was content to accept a silver piece and a breeding pair of hunting dogs for you brigit brigits eyes glittered at the sight of the gold and wulf thought that berikos would not have his granddaughters bride price for very long if brigit had her way the womans mouth was sullen however and she finally said is there no food in this hall that we might break our fast cailin is derelict in her duties or has her marriage gone to her head a good wife should have the morning meal ready at a respectable hour i hope ceara returns soon perhaps if you did not sleep half the morning away brigit cailin said as she entered the hall you would find the meal ready berikos and my husband ate hours ago if you go to the cook house however they may give you something if you tell them i said to do so she smiled brightly at the woman i must be about my duties a runner arrived this morning from carviliuss hill fort ceara and maeve are expected before sunset we will eat as soon as they arrive do try to be on time lady she turned to her grandfather is the bargain made between my husband and you berikos it is he said the corners of his mouth twitching just slightly the girl was tough and refused to be beaten hed give her that speak more gently to my lady wife in future mongrel he warned her she is deserving of respect only if she earns it berikos cailin shot back and turning on her heel left them there berikos crowed you have seen the rough edge of her tongue now wulf ironfist but it is too late she is your wife the barb was not directed at me berikos i like a woman who speaks her mind i will only beat her if she defies me he answered ceara maeve and nuala arrived even as the midafternoon winter sunset was turning the sky glorious shades of red orange gold and dark purple one cold bright star hung over berikoss hill fort as if guiding them to the warm safety within nuala was excited to be home and hugged her cousin tightly while her elders removed the cloaks before they might hear it elsewhere berikos told his two older wives of cailins marriage both were clearly horrified and equally furious at brigits part in the matter she did it to be cruel maeve cried in a rare show of anger before her husband you were filled with wine and mead ive not a doubt and went along with the bitchs mischief oh shame berikos you do not have to accept him as a husband my child ceara said her calm tones belying her outrage there is no shame among our peoples if a woman samples pleasure with several men if she learns to give equal pleasure it but enhances her reputation as a possible wife you can withdraw your consent cailin if you wish berikos can return the saxons gold piece it can be done honorably i do not wish to withdraw my consent ceara cailin said calmly wulf ironfist is a good man i am content to be his wife there is no other to whom i am attracted have you not been nagging me about marrying lady she teased but when he has finished his work here ceara wailed he will take you away to the saxon shore and we will never see you again good riddance i say brigit sneered ceara rounded on her shut your mouth bitch i should have killed you when i first laid eyes upon you you are nothing but trouble then she turned on her husband i have honored you my entire life berikos she began i have defended your decisions even when i knew them to be wrong i stood silently by when you disowned your only daughter and never said a word in kynas defense when i should have i gritted my teeth when you would not allow us to share the joy of the births of brennas grandchildren and i stood by silently again when brenna left us to be with kyna and her family you are a foolish old man berikos you wish to restore the dobunni to greatness what greatness we never had any greatness we are a simple clan if you try to drive the britons from their lands they will fight back to defend these lands they have farmed for the last few hundred years you will not succeed in this mad scheme even if i cannot prevent you from pursuing it but i will not let brennas only surviving grandchild leave us you will give this saxon the lands you promised him and they will remain here unless of course she concluded you wish to spend your days alone without maeve and me berikos was flabbergasted in all the years they had been married ceara had never spoken so harshly to him privately or in public he had also never seen her so angry what do you mean without maeve and you was all he could think of to say he did not even rail at her for her overly frank speech we will leave you berikos ceara said grimly we will go to other villages and live with our sons but you need not fear i am certain brigit will keep your house and nurse you tenderly when you grow sickly and see that your food is cooked to your liking does she even know how you like your meals prepared probably not but i am sure that you will tell her there is no need for that berikos grumbled nervously ceara cocked a bushy eyebrow quizzically indeed she said we will make some accommodation lady i swear it berikos promised the angry woman there is no need for rashness we will see old man ceara answered him in dark tones cailin looked up at her husband her eyes twinkling with their conspiracy they had agreed within the cozy closeness of their bed space early that morning that no mention would be made of her lands until they were ready to make their move they would not press berikos to keep his bargain when the time came they would retake the property belonging to the drusus corinium family the word was passed among the dobunni villages that any wishing to relearn the ancient arts of war were to come to berikoss village where they would be housed fed and taught in exchange for their service several wooden barracks were built within the walls of the hill fort for the prospective warriors one hundred fifty young men ranging in age from thirteen to eighteen came berikos was disappointed with the small number he had honestly believed there would be more what did you expect ceara said to him there are only a thousand of us many of the young men are already married and do not choose to leave their families why should they what of honor berikos said outraged by her words maeve chuckled honor has little hope of keeping a man warm on a cold winters night and what woman wants to spend her winter alone or with only her children or great with child and no man to comfort her this is what the romans have done to us berikos said grimly the romans did nothing to us we did not allow to be done ceara told him matteroffactly besides what sensible people do not prefer peace to war our people berikos said our people who came out of the darkness and across the plains and the oceans to britain eire cymry gaul and armorica our celtic race when will you accept the fact that that time is past berikos ceara said quietly to her husband she put a comforting hand upon his arm but he shook it off no it cannot be it will come again he insisted then train your warriors you stubborn old man she said irritably when the spring comes we will see what happens the winter came with its cold winds icy rains and snow wulf ironfist worked with his recruits taking them on daylong marches in all kinds of weather with fiftypound packs of equipment upon their backs when they complained at first he said coldly romes legions carry more perhaps that is why you are no longer masters of your own land you prefer drinking and telling outrageous tales to military training the young dobunni gritted their teeth and complained no more the clang of swords rang in the clear air of the hill fort along with the thunk of the javelin meeting its target as the warriorstobe honed their battle and survival skills yet as harsh a taskmaster as wulf ironfist was in training his men he was a completely different man with his wife ceara and maeve both agreed that the saxon though he would be a fierce opponent upon the battlefield was a gentle soul with cailin and with the children of the hill fort who followed him admiringly begging for his favor more often than not he would take two of the littlest ones up in his arms and walk through the village carrying them as he went about his business there was not a child who did not adore him nor a young girl who did not try to attract his attention after all there was nothing limiting wulf ironfist to only one wife the maidens however were doomed to disappointment for the saxon had no time for anyone or anything but cailin and his duty cailin was content with her life she had an attractive husband who was kind and regularly made passionate love to her it seemed to be enough particularly as she quickly found herself with child she realized that her parents had had a different sort of relationship than she had with wulf ironfist but she did not understand what that relationship had been cailins swelling belly pleased her husband here was proof of his virility for the dobunni berikos was not pleased now he would never get rid of the saxon if ceara and maeve were determined that he and cailin stay before this they would be implacable now berikos sighed to himself what difference would one damned saxon make anyway and there was always the chance wulf would be killed in battle cailin enjoyed the long dark winter nights spent in wulfs arms once she divulged her condition to him he was more careful of her but no less vigorous a lover he liked cuddling her spoonfashion his big roughened hands cupping her round little breasts which were swelling now with her condition her nipples always sensitive became even more so with each passing day what a little wanton you have become he said to her one night as he sheathed his great weapon gently in her passage from behind so that his weight would not harm the child he fondled her bosom wickedly teasing the hard buds of her nipples he then slipped his hands down grasping her about the hips drawing her firmly against his belly he sunk his teeth into the flesh of her neck nuzzled at the marks and then placed a kiss on the flesh cailin squirmed against him are wives not allowed to be wanton my husband ohhhhh she squealed softly as he probed her more deeply and her hips began to rotate just slightly against him wulf groaned he had never known any woman to have the effect on him that cailin did she roused him quicker and brought him on quicker he wasnt certain that he liked it but he certainly did not dislike it unable to help himself he began to pump her her little staccato cries of pleasure only increasing his own cailin thought dizzily that she should be used to him by now but each time he took her the excitement built and built until she could scarcely bear it it was so achingly sweet he seemed to grow and swell within her until finally they would both burst with pleasure and yet the afterglow was delicious as well even now when the child moved within her she enjoyed his attentions ahhhhhhh she sighed at last soon we must cease this he told her reluctantly why she asked him i fear i might hurt the child he replied will you take another woman she asked and he heard the edge of jealousy in her voice which pleased him inordinately he was silent a long moment would you mind if i did he asked affecting a nonchalant air now it was cailins turn to be silent for a time would she mind and if she did why would she mind yes she finally answered him i would mind it if you took another woman to your bed but do not ask me why because i do not understand it i just would then i will not he told her if i cannot keep my desires in check like a man then i am no better than a green boy besides i have seen the difficulties your grandfather has with more than one wife i think i should just as soon avoid such difficulties although i do not promise i will always feel so lambkin cailin found herself smiling at his words there would be no other wives if she could help it one wife was more than enough for any man even a magnificent marvelous man like wulf ironfist she would always be more than enough woman for him then a thought struck her why did it matter to her was it possible she cared for him was his thoughtfulness a sign he might care for her cailin slid into a contented slumber her last waking memory that of her husbands deep sleepy breath humming against her ear it was a comfortable feeling several days later on a bright april morning wulf ironfist put his plan to regain his wifes property into effect assembling the young warriors he had spent the winter months training he asked them how would you like to demonstrate your skills to me by helping me take a villa owned by a roman called quintus drusus the young men looked distinctly uncomfortable then corio cailins cousin said most of the lads want to return to their villages wulf the planting is already under way and their families need them you never really expected that they would form an army for berikos and carry out his foolish plans did you wulf ironfist laughed no corio i did not however quintus drusus is the fellow who murdered cailins family and was responsible for brennas death i promised cailin when i wed her that i would regain her familys lands for her and for our children corios blue eyes widened and then he grinned so that is why you have never pressed grandfather about the lands he promised you you knew all along that you would have cailins property i will only have it if you and the lads will help me to retake it and mete out justice to this quintus drusus wulf ironfist said honestly i cannot do it without your help corio corio turned to the other young men twill only take a few days of our time he told them we will right a wrong and cailin can go home again to raise her children to give honor to her dead family to live in peace as we would live he looked to his companions and when each head among them nodded in assent he turned back to wulf ironfist saying well do it get a good nights rest then my lads the saxon told them we leave in the morning then he dismissed them but corio touched his arm obviously wishing to speak further with him as the others hurried off in all different directions what is it corio i must tell you something wulf the younger man said its about my grandfather but you must keep what i reveal secret for now i agree wulf said corio did not dissemble but came right to the point the men have had a clandestine meeting as you know berikos lives in the pasta past he was not even a part of which makes it even odder as he grows older this determination of his to drive all the romans from britain grows and eats at him brigit encourages him in it we have no wish to join him in his folly but while he is our chief we must give him obedience however we have the option of replacing him with another my father eppilus has been chosen to lead the hill dobunni berikos can retire with honor and spend his days amusing himself in whatever manner he chooses when will this happen wulf ironfist asked just before beltane corio answered him we will retake cailins lands and then we will return to help the others depose my grandfather i think it a wise decision that has been made wulf said some men in power grow old and their wisdom but increases along with their age their judgment remains sound and good others however lose their sense of proportion with the passing years berikos is one of these i fear your people will never truly have peace as long as he is your ruler i understand your desire for peace i have seen enough war to last me a lifetime i will not fight again except in defense of my lands and my family there is no other reason for it i have lived my entire life here among these hills corio replied the farthest i have ever been away is to the town of corinium it is a wondrous place with its paved streets its shops and pottery works the theaters and the arena still i could not have lived there wulf it is too noisy too busy too dirty and there are i am told places even larger than corinium even here in this land they say there is a huge town in the southeast called londinium two roads from corinium lead to it if one rides far enough but i never have had the desire to follow either of those roads i have heard your stories of the battles you fought in gaul and in the rhineland they did not fill me with excitement like they did some of the lads they frightened me and celts are not supposed to fear anything like you i can see no reason for fighting except to keep ones lands and ones family from harm the majority of us feel this way and so berikos must go he will not be happy but he will have no choice but to accept the will of the dobunni brigit certainly will not be happy wulf noted you had best beware her she is a wicked woman and will not hesitate to do a bad turn to those she thinks have betrayed her or berikos you do not have to tell me about brigit corio said quietly when she first came to our hill fort as my grandfathers bride she tried to seduce me she has never forgiven me for repulsing her i am not the only man she has approached either it would be one thing if berikos offered her but he has not he is very proud of her and jealous of any man who looks her way you are right when you say she will not be happy to be a chieftains wife gives her a certain rank but to be simply the wife of an old man does not corio smiled i think i shall enjoy her discomfort and i shall not be the only person who revels in her downfall few like her she thought to do cailin a bad turn when she encouraged berikos to put her in my bed the night i first came here wulf said she knew that the dobunni ways were not cailins customs and hoped to shame and degrade her by using me as her weapon i know corio said softly had it not turned out as it did i would have strangled brigit with my own two hands wulf ironfist looked intently at the younger man for a brief moment he saw something in corios face that he had never seen there but it was quickly gone you care for cailin he said i offered to make her my wife shortly after she came here but she did not love me at least as a man she said she felt for me as she had her brothers he grinned wryly now what man in love with a girl wants to hear that he reminds her of her kin you do not remind her of her brothers i will wager do you love her i know you are good to her but one day that will not be enough for cailin she is more celt than roman she needs to be loved not simply made love to the big saxon thought carefully he had not considered loving cailin the kind of love that corio was speaking of was a luxury between men and women a man sought a wife who would be a good breeder a good helper and perhaps if he were fortunate a good friend love he turned the word over in his brain as if he could examine it did he love her he knew he wanted to be with her whenever he was not about his duties not just to make love to her but to be with her to see her smile aimed in his direction to smell her fresh fragrance to talk with and nestle with her on a chilly night he thought of the mixed feelings he had had of late when other men looked admiringly at his pregnant wife he was proud yet he was a little jealous too he considered what life would be without her and found he could not even imagine such a thing now the realization stunned him and he heard himself say to corio yes i do love her and the mad thing was that as the words rang in the springtime air he knew in his deepest heart of hearts that it was true good corio said with a smile i am glad you love her because cailin loves you corios declaration surprised wulf ironfist she does he said she has never told me so even in the heat of passion how is it you know she loves me has she said it to you he shook his head no wulf but i see it in her face each time you pass by in her eyes as they follow you about the hall in the way she smiles so proudly when you are praised in her presence these are all signs of her feelings for you but because she was so sheltered by her family she is not aware yet of what these feelings within her mean she will be one day but in the meantime you must not hide your feelings from her i told her i would not take another woman even when she and i could not love for the sake of the coming child it seemed to please her very much wulf ironfist told corio corio laughed you see he said triumphantly she is jealous and that my friend is the sure sign of a woman in love the two men walked still conversing into the hall cailin was seated by her loom weaving cloth she looked up and a welcoming smile turned her mouth up prettily wulf corio she arose are you hungry or thirsty may i get you something we leave tomorrow for your villa wulf began i am coming with you cailin said you cannot he told her this is mans work neither my fathers lands nor my cousins are defended there was never any need for that kind of defense you will meet with no resistance i promise you quintus drusus will protest but even his fatherinlaw the chief magistrate of corinium will not deny me what is rightfully mine you will not be safe wulf ironfist said unless i kill this quintus drusus remember he had no mercy upon your family i will never forget his treachery as long as i live cailin replied of course you must kill him but not in such a way that the magistrate can charge you with his murder my son must have his father and my sons mother must remain here where she will be safe wulf countered with what he thought was sound logic if i do not go with you then how will they know i am alive i want quintus to see me and know that i have come not just to reclaim what is rightfully mine but to expose his wickedness to the world you cannot ride a horse cailin corio said there is little to riding pillion behind my husband cailin replied my belly is not that big yet the child is not due until after the harvest i must be there it is my right to see justice served very well her husband answered but we leave before dawn cailin if we meet with any resistance you must get down and hide will you promise me that lambkin yes she said and then she smiled almost cruelly it will be very frightening to see a large party of armed warriors coming from the forest and across the fields it has been over a hundred years since such a thing has occurred and certainly not in the memory of anyone living hereabouts now you will strike terror into all who see you she looked at the two men does berikos know of your plans they shook their heads we will only tell him we are taking the men on a practice march wulf said he doesnt have to know any more than that no cailin agreed he does not he grows stranger as each day passes and spends all his time with brigit we only see him for meals in the early morning and at night frankly i prefer it her two companions said nothing berikoss overthrow was not cailins business it would happen soon enough it was dank and chilly as they arose in the dark of the night to dress for their departure wulf handed his wife a pair of braccos corio gave them to me to give you he said they are lined in rabbit fur and big enough for your belly cailin was delighted to have the garment she made a belt from a length of ribbon to hold up the braccos and then slipped her camisa and tunic dress on over them her boots were furlined as well and absorbed the chill from her feet even as she slid into them she ran the pearwood comb through her hair and taking up her cloak silently followed her husband outside where corio and the others were already waiting upon their own animals wulf ironfist mounted his horse then reached down and pulled cailin up behind him she put her arms about his waist and they were off there was a waning moon that gave them scant light and the forest was particularly dark but with each foot forward that they traveled the sky above them faded from pitchblack to grayblack and finally to an overcast gray as they crossed the great meadow cailin remembered from her journey to the dobunni hill fort almost a year ago birds chirped cheerily as they passed through the second wood and then over the hills that led to the home cailin had once known on the crest of the final hill they stopped and looking down cailin could see the ruins of her familys home they looked undisturbed the rubble uncleared although the surrounding fields were plowed and the trees in the orchards appeared to be wellpruned take me to the villa she said softly it is early yet and there is no one about to give the alarm wulf ironfist led his warriors down the hill they stopped before the ruined building and cailin clambered down from the horses back for a long moment she stood just staring and then she entered carefully she picked her way through the atrium stepping over the fallen timbers that lay strewn across what had once been a magnificent stone floor inlaid with mosaic designs wulf corio and several of the other men followed her reaching her parents bedchamber cailin moved into the space nothing was recognizablenothing except the bleached bones and the four skulls that lay at various angles upon the floor it is my family cailin said tears springing to her eyes he did not even have the decency to bury them with honor as the tears slipped down her face she continued see there that is my mother kyna upon the bed all burnt but for a few large bones and her skull which lies in what was once a place of loving refuge for her and there in a row lie my father and brothers my fathers skull would be the largest i imagine she knelt and touched one of the smaller skulls this is titus i can tell for one of his front teeth his chipped i hit him with a ball when i was little and did the damage i did not mean to but after that i could always tell my brothers apart and this is flavius they were so handsome and so full of life the last time i saw them she suddenly felt very old but nonetheless pulled herself to her feet let us go now when we have secured my lands we will return to bury my family with the dignity that they deserve she turned and walked back through the ruins out into the morning corio shook his head she is celt he said admiringly you breed strong women wulf ironfist replied the men rejoined cailin where does quintus drusus have his lair the saxon asked his wife i will lead you cailin answered him in a strong cold voice the slaves in the fields belonging to quintus drusus saw the armed and mounted party of dobunni coming they quailed at the terrible sight and froze where they stood the dobunni paid them no heed there was wulf assured them no true sport in killing unarmed slaves when they reached the magnificent spacious villa belonging to cailins cousin they brought their horses to a stop the slaves raking the gravel driveway had melted away before them as prearranged fifty of the men remained mounted before the villas entrance cailin wulf corio and the hundred other men entered the house unannounced whwhwhat is this you cannot enter here the majordomo cried running forward as if he might stop them we have already entered wulf ironfist said in a severe voice fetch your master immediately or would you prefer to be skewered upon my sword you fat insect this is the house of the magistrates daughter the majordomo squeaked desperately striving to do his duty if the magistrate is in residence then fetch him also wulf ordered the man and he prodded his plump midsection with the tip of his sword i am growing impatient he growled giving a small cry of horror as the sword point cut through the fabric of his tunic the majordomo turned and fled the laughter of the dobunni causing his ears to redden as he went from antioch to britain they are all alike these upper servants wulf noted pompous and filled with their own importance as they stood in silence waiting the dobunni snuck looks about the atrium for most of them had never been in so fine a house then suddenly quintus drusus entered the room from her place behind her husband cailin peeked at her cousin he had put on weight since she had last seen him and was almost fat he was still handsome however but his eyes were now openly hard and his mouth a trifle sullen how dare you enter my home unannounced and uninvited you savages he blustered at them but quintus drusus knew as he spoke the words he could not have stopped these men what do you want state your business with me if indeed you have any business with me and then get out wulf ironfist took the measure of the man before him and could see that he was soft this was no warrior just a carrion creature who allowed others to do the killing for him and then moved in to take the largest portion of the spoils the saxon moved just slightly to one side allowing cailin to step forward hail quintus drusus she said enjoying immensely his look of amazement which was quickly followed by one of fury you are dead he said nay i am very much alive cousin i have returned to claim what is rightfully mine and to see that justice is done she told him i will show you no more mercy than you showed my family what is this what is this anthony porcius entered the atrium followed by his daughter it was antonia who saw cailin first and she gasped with surprise cailin drusus how can this be you surely died in that tragic fire almost a year ago but i can see you did not where have you been and why are you wearing those dreadful clothes cailin nodded to antonia but her words were for anthony porcius chief magistrate of corinium i claim justice from you you will have it cailin drusus the magistrate answered solemnly but tell me child how is it you survived that terrible fire and why is it you have not revealed yourself until now for reasons i will never understand cailin told him the gods spared me death in the conflagration that destroyed my home i had stayed late at the beltane celebrations when i arrived back at the villa it was in flames and my grandmother brenna was collapsed outside she insisted we flee saying the danger to our lives was great we walked the rest of the night until at dawn we reached the hill fort of my grandfather berikos chieftain of the hill dobunni it was there that she told us what had happened what had happened quintus drusus demanded edgily you piece of roman filth cailin cried angrily you are an embarrassment to the name of drusus you murdered my family and you dare to play the innocent i pray the gods strike you down before me quintus drusus cailin looked again to the magistrate my cousin arranged for two gauls he owned to gain their freedom by doing his heinous bidding they gained entry to the villa killed my parents and my brothers and felled brenna with a single blow unbeknownst to them it did not kill her she lay waiting until she could make her escape she overheard these gauls bragging about how well they had carried out their masters biddingfirst by murdering his two little stepsons and making it appear as if the nursemaids had been negligent the murder of my family was to complete their service to quintus drusus they even knew where my father kept his gold and they looted it before fleeing i too was to be killed but it grew late the gauls feared exposure and execution if they did not soon flee so they fired my home and departed my grandmother escaped crawling through the flames and smoke we fled to my grandfather fearing that if my cousin learned of our survival he would seek to finish the task he had started brenna never recovered she died at samain now i have returned anthony porcius i claim what is rightfully mine as the sole surviving member of the drusus corinium family i am a married woman now and my child will be born after the harvest i want my lands back i want this murderer punished cailin concluded it was a great deal to absorb anthony porcius had never liked quintus drusus but he had swallowed his own feelings for he had not liked sextus scipio either he had assumed that as a doting father it was his nature to dislike antonias husbands he realized now that perhaps he had been right all along and his daughter was incapable of choosing a good man now cailin was accusing her cousin of not only the murder of her family but of his two little grandsons as well it was horrifying but in his heart of hearts he believed it to be true quintus was a cold hard man still anthony porcius was a chief magistrate everything he did must be done exactly according to the letter of the law he drew a deep breath i can of course return the land to you cailin drusus it is indeed yours by right of inheritance and you have a husband to work and protect it as for your accusations against quintus drusus what proof can you give me other than this story your grandmother told cailin looked bleakly at him and said once my mother told me that before she married my father while she was living with my grandparents in corinium you fell in love with her she however loved my father but when she turned you away it was with gentleness for she respected you if there is any pity in your heart anthony porcius help me avenge her death do you know what my cousins gauls did to her they raped and beat her until they killed her my grandmother said her last glimpse of her daughter was her bloodied and battered face and body she was once a very beautiful woman this murderer that your daughter has wed has not even had the kindness to bury her bones or those of the rest of my family they lie where they were killed while quintus drusus tills our fields with our slaves is this the roman justice of our ancestors the magistrate looked as if he would cry she was telling the truth in his very heart and soul the part of him that was celtic knew it but he could not help her the law cailin drusus requires proof you have no proof but the words of a dying old woman it is not enough i would help you if i could but i cannot there is no proof cailin burst into tears have i survived everything and come to you for justice only to be denied must i live the rest of my days knowing that quintus drusus continues on in comfort when my family is dead and gone she wiped her tears away with the heel of her palm and then her moment of weakness passed she looked at her cousin you know what you did quintus drusus do not rest easy feeling that you have escaped punishment if you are wise you will never close your eyes in sleep again i will see you punished if it is the last thing i ever do you murderer you have gone mad or else your natural grief has addled your wits cailin my dear quintus said in a bored and superior tone he hated losing his cousins lands after all his hard work but he would correct that he just needed time and since his fatherinlaw maintained that a lack of hard evidence made it impossible to prosecute him he would have that time well antonia said now that is settled may i offer you wine she smiled brightly as if she had heard nothing of what had transpired nothing is settled until your husband pays for his crimes cailin said coldly by the gods antonia do you not realize what quintus has done not just to me but to you as well quintus is a good husband to me cailin antonia said primly quintus is a heartless bastard cailin snapped before he murdered my family he had his gauls murder the sons you birthed by sextus scipio they were innocent children my sons drowned in the atrium pond because their licentious nursemaids were negligent antonia replied but her voice quavered with the secret doubts she had always harbored about the incident your husbands gauls throttled your children in their beds and then placed their lifeless bodies in the atrium pool cailin told the woman bluntly cruelly it isnt true antonia began to sob it is true cailin said harshly does it hurt you to know what quintus did perhaps then you will understand some of what i feel antonia quintus tell me it isnt so antonia wept tell me yes cousin cailin mocked him tell her the truth if indeed you even know how to tell it have you ever told the truth in your whole life tell your wife the mother of your only son that you did not arrange to have her sons from her first marriage disposed of and then tell her that you did not have those same gauls murder my family in order that you would inherit my fathers lands tell her quintus tell her the truth if you darebut you do not do you you are a coward quintus drususs face was contorted with terrifying fury and you are a bitch cailin drusus he hissed at her who among the gods hates me so that he protected you from death that night when i had arranged for everything to be ended so neatly cailin threw herself at her cousin and raked her nails down his handsome face i will kill you myself she screamed at him teeth bared quintus drusus raised his hands to strike out at her but suddenly his arms were grasped and pinioned hard behind him panic rose in his chest as he saw the huge saxon warrior push cailin firmly behind him quintus drusus knew from the look upon the mans face that he was going to die noooooo he howled struggling desperately to free himself from the iron grip holding him wulf ironfist slid his sword from its sheath it was a twoedged blade thirtythree inches in length made of finely forged steel with an almost round point grasping the weapon firmly by its pommel the saxon thrust it straight into quintus drususs heart twisting the blade just slightly in order to sever the arteries his blue eyes never left those of his panicked victim his look was pitiless the undisguised terror he saw in return was small payment for all the misery and heartache quintus drusus had caused those about him especially cailin when life had fled the romans eyes wulf pulled his blade from the dead mans chest and wiped it clean on quintuss toga corio then allowed the body to fall to the floor the saxon looked challengingly at the magistrate but anthony porcius said smoothly he condemned himself with his own words he put a comforting arm about his daughter wait here he told them and then he led antonia from the atrium a realistic man corio noted dryly he was always practical cailin told him my father said for all his girth anthony porcius had to be lighter than thistledown for he could blow in any direction with any wind just like a duck feather she looked down at the lifeless body of her cousin i am glad he is dead im just sorry he did not suffer like my mother did your mother is with the gods corio told her this roman is not i am certain he looked to wulf i think the men can wait outside now there is no danger here dismiss them wulf ironfist said and then he told his wife come and sit down lambkin it has been a long morning for a woman in your condition are you tired would you like something to drink i am all right wulf she told him do i look like some delicate creature who must be pampered but she sat nonetheless on a small marble bench by the atrium pool it was empty of water now anthony porcius came back into the atrium i have given my daughter into the keeping of her women he said she is unfortunately with child again he sat down next to cailin my dear what can i say that would possibly ease your suffering he shook his head wearily you never liked him i know i did not either but i thought i was a foolish old man jealous of his only childs husband well he is dead now and will not harm you or antonia again what is past is past when i return to corinium i will see your survival is made known and i will have your lands legally restored your familys slaves and other goods of course will be returned where will you live the villa is in ruins the dobunni warriors with us will help to raise a hall for us we will bury my family with honor then clear away the rubble and begin there is nothing salvageable we will have to start from the beginning just like my ancestor the first drusus corinium did cailin said the big saxon is your husband anthony porcius asked curiously yes we were wed five months ago she told him and then seeing the worry in his face she continued it was my choice anthony porcius celts do not force their children into marriage i know he rejoined for all my roman name cailin drusus i am every bit as much a celt as you i am a briton she told him i am a briton and britain is my land i will not take sides against one part or the other of myself i am proud of my ancestry of its history i honor the old customs when i can honor them but i am a briton not a roman not a celt my husband wulf ironfist is a saxon but our children will be as i am they will be britons i will teach them my history and wulf will teach them his but they will be britons we must all be britons now if we are to survive this dark destiny before us anthony porcius everything as we knew it has changed or is changing it is a hard world in which we live yes my child it is he agreed he arose and drew her up with him go now cailin drusus go with your strong young husband and make this new beginning in time the horror of today will fade my grandchildren will play with your children and there will be peace between us then as there has always been between our families he kissed her brow tenderly and then put her hand into wulfs may the gods be with you both he told them together they walked from the atrium of the villa corio in their wake a new beginning said wulf ironfist i like the sound of it yes cailin agreed and she smiled up at both men a new beginning for us all for britain and for the britons chapter true to his word anthony porcius returned to corinium and removed cailins name from the list of the dead restoring her property to her legally he then closed up his own house in the town and made his way back to his daughters home instinct told him that she would need a mans presence in her household she had no other family besides him he knew her grief would be deep for she had truly loved quintus drusus and had refused to acknowledge his faults to his great surprise anthony porcius did not find his daughter prostrate with grief he instead found her embittered and angry worse she had become overdoting of her little son quintus the younger antonia had loved all of her children but had never bothered a great deal with them preferring to leave them to the servants a practice her father abhorred but could do nothing about now suddenly she could barely stand to have her son out of her sight you must not allow him his way in everything my daughter anthony porcius chided her the afternoon of his return little quintus had just thrown a tantrum and having calmed her son antonia then rewarded him with a new toy he is alone in the world but for us father she answered angrily thanks to cailin drusus my little quintus and the son i carry in my womb are fatherless i must be both father and mother to my babies now all because of cailin drusus antonia my dearest her father reasoned you must face the truth you cannot live with a heart that is filled to overflowing with bitter vetch cailin drusus is not responsible for your husbands death did you comprehend nothing that was said the day he died quintus drusus had cailins family murdered and then burned their villa to cover his crime in order that he might have their lands for himself he admitted it why will you not understand i will not believe it antonia said stubbornly why would cailin make up such a story antonia her father persisted what purpose would she have in doing so if it were not true then why did she and brenna flee to berikos if the fire had been an accident why not simply say she escaped it perhaps because she killed her family father did you ever consider that possibility no of course not antonia cried antonia he was horrified by her words for they were totally irrational what reason would cailin have for doing such a thing the grieving widow looked bleakly at him in silence antonia her father continued how can you mourn a man who saw to the murder of your own two sons it isnt true antonia shrieked it cannot be true it horrifies me as well as it does you but there is a certain logic to it antonia was quintus drusus such a gentle and perfect man that there was never a time when you were afraid of him there was one time antonia said low just after lucius and paulus were found dead when our son was but a day old i was filled with grief but quintus grew hard with me for he feared my bereavement might impede the flow of my milk he became very angry with me father he said his son must be nursed by his mother not some distressed slave woman i was afraid of him in that moment but it passed so that was why antonia suckled her youngest son anthony porcius thought she had never nursed the elder boys he could not have killed my sons antonia protested further he loved them besides the two nursemaids were found in the most lewd and compromising of positions reeking of wine had these women ever been found drunk or judged guilty of lascivious behavior before my daughter i remember them both they were faithful women and loved my grandsons you chose each of them carefully yourself after lucius and paulus were born antonia they nursed those boys devotedly yet before they might even defend themselves they were adjudged guilty and strangled who did this it was quintus antonia said quintus her father replied softly ah yes quintus i find that interesting my dear the household slaves are your province antonia should he not have waited for your decision in the matter perhaps he did not because he knew if he had those poor women would have implicated his murderous gauls and they in turn to save their own skins would have implicated quintus drusus my reasoning is sound i believe antonia stubbornly shook her head it is cailins fault how is it cailins fault antonia how he demanded oh father do you not see if cailin drusus had not come back none of this could have happened quintus would be alive this very minute and my sons would have their father but she returned with her accusations and then her husband killed mine what of your two elder sons and what of the drusus family the magistrate said all brutally slain the villa burned the drusus familys bones left to bleach in the wind and rain have you no pity for anyone but yourself antonia the gods i am ashamed of you i did not raise you to be so selfish anthony porcius turned away from his daughter angry and disappointed am i selfish to have loved my husband father if that is so then i do not care what you think of me quintus drusus was the man i loved and cailin took him from me i care for nothing else if i am wrong then what matter i am condemned to live the rest of my days without my love my children are sentenced to grow up without their father and for these and other crimes i hold cailin drusus responsible i hate her i only hope she someday knows the pain and suffering she has inflicted upon me i hate her i will never forgive her it is not fair father that she now have the handsomest man in the province for a husband instead of me she has taken quintus drusus from me and she has that magnificent saxon to comfort her i have no one to comfort me his daughters unbalanced thinking disturbed anthony porcius greatly he could understand her anger somewhat but this sudden irrational envy of cailins husband made him very uncomfortable perhaps he considered with time antonia would learn to accept the reality of what had happened she would come to terms with herself and everything would be all right quintus drusus was newly dead anthony porcius knew his daughter she would grieve dramatically for a time and then another handsome man would catch her eye and quintus drusus would be forgotten it had always been that way with antonia when she lost a man another soon took his place after spending several days with his daughter the magistrate took his horse and rode across the fields to the drusus corinium estate the rubble of the burned villa had been cleared away and a timber and stone hall was being raised over the marble floor that ran from the entry through the atrium and into the dining room of the old building the wings of the villa where the sleeping chambers baths and kitchen had been located were not to be restored it would be a far simpler and more practical lifestyle that cailin would have to accustom herself to anthony porcius realized and he sighed all over britain others were being forced to do the same thing in order to survive the age of gracious living as embodied by the elegance and the lavish lifestyles of their roman ancestors had drawn to a close in order to continue on people would have to learn to make do although he realized some would make do better than others he smiled to himself it was not really so bad cailin and wulf had good lands each other and the hope of many children in the end when all else was stripped away that was what was important the young couple greeted him politely they showed him the new graves of cailins family a marble cutter had been sent for from corinium and would make a memorial to the family using marble from the villas wings the new hall would not be a great one to begin with but eventually wulf told their guest they would build a larger and far grander hall even so there would be a room called a solar located above part of the main hall that would offer them some privacy the fire pits would be lined in brick the roof expertly thatched with neatly woven tight smoke holes i have been able to salvage some items from the old kitchen cailin told the magistrate proudly the pots and the samianware did not burn with cleaning i believe they will be usable again but what will you do for other household items and furnishings he asked her perhaps antonia has some things she does not need and would send them over to you he said doubtfully i want nothing from your daughter cailin said proudly the dobunni will give us what we need berikos owes me my dower rights and ceara will see he gives them to me and i am capable of carpentry for all my military calling wulf joined in then too there will be some among our slaves who are capable of like tasks it will simply take time and time is the one commodity with which we are most generously blessed anthony porcius you will not be able to do much more with the hall until the harvest is in the older man replied the coming summer months you must spend attending to your fields which are already planted and greening your harvest will be your most important asset you will need a barn or two i agree wulf said but there will be those who cannot work in the fields and there will be rainy days when the fields cannot be worked we will manage to finish what must be finished before winter they returned to berikoss hill fort for beltane and the wedding of nuala and bodvoc eppilus was already chieftain of the hill dobunni it had not however been necessary to depose berikos he had been spared that indignity several days after cailin wulf and his men had departed to revenge her family her grandfather had suffered a series of seizures that left the old man paralyzed from the waist down his speech was also affected only ceara and maeve could really understand what he was trying to communicate consequently the dobunni men had not had to remove him from his high office a physically impaired man could not rule his fellow men as far as everyone was concerned the gods had taken care of the matter and berikos had been retired albeit forcibly with honor the old man however was still filled with venom most of which was now directed at brigit she has left him ceara told cailin in a rather satisfied tone no sooner had his condition been ascertained and the fact that he would not recover fully made known than she was gone ceara smiled grimly she took her serving women her jewelry and everything else of value he had lavished upon her we awoke one morning and she had vanished along with a foolish halfgrown boy who shall remain nameless the lad came back his tail between his legs several days later brigit had returned to her catuvellauni kin and immediately took herself a new husband we did not tell berikos that there is no need to add to his pain i can almost feel sorry for him cailin said but then i remember that he disowned my mother and that he was so unkind to my grandmother when we came to him for aid i cannot forget that he forced me to wulfs bed when he knew was a virgin and unused to such behavior but you are happy with wulf are you not ceara asked her yes but what if wulf had not been the kind of man he is ceara nodded yes you have a just grievance but try to forgive him cailin he is a foolish stubborn old man he cannot change but you my child can he did love your mother and i suspect he loves you as well for you are kynas daughter though he is too proud to say it he sees too much of brenna in me cailin said softly and he will never forgive me for it he does not see my mother when he looks at me he hears brenna speaking out of my mouth she smiled i will try though for your sake ceara you have been good to me nuala and bodvoc were wed during the festive celebration of beltane the brides belly had already grown quite round and while bodvoc was congratulated nuala was roundly teased but she did not mind perhaps we shall leave here and settle near you and wulf nuala said to her cousin leave the dobunni cailin was surprised by nualas words celtic life was a communal life of kin and good friends she was startled to think that nuala and bodvoc would give all that up why not nuala replied times are changing for us all life is too constricted here for bodvoc and for me there is no opportunity to do anything except what has always been done we love our families but we think perhaps we should like to be a little bit away from them you and wulf have no one but each other if we came and lived by you you would have us and we would be near enough to the dobunni villages to have the rest of our family available when we wanted to visit or if they needed us or we them there is more than enough land for us isnt there cailin nodded when anthony porcius returned my fathers lands to me he included the river villa that had been given to quintus drusus when he came from rome you and bodvoc could have that land wulf and i will give it to you as a wedding present you will have to build your own hall but the lands are fertile wellwatered and there is a fine orchard nuala it would be good to have you near our children will grow up together nuala said with a smile cailin found her husband and told him what she had done good he said with a smile bodvoc will be a good man to have as a neighbor well help him to build his home so that by the time their child comes they will have a place of their own with the sunset the beltane fires sprang to life and the feasting drinking and dancing continued during the day cailin had been absorbed with her relatives and the wedding but now a deep sadness came upon her just a year ago her family had been murdered she wandered among the revelers and then suddenly found herself by berikos well she thought now is as good a time as any to try to make peace with this old reprobate he was seated on a bench with a back she sat down upon the ground by his side once she began my mother told me of how when she was a little girl no one could leap higher across the beltane fires than you could berikos i think it was the only time i ever heard her speak of you i believe she missed you especially at this time of year i am not like her am i well i cannot be anyone but who i am surprised she felt the old mans hand fall heavily upon her head and turning she looked up at him a single tear was sliding down his worn face for a brief moment cailin felt her anger rising the old man had no right to do this to her after all his unkindness and crueltynot just to her but to brenna and to kyna then something inside her popped and she felt her anger draining away she smiled wryly at him were alike berikos arent we it isnt just brenna that makes me who i am it is you as well we are quick with our tongues and have a surfeit of pride to boot she patted her rounded belly the gods only know what this greatgrandchild of yours will be like he half wheezed half cackled at her remark guud he said good she answered him and he nodded vigorously a chuckling noise coming from his throat you think so do you well we shall see after lughs feast if you are right cailin replied with a small smile before cailin and wulf departed the next morning ceara came to her and said you have made berikos very happy my child your mother would be proud of you and of what you have done i think it has helped him to make peace with himself and with kyna cailin nodded why not she said last night the doors between the worlds were open perhaps not as widely as at samain but open nonetheless i felt my mother would want me to be generous toward berikos it is strange is it not ceara just a few weeks ago berikos was strong and vital the lord of his world now he is naught but a weak and sad old man how quickly the gods render their judgment when they decide that the time has come for it life is fragile my child and appallingly swift as you will soon find one day you are filled with the juices of fiery youth and nothing is impossible then just as suddenly you are a driedup old husk with the same desires but no will left to accomplish the impossible she laughed you have a little time yet i think go with your man now send for me when the child is due maeve and i will come to help you cailin took the time to stop by the bench where her grandfather sat in the sunshine of the may morning she bent to kiss his white head and taking his hand in hers gave it a squeeze farewell grandfather she said quietly i will bring you the child after it is birthed she and wulf returned to their own home and cailin finding more strength in herself than she would have thought helped to seal the walls of the new barn with mud daub and wattle while wulf worked in their fields with the servants it was a good summer neither too dry nor too wet in the orchards the fruit grew round and hung heavy upon the boughs of the trees the grain ripened slowly while the hay was cut dried and finally stored in the barns for the coming winter the cattle grew fat their herds having increased quite sizably that spring with the birth of many calves in the meadows the sheep had multiplied too and shearing time was drawing near cailin sitting outside the hall one warm day looked across the shimmering fields contentedly for a moment it appeared as if nothing had changed and yet everything had changed it was a different time and she was beginning to sense it most strongly one evening she and wulf lay upon their backs on the hillside looking up at the stars why do you never mention your family she asked him i am to bear your child yet i know nothing of you you are my family he said taking her hand in his no she persisted what of your parents did you have brothers and sisters what has happened to them are they in britain my father died before i was born he told her my mother died when i was just past two i remember neither of them they were young and i was their only child but who raised you she said she was sorry he had no close relatives but on the other hand it meant that he was all hers kin raised me in my village along a river in germania i was passed from one relation to another like a lovable but unwanted animal they were not unkind mind you but life was hard no one really needed another mouth to feed i left them when i was thirteen and joined the legions i have never been back this is my land now my home you and our child are my family cailin until i found you i was alone until you found me she told him i was alone too the gods have been kind to us wulf aye he agreed and looking up they saw a falling star blazing its way across the heavens a slavecamefrom anthony porcius one day with a message antonia had gone into labor and the magistrate was at a loss he wrote that antonias women seemed helpless although they should not be cailin thought he begged that cailin come to the villa to aid them wulf ironfist was not happy about it but cailin did not think in light of the magistrates kindness to them that she could refuse we will pad the cart out and i will travel in complete comfort she told her husband our child is not due for another few weeks even if we go slowly i can be there by days end anthony porcius was grateful when cailin arrived antonia was still in labor and was having great difficulty she sent all the women who had always been with her away after quintuss death and replaced them with a group of fluttery girls i do not understand why he told cailin answering her unspoken question it probably had something to do with making a new start cailin suggested perhaps the other women who were with her when she was married to sextus scipio and to my cousin made her sad they were only reminders of all she had lost of better times now gone perhaps you are right cailin drusus he answered you have asked me to come and i came cailin replied but how will antonia feel about my presence i will help her of course but i am no expert why did she have no midwife among her staff he shrugged helplessly i do not know i have never birthed a child before anthony porcius but i know what must be done antonia will be able to help me for this is her fourth child take me to her when they reached antonias quarters they found her alone her maidens having fled glimpsing her fathers companion antonias blue eyes flashed angrily for a moment but hiding her ire she said why have you come cailin drusus your father called me to help you though the truth is you know more about birthing a child than i do still i will do what i can antonia your young women seem very helpless antonia whimpered as a contraction tore through her but she nodded you were good to come she answered grudgingly the child who came shortly afterward was born dead the cord wrapped about its little neck it was a boy and quite blue in color cailin wept openly with sadness at antonias misfortune though she had detested her cousin quintus she knew that antonia had loved him greatly loving wulf as she did cailin could but imagine antonias deep sadness at losing the posthumous son of quintus drusus antonia however was dryeyed it is better she said fatalistically my poor little marius is now with the gods with his father she sighed dramatically quintus is hardly with the gods cailin thought sourly as anthony porcius attempted to comfort his daughter i will stay the night and return home on the morrow cailin told them wincing just slightly as she felt a mild cramp in her belly she started nervously what is it antonia sharpeyed demanded just a twinge cailin told her with more selfassurance than she was actually feeling she hated being here and the morning could not come quickly enough for her do not leave me so quickly cailin drusus antonia pleaded stay with me a few days at least until my initial sorrow is past you are no use to that handsome husband of yours in your present condition bide with me a little bit i will wager you would enjoy soaking in my baths you have no such amenities in your hall i believe cailin considered antonias tempting offer she really wanted to go home frankly antonia made her uncomfortable now if she had any real sorrow over the loss of her poor little son there was none that cailin could see what kind of a woman was she still her pleading tone seemed genuine and the offer of the baths was an enticing one cailin did not mind the more primitive life she was living except for one thing she really did miss the baths with their hypocaust heating system that had been in her familys old villa it had been well over a year since she had had the luxury of a long hot soak it would be nice to remain for a short while to indulge this familiar luxury well she said ill stay antonia but only for two or three days then she wrapped the tiny corpse in a swaddling cloth and removed it for proper burial sending antonias silly maidens back in to attend to their mistresss needs their mistress hardly noticed them she was too busy plotting she had seen the spasm that had crossed cailins face was it possible the girl was going into an early labor or perhaps she had miscalculated the time of her childs arrival antonia porcius knew she would never again have such an opportunity for revenge and she wanted that revenge badly if cailin would deliver her child here alone and without her saxon husband then both wulf ironfists wife and child would be at her mercy oh quintus she thought help me to avenge your unjust death at the hands of that barbarian let me make him suffer as i have suffered why should he be happy when i am not you are very good to stay with antonia anthony porcius said to cailin that evening as they shared a meal this tragedy could not have come at a worse time for me i have found a buyer for my house in corinium i mean to remain here with antonia as she is widowed there are few young men about now and she may not have the opportunity to marry again my grandson will need a mans influence if antonia does remarry one day no good soninlaw would refuse me my place in this house and though she will not admit it i think my daughter needs me you need to travel to corinium shortly cailin guessed yes i do my dear i have let my home run down a bit in the years since antonia first married sextus scipio i was alone and it really didnt matter to me then now however i must make several repairs before the new owners will agree to my price they wish to take possession as soon as possible i am lucky to have found buyers at all in these hard times i plan to oversee the work personally so i will have to be away for several weeks i know you cannot stay with antonia all that time but if you will visit with her for just the next few days it will help her to overcome her sorrow he smiled fondly seeing his daughter as no one else certainly did she indulges little quintus far too much he confided and without me there is no discipline at all two days three at the most cailin told him but no more my child must be born in his fathers hall my grandfathers wives ceara and maeve are coming to midwife me i can stay but a short time and then i must go home anthony porcius you do understand he nodded i will ask no more of you than two days cailin drusus and i thank you for your kindness to my child she has not always been kind to you i know but surely you are her dearest friend anthony porcius departed the following morning for corinium watching him go antonia felt relief it would have been far too difficult to execute her plans if her father had remained oh yes the gods were certainly on her side in this matter and her pleasure increased threefold knowing that they approved her revenge in a way she was to be their instrument of retribution against cailin drusus and her husband cailin found herself quickly bored even when her parents were alive and she had lived a life similar to antonias she had never been as idle as this woman seemed to be antonia had seemingly recovered from the ordeal of childbed instantly she spent her time fussing over quintus the younger and beautifying herself the tinkling vapid girls who surrounded her did naught but giggle cailin knew from her conversations with anthony porcius that his daughter had been devastated and embittered by her husbands death yet here was antonia freshly widowed her newborn dead behaving as if nothing at all was amiss in her little world and acting gracious to the wife of her husbands executioner cailin found herself growing more and more uncomfortable why in the name of all the gods had she agreed to keep this woman company even for just a couple of days worse she could not seem to escape antonia who seemed to be everywhere she went and always chattering chattering chattering about nothing the longer cailin remained with antonia the more her voice within nagged at her particularly when her hostess brightly informed her i sent a messenger to wulf ironfist this morning telling him to fetch you in three days how kind of you to think of it cailin replied wondering why she had not thought of it herself being here must be addling her wits well at least this day was almost done the evening meal was a particular trial antonia had always loved good food and good wine which certainly accounted for her plumpness she pressed dish after dish upon her guest piling her own plate high with fish in a creamy sauce game eggs cheese and bread she fussed at cailin for not eating enough you will offend my cook she said i am not particularly hungry cailin replied nibbling at some fruit and a bit of bread and cheese her stomach was in knots are you all right antonia inquired solicitously just a bit of a queasy belly cailin admitted reluctantly the little fool was in labor she was in labor and she did not know it antonia thought triumphantly of course she wouldnt know it she had never borne a child before but antonia was certain of it wine is good for an upset in your condition she counseled and she poured cailin a large gobletful this is my favorite cyprian vintage and you will feel much better after you have drunk it take a bit of bread to cleanse your palate she instructed and while cailin was thus diverted antonia flipped the catch on a large catseye beryl ring she wore and slipped a pinch of power from the secret compartment into the wine where it dissolved instantly she held out the goblet to the girl drink it up now cailin and you will soon feel better cailin sipped slowly at the wine while she watched the halffull dishes of food being returned to the kitchens no one she thought could eat all that food such a waste when so many are going hungry then she gasped as a hard pain tore through her you arc in labor antonia said calmly of course she was in labor if her earlier pains had been but false labor the drugged wine had ensured the onset of the childs birth send for my husband cailin said trying to keep the fear from her voice i want wulf here for his childs birth oh the gods why had she promised to remain here for even a day of course you want wulf here by your side antonia cooed i remember when i bore my darling son how very much it meant to me to have my quintus with me i will send a slave for wulf do not fear dear cailin i will take good care of you she helped cailin into her bedchamber leaving her maidens with cailin antonia sent for a young male slave she had intended to make her lover it was unfortunate she thought but she would have to kill him for his part in this matter and she would not even get to enjoy him for a night go to simon the slave merchant in corinium he sends consignments to londinium monthly and will be dispatching a caravan shortly say i have a female slave i wish to rid myself of and he must send someone tomorrow to fetch her she is a troublesome creature and a liar she must be kept drugged until she reaches gaul i want her sent as far from britain as possible do you understand my handsome atticus antonia smiled up into the young mans face while caressing his buttocks suggestively yes mistress he answered her returning the smile he was new in the household but he had heard she was a lusty woman she would certainly have no complaints over his performance when she was healed from her childbirth and ready to take a lover tell piso to give you the fastest horse in the stable antonia instructed him i want you back by dawn if you are not i shall whip you her hand moved about to fondle his hardening manhood you are wellmade she noted did i buy you atticus i do not remember your father bought me mistress he replied with more aplomb than he was feeling he was as hard as iron within her hot hand we shall have to find a suitable position for you shortly antonia remarked thinking that perhaps she would not kill him immediately after all he would not understand what she had done now go she turned away from the slave and hurried back to her patient allthroughthenightcailin struggled to birth her baby her body was wet with perspiration she strained under antonias direction to bring forth the child where is wulf cailin repeated over and over again to the older woman why does he not come it is dark antonia told her there is no moon my messenger must go slowly over the fields to reach your hall it is not as if he could simply gallop easily down the fosse way from my home to yours cailin he must pick his way carefully he will get there but then he and your husband must come back just as slowly here she put her arm about cailins shoulders drink some of my cyprian wine you will feel better for it i always do i dont want it cailin cried pushing antonias hand away do not be such a silly goose antonia told her i have put some herbs in it that will ease your pain i take them myself when i am in the throes of having a child i see no reason to suffer cailin reached out and taking the goblet from antonia drank it slowly down she immediately felt better but her head was also spinning another pain tore through her and she cried out antonia knelt and examined her progress she began to smile and hum to herself can you see the babys head cailin asked her ohh i wish ceara and maeve were here with me i need them they could do nothing for you that i cannot antonia replied sharply then her tone softened a bit i can see the babys head be brave cailin drusus just a few more minutes and your child will be born the gods cailin groaned where is wulf antonia i am very dizzy what exactly did you put in that wine another pain came antonia ignored cailins questions push she commanded the straining girl push hard harder the infants head and shoulders appeared between its mothers legs antonia smiled wellpleased cailin did not realize it but she was having an easy labor the baby would be born in just another moment cailin was having difficulty keeping her eyes open her head was whirling violently and she felt as if she were beginning to fall another terrible pain washed over her she heard if somewhat distantly antonias voice demanding she push again cailin struggled to obey she couldnt allow herself to become unconscious making a supreme effort she pushed with all her might she was rewarded by the sudden cry of a newborn baby and her heart accelerated with excitement and joy then as suddenly the darkness rushed up to claim her she fought valiantly against it but it was no use the last thing she remembered was antonia saying she is so sweet i have always wanted a little girl and then cailin remembered no more when wulf ironfist arrived to reclaim his wife two days later antonia came slowly into the atrium to greet him she was crying the tears sliding down her fair skin what is it he asked a sinking feeling overcoming him even as he put forth the question antonia sobbed and threw herself into his startled embrace cailin she wept piteously cailin is dead and the childyour sonwith her i could not save them i tried i swear i tried how he said stunned how could this happen antonia she was healthy and well when i saw her last antonia stepped from the shelter of his arms and looking up at him with her wide blue eyes said your son was large he was not properly positioned a child is born head first but this boy came feet first he tore poor cailin almost in two her suffering was a terrible thing to behold she bled to death the child so long in birthing did not survive her by more than an hour i never imagined such a thing could happen i am sorry wulf ironfist where is her body he demanded his voice was hard and cold cailin his beloved lambkin dead it could not be it could not be he would not believe it i want to see my wifes body he repeated the pain in his chest was fierce could a heart break in two he wondered for he believed that it was happening to him now she was so torn apart antonia explained that we could not prepare her properly for burial i had her cremated the way our celtic ancestors used to cremate their dead i put the baby in her arms so that they would reach the gods together he nodded numb with grief i want her ashes he said stonily surely you have her ashes i will take her home and bury her on her land with the rest of her family cailin would want that of course antonia agreed softly and turning about she picked up a prettily decorated polished bronze urn from the atrium bench cailins ashes and those of your son are within this vessel wulf ironfist she handed it to him with a sympathetic smile i understand your grief having just recently lost both a mate and a child myself she said he took the urn from her almost reluctantly as if he could still not believe what she had told him then he turned wordlessly away from her and started for the door antonia silently exulted in his pain then a wicked thought came to her and she acted impulsively upon it wulf her voice was suddenly seductive he turned back to her and was shocked to see that she had removed her robe and was stark naked she was all pink and white and plump there was not a mark upon her to spoil the perfection of her smooth skin he found her appallingly repulsive for a moment he was rooted to the spot where he stood staring at her repugnant nudity i am lonely wulf ironfist antonia said softly so lonely lady put your robe back on he said you killed my husband wulf ironfist now i am lonely do you not think you should compensate me for the loss of quintus drusus antonia purred to her horrified audience she slipped her hands beneath her large breasts with their deep rose nipples and lifted them as if she were offering them to him are you not tempted to sample these fine fruits wulf ironfist is that weapon beneath your braccos not already hard with your longing for me clothe yourself lady he said coldly you disgust me she launched herself at him her naked body pressing against him he was overpowered by the scent of musk you are the handsomest man in the province wulf ironfist she said panting with desire i always have the handsomest man in the province for my mate her arms slipped tightly about his neck kiss me you saxon brute and then you must take me here where we stand on the floor of the atrium stuff me with your manhood and make me scream with pleasure i am so hot for you wulf took her arms from him and thrust her away he felt near to vomiting lady your grief has made you mad first your husband and child and then my wife and son i am sorry for you but i must master my own grief it is already tearing me apart i loved my wife i do not know how i will go on without her what is left for me nothing nothing he turned and stumbled from the atrium go antonia shrieked after him go wulf ironfist if you are in pain i am glad now you will know how i felt when you butchered my quintus may the sorrow eat your heart out i will be glad of it bending down she picked up her robe and slipped it back on i wish i could have told you the truth wulf ironfist she said softly to herself but i could not then my father would find out and i cannot have that she laughed still i have had my revenge upon you and cailin drusus if no one knows but me what difference will it make when anthony porcius returned from corinium several weeks later his daughter was prepared and waiting they sat together in the midautumn air of her garden while antonia nursed the infant at her breast i was shocked father she said he didnt want her he was ready to expose her on the hillside had i not begged him for the child all that mattered to him was that cailin had not given him the son he wanted these saxons are cruel people father fortunately little quintus was ready to be weaned and my milk is rich so i decided to take the baby and raise her with my son it almost makes up for having lost my own baby poor cailin where is wulf ironfist now the magistrate asked he has disappeared antonia replied no one knows where he has gone he made no provision for his slaves he simply left the land of course now belongs to my little aurora i call her that because she was born with the dawn even as her mother died i sent my majordomo to drive off those dobunni who had begun to build a hall at the river villa they said that cailin had given them the land for a wedding gift but i told them it was mine by right of inheritance and that cailin was dead in childbirth and not here to enforce their supposed rights they did not give me much difficulty and are now gone anthony porcius nodded it was all so much to take in he thought but one good thing had come of it antonia seemed to be her old self again taking in the orphaned daughter of cailin drusus had obviously been good for her you will stay here with us father wont you antonia said i do need you so very much i shall not marry again but will devote my life to my two children it is i feel what the gods desire of me perhaps you are right he said reaching out and taking her hand in his we will be a happy family antonia i know it in my heart byzantium ad chapter i donotbelieveitphocas maxima said surprised this cannot be the same girl you purchased in the market this morning jovian that creature was a filthy soreridden horror this girl is lovely her skin is like cream there isnt a mark on her and that hair the rich auburn color those marvelous little curls they are one and the same brother dear jovian maxima said in smug tones you are a true businessman you have absolutely no imagination phocas the moment i laid eyes upon the girl i knew she was a treasure all it took was hot water and soap to clean her up not only that her latin is flawless but for a slight provincial accent which can be correctedalthough some may find it most charming he looked to the slave girl who accompanied his new purchase isis remove her tunica please phocas maxima stared hard at the girl when she finally stood nude before him shes a bit slender for my taste he noted but we can fatten her up i dont imagine shes been getting a great deal to eat recently her feet looked dreadfully roughened shes done a lot of walking i would imagine jovian replied we can eventually correct it his brother said her breasts are very nice small but wellformed well i must admit it you did get us quite a good bargain in this girl does she understand what is expected of her or are we going to have to train her she is pagan i hope it was as if she did not exist except as an object cailin thought as she listened to the two brothers chattering back and forth about her and her eventual fate not that it really mattered nothing mattered anymore it was all so confusing she didnt even understand why she was still alive when all she wanted was to be dead but something inside her would not allow her to die it made her angry but there was naught she seemed to be able to do about it she thought back over the many days that had passed since she had iain in labor at antonias villa the last thing she remembered was the cry of a baby as she sank into unconsciousness when she came vaguely to her senses she was in a dirty room in a strange house the woman who brought her food told her she was in londinium which amazed cailin she had heard of londinium but had never thought to see it in her lifetime as it turned out she did not see it for when she asked what she was doing in this place she was told that the lady antonia had sold her to simon the slave merchant and that shortly she would be transported to gaul and beyond but i am no slave cailin protested that is what the lady antonia said you would say the woman replied sourly she says youre real troublesome and have ideas above your station girl why you even seduced her late husband and bore his bastard well shell have no more of you wench where is my baby cailin demanded the brat died im told was the cold reply cailin began to weep hysterically i do not believe you she protested before she knew it a bitter liquid was being forced down her throat and she was sliding into darkness again for days afterward she drifted between reality and nightmare when she finally was allowed to come to herself again she was in gaul traveling south with a shipment of other slaves down the backbone of the land toward the mediterranean sea not long after one particular beautiful young woman attempted to escape for unlike many of the slaves traveling with them she wore no collar nor was she chained she was quickly recaptured being unfamiliar with the land the slave master debated on her punishment to beat her would mark her fair skin and that same fair skin was an asset that could bring him a pretty penny for the girl he elected to make his point by raping her which he did before the entire party of travelers run again bitch he threatened as he jammed himself into her and ill give you to my men perhaps youd like that wench eh the look of terror on all the womens faces told the slave master that he would have no more difficulty with any of them indeed after that cailin went out of her way to make herself invisible she allowed her hair to go unwashed and uncombed her tunica which was the only garment she possessed grew more worn with each passing day she did not dare wash it for fear that it would disintegrate and leave her naked like some of the other women she did not expect she would be supplied with other clothing if she lost what she possessed when they reached the coast the slaves were separated some being put aboard ship for a town called carthage while cailin and the rest were being sent to a place called constantinople it was she later learned by listening to others the great capital city of the eastern empire the male slaves in her group were chained to the oars of the galley they would be sold when and if they reached their destination but in the meantime they would provide the manpower to get there the women were penned below in barely habitable quarters a square space with no sleeping accommodations but the floor a wooden bucket for their needs little light and less air each night the first mate would arrive grinning and select several of the women whom he would take away they returned with the morning usually laughing with extra food or water for themselves which they usually chose not to share their own survival was paramount cailin instinctively hid herself in the darkest corner when the first mate came she did not need to be told what the women were doing or why they were given gifts she grew thinner with the meager rations supplied her but somehow remained alive to reach constantinople the morning of their arrival the slave master came to carefully look over the women he selected several who appeared more attractive than the others they were immediately removed some of those not chosen tried to plead with the slave master to take them and they wept when he roughly shoved them away where have the others gone cailin asked of an older woman the woman looked at her and replied they are considered the best of us they will be taken to a private slave market where they will be bathed perfumed and clothed in fine raiment before being auctioned off they will get wealthy masters and live comfortably if they please those masters what will happen to us cailin inquired curiously its the public market for us the woman said fatalistically well be bought as house or field slaves or for some waterfront brothel what is a brothel the look of astonishment on the womans face was almost comical but before she might answer cailin the slave masters minions came below and began herding the women up onto the deck they blinked uncomfortably in the sunshine their eyes unused to bright light after their many days at sea spent in the semidark of the hold gradually as they adjusted to the daylight they were led off the vessel and through the city streets to the public slave market cailin was astounded by the four and fivestory buildings along their route she had never seen buildings so big and the noise there seemed to be no quiet in this place she couldnt imagine how people managed to live amid the cacophony and such dirt the streets were strewn with garbage and both human and animal waste was littered all about her bare feet cringed with every step at last they reached the open slave market where little time was wasted one after another the slaves who had traveled with her were put up upon the block to be quickly sold off again cailin hid herself among the others until finally there was no longer any place to hide she was roughly pulled by the arm onto the little platform heres a fine strong young girl good for house or field the slave dealer said turning to cailin he ordered open your mouth wench he peered in and then announced to his audience she has all her teeth what am i bid the spectators looked up at the creature offered she was tall and pitifully thin her hair of an undistinguishable color was filthy and matted there was nothing at all about her that could be considered attractive despite the slave merchants spiel she did not look particularly strong or healthy they shuffled their feet and several began to slowly drift away offer me something the slave merchant pleaded with his audience she speaks good latin cleaned up she would make a good nursemaid or tavern servant smile girl he hissed angrily at cailin she ignored him if no one bought her perhaps they would kill her and then she would be out of her misery then suddenly into her view came the most astounding creature cailin had ever seen he was plump with rosy cheeks and merry dark brown eyes that surveyed her quite carefully he was dressed in a plumandgoldstriped silk dalmatica his round head was covered in a profusion of tight black curls the creature pursed his pink lips thoughtfully and then said in a clear sweet voice i will give you two folles for her two folles the slave merchant pretended outrage although he was relieved to be offered anything for the wretched creature he was just about to accept the gentlemans offer when the elegant spoke again oh very well i shall give you four folles ill not have you whining afterward that i cheated you you slave merchants are all alike when a man snatches a bargain from under your very noses you cannot see the value in what you havebut if someone else does you howl and cry to the godser god the gentleman amended jovian the plainly dressed gentleman who accompanied the elegant said irritably the girl isnt worth five nummi let alone four folles she is worth a dozen solidi brother even if you cannot see it right now trust me you know i have an eye for such things the curlyhaired man murmured extracting the coins from his purse and handing them to the slave merchant here fellow is your coin will you accept it he pierced the merchant with a direct look the man snatched the money from the elegants fingers and shoved cailin toward him go with your master now girl he growled jovians nose wrinkled with distaste as cailin approached him the gods girl when was the last time you bathed what is todays date she asked bluntly one loses track of time in the hold of a slave galley sir it is the ides of april he answered her curious she was not at all a subservient creature indeed she gave every indication of being strongwilled it was all to the good he thought pleased then it has been almost eight months since i last bathed she told him will i be able to bathe wherever it is you are now taking me sir i would be grateful to know that i could bathe properly again eight months both men chorused in unison looking horrified by cailins revelation then the more somber of the two said darkly you have made a dreadful error i fear jovian the plump gentleman chuckled nay phocas i have made no error wait and see wait and see he turned to cailin follow us girl but be mindful not to become lost in the crowds with us you will suffer no ill treatment but if you try to flee you could find yourself in far greater difficulties this is a cruel place cailin needed no warning nothing could be worse than the last few months she had spent in captivity she had come close to losing track of her own identity whoever these two men were they were certainly not threatening and at this point she would have followed anyone who promised her a bath she wondered in fact whether she would ever be able to really get clean again before her captivity she would not have believed that anyone could become so filthy as she now was mindful of his warning she hurried along after the elegant and his companion they walked swiftly through the noisy city and everywhere she turned there was something to catch cailins eye she wished she were not as she now was that she might ask questions of the two men it was all very overwhelming and not just a little frightening she was not at all used to the idea that she was a slave as she followed the two men off the wide avenue and into a narrow quiet street she saw them turn through the wide gates of a large house well at least they were wealthy and could afford to replace her worn tunic which was practically falling off her as she walked a majordomo hurried forward to greet the two gentlemen his eyes widening with shock at the sight of the girl following them my lord he questioned faintly is this person with you jovian has bought her in the public market paulus the sterner man replied you will have to ask him what he wants done with her the majordomo looked to jovian and the plump man laughed at the servants distress i shall take her to the baths myself paulus he said make certain the bath attendants are on duty they certainly have their work cut out for them dont they but wait until we have finished this filthy piglet i have purchased will turn into a peacock i promise you and i only paid four folles for her he turned to cailin come girl that bath you so desire is but steps away my name is cailin she replied following him is it and what kind of a name is cailin they exited the large atrium and moved through a scented corridor lined with many doors and he continued where is cailin from my name is celtic sir i am a briton she told him as they entered the reception room for the baths two attractive women came forward bowing to jovian and looking slightly dismayed by the sight of the girl accompanying him you have a great deal of work to do with this one my dears jovian told the bath attendants she tells me she has not bathed in eight months he chuckled i shall join you while you attend to the girl her name she says is cailin i like it we shall let her keep it i will answer to no other name cailin said firmly you were obviously not born a slave jovian noted of course not cailin replied indignantly i am a member of the drusus family of corinium my father gaius drusus corinium was a decurion of the town i am a married woman of property and good reputation who is now a slave in constantinople jovian answered dryly tell me how you came to be here he said as they entered the dressing room cailin told him what she could remember and what she had managed to piece together during her months of travel while the bath attendants undressed them and brought them into the tepidarium a warm anteroom where they would wait until they began to perspire the fact that she was now naked as was jovian did not trouble cailin she felt no danger from this man indeed she felt he might become her friend seeing their perspiration begin the bath attendants scraped away the dirt and sweat with silver strigils as they talked you were obviously betrayed by this antonia porcius jovian noted wisely a woman who believes herself wronged is a very dangerous enemy to have my dear selling you into slavery was her revenge upon you and upon your poor husband no doubt she told him you were dead if not he would have forced her to reveal your whereabouts and come after you i expect the news of your death however would cause him the same deep pain that his execution of her husband caused her she has been quite clever this antonia it is a plot worthy of a byzantine you survive to suffer in slavery not knowing what happened to your child while your husband suffers anguish over your alleged death cailin was silent how succinctly jovian had put it and he was probably correct what was worse there was absolutely nothing she could do about it she was helpless and so far from her beloved britain that she would never be able to get back until this moment she had not even considered it but now she had no choice but to face reality she was alive and obviously likely to remain so she had her future to consider why did you purchase me she asked jovian as they moved on into the caldarium to be bathed i could see that beneath the dirt you were beautiful and beautiful women are my business he told her then turning said to the bath attendants wash her hair first my dears i want to see its true color it is so mudcaked i cannot tell my hair is auburn cailin told him i take my coloring from my mother a dobunni celt then she could say no more as the two girls bathing her began to scrub her head and scalp with great vigor ouch cailin complained as their fingers forced themselves through the almost impossible tangles her hair had knotted itself into over the last months finally her hair was rinsed with warmed water that smelled of a pungent substance what is in the rinse water lemon jovian said the gods your hair is wonderful what is lemon cailin demanded ill show you later he said come now and let the girls bathe you my beauty no he motioned to the bath attendants i shall care for myself devote your time to cailin they washed her with a soft soap that seemed to melt the remaining dirt from her skin cailin could scarcely contain her delight at being clean again they continued on into the frigidarium for a quick cold plunge bath and then into the unctorium where they stretched out side by side on two benches to be massaged with sweet oils how are beautiful women your business sir cailin asked the two bath attendants giggled this is villa maxima cailin jovian explained it is the most elegant brothel in all of constantinople we serve both ladies and gentlemen seeking entertainment of a more exotic exciting kind what is a brothel she asked him annoyed to hear the two girls renewed amusement they sounded so smug jovian raised his head up in surprise and looked at cailin who lay comfortably next to him enjoying her massage you do not know what a brothel is he said amazed i should not have asked you if i knew sir cailin replied you say you come from corinium he began but she interrupted my branch of the drusus corinium family came to corinium in the time of the emperor claudius cailin told him but i was raised away from the town i only visited it three times in my whole life the last time being when i was six years of age i am the only daughter of a good patrician family i do not know what a brothel is should i oh dear jovian said almost to himself finish your massage cailin and then i will explain to you what you need to know then he glared in an unusual show of irritation at the giggling bath attendants who immediately fell silent it was rare for master jovian to grow angry but when he did it was highly unpleasant when the bath attendants had finished their work they escorted their charges into a warm dressing room where jovian donned a fresh dalmatica this one of skyblue silk a fresh white silk tunica belted with a gold cord was supplied for cailin come my dear he said taking her hand in his we will have honey cakes and wine in my private garden and i will tell you everything you need to know the garden was exquisite small and surrounded by a wall covered in ivy a little marble fountain was in its center shaped like a shell from which water dripped into a rounded basin there were half a dozen damask rose bushes already coming into bloom perfuming the air with their luxurious sweetness come and sit by me jovian said settling himself upon a marble bench ahh the wine has been iced excellent he said with a smile at the slave serving them now cailin to answer your question a brothel is a place where women sell their bodies for the amusement of men you do understand what i mean by that dont you she nodded her eyes wide and he noted their marvelous violet color i have never heard of such a thing she answered him i know that men lie with women other than their wives but i never knew women got paid for such things oh there is nothing unusual in it he replied it is done all the time and has been done since the beginning of time there are however varying degrees of such an arrangement some women sell themselves in the streets they are called whores or prostitutes they couple with their customers up against walls and in alleys they cannot be discerning about the men with whom they involve themselves either consequently they end up diseased and often dead at an early age which is probably a blessing it is not easy being a woman of the streets they can fall prey to a single man who steers other men their way but takes most of their pitiful earnings for himself it is a hard life women in brothels are usually better off although there are different sorts of brothels those serving the lower classes tend to treat their women little better than those poor souls plying their trade in the streets of the city these brothels exist because there is always an unending supply of poor girls willing to take their chances making their fortunes within their walls but alas few if any do escape to live to a grand old age in comfort why do they do it then cailin asked him because they have no other choice he told her frankly villa maxima however is not like most other brothels we cherish our women and pamper them in luxury they are not common whores but courtesans highly trained and skilled in giving the men who come to patronize them the utmost in pleasure we also have handsome young male courtesans who are much in demand among certain wealthy women of the city and the court there are men among our clients who enjoyindeed they preferthe company of other men and women who would rather have a woman for a lover we cater to every taste it is all very strange to me cailin told him he nodded yes i imagine it would be considering your former life in britain i know it will be difficult for you but you will adjust to this new life if your mind is open are you perchance a christian cailin shook her head no are you he chuckled it is now the official religion of the empire he said like a good citizen i obey the emperor in all things cailin laughed for the first time in many months what a prevaricator you are sir i fear i do not believe you jovian shrugged i do what i must to avoid difficulty he said this new church fights among itself as to what is correct and proper doctrine and what is not when they have settled it among themselves perhaps i shall find my faith until then you will give lip service to it she told him i know very little about the christians sir i think however that i prefer my own gods danu the mother and lugh our father they are represented by the earth and the sun then there is macha epona sulis cernunnos dagda taranis and my favorite nodens the goddess of the forest my mother particularly loved nodens the christians i am told have but one god it seems a poor religion to me that only has one god you should learn about it as you are to live in constantinople jovian told her i will have a priest tutor you in the intricacies of the religion we have several rather important clerics as clients am i to be a courtesan then sir cailin asked him not immediately my dear you lack training for one thing and for another i must be certain you are diseasefree the women who live in this house are healthy i do not allow them to consort with men who are not some brothel owners are penurious when it comes to the health of their women my brother and i are not for a single solidus a good greek physician can be purchased in the market we own one who lives here and oversees to the health of all the residents of villa maxima then once he has decided that i am healthy cailin said you will have me trained to be a courtesan eventually he answered does it disturb you to know that you will be expected to entertain a variety of lovers my dear cailin considered his words in another time and another place the mere thought of such a thing would have horrified her beyond anything but this was not britain she was so far from home she could not even ascertain the distance her husband probably did believe her dead mayhap he had already taken another wife wulf for a moment she saw his strong handsome face before her and tears sprang to her eyes she quickly blinked them away it would not be easy at first to take another man between her thighs but she supposed in time she would grow used to it what future have i beyond my youth she asked jovian for a moment surprise suffused his features and then he said in admiring tones how wise you are my dear to consider the future so many of them do not they think they will be young and desirable forever of course that is not the case well i will tell you what that future can hold for you if you will trust me learn your lessons well cailin and you will i promise attract the best lovers constantinople has to offer to your bed learn more than just the sensuous arts my dear many do not realize that to be truly fascinating a woman must be a clever and a knowledgeable conversationalist as well as a desirable female lovers will shower such a woman with expensive gifts gold jewelry and other valuables eventually you will be able to purchase your freedom at the beginning of each year we put a value upon each woman in our house if during that year she decides she wishes to buy her freedom there is no argument over price for it is already set today i purchased you for four folles but your value is already more now that your beauty is visible to all you are worth at least ten solidi how many folles is that sir cailin queried him there are one hundred and eighty copper folles to each gold solidus eighteen hundred copper folles equals ten gold solidi my dear he said with a grin i am almost tempted to take you back now to that foolish slave merchant who allowed you to go so cheaply for want of a little water no i cannot he will howl and cry hes been cheated despite the fact that i warned him they are all alike those people he stood up come we will go and show my brother phocas that i have not lost my ability to see a perfect gem beneath the mud in the road isis he called to an attending slave you will accompany us then he turned back to cailin you will address gentlemen who enter this house as my lord my brother and myself as well sir is such a provincial mode of address dear girl yes my lord cailin answered him following jovian through the house to where phocas sat awaiting them when she was disrobed the elder of the maxima brothers expressed his surprise at and his approval of her newly restored appearance she stood silent as they spoke until finally her garment was restored to her isis her new master instructed the slave girl take cailin to the quarters i have ordered prepared for her when the two women had departed jovian turned to his brother an excited look upon his face i have the most marvelous plans for that girl he said she is going to make us a fortune phocas and our old age will be secure no single courtesan however welltrained his elder brother answered can make us that much gold this one will and she will not have to personally entertain any of our clients at least not for some time brother dear jovian finished rubbing his hands together gleefully he sat down next to phocas they were a study in contrasts these two brothers although they were of almost equal height phocas being slightly taller no one who did not know them would have realized they were siblings born of the same parents their father had been a courtier their mother his mistress villa maxima had been her home phocas favored the paternal side of his family he was slender with a long aristocratic face made up of a slim nose narrow lips and deepset dark brown eyes his hair was dark and straight cut mediumshort and brushed away from the crown of his head his clothing was expensive and simple phocas maxima was the sort of man who could easily disappear amid a crowd it was said by the women he owned that he was a lover of epic proportions who could make the most hardened courtesan weep with joy his business acumen was admired citywide and his generous works of charity kept him in favor with the church his younger brother jovian was his opposite elegant classically educated a slave to fashion he was considered one of the greatest wits of his time he adored beautiful things clothing women works of art and particularly beautiful young men of whom he kept several to see to his every need his dark curls in careful and deliberate disarray he was easily recognizable at the races the games the circus the success of villa maxima was largely due to him for although phocas could keep the books and see to the budget needed to run the brothel it was jovians wonderful imagination that set villa maxima above all the other expensive brothels in the city their late mother a famous courtesan of her day would have been enormously proud of them what have you in mind phocas asked him his curiosity provoked by his brothers particularly excitable state regarding the girl cailin are we not famous the length and breadth of the empire for our entertainments jovian said absolutely phocas agreed our living tableaux have no equal am i correct you are correct brother dear phocas answered what if we took a living tableau a giant step further jovian suggested what if instead of a tableau we staged a playlet of delicious depravity so decadent that all of constantinople would want to view itand would pay handsomely for the privilege no one brother dear would be allowed to view this playlet at first but our regular clients they of course would talk about it intriguing their friends and their friends friends only those personally recommended by our clients would be permitted to enter here to view our little entertainment soon we would have so many requests for entry that we could charge whatever the traffic would bear and thus make our fortunes no one has ever before done anything such as i propose to you others will naturally copy us but they will not be able to maintain the level of genius and imagination as we can cailin will be the centerpiece of the performance phocas could fully appreciate his brothers plan it was absolutely brilliant what will you call your playlet and how will it be performed jovian he asked his sibling fascinated the virgin and the barbarians is that not marvelous jovian chortled most pleased with himself and his cleverness the scene will open with our own little cailin seated before a loom modest and innocent in white her hair unbound weaving a tapestry suddenly the door to her chamber bursts open three magnificent naked barbarians enter swords in hand their intent quite plain the frightened maiden leaps up but alack they are upon her rending her garments asunder as she shrieks her protest they violate her and the curtain descends to the cheers of our audience boring phocas said dryly boring jovian looked offended i cannot believe you would say such a thing to me there is nothing boring about the scene i have described to you violation of a virgin is an ordinary topic of living tableau phocas answered disappointed if that is all there is to it jovian then it is boring the gods jovian exclaimed it is all so clear to me that i have not explained it in detail to you our virgin is violated by three barbarians phocas three indeed were it one or three it is boring his brother repeated all three of them at one time jovian slyly elucidated phocass brown eyes grew wide impossible he said breathlessly not at all his brother answered but it must be choreographed most carefully as one would choreograph a temple dance it is not however impossible dear brother oh no not at all and nothing like it has ever been presented here in byzantium does not the church itself constantly decry the wickedness of mans nature there will be riots before our gates in an effort to see the performance this girl will make us our fortunes we shall retire to that island in the black sea that we bought several years ago and have not seen since but will the girl cooperate phocas asked you are after all expecting a great deal of an unsophisticated little provincial she will cooperate brother dear she is very intelligent for a woman and because she is a pagan she has no foolish qualms since she is not a virgin she has no respectability to lose in this do you know what she asked me what her future held after her youth and beauty had fled of course i told her she might eventually purchase her freedom if she were clever and i believe she certainly is with the proper training cailin will be the greatest courtesan this city has ever known have you decided upon the men involved phocas said now all business and how often shall we schedule this spectacle only twice weekly his brother replied the girls physical wellbeing must be protected and the unique nature of the performance involved considered better our clientele be left begging for more than our little playlet become too ordinary too quickly as for the men i saw just the trio i will need at isaac stauraciuss private slave market two days ago what if they are already sold they will not be jovian said i thought i might want them then although i wasnt certain i gave isaac five gold solidi to hold them for me i was to tell him by tomorrow but i shall go today they are quite magnificent phocas dear brothers all identical in features and form down to the last detail big blond northmen they have but one tiny flaw it is not visible to the eye but isaac wanted me to know they are dumb the fool who captured them had their tongues torn out a pity really they seem intelligent and hear quite well go and fetch them then phocas replied do not let isaac cheat you jovian after all he does not know how we are going to utilize these young men their physical defect should certainly lower the price he will ask appreciably but wait what of their male organs they are large no matter how beautiful these creatures they must have big manhoods how can you be certain of that without isaac suspecting something of the use to which we will put this trio jovian looked drolly at his elder sibling phocas my dear brother you wound me deeply when did i ever purchase any male slave for this house that i did not inspect their attributes most thoroughly first at rest the manhoods of these three hang limply at least six inches aroused they will lengthen to eight if i am not mistaken and i rarely am your pardon brother phocas said with a brief smile with an answering smile and a bow jovian departed his brothers presence calling to his favorite body slave and current lover to come and join him he walked swiftly through the gates of villa maxima and out into the street chapter cailinhadalwaysbelievedthat the home in which she had grown up was luxurious but life at villa maxima was a revelation to her no windows despoiled the outside walls of the building facing the street one entered through bronze gates that led by way of a narrow passage into a large sunny open courtyard the flooring in the courtyard was designed of square blocks of black and white marble great pots were set about the perimeter of the space they were planted with small trees and pink damask rosebushes there were always attractive slaves on duty within the courtyard to welcome visitors and to direct them up the two wide white marble steps onto the colonnaded portico and through it into the atrium of the villa the atrium was magnificent it had a high curved vaulted ceiling divided into sunken panels that were carved and decorated in red and blue and gilded with gold the walls were decorated with panels of white marble and the baseboards were overlaid in silver the entry to the atrium had two squared columns and four rounded pillars in red and white marble all topped with gilded cornices above the entry were three long narrow latticed windows the doors leading from the atrium were of solid bronze and the door posts sheathed in green marble carved and decorated with gold and ivory the floor was of marble tiles of various contrasting shades of green and white arranged in geometrical patterns in the recessed wall niches set about the room were marvelous marble sculptures of naked men and women singly or in pairs or groups all in erotic poses calculated to titillate the viewer there were marble tubs filled with brightly colored flowers and several marble benches where clients sat waiting admittance as their identities and credit were checked what little of the rest of the villa that cailin saw in her first weeks in constantinople was equally magnificent the walls were all paneled and centered upon them painted pictures in frames the subject of most of these paintings was erotic in nature the ceilings were all paneled and decorated with raised stucco work which was gilded or set with ivory doors were paneled and carved with colorful mosaic thresholds the floors were either of marble of various hues or mosaic pictures made of pieces so tiny that they appeared to be painted the floor of the main chamber where the entertainments took place had the story of leda and jupiter illustrated in exquisitely colored pieces of mosaic that gave a jeweled effect the furniture found at villa maxima was typical of a wealthy household couches were everywhere and they were ornately ornamental in design wonderfully grained woods were used for the legs and the arms which were often carved tortoiseshell ivory ebony jewels and precious metals were used to decorate them the couch coverings were of the finest fabrics available embroidered in both gold and silver threads as well as sewn with jewels the tables were equally beautiful the best being made from african cedar some had bases of marble others of gold or silver and yet others of gilded woods there were chests for storage some simple and others of elegant design the candelabra were of bronze silver and gold as were the lamps both on the tables and hanging there was nothing that could be considered lacking in grace or beauty about the villa and its furnishings cailin had been assigned a charming little room with a mosaic floor whose center decoration was of jupiter seducing europa about the walls frescoes showed young lovers being encouraged and bedeviled by a host of amusing little winged cupids there was a single bed a lovely little decorated wooden chest and a small round table to furnish the space which had but one window looking out over the hills of the city to the sea beyond the room was sunny most of the day and the light gave it a cheerful outlook that made cailin feel comfortable for the first time in almost a year it was not a bad place to begin her new life for almost two weeks that life was uncomplicated and pampered she was fed more food than she had ever before eaten she was bathed and massaged three times daily her feet and her hands were attended to the nails pared her skin creamed to soften it she was made to rest continuously until she thought she would die of boredom for cailin was not used to being idle she saw no one but jovian and the few servants who attended to her in the evenings she could hear laughter music and merriment from elsewhere in villa maxima but her chamber was very isolated from the rest of the house one day jovian came and took her in a highly decoratedand to cailins tasteflamboyant litter to tour the city he was a font of fascinating facts and general information a town had been founded a thousand years before by the greeks on this very site cailin learned located at the junction of the eastwest trade routes the town had always flourished even if it was not particularly distinguished then just over a hundred years ago the emperor constantine the great had decided to leave rome and chose for his new capital the town of byzantium constantine the first emperor to embrace christianity consecrated the city on the fourth day of november in the year ad the city renamed constantinople in his honor was formally dedicated on may with much pomp and ceremony already building and renovation was then in progress constantine and his successors were always building and little remained now of the original greek town constantinople currently had a university of higher learning its own circus eight public and one hundred fiftythree private baths fiftytwo porticos five granaries four large public halls for the government the senate and the courts of justice eight aqueducts that conveyed the citys water fourteen churches including the magnificent st sophia and fourteen palaces for the nobility there were close to five thousand wealthy and uppermiddleclass homes not to mention several thousand houses and apartments sheltering the plebian classes the shopkeepers the artisans the humble the city had been built on trade and trade prospered there since it was set where the land routes from asia and europe met constantinoples markets were filled with goods of all kinds there was porcelain from cathay ivory from africa amber from the baltic precious stones of every kind found on the earth silks damask aloes balsam cinnamon and ginger sugar musk salt oil grains wax furs wood wines and of course slaves that afternoon they traveled the length of the city to the golden gate and then back along the mese past the forums of constantine and of theodosius they skirted the hippodrome and moved on past the great palace as they were carried by the great church of st erine jovian said i have not yet chosen a priest for you cailin i must remember to do so do not bother she told him i do not think i could be a christian it seems a difficult faith i fear why do you say that he asked her curious i have been speaking to your servants and they tell me that to be a christian you must forgive your enemies i do not think i can forgive mine jovian my enemy has cost me my family my husband and my child i do not even know if that child was a son or a daughter i have been taken from the land i love best enslaved and generally terrorized we britons are a hardy race which is probably why i have survived all of this but i am angry and i am embittered given the opportunity to take my revenge upon antonia porcius i would gladly do so i cannot forgive her for what she has done to me or taken from me your fate is now here jovian told her quietly and reaching out he took her hand in his squeezing it to comfort her cailins violet eyes surveyed him calmly i have learned to put my trust in no one my lord it is wiser and i shall not be disappointed how cold she is he thought wondering if her husband had ever been able to ignite passion in her yet she was exactly what he needed for his new entertainment a perfect marble venus beautiful untouchable icy and heartless she would be a sensation and her performance would bring all of constantinople to its knees in their admiration tomorrow he said you will begin your training you will be taught to do certain things that may at first frighten you or seem repugnant to you but you can believe me cailin when i tell you that i will not allow you to be injured in any way in this one instance you may put your trust in me i have too great an investment in you to allow you to come to harm my dear oh yes you may trust jovian maxima but no other you have an investment of four folles my lord she laughed tis hardly a great amount as you yourself explained to me ahh but remember that having cleaned you up i told you that your worth had increased to ten solidi once you are trained your worth will be a hundred times that cailin she was fascinated by what he was saying she had absolutely no idea what her training was going to involve she had no idea exactly what went on at villa maxima during those long evenings when the enticing noises from the main part of the villa teased at her sleepy ears all she knew about brothels was that bodies were sold for a nights pleasure there was obviously a good deal more if her instincts proved correct the next morning she was brought by the slave girl isis to an interior room where jovian awaited her with several others all of them but jovian resplendent in a red and silver dalmatica were naked there was a beautiful darkhaired woman of cailins height and three tall young men with long golden locks for a moment it was as if a hand had clutched at her heart cailin thought upon seeing them although there was nothing in the trio other than their size and coloring to remind her of wulf it was more than enough for a moment she was angry at jovian but then she realized he could not know so she steeled herself for whatever was to come because it meant the first step along her road to freedom yesterday discussing her anger with jovian cailin had suddenly known that what she desperately wanted was to return to britain no matter how far away it was or how difficult the journey the realization of such a dream was impossible without gold and power behind her she knew not if wulf was dead or alive even if he lived he might not want her back but her fathers lands were hers and there was that faceless sexless child too who belonged to her she wanted them back and she wanted her revenge on antonia porcius only by becoming famous here in constantinople did she have the slightest chance of returning to britain and foiling antonias evil scheme in her innocence cailin vowed she would do whatever she had to do to attain her goal this is casia jovian said introducing the darkhaired woman she has been with us for two years and is most popular with the gentlemen i have asked her to join us because she will demonstrate what i have in mind for you remove cailins tunica for her isis and then you may leave us cailin swallowed her apprehension at being nude before strangers no one else was embarrassed it was obviously a normal procedure in circumstances such as these the obvious admiration for her in the blue eyes of the male trio was flattering who are they she asked jovian your fellow players he said smoothly and then asked her how did you and your husband make love my dear the positions you assumed i mean he further explained then he continued answering his own question you lay upon your back i surmise and he rode you cailin nodded swallowing silently she was suddenly cold casia put her arm about her do not be frightened she said in kindly tones no one is going to hurt you cailin you are really very fortunate to have been chosen by jovian for this entertainment surely you are not fearful jovian fussed at her i told you that in this one matter you could trust me it is simply the unknown that distresses you very well then let us demystify your fears your fellow players cannot speak although they hear i have decided to call them apollo castor and pollux the physician tells me you are healthy in all respects and more than ready to receive a mans homage these three are to be your lovers they are slaves as i am cailin said where is the profit in that my lord how can i earn my freedom lying with slaves jovian chuckled she might be afraid but she had not lost sight of all he had told her your lovemaking shall be an entertainment for our clients cailin twice weekly you four shall perform a playlet of my devising he then went on to explain what would be required of her i realize that you have never had a man enter through your temple of sodom that is why casia is here today it is a particular specialty of hers if you see her carrying out this manner of lovemaking you shall see there is nothing to be apprehensive about casia take your position pollux and castor attend her now watch carefully cailin you will be required to do what casia does casia fell to her knees castor standing before her rubbed his male organ against her lips opening her mouth she absorbed him before cailins shocked eyes she suckled strongly upon his manhood she is arousing him by means of the sucking action and by teasing his flesh with her tongue jovian explained matteroffactly see he is already engorged with his lust hes an eager young fellow casia could no longer contain the northman within her mouth she positioned herself on her hands and knees castor moved behind her and knelt using his hand to guide himself he pushed between the tight halfmoons of her bottom casia groaned softly and as she did pollux tipped her head up with one hand while offering the girl his manhood to entertain within her mouth grasping her hips in his big hands castor very slowly inserted himself within the kneeling casia then he began to pump her with equally slow long majestic strokes of his manhood i cannot possibly do that cailin protested of course you can and you will not only do that but more my dear jovian assured her you will note how careful he is with her as filled with lust as he is he is tender he must be lest he damage her he would forfeit his life if he did and he knows it jovian suddenly put an arm about cailin and drawing her next to him he put a hand between her nether lips to her shocked surprise ahh good you are already moist with beginning desire despite those maidenly protests you are going to make to me apollo come here and sooth our little novice lay her on her back and give her a good fucking strangely it was the gentle pity in apollos eyes that hardened cailins heart that day she realized then that if she were not the mistress of this situation the three brothers would bully her in their performance ever after she lay down upon a mat placed on the marble floor and spreading her legs wide observed to jovian he is as ready to couple as i am my lord his manhood is certainly a fine one though i have seen bigger come apollo and do our masters bidding she felt absolutely nothing as he reamed her vigorously she was as cold as ice finally casia her own performance concluded knelt by cailins head and softly instructed her you must always let a man believe you are feeling passion such as you have never felt before even when you are not thrash your head back and forth good now moan and claw at his back she smiled up at jovian as cailin complied she is an apt pupil my lord i am dead cailin thought and this is hades but it was not for several weeks she was instructed in the erotic arts and to her own surprise she seemed to excel in them finally came the day when cailin and the trio of young northmen brought jovians playlet fully to life before his delighted eyes two days later they performed a dress rehearsal before all the residents of villa maxima afterward both cailin and jovian were congratulated jovian for his creative abilities and cailin for her acrobatically inclined performance next week jovian said enthusiastically we begin our performances next week there is just enough time to let our special clients know that something extraordinary will be happening oh my brother we are going to be rich the virgin and the barbarians was an immediate success never had anything like it been seen in the history of constantinople it was all going exactly as jovian had predicted it would phocas in a rare show of excitement could scarcely contain his glee over the thousands of gold solidi piling up in their strongbox twice weekly the playlet was performed before several hundred guests each paying five gold solidi apiece to view the performance one night jovian sought out his elder brother and told him excitedly the empresss brother has come and general aspar with him i have seated them in the first row for the best viewing the gods i knew i was right i am going to start designing another playlet phocas i wonder if this is as fascinating as the rumors insist prince basilicus murmured to his companion the prince was an elegant man with fair skin black hair and deep brown eyes cultured and educated it was unusual to find him in such an atmosphere particularly given his public piety and his circle of religious friends i am going to be sorry that i allowed you to drag me here tonight aspar the general chuckled you are too serious basilicus and i should be more like you a lover of plays and public spectacles aspar if you werent the finest general the empire has ever seen you would not be tolerated by the court if i were not the finest general the empire has ever seen aspar said quietly your sister verina would not be empress the prince laughed it is true he admitted you made leo emperor even as you chose marcian before him you would be emperor yourself were it not for my friends in the church they fear you aspar they are fools then was the reply thank god for my lack of orthodoxy basilicus i should rather be an emperormaker than an emperor that is why your friends really fear me they do not understand why i choose to be as i choose to be besides times have changed byzantium needs a great general more than she needs a great emperor right now and the days are long past when a single man could be both your modesty touches me the prince said ironically my god is that senator romanuss wife with that musclebound boy it is aspar chuckled we probably know half the people in this room basilicus look over there there is bishop andronicus and just look whom he is with it is casia one of the finest courtesans villa maxima has to offer i have enjoyed several evenings in her company she is a charming and a most talented girl would you like to meet her one day i do not think i dare intrude upon the bishop tonight however the room was totally filled now naked young boys and girls began to move about snuffing out the lamps until the room was in total darkness aspar smiled to himself hearing the low moans and heavy breathing about him already some in the audience were taking advantage of the darkness to make love then the heavy curtain shielding the stage was drawn aside revealing a second diaphanous curtain the stage was very well lit with lamps set along its rim and several others that hung down from the stage beams the sheer draperies were slowly drawn back to completely reveal a beautiful young woman seated at a loom her face was serene but it was her charming long auburn curls that aspar found delightful the girl was dressed in a modest white tunica her slender feet were bare she worked knowledgeably at the loom her very demeanor was of purity and innocence soft music played in the background from unseen musicians setting the peaceful scene the general gazed about him among the audience lovers were beginning to become quite entwined senator romanuss wife was seated facing the stage upon her lovers lap her gown was pulled well up as was the tunic of the young man upon whom she sat their activity was obvious aspar smiled amused and turned back to the stage the girl looked up from her weaving and aspar saw that her eyes held no expression at all for a moment he wondered if she were blind but he could see she was not the vacant look touched him in a strange fashion he realized he felt sorry for the beautiful young woman then suddenly the door to the little theatrical chamber burst asunder the audience gasped as three naked oiled warriors strode onto the stage they were all identical in features each wore a helmet with a horsetail and carried a sword and a decorated shield but it was their large male organs that intrigued both the men and the women in the audience god in his heaven murmured basilicus where did those three come from surely they arent going to ah yes they are he leaned forward fascinated as the three barbarians began their violation of the hapless virgin cailins gauzy little garment was torn violently from her voluptuous body raising her right arm she pressed the back of her hand against her forehead while her left arm was positioned down and slightly back this clever little piece of staging allowed her audience a perfect view of her beautiful naked body for the briefest of moments the three barbarians stood silent as if they too were admiring their victim then suddenly one of them grabbed the girl and kissed her fiercely his big hands roaming over her lush form fondling it vigorously a second barbarian tore the maiden from his companion and began to plunder her lips only to have the third man in their trio demand his share of the sweetness as well for a few minutes the barbarians kissed and caressed cailin beneath the collective hot gaze of their audience oh the gods a faceless female voice half moaned in the darkness as the three golden barbarians suddenly turned to face the audience revealing their engorged manhoods in all their epic proportions there were more lustful sighs and groans as the playlet continued onward to its conclusion clutching the girl to prevent her escape the three barbarians diced to see who would take the virginity contained in her temple of venus unknown to the audience this was the one part of the act that was left to chance each time the quartet performed jovian believed if his male actors played exactly the same role in each performance they would become stale in their parts and hence boring apollo won the first toss and grinned delightedly he had been relegated to the role his brother castor would play tonight for the last three performances he groaned with genuine pleasure as cailin was forced down upon his manhood pollux knelt down behind the girl grasping her hips tightly while she balanced herself upon her hands and slowly inserted himself in her temple of sodom the audience chuckled as castor apparently left out of the fun looked downcast then a wicked smile crossed his face walking over to the entwined group he stood over apollo and reaching down lifted cailins head up he rubbed himself against her lips until with what appeared a demure reluctance she opened her mouth and took his manhood in at first shyly and then with a noisy suckling carefully the other two men began to move on the girl as well her ravishers howled with their pleasure it was clever the general thought the girl looked as innocent as a young lambkin the blankness in her eyes however told him that she was doing what she had to do to survive she was certainly not enjoying the three men now pushing themselves into the three orifices of her lovely body about him aspar saw men and women in the audience slackjawed and wideeyed with lustful enjoyment several couples physically involved themselves were moaning their own pleasure as the players upon the stage were bringing this little piece of depravity to its natural conclusion as the quartet collapsed in a heap of entwined limbs the curtains were drawn back across the stage jovian appeared to the cheers and shouts of the audience you have enjoyed our little entertainment he asked coyly a winsome twinkle in his eyes they shouted their approval at him and he beamed pleased are there any ladies here tonight who would like to enjoy the special attentions of one of our handsome young barbarians jovian inquired slyly he was immediately bombarded with eager requests the three brothers were quickly auctioned off appearing from behind the curtain to join their happy partners for the night to basilicuss astonishment senator romanuss lusty wife gained possession of one of the players and disappeared with both him and her young lover what about the girl came a shout from the audience oh no jovian answered with a little laugh our virgin is not for anyone elses amusementfor the time being perhaps one day gentlemen but not right now my brother and i are pleased that you have all enjoyed yourselves at our playlet there will be another performance in three nights do tell your friends then he disappeared behind the curtain like a small fox popping back into its den aspar stood up i have some business to conduct he said to his companion will you remain basilicus i think so the prince said after all i am here smiling to himself flavius aspar left the small theater he had sought light amusement at villa maxima for a number of years and he knew precisely where he was going he found the two maxima brothers in a small interior room gleefully counting their proceeds from tonights performance my lord it is good to see you jovian hurried forward while phocas looked up just long enough to nod at the general did you enjoy our little entertainment i saw prince basilicus with you nothing escapes your sharp eyes does it jovian the general said with a laugh the performance was unique a bit hard on the girl i would say is that why you limit her appearances to twice weekly of course my lord cailin is very valuable to us we would not want to harm her in any way jovian said i want to buy her aspar said quietly jovian felt his heart jump in his chest his eyes met those of his brother nervously this was certainly not something that they had even considered my lord he said slowly she is not for sale not now perhaps later he felt a tiny bead of perspiration begin to slide down his backbone this was the most powerful man in the byzantine empire more powerful than the emperor himself one thousand gold solidi aspar said and he smiled to show he was unoffended by jovians refusal three thousand phocas answered there was no sentiment in phocas maxima jovian might protest but another girl could be trained to take cailins place besides the playlet was no longer fresh fifteen hundred the general countered quickly two thousand phocas replied fifteen hundred the general replied firmly indicating the bidding was done have the girl delivered to my private seaside villa it is just five miles past the golden gate when you arrive tomorrow the majordomo there will have your gold for you i trust that will be satisfactory gentlemen he did not for a single moment believe he would be denied we would prefer my lord if the gold were delivered here to us i do not think either of us relishes returning from beyond the city walls laden with such a treasure phocas explained when the purse is brought to us we will gladly send the girl to you he bowed politely very well flavius aspar answered and then seeing jovians downcast features he said do not be sad my old friend the virgin and the barbarians was becoming quite commonplace shortly no one will believe that your little protegewhat did you call heris a virgin create a new playlet for your audience jovian you will lose nothing by it those who have not seen this playlet will be twice as eager to see the next one and those who have seen it will be equally eager to see what is next cailin her name is cailin she is a briton jovian said you will be kind to her my lord she is a good girl fallen on hard times if you ask her she will tell you her tale it is most fascinating i did not purchase her to hurt her jovian the general told him then he said gentlemen no word of this transaction is to be gossiped about even to my friend basilicus i do not want anyone to know of my purchase we understand perfectly my lord jovian said smoothly now beginning to recover his aplomb knowing cailins history he had always secretly felt a bit guilty about making her the centerpiece of his entertainment he realized that as general aspars mistress she would be far safer and possibly even happier we will see less of you now i expect he finished perhaps aspar answered then nodding to the two men he departed the chamber closing the door behind him as he went the gods phocas exclaimed we have had the girl in our possession less than three months brother dear her performances made us fifteen thousand solidi and her sale has brought us another fifteen hundred solidi an excellent return on a slave who only cost us four folles to begin with even considering the cost of her keep which was really quite negligible i salute you jovian maxima you were correct jovian smiled broadly a compliment from phocas was as rare as finding a perfect pearl in an oyster thank you brother he said you will tell the girl i will speak to her in the morning on the nights she gives her performance she bathes and goes to her bed immediately following it she will be sleeping now and she always sleeps like the dead afterward sleep it was her only escape cailin had believed she was strong she had almost convinced herself that she could do what they asked of her but she did not think she could bear much more it was not that anyone was unkind to her indeed everyone went out of their way to make certain she was comfortable she was pampered and fussed over by everyone at villa maxima jovian was almost devoted to her apollo castor and pollux adored her openly they had even gone as far as to show her a lion designed in a mosaic point to it tap their chests and then point to her they were telling her in the only way they could that she had the courage of a lion it was flattering but it was not enough she had recently overheard jovian speaking about a new entertainment he was conceiving for her it surely couldnt be any worse than what was happening to her now to her surprise jovian joined her the following morning for the first meal of the day i could not sleep he told her and so i went early to the marketplace see the fine melon i have brought you we will enjoy it together while i tell you that you have had the most incredible piece of luck cailin fortuna is not a goddess who has been kind to me of late cailin told him handing the melon to isis to split she smiled quite broadly on you last night my dear jovian said archly flavius aspar byzantiums most powerful man was in the audience i thought the emperor was your most powerful man cailin replied flavius aspar is the empires most famed general he has personally chosen the last two emperors both the late emperor marcian and this emperor leo owe their positions to aspar and what has your general to do with me my lord cailin took a slice of melon offered her by isis it was wonderfully sweet and the juice ran down her chin she flicked out her tongue to catch it i have sold you to him jovian said biting into his own piece of the ripe fruit he paid fifteen hundred gold solidi for you my dear did i not tell you that your value would increase you also told me that i should be able to purchase my freedom eventually cailin said bitterly did i not say i should trust no one but you swore to me that you could be trusted my lord dear girl jovian protested we did not solicit your sale he came to us aftet last nights performance and said he wished to putchase you he is truly the most powerful man in the empire cailin there was no way my brother and i could refuse him and continue to prosper to deny aspar what he wanted would have been tantamount to suicide he patted her arm do not be afraid my dear he will be kind to you i do not think the general has ever kept a mistress when he wished to have a woman other than his wife he would come here or to some other respectable house such as ours you should feel honored cailin glared at him how will i ever get back to britain to take my revenge on antonia porcius now she demanded furiously a clever womanand i do believe you are clever cailin would see the great opportunity offered her aspar will lavish gifts upon you if you please him he may even free you one day jovian said i have none of the skills of a courtesan cailin told him those lessons were to come later all i am capable of doing is she flushed angrily well you know what i can do my lord jovian for you conceived the hades i have been living in for the past weeks will not your powerful general believe he has been cheated when he finds out that the woman he bought last night is not at all skilled in the arts of erotica i do not think it is a trained courtesan he wants cailin jovian told her he is a strange man aspar for all his military skills he is a very kind person in a very cruel world make no mistake about him however he is a man used to being obeyed he can be hard at that moment phocas came bustling into cailins small chamber the messenger has arrived with the gold he said attempting to restrain his glee i have counted it and it is all there to the last solidus brother dear have you told cailin is she ready to leave us now i must wash my hands and face first cailin answered for jovian and then i am ready to leave my lord phocas there was nothing else left to say isis brought a basin of water and cailin removed all traces of the melon from herself then bidding isis farewell she was escorted by the two brothers to the courtyard where a litter was waiting she wore a simple white chiton belted with a gold rope the sleeves of the garment flowed gracefully to her midarms her feet were bare for she had needed no sandals within villa maxima and none had been given her casia came out into the courtyard and said you cannot allow her to leave without these with a small smile she fastened amethyst pearl and gold dangles in cailins ears every woman deserves some jewelry the gods go with you my little friend i do not think you realize how fortunate you truly are thank you casia cailin exclaimed i have never had lovelier earrings than these and thank you for the rest be yourself and you will succeed admirably with him casia promised i will call on you soon jovian told cailin brightly and helped her into the litter lake casias advice she knows cailin felt a momentary panic as the litter was lifted and the bearers moved off through the gates of villa maxima once again she was facing the unknown it seemed so odd after the quiet life she had lived in britain that within the space of two years her fate had taken such twists and turns cailin leaned back and closed her eyes as they hurried through the city at the golden gate the litter stopped in the line of traffic waiting to be passed through she heard a rough voice say and what have we here this woman belongs to general aspar and is going to villa mare came the curt reply ill just have a look the voice answered and the litters diaphanous draperies were yanked aside cailin stared coldly at the soldier peering in the draperies fell back she belongs to old aspar the guard at the gate said whistling admiringly what a beauty pass on the litter was picked up again and moved forward cailin peeped between the draperies after a while the road stretched across a flat fertile plain with wheat fields orchards and olive groves along both sides beyond lay the sea she could not see it but she could smell it the sharp pungent tang of the salt air rickling her nose she was beginning to feel better the sea was a means of escape and now that she was free of villa maxima she would never again have to degrade herself as she had the last five weeks they moved along at a smooth pace and then she felt the bearers slowing turning peeking out again she saw they had passed through an iron gate and were going down a treelined lane she was in the country again she thought relieved to be free of the noise and stink of constantinople the bearers stopped and the litter was set down again the curtains were drawn aside and a hand extended to her cailin stepped out to discover the hand belonged to an elderly whitehaired man of small stature good day lady i am zeno the majordomo at villa mare the general has bid me welcome you this is your home and we are all at your command he bowed politely his worn face breaking into a friendly smile where is your master zeno she asked him i have not seen the general in several months lady he sent a messenger early this morning with his orders for you zeno replied is he expected soon cailin asked this was odd he has not informed me so lady zeno told her come in now and take some refreshment the day is growing warm and the sun is very hot for late june the city i can but imagine was a tinderbox cailin followed after him i do not like the city she said the noise and the dirt are appalling indeed he agreed i have served the general for many years but when he offered to make me his majordomo at villa mare i kissed his feet in gratitude the older i get the less tolerance i seem to have lady you are not a citizen of byzantium i am a briton cailin told him and accepted a goblet of chilled wine from a smiling servant it is a very savage and barbaric land i am told zeno said with utmost seriousness it is said the people are blue in color but you are not blue lady am i mistaken then cailin couldnt refrain from one little giggle but she quickly soothed the majordomos feelings by telling him in ancient times the warriors among my people painted themselves blue when they went into battle zeno but we are not blueskinned by nature i can see that lady but why did they paint themselves blue our warriors believed that although the enemy might kill them and strip them of their possessions as long as they were painted blue their honor and their dignity could not be taken from them cailin explained to him britain is not a savage land we have been part of the empire for over four hundred years zeno my own family descended from a roman tribune who came there with emperor claudius i can see i have a great deal to learn about the britons lady i hope you will share your knowledge with me i greatly value knowledge zeno said during the next few days cailin explored her new surroundings villa mare was very much like her home in britain had been a simple but very comfortable country villa the atrium had a dear little square fish pond and she enjoyed sitting there in the heat of the day when the outdoors was not particularly comfortable her bedchamber was large and airy there were no more than half a dozen servants all older it was obvious to cailin that general aspar sent those slaves he wished to semiretire to the villa mare where they would have a simpler and easier time of it it seemed a kind act and she grew more curious about the man who had rescued her from villa maxima but he was not it seemed expected by his household at any time soon it was as if he were deliberately leaving her in peace to recover from the ordeal she had suffered these last months if this was indeed fact cailin appreciated it zeno was fascinated by her stories of britain he had never it seemed been anywhere in his entire life but constantinople and the surrounding countryside cailin was surprised to find he was a very cultured man despite his status he could both read and write latin and greek as well as keep accounts he had he explained been raised with the son of a noble of the court of theodosius ii and had come into general aspars household when his master had died deeply in debt then he along with the other slaves of the household were sold you were not born a slave my lady cailin zeno said no she told him i was betrayed by a woman i believed a friend a year ago at this time i was in britain a wife an expectant mother if i had been told that this would be my fate i should have never believed it zeno she smiled softly almost to herself i will go home one day and i will revenge myself on that woman i swear it it was obvious to him that she was of the upper class but because zeno had been born a slave the son and grandson of slaves he did not inquire further it would have been a presumption on his part and he could not despite his curiosity change the habits of a lifetime it did not matter that she was also a slave she was a slave who had been born a patrician she was his better no matter her youth tell me of your master cailin asked him you do not know him zeno said this was interesting i do not even know what he looks like cailin admitted candidly the master of the house in which i served came to me one morning and told me that i had been seen and admired by general aspar who had bought me from him i was then sent here i find it all quite strange zeno smiled no he said it is the kind of thing he would do my lady we who have been with him for so long know his kind heart although it is not his public reputation he would be should be emperor of byzantium my lady but instead he has placed leo on the throne why she asked curious she motioned zeno to sit with her by the atrium pond encouraging him to continue he descends from the alans my lady they were once a pastoral nomadic clan living beyond the black sea the alans were driven from their homeland by the huns a fierce warlike tribe who until recently were ruled by an animal called attila although the general is a christian he is an arian christian whereas the orthodox christians believe that their holy trinity consisting of god the father the son and the holy spirit are one in three and three in one the arians believe that the son is a different being from the god father and subordinate to him they argue back and forth over doctrine although some of our emperors are intrigued by the arians the orthodox church holds sway in byzantium they will not allow an openly arian christian to be crowned emperor the bishops respect general aspar and they know there is no finer military man alive but they would not allow him to be emperor i honestly do not think he wants to be emperor my lady the emperor is never a free man much of the generals heritage remains in him i believe he would rather be a free man than a king does he have a wife zeno or children cailin wondered for many years the general was wed to a good woman of byzantium the lady anna in the first year of their marriage they had a son ardiburius and then later a daughter sophia nine years ago the lady anna after many years of barrenness bore our master a second son patricius the birth weakened her she remained an invalid until her death three years ago villa mare was bought for her pleasure because it was thought the sea air would be salubrious for her we thought the general would remain a bachelor but last year he married again it is a political alliance however the lady flacilla is a widow with two married daughters she does not even live in our masters house in the city but remains in the home she has had for many years she is a woman of the court with powerful connections but i fear she is a poor companion for the general he is lonely the trouble with old and valued servants came a deep voice is that they know far too much about one and are given to idle chatter zeno leapt up and kneeling before the man who had entered the atrium kissed the hem of his cloak forgive an old fool my lord he said and then why did you not send word you were coming because this house is always in perfect order to receive me zeno aspar said helping the old man to his feet now go and bring me some chilled wine the cyprian wine for i have had a long hot ride having dismissed the servant he turned to cailin you are wellrested he asked politely thank you my lord she tried not to stare zeno has made you comfortable he said god she is beautiful he thought he had bought her on a whim out of pity but now he realized perhaps he had not been foolish after all it had been a long time since any woman had made his heart race and his loins stir with desire i have been treated with nothing but kindness my lord cailin told him softly he is a very attractive man she considered realizing the place she would occupy in this house from his look here let me take your cloak she said unfastening the diamond button of the garment and laying it aside he stood just two or three inches taller than she was he was not nearly as tall as wulf or the trio of northmen had been but his body had a solid almost square look to it he was obviously a general who kept himself in as good condition as his own men were required to keep themselves what is the fragrance you are wearing he asked her it was intoxicating him with its elusiveness i wear no fragrance my lord but i do bathe daily cailin told him nervously stepping away from him it is probably the scent of the soap that lingers on my skin we will bathe together after i have had my wine the ride was hot and the city even hotter do you like it here by the sea i was raised in the country my lord and lived there until i came to constantinople i prefer it to the city she answered him calmly but her heart was thundering in her ears we will bathe together if there had been any doubt in her mind as to what position she was to hold in his life before there was certainly none any longer zeno returned with the wine and aspar sat down on the marble bench by the fish pond sipping the cool beverage slowly and with obvious appreciation cailin stood silently by his side watching him his hair was deep brown sprinkled with bits of silver it was cut short and brushed away from the crown of his head it was a practical style for a military man the hand holding the goblet was large and square the fingers long and powerfullooking there was a big gold ring upon his middle finger the ruby in it was cut to resemble a doubleheaded eagle the symbol of byzantium he felt her stare and looked up suddenly cailin blushed caught at her scrutiny he smiled it was a quick mischievous smile like that of a small boy his teeth were white and even and the eyes that twinkled at her a silvery gray the lines about his eyes that crinkled with amusement told her that he smiled easily i think my nose too big what do you think cailin he smiled again and her knees went just a trifle weak he wasnt quite handsome but there was something about him i think your nose very nice my lord she replied the nostrils flare a bit too much he told her now my mouth is very wellproportioned neither too big nor too little our friend jovian has a cupids bow of a mouth quite unsuitable for a man dont you think it was probably charming when he was a child jovian is still a bit of a child cailin observed aspar chuckled so there is a keen eye and i suspect an intellect to go with that beautiful face and form i was not aware that my face was particularly visible when you saw me last my lord and my form was quite contorted or so it felt cailin said humorously then she grew serious why did you buy me my lord is it your habit to purchase inmates of brothels i thought you the bravest woman i had ever seen aspar told her you were struggling to survive at villa maxima i saw it in the blank stare you favored the audience with and the stoic way in which you accepted the degradation visited upon you in that obscene playlet of jovians the empire that rules the world or at least most of it is governed by those same deviates who found your shame entertaining i am a member of that ruling class but i find those people more frightening than any danger i have ever faced in battle when i impulsively purchased you from jovianwho by the way would not have dared to refuse my requesti was doing so because i felt your bravery should be rewarded by freeing you from the hell you so gallantly endured now however i think perhaps there was another reason as well you stir my blood it seems his frankness amazed her cailin struggled for composure there must be many beautiful women in byzantium my lord she said it is i have been told a city of uniquely beautiful women surely there are others more worthy of your attention than myself a humble slave from britain his laughter startled her by god i would not have thought coyness a part of your nature cailin it does not become you i fear aspar told her i have never been coy in my entire life she sputtered indignantly then do not start now he chided her you are a beautiful woman i desire you since i bought you there is it would seem little you can do except bear with the horrendous fate i have in store for you he put down his goblet and arose to stand facing her yes you own me cailin said and to her dismay tears sprang into her eyes which she seemed powerless to control i am bound to obey you my lord but you will never have all of me for there is a part of myself that only i can give no man can take he caught her chin between his thumb and forefinger stunned by her honest declaration and moved by her passionate defiance tears slipped slowly down her smooth cheeks like tiny crystal beads my god he exclaimed did you know that your eyes glisten like amethysts when you weep like that cailin you break my heart cease i beg you my beauty i surrender humbly before your feet i hate being a slave she told him desperately and why is it that you can penetrate the defenses i have so carefully built up around myself these last months when no one else could i am a better tactician than any of the others he told her teasingly besides cailin although you tempt my baser nature i find you fascinating on several other levels as well he brushed away her tears carefully with a single finger i have finished my wine now we will become better acquainted in the bath i promise i will try not to make you cry again if you will not be coy do we have a bargain my beauty i think i am being most generous she could not be angry with him he was really very kind but she was a little fearful of him nonetheless i agree she said finally come then he said taking her hand and leading her from the atrium chapter thebathatvillamarewas unique in that it was not an interior room it faced the sea and had an open portico that could be closed off by means of shutters in cold or inclement weather the view from the room was both beautiful and soothing the walls were decorated in mosaic one pictured neptune the sea god standing tall amid the waves a trident in one hand and a conch shell in the other upon which he was blowing behind him silverblue dolphins leapt a second wall offered a scene of neptunes many daughters cavorting among the waves with a troupe of sea horses while the third wall showed the mighty king of the sea seducing a beautiful maiden in an underwater cave the mosaic floor of the bath pictured fish and sea life of every kind known to the artist it was both colorful and amusing there was a tiled dressing room off the bath but the main room served all the steps necessary to bathing unlike the elegant bath complex at villa maxima with its many different rooms the bathing pool was set in seablue tiles and the water gently warm a corner fountain with a marble basin ran with cool water there were shellshaped depressions with drains for rinsing and benches for massage aspar dismissed the old slave who served as bath attendant the lady cailin wishes to serve me he told the woman and she grinned a toothless grin that bespoke pure conspiracy cackling as she departed discretion is wasted here cailin told him pinning up her long hair remove your chiton he said i want to see you as god made you cailin bent over as you were the last time i viewed your charms i could see little of much note so covered were you by those northmen you may be sorry you did not buy one of them she teased him mischievously and slipped the simple garment over her head tossing it carelessly upon a bench then she stood silent and still amazed that she was not mortified but then her stay at villa maxima had she suspected rid her of all false modesty turn slowly he commanded her quietly his admiration obvious then he removed his own garments unfastening the crossgartering on his braccos and slipping them off to be followed by his drawers tunic and fine linen chemise as cailin turned back to face him she found aspar quite as naked as she herself was startled by his action she blushed he stood quietly allowing her the same advantage as he had had and then he turned too her first impression had been a good one his body was firm wellmuscled and kissed by the sun he was not fat nor was he largeboned there was a solid stockiness to him that she found comforting his arms and legs were hairless as was his chest he had longer legs than she would have expected and a wellsculpted hard torso his buttocks were tight his male organs seemed smaller than she was used to but she suspected he was of quite average size her barbarians and wulf had been the exceptions to the rule casia had assured her when they had once spoken on it her curiosity had led her to question the lovely courtesan who had tutored her so well in the arts of eros casia had been a font of useful and rather fascinating information for cailin who was so lacking in practical experience regarding men and lovemaking his voice brought her back to the present do you find me as beautiful as i find you cailin he asked her yes she said quietly he was an attractive man and she saw no reason not to tell him so take up the strigil now and scrape me he ordered her i am filthy from my ride the roads are particularly dusty at this time of year cailin picked up the silver bathing tool and began to remove the sweat and grime that his ride in the heat of the day had deposited on his skin she had watched the bath attendants at villa maxima at their trade for casia had warned her that men frequently enjoyed being served this way by their lovers slowly carefully she worked moving from his shoulders and chest down his arms and back and legs you have a skill for this work he said softly as she knelt before him carefully running the bath instrument over his thighs i am a novice at such a task she said but i am glad i please you my lord she rinsed him with a basin of warm water taken from the bathing pool and he took the strigil from her hands i will scrape you now he said softly plying the tool cailin stood very still as he moved the strigil gently over her delicate skin she found this loveplay rather charming his restraint in claiming his rights was very reassuring she sighed as he rinsed her and turning to face him she said now my lord i will wash you before we enter the bathing pool he stood in one of the hollowed mosaic shells in the floor cailin placed an alabaster jar of soft soap on the floor nearby and took up a sea sponge scooping some soap from the jar she spread it over his shoulders and then worked up a lather using the sponge slowly carefully she washed him working in an efficient manner turning him about as she knelt adding more soap scrubbing with the sponge she blushed selfconsciously as she bathed his manhood but to his credit he said nothing remaining quiet as she worked cailin stood swirling the soapy sponge over his belly and up his broad chest finished she rinsed him again with warm water relieved the ordeal was over she had never bathed a man before wulf had always washed himself usually in the fastrunning stream near the hall even in winter now you may enter the bathing pool she told him nay he answered her and took the sponge from her hand you must be washed first my beauty bending he rinsed the sponge in the bronze basin and tipping the dirty water out refilled it with fresh i can bathe myself she said shyly im certain you can he said laughter evident in his tone but would you deny me the pleasure serving you will give me not waiting for her answer he dipped his three fingers into the alabaster pot and began to slowly spread soap over her shoulders and back the slow circular motion of the sea sponge on her skin was almost mesmerizing in its sensuous movement she thought she felt his lips touch the back of her neck and then the soapy sponge swirled over it leaving her confused kneeling he washed her buttocks kissing them first and then moved on to her legs turn he said and she obeyed although her body was already beginning to feel heavy with desire how lovely all of this was bathing with a man was most pleasurable he lifted her left foot and washed it then the right the sponge swept slowly up her legs which were tightly closed gently he pushed them slightly apart the sponge sliding over her sensitive skin cailin turned her head and looked away she was unused to seeing her venus mont so pink and smooth devoid of its little curls but only men peasants and savages jovian had assured her kept such body hair a woman must be silken all over her stomach knotted itself as his hand rubbed soap over the quivering flesh cailin closed her eyes as the sponge rubbed round and round and round his hand gently drew her forward and cailin gasped startled as his mouth closed over the nipple of her right breast his teeth lightly scored the flesh his tongue teased insistently at her and then he suckled hard on the tight little nub even as his left hand caressed then crushed her other breast until her knees began to buckle standing quickly he pulled her hard against him his mouth finding hers with a burning kiss that left her breathless then his gray eyes held her in thrall as he rinsed her slowly being certain that every bit of soap was washed away finally placing the basin down he took her by the hand and led her down the steps into the bathing pool the warm water lapped softly at their bodies cailin felt weak in the sudden heat seeing how pale she was he drew her against him again when he felt her trembling aspar said softly even as he began to place little kisses all over her face i do not want you to be fearful of me cailin but you must know i want to make love to you do you know how sweet iovemaking can be between a man and a woman my beauty not that ugly animal coupling you were forced to endure at villa maxima but true passion between lovers tell me were you a virgin when you first came to constantinople or did some other lover initiate you into the wondrous sweetness two people can create tenderly he nibbled on her earlobe and then he looked directly into her violet eyes i i had a husband cailin told him what happened to him my beauty aspar gently encouraged her i do not know my lord i was betrayed into slavery she told him and then went on to explain briefly jovian says that wulf was probably told i was dead she finished several tears slid down her cheeks i think he is correct i just wish i knew what happened to our child i am so afraid that antonia may have sold it too if indeed it lived but our child would be strong i know it is alive you cannot change the past he counseled her wisely i understand that better than most cailin if you will trust me i will give you a happy present and your future will be everything you could ever want it would seem my lord that i have no choice she replied trust she thought wryly why were men always asking you to trust them oh my beauty he said with a smile we always have a choice it is just sometimes our choices are not particularly pleasant your choices however are you may love me now or you may love me later cailin giggled your choices my lord bear a great similarity to one and another she already liked this man he was kind and he had humor these were not bad traits in one so powerful he smiled back at her she excited him very much rousing him in a way no woman really ever had even his beloved anna it had been a long time since he had really desired a woman although he had visited villa maxima quite regularly he firmly believed that a man should not allow his juices to be pent up for too long to do so foggled the brain and made a man irritable he knew however looking at this beautiful girl before him that he would never visit villa maxima again i like it when you laugh my beauty he said softly i like it when you smile at me my lord she responded and then she kissed him on the lips quickly without passion but sweetly in answer he cupped her head in one hand and began to kiss her face and throat with warm lips that sent tingles of pleasure throughout her entire being she moaned low in the back of her throat arching her body as his other hand began to knead at a breast and he pushed her back against the side of the pool he ran his tongue over her lips nibbled at her eyelids tongued the column of her straining neck his hand dug into the tightly bunched curls pinned atop her head and then he groaned as if pained when her body pushed against his lower torso her arms slipped about his neck cailin returning his kisses with fervor realized she had no need to employ casias tricks with aspar she felt his hungry arousal against her thigh pushing pressing with urgency i want to wait he half sobbed but i cannot cailin do not my lord she encouraged him tightening her hold about his neck as he slid his hands beneath her buttocks and sheathed himself within her passage sighing with deep relief he pumped her with long slow strokes of his weapon and she felt him hard but loving within her body she murmured low as he moved inside her over and over again until he could bear no more and his lovers tribute exploded in hot bursts of passion that left him weak and cailin shocked that she had felt nothing but his physical presence she shuddered horrified aspar opened his eyes what is the matter he asked her you had no pleasure of it did you cailin yet think i do not displease you my beauty do i he was free of her body now and they stood together facing each other her back still against the bathing pool is there only pleasure with a husband she asked him honestly confused and needing desperately to know i felt no pleasure when was forced to couple with jovians trio of northmen but i thought it was because i did not love them because what they were doing to me was wrong you are not my husband but you are kind to me i want to serve you like a wife should there not be pleasure then my lord you do not repel me you do not her voice cracked and she began to weep wildly what has happened to me my lord that i can feel no pleasure with you he took her in his arms and soothed her as best as he could he was not a doctor but he knew that the mind was probably the most powerful weapon that god had ever created he had seen strange things happen to soldiers in the field particularly after a cruel battle men normally hardened and fierce who would break down weeping men who could never look at weapons again without breaking into a fit of trembling sweats perhaps the brutal savagery cailin had endured had hurt her in a similar way he remembered the blank look in her eyes the night he had attended the entertainment at villa maxima she had in a sense removed herself from what was going on upon the stage because it was the only way she could survive it what has happened to you since you left britain has hurt you in some unseen manner he told her comfortingly if you will trust me i will help you to heal yourself my beauty i very much want you to have the same pleasure of me as i have had of you unlike most men of my age i have a rather unusually large capacity for lovemaking cailin we will continue on until you too are pleasured no matter how long it takes he took her hand come now before we are so weakened that we are washed away in this bath he led her from the bathing pool and they dried each other off then taking her hand again he brought her to their bedchamber cailin was surprised to see that her pretty narrow little couch had been removed from the dais and pushed against a wall in its place upon the raised platform was a large striped mattress and several large colorful pillows aspar began kissing her again and shortly they fell to the bed their limbs intertwined the sensation of his body against hers was totally different here than in the bathing pool he seemed harder lie still he commanded her and pushing two of the pillows beneath her hips to raise her up he told her i want you to spread your legs wide for me my beauty and when she obeyed him he leaned forward gently spread her nether lips with his thumbs and began to touch her lightly and softly with his tongue cailin gasped with shock and surprise her first thought was to push him away this was an invasion of such a deeply intimate nature such as she had never experienced yet there was a tenderness to it and a sweetness that hypnotized her so thoroughly that she found she was unable to deny him his way with her his tongue gently caressed her flesh then began to tease at the tiny core of her very being cailin felt heat suffusing her entire body yet she shivered the little nub began to sharply tingle the sensation growing in intensity until she thought she could simply bear no more but for the life of her she could find no voice to beg him to stop she let the deliciousness take her and she heard herself as if from a distance moaning with her own pleasure her limbs were heavy with a longing she had never experienced but did not find unpleasant in the least the feeling was building even more with each passing moment until finally an intense sweetness swept over her like a wave from the sea and receded as quickly leaving her weak but most strangely satisfied ahhhhh she exhaled breathily then quite unexpectedly she began to cry softly aspar pulled himself up and gathered the girl in his arms he said nothing he simply stroked those riotous little auburn curls marveling at their softness as his fingers became tangled amid the silk of her lovely hair she pressed herself against him as if seeking his protection and he was overwhelmed by his own desire to keep her safe from all the cruelty of the world no matter what had happened to her cailin was in her heart an innocent he was not going to let her be hurt again finally her sobs subsided and she said you received no pleasure my lord yet i did how can this be i did not know a woman could be pleasured in such a way she looked up at him and he thought that her beautiful eyes resembled violets wet with a spring rain there is pleasure in just giving pleasure cailin not perhaps as intense for me as when i am encased within you but pleasure nonetheless there are many ways of giving and receiving pleasure we will explore them all i will never intentionally do you harm my little love he told her stroking her cheek with a gentle finger they say you are the most powerful man in the empire my lord even more powerful than the emperor himself she said never say that aloud to anyone else cailin he warned her the powerful are jealous of their power and would not share it my survival depends upon remaining a good servant of the empire it is really the empire honor god and the empire no man but that my little love must remain our secret eh he smiled at her you are like the romans of old i think my lord you honor the new rome byzantium as they once honored the old rome cailin said and what do you know of rome he asked her amused i sat with my brothers and their tutor for many years cailin said i learned the history of rome and of my native britain can you read and write he questioned her fascinated in latin she responded the history of my mothers people the dobunni celts is an oral history but i know it my lord jovian told me little of your background cailin your latin is that of a cultured woman if a bit provincial who were your people i descend from a tribune of the drusus family who came to britain with the emperor claudius cailin said and then as they lay together she told him her familys history and your husband who was he also of a romanobriton family my husband was a saxon cailin said married him after my family was murdered at the instigation of my cousin quintus who wanted my fathers lands my cousin was unaware i had escaped the slaughter until i came with my husband wulf ironfist to reclaim what was rightfully mine wulf killed quintus when he attempted to attack me it was his wife antonia who betrayed me but you already know that part of my story my lord it is amazing that you have survived it all aspar said thoughtfully now you know everything about me zeno has told me that your first wife was a good and an honorable woman what he did not say about the wife you now have is more of interest cailin said if you would tell me my lord i should like to know flacilla is a member of the strabo family aspar began they are very powerful at court our marriage was one of convenience she does not live with me and frankly i do not even like her then why did you marry her cailin asked curiously you did not need to marry again at this time my lord you have one grown son zeno says and a second son as well as a daughter did zeno mention my grandchildren aspar demanded with a certain humor in his voice my daughter sophia has three children and my eldest son has four since patricius my youngest shows no signs of wanting to be a monk i can assume he too will give me more grandchildren one day when he is grown and wed you have grandchildren cailin was astounded he did not look that old and his behavior was certainly not that of an old man how old are you my lord aspar i was nineteen in the month of april he groaned dear god i am certainly old enough to be your father my little love i am fiftyfour this may past you are nothing like my father she murmured and then she boldly pulled his head to her and kissed him softly sweetly his head swam pleasantly with her daring no he said his gray eyes smiling into her violet ones i am not your father am i my little love he kissed her back a long slow deep kiss cailins senses reeled finally when she recovered herself she said tell me more about your wife my lord aspar i like the sound of my name upon your lips he said the lady flacilla strabo my lord aspar she insisted i married her for several reasons the late emperor marcian whom i placed upon the throne of byzantium and married to the princess pulcheria was dying and there were no heirs marcian came from my own household he had served me loyally for twenty years when i realized his end was near i chose leo another of my household to be the next emperor i needed certain support from the court however the patriarch of constantinople the citys religious leader is a relation of the strabo family and family ties are strong here without him i could not have hoped to place leo on the throne to ensure his support and that of the strabo family i married the widowed flacilla she was pregnant with a lovers child at the time and was causing her family untold embarrassment what happened to the child cailin wondered aloud she miscarried it in her fifth month he said but it was too late she was my wife in return for my aid the patriarch and the strabo family supported my choice of leo of course other patrician families followed suit this allowed us a peaceful transition from one emperor to another civil war is unpleasant at the least cailin and flacilla is to all outward appearances a good wife she has taken my little son patricius in her charge and is a very good mother to him he is being raised in the orthodox faith i hope to match him with the princess ariadne one day and make him leos heir for the emperor has no sons what do you want of me my lord i mean other than the obvious cailin asked him and then she blushed at her own audacity still her life since leaving britain had been so unsettled she needed to know if she was to have a permanent home he thought for several long minutes i loved my first wife he began when anna died i thought that i should never again care for a woman i certainly do not like flacilla but i serve a purpose for her her social stature is practically as high as the empress verina for i am the general of the eastern armies and the first patrician of the empire flacilla in turn mothers my orphaned son but that is all she does for me i am powerful cailin but i am alone and the honest truth is i am a lonely man when i saw you that night at villa maxima you touched me as no woman has ever really touched me i need your love i need your gentleness and i need your companionship in my life do you think that you can give it to me my beauty my grandfather said i had a sharp tongue and i do cailin told him slowly i am practical to a fault if there is any gentleness left in me my lord aspar you are possibly the only one to see it now what i must say to you will sound hard but i have learned in the last year to be hard in order to survive you are not a young man yet i am your slave if you should die what will happen to me do you think that your heirs will treat the slave mistress of their father with kindness i think not i believe that i shall be disposed of with all the other possessions that you own that will be considered unnecessary can i love you yes i can i believe you to be kind and good but if you truly care for me my lord then make provisions to keep me safe when you are not here to do so yourself until that time i will serve you with all my heart and soul he nodded quietly she was right he would have to make arrangements to protect her when he no longer could i will go to the city tomorrow and arrange for everything he promised her you will be free upon my death and have an inheritance to keep you if you bear my children i will provide for them and recognize them as well it is more than fair cailin said relief sweeping over her when she awoke in the morning aspar was gone from their bed he has gone to the city zeno said smiling he says to tell you that he will return in several days time my lady he has also told me that you are to be considered mistress here and we will obey you my lord aspar is a generous man cailin said quietly i must rely upon you zeno to help me do what is proper and correct my ladys wisdom is only excelled by her great beauty the elderly majordomo replied pleased by her tactful response and the certainty that everything would remain the same aspar returned a few days later from constantinople within a short time it was obvious to his servants that he intended to make villa mare his primary residence he left only to attend to court business and oversee his duties as general of the eastern armies he was rarely away overnight he and cailin had settled down to a very quiet domestic existence cailin was surprised to learn that aspar owned all the farmland about the villa for several miles there were vineyards olive groves and wheat fields all contributing to the generals wealth he thought nothing of helping out in the fields or working to harvest the grapes she rather suspected he enjoyed it in the city aspars absence from his elegant palace was not noticed at first but the empress verina a clever woman kept her ear to the ground in all quarters she and her husband had not the advantage of inheritance to keep their thrones safe aspar was important to them although an excellent public servant leo was not a master of intrigue at this early point in his reign but his wife raised in byzantium knew that the more one knew the safer one was a servants idle gossip caught her ear at first and then she heard it again this time from a minor official the empress invited her brother basilicus to come and visit her they sat on a terrace overlooking the propontis called by some the marmara one afternoon in late autumn sipping the first of the new wine verina was a beautiful woman with ivory skin and long black hair which she wore in an elaborate coiffure of braids that were fastened with jeweled pins her red and gold stola was of rich materials and the low neckline showed her fine bosom to its best advantage her slippers were bejeweled and she wore several ropes of pearls so translucent they seemed to shimmer against her skin and gown she smiled at her brother what is this hear about aspar she purred what is it you have heard about aspar my pet he countered it is said that he has closed up his palace and now lives in the countryside outside the city the empress said is it true i would not know sister dear basilicus replied i have not seen aspar socially for months now i see him only when we have mutual court business to attend to which is infrequently why would you care where aspar lives verina although he is responsible for leos ascent you have never cared particularly for him i know for a fact that his presence irritates you for it only serves to remind you that he is responsible for your good fortune it is said there is a woman living with him basilicus the empress said ignoring her brothers astute observation you know that aspars wife flacilla is my friend i would be very distressed to have flacilla embarrassed by her husbands peccadillos nonsense sister you are simply consumed by curiosity basilicus replied if indeed aspar is living with some mistress nothing i suspect would please you more than to drop a hint in flacillas shelllike ear thereby enraging her you know that aspar agreed to marry her only if she would remain discreet in her little adventures and not embarrass her family again aspar is not a man to install a mistress in his house but if indeed he has then by living in the country he is making an attempt to be circumspect in his affair besides there is nothing wrong with a man taking a mistress verina it is my opinion that our good general deserves a modicum of pleasure in his life he will never obtain it from your dear friend flacilla who takes lovers like some women gather flowers in a field and with less discretion i might add flacilla is young yet she is many years her husbands junior the empress said aspar could not keep up with her i assure you she could not keep up with him basilicus said with a laugh aspar is known to be a prodigious lover my dear sister an eighteenyearold could not keep up with him i am told by most reliable sources besides flacilla has two grown daughters she is hardly in the first bloom of youth herself she had her children when she was fifteen and sixteen verina said in defense of the lady they were fifteen and sixteen when she married them off last year that only makes her thirtytwo aspar is at least twenty years her senior if he has taken a mistress it will make my poor flacilla the laughingstock of all of constantinople you must find out me basilicus looked horrified how could i find out you must go to visit aspar in the country basilicus perhaps these rumors are nothing more than that rumors but if they are true then i must inform flacilla before she is shamed before the court go to the country verina i detest the country i havent left the city in several years there is nothing to do in the country besides flacilla should be delighted if aspar has taken a mistress it will keep him occupied amused and uninterested in her affairs she almost caused a dreadful scandal again last week when the young gladiator she had been amusing herself with decided he was in love with her after she attempted to discard him i didnt hear that the empress said annoyed and curious as to why her network of spies had not reported this rather interesting tidbit to her what happened basilicus i can see you know every delicious detail tell me at once or i shall have you blinded he chuckled and pouring himself another goblet of wine began well my dear sister your friend flacilla had taken a young gladiator to her bed whom she had first seen at the spring games a thracian named nichophorus rather beefy i thought but those muscular thighs of his were irresistible i suspect as is usual with flacilla after a few months time familiarity began to breed contempt she grew tired of her muscular adonis and besides her eye had lit upon michael valens the young actor our flacilla was struck anew by cupids dart what happened to the gladiator verina demanded he caught them at the very same trysting place flacilla had once shared with him basilicus replied she is not a woman of great imagination is she sister you would have thought she would have chosen another site to carry on her little passion but no twas the very same spot nichophorus informed by some mischief maker found them there he howled and raged beating upon the door of the chamber in which your friend and her lover were cowering finally he broke the door down michael valens no hero fearful that his beautiful face would be destroyed escaped through a window naked as the day his mother had birthed him im told leaving a semigarbed flacilla to contend with the outraged gladiator he railed loudly against her cursing her and naming her a whore to all who would listen the innkeeper finally called out the guard who chased after nichophorus as he ran screaming after flacillas litter which was making its way down the streets of the city at an unusually great rate of speed basilicus laughed the captain of the guard and his men were of course bought off by the patriarch the scandal was hushed up nichophorus was sent to cyprus it is a very good thing aspar was not in the city when it happened he warned flacilla when they married that if she caused any public scandal he would send her to st barbaras convent for the rest of her life the empress nodded yes he did and the patriarch agreed to support him in such an instance the strabo family is not just a little annoyed by flacillas indiscreet behavior and their patience is worn thin by her hmmmmm i wonder to what use i may put all this information but of course the puzzle is incomplete until i know exactly what is going on at aspars villa her amber eyes glittered wickedly you will leave in the morning brother he groaned as he arose kissing her hand the empresss wish is my command but verina i will expect the favor of my choice for this little task i undertake on your behalf remember that within reason basilicus she purred smiling broadly after him he was such a good brother the empress thought fondly as she watched him leave whatever was happening at the generals villa basilicus would obtain the entire story analyze it and return to her with it if she could not decide how to use his information he would be able to advise her they were very close and always had been basilicus left the city early the following day he traveled in a large comfortable litter preferring not to ride in the warm sun to his surprise he napped most of the way awakening as they entered through the gates of the villa zeno the majordomo greeted him politely recognizing the prince from his own days at the generals house in constantinople where is your master basilicus asked he is walking by the sea my lord zeno replied basilicus was about to tell zeno to send a servant for aspar but instead decided that he might learn something of value if he took his friend unawares thank you zeno he said if you will but direct me he followed the majordomo through the atrium of the villa and across the interior garden out into a large open garden that looked over the propontis and beyond into asia there is the path my lord zeno told him pointing basilicus hurried along the gravel walkway it was a marvelous day with a flat bright blue cloudless sky above the autumn sun was warm and about him the damask rosebushes sported a mixture of late blooms and large fat round redorange rosehips then he saw themaspar and a woman laughing together upon the beach the woman wore a white chiton and was barefoot as was her companion who was gatbed in a short red tunic the sea was almost flat a mixture of azure aquamarine and tealgreen stretching like an iridescent fabric across to the hills on the other shore above them the gulls mewled and cried swooping to the water and then pulling up sharply to soar in the windless sky basilicus watched them for a long moment enchanted by the picture they made and then he called out raising his hand and waving at the couple aspar my friend he stepped from the pathway to the sandy beach and began walking toward them jesu aspar swore softly beneath his breath it is basilicus the empresss brother cailin replied did you invite him of course not he has obviously heard something my little love he is a clever and a sly fox he has come with a purpose you may be certain i can only wonder at what it is he is very handsome she observed aspar felt a twinge of jealousy at her words he had no cause he knew to doubt her she was simply making an observation and yet he felt resentful he did not want to share cailin with anyone he thought as basilicus finally reached them is there some emergency that you invade my privacy he said ungraciously to his friend basilicus was somewhat taken aback by the unfriendly tone of the generals voice dear lord caught between his sisters unbridled curiosity and the annoyance of the most powerful man in the empire no one would envy him his position at this moment there is no emergency he said i simply felt like a day in the country aspar i did not believe my arrival would cause you to behave like a bear with a sore paw basilicus replied put off but determined to remain your guest will be thirsty and hungry my lord cailin said quietly i will go and make certain that zeno has refreshments prepared she nodded politely at the prince and left the two men on the bench what a glorious creature basilicus said who is she and where you fortunate man did you find her why are you here his companion demanded bluntly you detest the country basilicus there is another reason i know verina sent me basilicus admitted honesty always worked with aspar the prince knew besides aspar was not a man to trifle with particularly when he was in a difficult mood such as now good lord what does your sister want of me that she would send you to the country after me basilicus tell me we will not return to the house until you do then aspar chuckled obviously finding humor in the situation your poor body will soon go into shock my friend i do not believe it has been in the warmth of the sun in years verina heard that you had closed up your house in the city and moved out to your villa she has also heard that you have taken a mistress you know her curiosity is greater than most womens basilicus said to aspar and of course she is flacillas friend and she hopes to get me in her debt aspar observed wisely how well you seem to know my sister basilicus said mockingly i also know of the recent scandal involving my wife that the patriarch hushed up aspar replied i may be living in the country basilicus but my channels of information have simply stretched a bit farther there is little happening in the city that i do not know about because i am happy and because my wifes relations have quieted the gossip surrounding her and her recent lovers i am content to let the matter rest lest my own arrangement be brought to light you know as well as i do basilicus that flacilla is perfectly capable of creating a scandal around this villa and its inhabitants simply to deflect attention from her own outrageous behavior because she is not a happy woman the idea that i should be happy would be galling to her that is why i live here now rather than in the city my conduct is subject to less scrutiny at villa mare or so i believed until today you do not seem to be living a very profligate life aspar basilicus observed as they now walked from the beach up the garden path to the villa indeed if i had not known you i would have assumed you were simply a welltodo gentleman and his wife now tell me before i die of curiosity who the girl is and where you found her you do not recognize her basilicus the prince shook his dark head no i do not think back my friend to a night several months ago when you and i together visited the villa maxima to take in a notorious and particularly salacious entertainment that had the city agog aspar said basilicus thought a moment and then his dark eyes grew wide no he said it cannot be is it you bought that girl i do not believe it that exquisite creature with you on the beach is patricianborn without a doubt she cannot be the same girl she is aspar said and then offered his friend a brief history of cailin and how she had come to villa maxima so you rescued her from a life of shame basilicus noted what a soft heart you have aspar it would be better that others including my sister and your wife not know it i suspect i am only softhearted where cailin is concerned the general told his friend she makes me happy and is more a wife to me than flacilla has ever been anna would have liked her too you are in love basilicus accused almost enviously aspar said nothing but neither did he deny the charge what will you do my old friend basilicus asked you will not be content to live in the shadows with your cailin for very long i know perhaps i will seek a divorce from flacilla aspar said the patriarch cannot deny me particularly given this recent scandal she has caused it is past time she was shut up in a convent she is a constant embarrassment to her family eventually she will do something so mad that they will not be able to cover up her behavior they walked across the portico facing the sea and into the interior garden of the villa where chilled wine and honey cakes awaited them cailin was nowhere to be seen and they were served by a silent slave who at a sign from his master withdrew to allow them privacy even if you were allowed to divorce flacilla strabo basilicus observed you would never be allowed to marry a woman who had begun her life in constantinople as performer in the citys most notorious brothel surely you realize that aspar you must realize it cailin is a patrician born into one of romes oldest and most distinguished families aspar argued her tenure at villa maxima was not of her own making she was not used as a common whore and she only performed in that obscene playlet less than a dozen times my god basilicus there were women in the audience the night i first saw her who were coupling with slave boys and all were of good family the prince sighed i cannot argue with your logic but neither can you argue with the plain facts yes there were women of distinguished families seeking illicit entertainment but they were not performing for the delectation of several hundred people twice weekly even my sister could be moved by cailins story but she would still not approve a marriage between you besides the girl is a pagan she could be baptized basilicus by the patriarch himself ensuring that i would have an orthodox wife and children aspar said you are living in a fools paradise my old friend the prince told him you are too important to byzantium to be allowed this romantic folly and you will not be i assure you keep the girl as your mistress and continue to be discreet it is all you will be allowed but at least you will be together aspar i will not tell my sister of your other desires they would frighten her for they are so unlike you i am the most powerful man in byzantium the kingmaker they say and yet i cannot have my own happiness aspar said bitterly he swallowed several gulps of wine i must remain married to a highborn bitch who whores among the lower classes but i must not marry my highborn mistress because for a short time she was forced into carnal slavery have you freed her basilicus asked of course aspar answered i told cailin she would be freed legally upon my death but actually she is free now i feared she might leave me if she knew the truth although she is really quite helpless she wants to return to her native britain to avenge herself upon the woman who sent her into slavery but how could she do it without help and who would help her only those seeking to take advantage of her and besides basilicus said gently you love her do not regret what you cannot have aspar take what you can have you have cailin and she is yours for as long as you desire her no one will deny you your mistress even if flacilla protests to the heavens over it the court knows your wife for what she really is and no one would seek to see you unhappy do you understand what i am saying to you aspar the general nodded bleakly i understand what will you tell your sister basilicus it must be enough to keep her content he laughed yes verina is more curious than a cat well i shall tell her that you have taken a charming beautiful mistress to yout bed and are living quite contentedly with her at villa mare in order to avoid any scandal or public argument with flacilla she will think you justified despite her friendship with your wife and that will be the end of it i suspect verina thinks i do not lie to her although i find i must sometimes in order to protect her or to protect myself the prince chuckled besides i shall not be lying i shall simply not be telling her the entire truth but then she really does not need to know the whole story does she he grinned at aspar i do not know why leo does not use you in the diplomatic service aspar said his gray eyes twinkling my brotherinlaw does not trust me basilicus replied he also does not like me i fear his high office has turned him from a dull little man into a dull little man who grows more righteous and more pious as each day passes the priests adore him aspar you had best watch that quarter lest they convince leo of his own infallibility and that generals are unnecessary to gods grand design for byzantium you may not like leo or he you aspar said but he is the perfect man to be emperor and he possesses more common sense than you would suspect for now he lacks ego although eventually as with all men in power the ego will rear its ugly head to cause him difficulties he loves byzantium basilicus and is a good administrator i chose the right man and the priests know i did although they forced me into that little bargain to gain their most vocal support they are content with leo and so are the people marcian gave us prosperity and more peace than we had had in many years leo is his most worthy heir i would think you would not care much for peace the prince said aspar laughed twenty thirty years ago i could not get enough of war but now i have had my fill i am in the twilight of my life i wish nothing more than to live in peace here with cailin may god grant you that wish aspar my friend it seems a very little wish to me basilicus told the general now am i to be introduced to that exquisite girl or must i return to my sisters with the news i neither saw nor spoke with this divine creature who has made you depart your palace in constantinople chapter isshebeautifulthe empress demanded of her brother outrageously so basilicus replied smiling he had left villa mare in early afternoon of the same day he had arrived hurrying back to the city to report to his eagerly waiting sister fair of skin verina asked her skin is as white and as smooth as a marble statue my dear what color are her eyes it depends upon the light basilicus told his sister sometimes they are like twin amethysts and at other times they appear like early spring violets he reported poetically and her hair verina was growing more intrigued as her brother spoke basilicus was not a man to lavish praise easily her hair is auburn a mass of little ringlets that fall to just below her hips she wears it loose and it is most charming do not tell me the empress said her curls are natural i am certain how fortunate she is but who is she basilicus a young patrician widow of roman ancestry from britain he answered serenely she is most charming verina and she loves aspar if you saw them together you would assume them to be a happily married couple how did this woman arrive in byzantium my brother a widow you say was her husband a byzantine does she have children come now basilicus you are not telling me everything you know the empress looked sharply at her brother her husband was a saxon i am told their child was lost to them i have absolutely no idea how she came to byzantium really verina it was embarrassing enough crossexamining aspar for you simply to satisfy your childish curiosity i have done my best and will do no more he huffed how old is aspars little mistress and what is her name the empress pressed him certainly you know that much the girl is nineteen and her name is cailin basilicus answered nineteen verina winced poor flacilla flacilla deserves whatever she gets snapped basilicus eager to escape his sisters questioning before he told her something he should not tell her for some reason verina was making him very anxious she knew something but he did not know what she knew he shifted nervously verina saw her brothers discomfort i had a visitor this morning brother dear she said sweetly too sweetly i probably should not confide this to you men are so foolish about these things but since you are obviously holding something back from me i must tell you so that you will speak freely to me you know that leo rarely visits my bed any longer he listens to his clerics who declare women unclean a necessary evil for reproduction who should otherwise be avoided i do not know how he thinks we will get a son unless we couple it is all very well for the priests to tell him to pray for an heir but there is more to getting a child than just prayer the empress flushed irritably but then she continued smoothly i dare not take a lover yet to satisfy my own needs the church considers a womans natural urges evil i have no real privacy and i am constantly watched as you know i have thought about it for some time and it finally came to me if i am to entice my husband back to my bed i must take drastic action i realize i am not supposed to know of things like this but we have i am told several very fine brothels in constantinople i decided to engage a courtesan to teach me the erotic arts so that i might lure leo into doing his duty by us both you did what basilicus gasped totally stunned by his sisters revelation a good byzantine wife was not supposed to be aware of such things he did not know whether to be shocked or amused by what she had done i hired a courtesan to help me become more sensual verina repeated flacilla helped me she sometimes visits a place called villa maxima it has wonderful entertainments and marvelous young men for hire as lovers she tells me do you know it basilicus and while he gaped at her in wonder she answered her own question of course you know villa maxima brother dear you are one of its distinguished patrons on occasion one of those occasions was several months ago when you visited the place in the company of our good general there was a particularly notorious and most lewd entertainment being performed twice weekly that had the entire city talking of its perversity flacilla says it was wonderful i wish that i had been able to see it but how could i go to such a place even in disguise someone would be certain to recognize me he nodded it would be unwise indeed verina he told her she smiled at him and then took up the thread of her story the courtesan sent to me is a lovely creature named casia it is she who told me that aspar had purchased from the owners of the brothel the female member of that depraved entertainment a young patrician widow of roman ancestry from britain really basilicus she is precisely as i have described her to you verina i did not think it necessary to reveal her unhappy months in slavery a condition that came about through nothing of her making aspar freed her immediately after he purchased her he recognized her patrician blood and felt sorry for her now he is in love with cailin i cannot believe that you would lie to me brother the empress pouted i did not lie to you verina the prince said irritably you did not tell me all that you had learned i cannot forgive you for it i did not tell you because i did not want to embarrass cailin verina aspar would not have told me but that i recognized her it is an episode that both of them would like to put behind them basilicus said all they desire is to live quietly together at villa mare then he grew serious leo will never be so safe that you do not need aspar sister mine offend aspar and god knows what might happen to you and your family the empire is relatively stable right now but one never knows when something may set the masses to rebellion and discontent i will tell aspar that you know his secret and how you learned it you will keep that secret and by doing so our general will be deeply in your debt verina that is far more valuable to you than any momentary satisfaction you might gain by revealing all this to flacilla strabo the empress considered her brothers words and then she nodded yes you are correct basilicus aspars goodwill is far more important to us than that of his whorish wife she has a new lover now you know and this time she has chosen a man from among our own class did she tell you that basilicus asked who is it verina justin gabras scion of the great patrician family in trebizond the empress responded he is twentyfive and said to be very handsome what is he doing in constantinople and how has flacilla intrigued him into a carnal liaison basiclius wondered aloud but seeing the sparkle in his sisters eye he knew she would tell him everything it is whispered verina began that justin gabras has a very quick temper he has killed several people whom he believed offended him his last victim however was a cousin of the bishop of trebizond it was necessary i am told to remove the murderer as quickly as possible from the scene they say that the gabras family was forced to pay the bishops family a huge bounty for their relatives life justin gabras was expelled from trebizond for a period of five years already his reputation in constantinople grows for its wickedness he has bought an enormous mansion overlooking the golden horn and an estate in the country they say his parties and his entertainments rival those at the citys best brothels basilicus are you surprised that flacilla should find him i am surprised that the church does not interfere the prince said his generosity to the patriarchs favorite causes has earned him a blind eye in that quarter the empress told her brother knowledgeably if this justin gabras is all you say he is i think perhaps flacilla has gotten in over her head this time basilicus noted if she has it might solve many problems the empress observed wisely the strabo family would no longer have to worry about flacillas behavior nor would aspar have to be burdened with her and then he could marry his beloved cailin basilicus said casually looking to see what his sister would say marry the girl he found in a brothel no brother dear it simply could not be allowed he need not marry again at all but it would never do for the first patrician of the empire byzantiums greatest general to marry a girl who worked in a brothel no matter how blue her blood is the empire would be a laughing stock and we cannot have that verina said of course basilicus thought sadly they would never allow aspar to marry cailin had he not told his friend so still when he had heard of flacillas latest lover and his rather unsavory reputation he had thought that just perhaps the empire would reward its favorite son with permission to marry the woman he loved who would tend him with devotion and love in his old age basilicus thought of himself as a sophisticate but sometimes even he longed for a simpler life autumnslippedintowinterthe winds blew from the north and at villa mare the shutters upon the portico were drawn tight while the braziers filled with charcoal warmed the rooms on cold days cailin and aspar lived quietly they seemed to have a need only for each other there were no further visitors to the villa after basilicuss surprise arrival that autumn day they preferred it that way aspar spent several days each week in the city attending to his duties he saw his eldest son ardiburius quite often and one day in the senate ardiburius boldly asked his father why did you close our palace because i prefer living in the country aspar replied they say you have a young mistress with you ardiburius said a small smile touched aspars lips but was quickly gone they are correct he told his son unlike your stepmother i prefer to conduct my affair in a discreet manner cailin is a gentle girl and prefers the country to the city it pleases me to please her ardiburius swallowed hard do you care for her father aspar stared at his son wondering just where this was leading finally he said yes i do and your mother would have liked her too you do not love the lady flacilla no ardiburius i do not i would have thought that obvious to you from the beginning the marriage was political i needed the patriarchs approval of leo and i gained it by taking flacilla off her familys hands aspar said what is it you want to tell me my son you have never been a man for this many words you are a soldier as i am speak you must remove patricius from the lady flacillas care father he should not remain in her house any longer ardiburius said why the word was sharp she has a very evil lover father a man of wealth and great family he has i have it on the most reliable authority debauched children as young as eight patricius is almost ten and grows more beautiful every day he is a charming child as you know and always eager to please your wifes lover has not yet violated him but he has of late shown an interest in patricius that is not healthy my source is totally reliable father my little brother must be protected you and zoe must take him then aspar said sophia is not used to little boys and he lacks respect for her patricius adores you ardiburius and your wife knows well how to deal with rambunctious little boys i will tell flacilla that patricius needs the company of other children and as there are none in her house i have decided to give him to you and zoe it will not seem like a criticism if i handle it that way hopefully her new interest will keep her amused so she will not take offense you know i cannot bring patricius to villa mare cailin of course would adore it she is meant to be a mother but it would cause the very reaction i seek to avoida scandal you understand my son yes father ardiburius said will you take patricius today it should be done as quickly as possible i have already discussed the possibility of his coming to us with my family your grandson david is delighted to have his uncle join us being the eldest with two sisters after him and his brother just a baby it is hard for him you spoil him aspar growled but he seems a good lad despite it he is six now is he not he and patricius will get on quite well he sighed gustily as much as i detest having to meet with flacilla i shall go now and fetch patricius from her go home ardiburius and tell zoe that he will be coming to you by nightfall the general left the senate and mounting his horse rode unescorted through the streets of the city to his wifes home he needed no guard to keep him safe and many recognized him calling out to him wishing him well the gatekeeper at flacillas mansion greeted him pleasantly and the majordomo after hurrying forward to welcome him sent a slave to his mistress to announce her husbands arrival flacilla strabo was a beautiful woman small and delicate she possessed gorgeous blond hair and seagreen eyes she had been entertaining her lover when news of her husbands sudden and totally unexpected visit was brought to her damn him she said irritably how like aspar to come without any forewarning my god what if he has heard about us he threatened to put me in st barbaras if i caused any new scandal and my family will support him if he does justin gabras smiled lazily at her from the couch where he was reclining a single black curl fell directly in the center of his forehead he was tall and lean and had dark eyes that seemed fathomless i would very much regret losing you flacilla he drawled you must leave now she said fearfully as the silent slave stood waiting for her instructions to take back to the majordomo reaching out justin gabras yanked flacilla down into his lap pulled the neckline of her chiton as low as he could and lifting a plump breast out began to fondle it vigorously have your husband come in flacilla i am very much looking forward to meeting him his fame as the empires general precedes him i do not believe i have ever really met a truly brave man but aspar is said to be one she struggled to escape him are you mad she gasped as he lowered his head and he began to suckle strongly on her nipple in answer justin gabras bit sharply down on flacillas tingling breast causing her to cry out his eyes met hers and flacilla said weakly to the slave have my husband join us here on the terrace marco then she gasped again as her lover slipped a hand beneath her gown slid it quickly up her leg and began to tease at her little jewel she moaned desperately knowing that he would not cease until she gave him complete satisfaction and that it would not matter in the least to him if aspar walked in and found them in such a compromising attitude justin gabras was the most perverse man she had ever known and even though she was sometimes frightened of him she could not resist him ahhhhhh she moaned as he forced her to completion he laughed releasing her and watched as flacilla quickly straightened her garments and attempted to regain her composure he was probably on the stairs even as i made you obey me he mocked her did you think of him coming toward us as i played with you my pet you are a wicked man she said now angry that he had frightened her so greatly you love danger but you involved me in it then and you loved it flacilla he mocked her you are the perfect woman for me you have breeding and you are a very skilled whore as your husband is leaving us today i will have another little surprise in store for you my pet does it excite you to think on it before she could answer however aspar came out onto the terrace flacilla arose and came forward to greet him my lord why did you not tell me you were coming patricius will be so delighted to see you he has been doing very well at his studies lately his tutors say i apologize for interrupting you and your guest flacilla aspar said with a hint of censure in his voice she heard it and quickly replied this is justin gabras a gentleman from trebizond my lord he is now making his home in the city the patriarch has asked him to help me in a project to aid the poor we were just discussing it when you arrived will you join us a small amused smile touched aspars lips but it was quickly gone i have come for patricius he said i have decided to send him to live with ardiburius and zoe you have been a good mother to him flacilla but he is at an age now where he needs the company of other children my grandson david is just slightly younger than patricius and will benefit as well from their shared companionship since both my elder son and daughterinlaw follow the orthodox faith patricius will of course continue in that instruction will you send for him flacilla was astounded and frankly curious as to his apparently sudden decision but she nodded calling a servant she gave instructions that the boy be brought to them may i see patricius on occasion my lord she asked her husband i have grown fond of the child of course he said smiling you are always welcome at my elder sons home to visit patricius he is fond of you also i know justin gabras was fascinated he had never seen two more poorly matched people he would be sorry to see the boy go too only recently he had begun to consider what an appetizing little tidbit the child would be as patricius was sweetnatured and eager to please seducing him would have been a simple matter and afterward he would have taught him how to please his lusty stepmother as well bad luck he thought an opportunity lost but another will appear the general and his wife had grown silent for they had little if nothing to say to each other aspar looked like a dull fellow justin gabras thought brilliant in the field but boring in the bedchamber flacilla politely offered wine and then mercifully the boy came father aspars youngest child ran into the room his face joyful at the sight of the general what a grand surprise father aspar caught the boy in an embrace and then stepping back said you have grown again lad and the lady flacilla says your tutors give good reports of your studies you make me proud and i have come with a surprise for you you are to go and live with your brother and his wife your cousin david is most eager for your arrival ohh father that is splendid news patricius cried when am i to go then his face fell and turning toward flacilla he said almost apologetically i will miss you lady you have been good to me flacilla smiled but there was no warmth in it i think your father has made an excellent decision patricius you should be with other children and my household is long past children if we left now my lad would that suit you aspar asked his son the boy nodded vigorously and aspar said to his wife have old marie pack my sons things up you may send her and his tutors to ardiburiuss home tomorrow now we will take our leave of you my lady and you may return to your business with this gentleman he bowed politely to flacilla first and then to justin gabras taking patriciuss hand in his they departed the terrace when they were safely out of hearing patricius said to his father i am glad to be going to my brothers house father the lady flacilla entertains too many gentlemen and this latest fellow frightens me he was always watching me he did not touch you or hurt you my son did he oh no father the boy assured his parent i never let him come that close to me marie says he is a very bad man you listen to your old nurse patricius she loves you well aspar told his child your mother picked her especially to care for you upon the terrace flacilla watched through the latticed screen that topped one of the low walls as her husband and his child rode off down the wide street justin gabras stood behind her his hands upon her hips plunging himself in and out of her womans passage as she leaned upon the parapet it was so sudden she said irritably how typical of aspar to make this surprise visit with its surprise ending her lover ground himself slowly into her and bending over whispered in her ear he thinks you no longer fit to watch over the child my pet oh he masked his intent with sweet words but it was obvious to me what he was really thinking flacilla what will the gossips make of it i wonder for it will certainly provide grist for their mills she felt her crisis approaching and moaned hungrily thrusting her hips back to meet him i will go to the empress she gasped justin gabras pushed flacilla farther over so that she was almost bent double enjoying her surprised scream as he moved from her temple of venus and jammed himself into the entry of her temple of sodom his hands held het firmly stilling her feeble struggles as he leaned forward and bit her neck you will be the laughingstock of constantinople my pet everyone knows you for a whore but now they will know you for a bad mother as well do you not ever wonder why your daughters do not visit you flacilla their husbands families will not let them associate with you i am told his lust exploded into her aching body and finally with a satisfied groan he withdrew from her flacilla burst into tears why do you tell me these lies she demanded of him because you have a delightful talent for perversion to match mine my pet you have barely scratched the surface of your own wickedness yet but under my tutelage you will become a mistress of evil do not weep you are too old to do so publicly and your face is getting puffy tis most unattractive i do not lie to you flacilla when i say you are the perfect woman for me i want to marry you you have powerful family connections and if i must remain here in constantinople then i want a wife such as you my dear a young girl would bore me she would whine and complain about my tastes you however will not will you you would let me take lovers she asked him nervously of course he said laughing for i will take lovers too he took her hand and they lay together upon the couch think of it flacilla think of what we could share together and with no recriminations on either side we could even share lovers you know i enjoy both women and men as you do shall we go to villa maxima tonight and choose a lover to share what about one of those wonderful dumb northmen jovian so favors or perhaps casia is more to your taste what say you let me think she said ohh i wish that girl that jovian featured in the first of his playlets was still here she was so beautiful but she disappeared very quickly you did not see the performance of course not having yet come to constantinople but the girl took all three of those northmen into her body at one time jovian never allowed anyone else to have her and then suddenly she was gone he would never explain what had happened to her i think she may have killed herself she did not look like a whore let us have all three of the northmen then flacilla you shall play the girls part for me and we shall have casia as well he said kissing her quickly it will be a celebtation of our engagement flacilla sat up my family would never allow me to divorce aspar and marry you she said they value aspars influence too much though they forced him to wed me in order to gain their support for leo they have gotten much through his influence justin they will not easily give all that up do not ask your family flacilla ask your husband for a divorce i suspect he wants to ask you for one and removing his child from your care is his first step along the road to ridding himself of you once again aspar will embarrass you and hold you up to ridicule sttike first my pet i doubt he cares as long as he is rid of you what if he refuses me she said you never know with aspar then you can go to your family justin replied your husband is not a god flacilla there must be some weakness of his you can play upon have you learned nothing in the time you were married to him actually she admitted i know little of him we have never lived together nor slept together he is an enigma to me then you must spy upon him to learn what we need to know my pet for i will have you or no one will he kissed her hard after a night of particularly wild debauchery flacilla awoke clearheaded and determined send a messenger to my husbands palace she told her majordomo and say that i wish to visit him this morning i shall arrive before the noon hour the general is not at his palace my lady the majordomo said he closed his palace up some months ago and lives at villa mare now shall i send a messenger to the country to inform him you are coming my lady the villa is just five miles beyond the gates no flacilla said do not bother i will simply go by the time a messenger went and returned i could be there myself have my litter made ready she dismissed the majordomo and called her maids wanting to make a good impression flacilla chose her garments carefully her stola was bluegreen in color and matched her eyes it was shot through with gold threads and the fabric was very rich the sleeves were long and tight and the garment was belted at the waist with a wide gold belt that was most flattering her gold slippers were beautifully bejeweled and her hair was a mass of golden braids fastened high and decorated with jewels a matching cloak lined in fur completed her outfit flacilla stared hard at herself in the polished silver mirror then she smiled wellpleased aspar would be impressed her bearers hurried along the mese and through the golden gate the day was pleasant and she could see through the bit of drapery she left open the cattle grazing in the fallow fields here and there peasants were pruning trees in the orchards that occasionally lined the road it was a soothing and most pastoral scene flacilla thought if not just perhaps a bit boring why was aspar living in the country the litter turned into the gates of the villa mare and entering the courtyard came to a stop the vehicle was set down and the curtains drawn back a hand was extended to help her out who are you flacilla demanded of the elderly servant i am zeno general aspars majordomo was the polite reply i am the lady flacilla the generals wife please tell him that i have arrived she said grandly and you may show me into the atrium now zeno and bring me some wine zeno was horrified but his face did not show his consternation if my lady will follow me he said calmly it was a charming little villa flacilla thought she had never been here before a bit too rustic for her taste but peaceful she could not however understand why aspar would prefer it to his palace in the city making herself comfortable upon a marble bench she sat down to wait for her wine and for her husband to make an appearance aspar arrived before her refreshment his greeting was less than cordial what are you doing here flacilla what could have possibly brought you into the country on a winters morning at so early an hour he looked distinctly uncomfortable and she wondered why then it dawned upon flacilla that her husband the morally upright aspar had taken a mistress he was living with her and wanted no one to know of it why the old fox flacilla almost laughed aloud i have come on a matter of some importance she began swallowing to conceal her amusement yes he said shifting on his feet i want a divorce aspar flacilla burst out this was no time to be coy she didnt give a damn if he had one or a hundred mistresses tucked away here in the country she had been twice wed to please her family now she wanted to marry for her own sake you want a divorce his look was almost incredulously comical ohh aspar she said with utmost candor her words tumbling out quickly our marriage was one of politics you got what you wantedthe support of the patriarch and the strabo family in leos behalf i got what i thought i could live with being the wife of the most powerful man in byzantium but ours has been no true marriage we detested each other on sight we have never spent a single night including our wedding night in the same bed or under the same roof you do not really want me you have even taken patricius from my care well i am no longer a girl and for the first time in my life i am in love i want to marry justin gabras and he wants to marry me let me have a divorce and in exchange i will be your eyes and ears in verinas court verina is very ambitious for both herself and leo she would dispose of you if she thought she could and one day she may think to do so if i am there for you you will have no unpleasant surprises to contend with from that quarter it is a fair offer he was astounded if they both wanted the divorce then the patriarch could hardly contest them and the strabos could not be offended yes he said slowly it is a fair offer flacilla why did you not speak to me about this yesterday when i came for patricius justin asked me the same thing flacilla lied but as i told him i was so distraught by patriciuss departure that i was not thinking clearly and then you were gone with the child i promised him however that i would come to you this very day and settle the matter i have brought wine my lord zeno had reappeared he set the goblets and the carafe on a small inlaid table you need not bother to pour aspar said i will return to your duties he finished meaningfully hoping zeno understood at once my lord was the emphasized reply but at that moment disaster descended as cailin entered the atrium i have been told we have guests my lord she said flacilla strabos mouth dropped open she stared hard at the girl and then managed to gasp you it is you cailin looked confused lady do i know you she replied you are the girl from villa maxima do not bother to deny it i recognize you flacilla shrieked and then she began to laugh ohh aspar she chortled you were faithful to anna and then waited years past the time when most men take a mistress now in the twilight of your years you choose one and she is the most notorious girl in all of byzantium you will give me my divorce and we will call the matter even if you do not i shall tell the world of your whore and then you will be the laughingstock of the empire your usefulness will be over and where will your power be you will be helpless i can scarcely believe my good fortune the girl from villa maxima who is this coarse creature my lord cailin said icily coarseme flacilla glared angrily at the girl god she was so young may i present my wife flacilla strabo aspar said formally what an incredible piece of bad luck that cailin should come into the atrium before zeno could find her and warn her off well it could not be helped he would have to make the best of it he looked at flacilla i was not aware that you patronized villa maxima occasionally flacilla answered carefully jovians little playlet was the rage of the city early last summer she does not look like a whore aspar i am not cailin replied sharply my blood is nobler than yours lady i am a drusus of the great roman family rome is finished it has been for eons and since attila pillaged it several years ago there is little of any consequence left including its families this is the center of the world now flacilla sneered do not boast so proudly lady cailin returned this center of the world you so loftily hail is as rotten as an egg that has lain in the sun all day in britain we do not debase our women before an audience of lewd and cheering lechers you should be ashamed to admit to what you saw but why should it surprise me even your priests came to see jovians entertainments the outward beauty of your city cannot make up for the darkness in your hearts and souls i pity you will you allow this slave to speak to me so flacilla demanded she glared angrily at aspar i am still your wife and will have respect cailin is not a slave aspar said quietly i freed her months ago she is your equal flacilla and may speak to you as she chooses he took cailins hand in his and then continued i will give you your divorce flacilla i will go with you myself to the patriarch and we will tell him of our wishes i have no quarrel with you and never have had if you have found happiness as i have found it then i wish you well and will do whatever i can to ensure your good fortune flacillas anger was almost immediately tempered that is most generous of you my lord she said slowly there is one condition he told her you will not gossip about cailins past flacilla you must swear to me that you will be silent or i will not acquiesce in this matter a divorce is more to your advantage my dear wife than it is to mine and you will still be my eyes and ears at verinas court those are my terms will you swear why is this more to my advantage than to yours aspar flacilla said you wish to marry justin gabras do you not you cannot marry him without a divorce i on the other hand will never be permitted to marry cailin because of her unusual beginnings in constantinople the fact that i keep her with me as my mistress is not a crime nor is it considered unique for a man of my position whether you are my wife or not flacilla cailin will remain my mistress but to marry your lover my dear you must be free of me so it is more to your advantage that i agree to divorce you than it is to mine would you not say i am correct he smiled at her in a friendly manner cocking his head to one side questioningly well flacilla what say you my dear she nodded as always aspar you are correct i must tell you that i have ever found this trait of yours most irritating however very well i swear on the body of our crucified lord that i will not gossip or speak ill of your little barbarian pagan lover i rarely give my word as you know you also know you may trust that word i do flacilla he said now when would you like to meet with your cousin the patriarch i am at your disposal in this matter let us do it today she said eagerly let us simply call upon him without warning if we take him unawares he is more likely to cooperate than if he sits down with his council of bishops and they natter on about the matter i know just the argument to sway him aspar go on ahead of me he told her i will ride and catch up with you before you even reach the city gates allow me to escort you to your litter flacilla cailin remain here i am content to do so she said and he heard ice in her tone aspar walked with his wife to where her litter awaited her what a pity you cannot marry her flacilla said wickedly she loves you like anna did and is obviously meant to be a good wife but she has spirit like i do the perfect mate aspar and you cannot have her it hardly seems fair after all your service to the empire flacilla mocked him tsk tsk he smiled unaffected by her cruel barbs more concerned with cailin whom he knew was going to be furious with him for not telling her that she was already a free woman it will be as god wills it my dear he replied smoothly spoiling flacillas obvious glee as he helped her into her luxurious litter i will be with you as quickly as i can closing the curtains of the vehicle smartly he told the bearers take the lady flacilla to the palace of the patriarch at once then aspar turned about and went back into the atrium of his villa cailin was pacing around the fish pond she whirled at the sound of his step and shouted at him how could you keep such a thing from me my lord or was it a lie told simply to annoy that dreadful creature it is true he said you have been a free woman again since that day i promised it to you i could not tell you the whole truth cailin i am not a young man but god help me i love you i feared if i told you that you were free you would leave me that you would attempt some foolish flight back to britain and end up in a worse situation than the one from which i rescued you for a moment pity welled in her eyes but it was quickly gone oh aspar she said to him do you not know that i love you also until you found me and yes even for a time afterward i dreamed of returning to britain to avenge myself upon antonia porcius but what good would it do me would vengeance return me to my family my husband my child i do not think so antonias revenge certainly did not return quintus to her wulf ironfist will have found himself another wife by now perhaps they even have a child he husbands the lands that were once my familys my return would bring but unhappiness to all involved it is a new age for britain and it would seem that i am not meant to be a part of it this is where my fate has brought me and here i will remain by your side and in your heart as long as you will have me aspar she surprised herself with her own words but even as she had spoken them she realized it was time to put her dreams aside and face reality it was unlikely that she would ever see britain again they will not let us marry cailin he said sadly who your christian priests i am not a christian aspar i am what was it your wife called me a pagan do you remember the old words of the roman marriage perhaps you do not but divorce flacilla and i will teach them to you that we may say them to each other then whatever others may say we will be bound together for all eternity my dearest lord cailin promised him slipping her arms about him she pressed herself hard against him and kissed him with all the passion her young soul could muster then looking up at him she said and you will never ever again keep things from me or tell me halftruths my darling lord or i shall be very very angry you have not yet seen my wild temper in full force and you do not wish to i promise you she astounded him and the happiness filling him would only allow him to say you love me you love me he caught her up in his arms and swung her about happily cailin loves me put me down she said laughing you will have the servants thinking that you have lost your wits entirely my lord just my heart my love and that you will keep safe for me i know it he placed her gently upon her feet go to constantinople now my lord and convince those you must to rid you of that harpy you wed for expediencys sake cailin told him i will eagerly await your return i will legalize any children you bear me he promised her i know you will do the just thing she replied now go he did not even have to give orders zeno appeared to inform his master that his horse was saddled and awaiting him in the courtyard aspar laughed aloud it was a conspiracy he thought to himself his servants adored cailin and would do whatever they must to ensure both her happiness and his he rode off down the road to the city eventually catching up with flacillas litter together they traveled the rest of the distance to the patriarchs palace where they were admitted immediately and announced to constantinoples religious leader the patriarch looked warily at the couple before him and to what do i owe the pleasure of seeing you both he murmured nervously we want a divorce flacilla said bluntly both aspar and i are agreed upon it you cannot refuse us we have no marriage and never have my lord we have not even cohabited once and i have constantly betrayed my husband with men of low degree she finished constantly aspar said one dark eyebrow arching quizzically you rarely knew flacilla said smugly and then she laughed almost ruefully they do not all end as scandalously as did the little episode of the gladiator and the actor my lord the patriarch paled you knew of that unfortunate incident he asked aspar i knew the general replied my sources are even better than yours are my lord patriarch i chose to overlook it because of your little mistress the patriarch countered his black robes swirling about as he paced the room edgily you will never be permitted to marry her your prestige is too valuable to byzantium flavius aspar your behavior is tolerated because you have been discreet but only for that reason go home both of you i have twice married for the good of my family flacilla said taking up the argument i was content to remain a widow when my husband constans died but the strabos would make me this mans wife well i have served my purpose for them and for you now i want to be happy with a man of my own choosing her blue eyes glared fiercely at the patriarch cousin i wish to marry justin gabras and he wishes to marry me he is the first lover with whom i have been involved who is my equal the gabras family is as you well know the first family of trebizond the emperor is in your pocket now and aspar is the most loyal citizen in this land you need fear neither of them i would be far more useful as justin gabrass wife as this should give you an important toehold in trebizond refuse us and we will cause such a scandal that neither you nor this emperor will survive it i mean it cousin and you know that i am capable of such destruction flacilla finished threateningly you are content to allow this marriage the patriarch said feebly to aspar but even as he spoke he knew that aspar undoubtedly considered this situation a pure stroke of luck i have no quarrel with flacilla aspar replied smoothly if this marriage can make her happy why should we refuse her my lord to what purpose she is correct about the gabras family and they would i suspect even be grateful to flacilla her lover has never before married and a marriage may settle his rather erratic personality that would certainly reflect well on the strabos and upon you and if marriage does not settle him we are none of us any the worse off he shrugged as for my situation i will continue to remain discreet little can be said about an unmarried man who keeps a mistress and is faithful to her my lord it is small reward i ask for all my services to the empire she must be baptized the patriarch said we can tolerate a christian mistress flavius aspar but never a pagan i will choose a priest myself for her instruction and when he tells me she is ready to receive the sacrament i will baptize her myself into the true orthodox faith of byzantium will you accept my decision in this matter i will aspar said wondering just how he was going to explain it to cailin she would find it very irrational but in the end he knew she would do it to please him and because it was the only way that their relationship would be tolerated by the powers that be the patriarch turned to flacilla you will have your divorce cousin and before your strabo family relations even know it i do not intend to argue with them over this matter choose a wedding date and i will personally marry you to justin gabras it is to be done however privately and with a little decorum flacilla i will not allow either of you to make a circus of this matter and afterward you will hostess a family party to properly celebrate this new union there will be no orgy do you understand will justin gabras understand it will be as you desire my lord patriarch flacilla said meekly the cleric laughed humorlessly if it is he said then it will be the first time you ever really obeyed me cousin libibjbfbmblbibjbibiblbjblbil chapter spring always came sooner to byzantium than it did to britain cailin noted not displeased by the early display of flowering trees in aspars orchards the general was a good master as each peasant she met was quick to assure her while many on neighboring estates were worn down by the incredible taxation placed on the farmers by the imperial government aspar paid the taxes imposed on his people so that they would not have to leave their own small bits of land taxes unfortunately could not be paid in kind they had to be paid in gold yet the price of all produce and farm animals was strictly regulated by the government making it nearly impossible for freedmen to meet their obligations the government kept these prices artificially low to satisfy the populace many small farmers attached to other estates had practically sold themselves into serfdom to their overlords so that they and their families might just survive if you had no farmers cailin said to her lover where would we get our foodstuffs does the government not consider that why are the merchants taxed so little and the farmers so much for the same reason ships docking in the golden horn are only charged two solidi on their arrival but fifteen solidi on their departure the government wants luxury goods and staples brought into the city but not traded away out of it that is why the merchants are charged such low taxes someone has to make up the deficit since the farmers have no choice but to farm the land and are so scattered throughout the country they cannot unite and complain the heaviest burden of taxation falls upon them aspar told her governments have always acted thusly for there is always someone willing to farm the land that is totally illogical cailin responded it is the luxury goods that should be taxed and not the poor souls who supply the necessities of everyday life who makes such foolish laws the senate he said smiling at her outrage you see my love the bulk of the luxury goods are sold to the ruling class and the very rich have a strong aversion to heavy taxation the government keeps the majority of the populace content by regulating the price of everything that is sold the poor farmers a minority can cry out all they want their voices will not be heard in either the senate or in the palace only when the majority of the people threaten rebellion do those in power listen and then not particularly closely but just enough to save their own skins aspar finished cynically if they tax the farmers out of existence cailin persisted who will grow the food has the government considered that the powerful will grow the food using slave labor he said that is why you pay your tenants taxes isnt it free men are happier men aspar said and happier men produce far more than those who are not happy or free there is so much beauty here cailin said slowly and yet so much wickedness and decay i miss my homeland life in britain was simpler and the boundaries of our survival were more clearly defined even if we had not the luxuries of byzantium my dear lord your thoughts are complex even for a wise man he replied taking her hand and kissing the inside of her wrist your heart is great cailin drusus but you must accept the fact you are only a woman there is little you can do to right the worlds ills my love yet father michael tells me that i am my brothers keeper she answered him cleverly and he smiled at her tenacity this christianity of yours is interesting aspar but its adherents do not always do what they preach a good christian should do my lord i like your jesus but i think he would not like some of the ways in which his teachings are interpreted by those who claim to speak in his name i have been taught that one of the commandments handed down says that we shall not kill our fellow man and yet we do aspar we kill for foolish reasons which is worse a man does not worship as we think he should worship and so we kill him a man is of a different race or tribe than we are so we kill him this is not i think what jesus meant here in byzantium there is so much evil amid so much piety yet that evil is ignored by even those in the highest places who proudly worship in the hagia sophia and then run off to commit adultery or cheat their business associates it is all very confusing do you tell father michael of your thoughts and concerns he asked her not knowing if he should be truly amused or fearful for her no she said he is too intense in his religious fervor and very bound up with the correctness of his worship he says that i am far from ready for baptism which is i think a good thing aspar a good christian woman it is said must either be a wife or go to live in a convent i am told i cannot be your wife and i certainly have no desire to live a cloistered existence therefore once i accept the rite of baptism i must either leave you or be forever damned it is not a particularly broad choice my lord that is offered me cailins violet eyes twinkled with amusement then she slipped her arms about his neck and kissed him slowly i am going to avoid baptism as long as i can my lord good he answered her it will give me time to overcome this ridiculous notion that we cannot be married flacilla whored all over byzantium and was allowed to wed justin gabras but you my love who in your innocence was cruelly abused are denied the right to marry it is not a situation that is to be tolerated and i will not tolerate it we are together and that is enough for me aspar cailin told him i want nothing more than to be by your side for eternity how would you like to go to the games with me in may he asked her special games are held each may eleventh to commemorate the founding of the city of constantinople my box is right next to the imperial box have you ever seen chariot races cailin the hippodrome has the finest course in all byzantium if you are seen in public with me will that not cause a scandal she asked him i do not think it wise my lord there is nothing unusual about a man bringing his mistress to the games particularly a bachelor such as myself aspar answered casia the girl you knew at villa maxima is now basilicuss lover he has given her her own home in the city and visits her regularly we will ask her to join us as well as some of the citys more famous artisans and actors i am known to keep such company to the despair of the court but frankly those who create are far more interesting to me than those who govern and intrigue he chuckled we will fill the box with interesting people and few will know just who is who perhaps it would be nice to see other people cailin observed when you are away on your official duties i grow lonely sometimes her admission startled him for she had never complained about her solitude before aspar had never considered that she might be weary of being companionless several days later zeno was sent to the city and when he returned he brought with him a young girl with large frightened blue eyes and flaxen braids the master thought you would like a young maidservant to keep you company zeno said smiling we are all so old here but you lady are like springtime and need a fair flower to serve and amuse you she speaks no language i can understand lady but she seems pleasant and biddable cailin smiled at the girl and then asked from where does she come zeno if i knew perhaps i might find a language in which we could communicate if i cannot speak with her then all my lords good intentions are for naught the slave merchant said she comes from britain zeno said triumphantly surely you can communicate with her my lady yet she speaks no latin cailin mused to herself she turned to the young girl what is your name she asked in her own native celtic tongue if the girl didnt speak latin she must speak celtic nellwyn lady the girl said slowly are you celt cailin said the girl shook her head saxon lady but i understand the tongue you speak i come from the saxon shore and there are many celts there how came you to byzantium cailin continued byzantium nellwyn looked confused what is byzantium lady this place this land it is called byzantium the city in which you were in is its capital constantinople by name cailin explained northmen raided our village nellwyn told her my parents and my brothers were slaughtered my sisters and i and the other women who could not escape were carried off they took us to gaul first and then we traveled by sea again to come here many died on the way the sea was horrible yes i know cailin said i came to byzantium almost two years ago from britain in a similar fashion my home was near corinium the girls eyes grew wide are you a slave too no longer cailin replied is this your house lady nellwyn recognized quality when she saw it and this beautiful woman was obviously nobility no cailin told her it is the house of flavius aspar byzantiums most famous warrior and a great nobleman there was no need to explain anything else nellwyn would soon figure it out if indeed she had not already my lord has brought you to be a companion to me nellwyn you are safe now and need fear no longer do you understand yes lady nellwyn replied kneeling before cailin i will serve you loyally i swear by woden i am pleased to hear it cailin said now get up girl and go with zeno who is master of the servants in this house he will show you where you are to sleep nellwyn you will have to learn the language spoken in this land or it will be difficult for you i fear the tongue is called latin many spoke it in britain i have heard the words of that tongue nellwyn answered i have a good ear my father always said and learned celtic quickly i am sure i will learn latin as well lady and make you proud of me good now whatever zeno tells you to do you must obey him cailin explained to the girl then she turned to her majordomo she has some words of latin and claims she can learn quickly zeno see she is given a bath she smells like a stable then give her fresh clothing and a sleeping space she may come to me in the morning and i will assign her duties and begin to teach her myself the elderly servant bowed and signaling to the girl led her off very shortly he returned however and said bluntly she will not let us bathe her my lady she screams like a rabbit in a trap i will come cailin said and followed him to the servants quarters where nellwyn naked now stood sobbing piteously come girl you must wash cailin scolded her in this land we bathe with regularity your pretty hair will be crawling with lice ive not a doubt and must be cleaned too follow tamar to the bath now they would drown me lady nellwyn wept i know how to wash but properly in a basin not with all that water cailin swallowed her laughter in byzantium we wash with lots of water she explained now you must trust me nellwyn and obey me when i command you for i am your new mistress go with tamar reluctantly the girl obeyed casting a teary glance over her shoulder as she followed the older woman into the servants bath it is a pretty toy you have given me my lord cailin told aspar that evening as they ate she speaks no latin and i must teach her is afraid to bathe but she appears sweettempered and eager to learn you said you were lonely she is young as you are young my beauty she will keep you amused when i am away he responded smiling she is thirteen and believed she was about to be drowned in the servants bathing pool cailin giggled where did you find her i asked a slave merchant i know to find me a young female briton he said she is a saxon from the saxon shore of britain cailin told him then she is not one of your people he remarked irritated at himself i should have been more specific with the slave merchant celts are usually harder to catch cailin said a twinkle in her eyes and they do not take well to service my lord nellwyn will suit me admirably saxon girls are generally goodnatured then i have pleased you he replied smiling at her you always please me my lord she answered him softly no he said sadly i do not cailin i wish i could the fault lies with me aspar you know it does it breaks my heart that i can no longer feel passion when a man is within my womans passage cailin said tears filling her lovely eyes yet i do gain a different kind of pleasure when we lie together your touch is so filled with love for me that it communicates itself to my very heart and i am filled with happiness and peace it is enough for me i could but wish it was enough for you it hurts me to know that i have failed you in this manner but i know not what to do to change things i have not that wisdom my beloved lord she lay her head on his shoulder and sighed forlornly how could she care so for this good man cailin wondered and be unable to completely return his passion i love you for many reasons he told her but your truthfulness in all things pleases me greatly i would have no whores tricks from you cailin no simulated cries of passion ringing in my ears some day you will cry out for me but that cry will come from your heart i will wait until that time perhaps not always with patience but i will wait he arose from the table and held out his hand to her the night is fair and there is a moon let us walk together my love there was no wind and the night was quiet around them they walked first through the nearby orchards of almond peach and apricot trees with their fragrant pink and white blossoms some of which were already beginning to drift down to catch in cailins myriad auburn curls these trees are far prettier than the olive groves cailin said i do not like the yellowish flowers upon those trees but the olive is far more practical a fruit he told her the peaches and apricots are quickly gone the olives properly prepared last all year what is beautiful is not always practical almonds are beautiful she countered and they last every bit as long as olives even longer and they do not have to be salted he laughed too intelligent he teased her you are too intelligent for a woman no wonder you frighten father michael everything frightens father michael that is of this world cailin told him as they left the orchards behind and came across a small field to the beach she cried softly ohh aspar look at the moon on the sea is it not the most beautiful thing you have ever seen it was one of those rare moments when the restless waves were totally stilled the flat dark surface of the water was silvered and shimmered like the best silk as it spread itself before them they stood silently admiring the beauty of it all it was as if the entire world were at peace with itself and they were the only two creatures inhabiting it aspar reached out and took cailins hand in his together they walked down the little embankment to the beach removing his cloak he spread it upon the sand for them then taking her into his arms he kissed her softly lingeringly when he finally released her cailin wordlessly pulled her stola over her head and let the garment drop from her slender fingers naked she stood proudly before him he responded by removing the long comfortable tunic he wore within his home and kicked his sandals off then aspar slipped to his knees before her drawing her against him his cheek pressed against her torso they embraced quietly for a long moment then he began to trace a pattern of warm kisses across her flesh cailin sighed softly his patience and his gentleness always astounded her how very much she wanted to respond to his loving but passion it seemed was dead or almost dead within her the only time she felt the slightest bit of it was when he would tongue her little jewel but when his manhood lay embedded inside of her she could feel nothing at all but the thickness of it within her in an effort to resurrect her passion she had tried to remember all her times with wulf ironfist but she soon realized that recalling her saxon husband only seemed to render her body and soul colder than before several times she had come close to shrieking her frustration and pushing aspar away because he was not wulf and could not give her the joy she had once known in her husbands strong arms finally she had dismissed wulf from her conscious mind while her byzantine lord made love to her it was easier that way aspar rubbed his face between her breasts one hand reaching up to fondle her they are like perfect little ivory apples he said his palm cupping the firm flesh and admiring it gently his other hand pressed upon her back and when she bent slightly he lifted his head up to suckle upon the nipple his teeth teased at the sensitive nub and then his tongue encircled it enticingly before he suckled hard on it again ahhhhh she breathed her fingers digging lightly into his muscled shoulders he transferred his attentions to her other breast his hand kneading and cuddling until she felt as if her breasts would burst with pleasure he then pressed the palm of his hand against her venus mont as he began a leisurely exploration with lips and tongue of her slender torso each kiss upon her tingling skin was distinct and individual his other hand was lightly clasped about her right buttock the tips of his fingers caressing her his tongue pushed into her navel and cailin murmured softly as it simulated what was to soon come as if to emphasize the point he pushed through her nether lips with a single finger and thrust it into her sheath cailins head whirled and her knees began to buckle he felt her weakness and withdrawing the finger he pulled her to her knees facing him aspars dark eyes locked onto hers as he offered her his finger running it sensuously over her lips until she opened her mouth and sucked on it clutching at his hand until he pulled the finger away and caressed her throat she lowered her head and bit his hand lightly surprising him then kissed his knuckles something is different tonight cailin thought and looking up at him she realized that he could feel it too she did not dare speak for fear of breaking the spell that seemed to be enfolding them he took her by the shoulders and his lips touched hers in what had been meant to be a tender kiss the kiss however deepened quickly and her mouth opened to take in his tongue which danced primitively and hotly with hers then he was covering her face with kisses again and cailins head fell back her neck straining almost desperately as his lips burned their way down the perfumed column of her throat she stroked his hot hard body her fingers entwined themselves deep within his thick black hair as she fell back upon his spread cloak he moved his mouth slowly almost with reluctance down her body until his tongue found the delicate and sensitive jewel of her womanhood rousing it to melting sweetness with a stronger force than she had ever before felt then his soldiers body was covering hers his engorged manhood pressing forward to sheath itself within her cailin gasped with surprise as she realized that for the first time in two years her body was anxious nay desperate for a mans possession she shuddered with actual pleasure as he filled her her arms tightened about him drawing him as close as she could reveling in the feeling of him against her their eyes met even as he began to move slowly upon her cailin could not look away nor she realized could he their very souls seemed to blend as the rhythm of his sensuous movement began to communicate the rising passion between them he said nothing but she could feel him willing her to wrap her legs about him and she did then she began to match his thrusts with voluptuous pleasureseeking motions of her own the cadence of their deep desire grew almost savage in its intensity until both cailin and aspar were overcome by its tender violence she flew her spirit seemed to slip from her body and soar out over the still silvery sea she was one with the earth and the sky and the silken waters below nothing mattered but the sweetness enfolding them cradling them warmly in its embrace they were one together aspar she cried his name softly in his ear as she came slowly to herself once again and then her vision cleared she saw his dear face his cheeks wet with tears cailin smiled happily at him pulling his head down to kiss away those tears realizing at the same time that she was weeping too finally they lay together upon his cloak calm once more their fingers entwined and he said with a small attempt at humor if i had but known my love that making love to you upon the beach in the moonlight would result in such delight i should have done it months ago how much time we have wasted in our bed and in the bath we will waste time no more she promised him and when he leaned over to kiss her her features were radiant whatever prevented me from sharing passion with you before this night is now gone my dear lord i am like our mother the earth reborn with the springtime if aspars love for cailin had been restrained previously in consideration of her feelings that love was now plainly visible to all who saw them together aspar became more determined than ever that cailin should be his wife we will go to some country priest and have him marry us he said firmly once the rite is performed what can they do you must be my wife there is no one in the empire who does not know flavius aspar cailin said quietly and there is no one who does not know of the patriarchs wishes in this matter even were i to become one of your christians my dear lord i should not be allowed to become your wife those few brief months that i spent at villa maxima have destroyed my reputation there must be some way in which i can convince the patriarch aspar said to basilicus one afternoon as they came from the palace where they had been conferring with the emperor flacilla has married justin gabras and the pair of them are the scandal of the city with their orgies and their parties which rival anything the brothels can create how can the patriarch justify such a union while denying me the opportunity to marry my cailin who is so good her goodness does not enter into it my friend basilicus replied and it is not just the patriarch we have a law here in byzantium that specifically forbids the union of a senator or other person of high rank with an actress or a whore or any woman of lower rank you would not be allowed to circumvent the law aspar not even you cailin is a patrician aspar protested angrily she says she is basilicus answered but who is to prove her truthful or a liar here in byzantium she was an actress in a brothel performing sexual acts before an audience that makes her ineligible to marry with the first patrician of the empire flavius aspar then i will leave the empire aspar said grimly i can no longer be content or useful if i am denied my wish in this matter basilicus did not argue aspar would not leave byzantium his whole world was here and he was not a young man besides even based upon his brief acquaintance with cailin basilicus felt she would not allow aspar to do anything that could endanger his position or his comfort casia tells me you have asked her to sit in your box at the games next week the prince said changing the subject it is kind of you and i have said she may go although it will cause a small scandal who else will you invite my friend entertainers and artisans i doubt not aspar laughed ahhh yes he said how could i the empires first patrician and great general dare to prefer those who create to those in power eh basilicus but i do and you are correct both bellisarius and apollodorus the great classical actor and the masses favorite comedian will be in my box on may eleventh and anastasius the singer and poet as well as john andronicus the artist who does those marvelous ivory carvings and philippicus arcadius the sculptor i have commissioned him to do a nude of cailin for our garden he will spend the summer at the villa i have built him a studio in which to work so he will not have to travel back and forth between the country and the city nor worry about his daily needs which my servants will see to your sister will enjoy that piece of gossip basilicus indeed she will he admitted and then he said are not bellisarius and apollodorus dreadful rivals i heard that they despised each other is it safe having them in the same box their hatred has recently turned to love or so i hear aspar chuckled there is another tidbit for our beloved empress verina to chew upon the gods they havent become lovers but of course they have or you would not say it basilicus exclaimed they had reached his litter and he climbed in settling himself comfortably amid the pillows aspar mounted his stallion which had been tethered next to the princes conveyance is your wife coming to the games basilicus nodded mournfully eudoxia would not miss a chance to seat herself in the imperial box where she can be seen admired and bitterly envied by all of her friends and relations seated in the stands i will be by her side as convention demands but afterward when she goes to the palace to enjoy the banquet i shall join my adorable casia will not eudoxia miss you at the banquet basilicus nay the prince replied she will be too busy sampling all the delicacies offered the imperial guests and of course there is that young guardsman who has recently taken her eye i believe she means to seduce him eventually and i do want to give her the opportunity if she is busy with her young man then she will not wonder if i am busy somewhere else eudoxia rarely strays from her marital vows and so when she does i like to give her as clear a field as possible she is an excellent wife and mother to our children i might add that her discretion in her little peccadillos is commendable to say the least there has never been the tiniest bit of scandal about her which is certainly more than one can say about most patrician wives these days how fortunate for you both aspar said dryly he did not understand the kind of marriage that most of the nobility had true there were exceptions couples who like his late wife anna and himself kept to their vows of fidelity and loyalty that was the kind of marriage he would share with cailin one day i am not needed in town until the games he said to the prince i will see you then he rode off down the mese toward the golden gate as basilicus ordered his bearers to take him to the house of his mistress the fair casia may eleventh dawned clear and sunny it was a perfect day to celebrate the founding of constantinople cailin dressed carefully fully aware that she would be the subject of gossip she wanted to make aspar proud and so she chose a stola of pale violet silk which complemented her eye color the round neckline was low but not immodestly so the long sleeves were embroidered with wide gold bands showing flowers and leaves the stola was belted just below her waist with a girdle of small gold plaques studded with pearls that sat neatly atop her hipbones a delicate gold and violet shawl of brocatelle known as a palla would protect her from the burning rays of the sun nellwyn slipped little jeweled kid slippers onto her mistresss feet and then stood up to view cailin her eyes mirrored her approval youll look as good as that empress woman lady she said only if she has jewelry to rival verinas aspar said as he came forward with a large ebony box these are for you my love cailin took the box he handed her set it upon the table and opened it within was a beautifully bejeweled collar of gold small diamonds amethysts and pearls she stood stunned as he lifted it from its case and fastened it about her neck it lay flat upon her chest almost covering the skin her neckline revealed and it made the stola look far richer than it truly was i have never seen anything so magnificent cailin said it is beautiful my dear lord thank you there is more he said quietly and lifting out a pair of large pendant earrings he handed them to her with a smile cailin smiled tremulously back at him and affixed the large single teardrop amethysts set in gold filigree to her ears there wereseveral bracelets in the box as well two gold bangles set with diamonds and pearls and a wide gold band with inlaid mosaic that glittered and glistened with the light finally there was a filigreed gold headband studded with amethysts and diamonds cailin fitted it over the sheer mauvecolored veil covering her hair which she wore loose in deference to aspar who liked it that way i will be the envy of every man in the hippodrome today he said sincerely you are the most beautiful woman in a city of beauties i wish to be the envy of no one cailin told him honestly the last time i knew such happiness and contentment the gods snatched it away from me i lost everything i held dear now that i have found happiness again i want to keep it my lord do not boast lest the gods hear you and grow jealous of us we will keep it he said firmly and i will keep you safe cailin traveled to the city in her comfortable litter while aspar rode his big white stallion by her side he was greeted by many people along the way cailin watching from the security of her conveyance felt her heart swell with her love for this great and good man there was no doubt that flavius aspar was wellrespected by ordinary citizens not simply feared for his power and wealth they entered the city through the golden gate this was constantinoples ceremonial triumphal gate made of pristine white marble set into theodosiuss walls the gate gained its name from the enormous burnished brass doors with which it was fitted the elegant severity of the gates architecture and its splendid proportions made it an object of admiration throughout the empire passing through the gate they traveled slowly with the increasing crowds down the mese to the hippodrome at the golden gate they had been met by a troop of cavalry that had come to escort aspar and his party along the broad main avenue of the city as they surrounded cailins litter she discreetly closed the silk curtains she was well aware that she was the object of certain curiosity among the soldiers but she could not allow them to stare boldly at her as if she were a common prostitute the hippodrome could seat forty thousand people and was an imitation of romes circus maximus however it had never hosted games quite as cruel as those in rome nor had it seen the martyrdom of innocents it had been first built by the roman emperor septimus severus but remodeled by the great byzantine emperor constantine i the entertainments it offered were varied there was everything from animal baiting theatrical amusements and gladiators to chariot racing religious processions state ceremonies and the public torture of famous prisoners entry to the hippodrome was gained by presenting a special token and tokens were issued free in advance of the games to the populace who came to sit regardless of class upon the snowy marble tiers of seats in the center of the hippodrome a line of monuments had been erected forming what was called a spina the spina indicated the division between the downward race course and the upward one among the monuments was the serpent column which had been brought to constantinople from the temple of apollo in delphi by constantine i the ancient column made up of intertwined bronze snakes had been given to the temple by thirtyone greek cities in the year bc it commemorated the victory of the greeks over the persians and was presented to the gods with gratitude another monument that stood out was the egyptian obelisk that theodosius i had placed upon a sculptured base it was carved on all four sides with scenes of imperial life including one of theodosius himself in the imperial box with his family and close friends watching the games cailins litter was set down by a private gate to the arena on the eastern side aspar dismounted his stallion and proudly handed her from the vehicle he knew that every man in the cavalry troop was eager to see the woman rumored to have captured his heart a dainty jewelencrusted gold sandal was put forth first as she stepped from the litter eyes widened knowing looks were exchanged by the soldiers most not a little envious and as the empires first patrician escorted his beautiful young mistress into the hippodrome a long low whistle of admiration echoed behind them aspar grinned just as any small boy with a new and most admired toy would have but cailin scolded him softly shame on you my lord you need not look so delighted with yourself as if you did something worthy of praise all those randy young soldiers are wondering about is if it is your power your wealth or your skill as a lover that has gained you a young and pretty mistress it is nothing to be proud of she finished looking indignant a decent woman would be shamed but you are not considered a decent woman he teased her those randy young soldiers as you call them would envy me even more if they knew the passionate wildly wanton creature you have recently become my back is covered with weals that are a testament to your delicious newfound desire my love ahh yes you do well to blush he chuckled but i am content to have you so utterly shameless in my behalf she was blushing but she was also unable to restrain her laughter his happiness at having been able to overcome the ice in which her soul had been so encased made her happy it is you who are shameless my lord she countered you preen like a peacock in full plumage and you fully enjoyed displaying me to those young men she giggled they all looked so surprised when they saw me is your reputation such that they did not think you capable of attracting a pretty woman they should but know you as i do if they did my love i should be called by a different name and would have taken jovian for my lover he chuckled my lord cailin was overcome by another fit of mirth he led her up a flight of stairs explaining as they went that this was the way to the two private boxes allowed in the hippodrome other than the imperial box the patriarchs box is on the emperors right hand and the box of the first patrician of the empire is on the emperors left hand i have come early so we will not cause a disturbance with an obvious entry it would not do to have the crowds hail me before the emperor we will slip quietly into the box and then be on hand to greet our guests the emperor will not come until the races are ready to begin there will be four races this morning and four in the afternoon in between we will see other entertainments and zeno will come with our servants to bring us luncheon i have never seen chariot races cailin said who will be racing today there was an amphitheater in corinium for games but my father never took us he said the games were cruel some are aspar admitted but there will be no gladiators today i have been told there will be actors and wrestlers and more gentle amusements that do not take away from the racing we have four chariot teams here in constantinople the reds the whites the blues and the greens they will be racing and the passions they arouse in the collective breast of the populace is ofttimes terrifying wagers will be placed and you are apt to see a fight or two between the adherents of a particular team and their rivals you are safe in the box which team to do you favor my lord she asked him the greens he said they are the best and the blues come after them the reds and the whites are nothing though they try then i shall favor the greens as well cailin said they had reached a small landing where the staircase divided into two sets of stairs and taking the three steps up to their left they entered aspars box an awning of cloth of gold striped with purple roofed the box there were comfortable marble chairs with silken cushions and benches set about all with a good view of the arena the public stands were beginning to fill up but no one noticed them and a quick glance showed cailin that the imperial party and the important religious personages were not yet in their boxes there are no steps going to the emperors box she said to aspar how does he enter it there are stairs directly into the box that lead from a tunnel beneath the palace walls he told her it allows our emperor a quick exit should he find he needs it ive always thought it an excellent place for an ambush but there is really nothing one can do should that occur cailin a young woman had entered the box behind them cailin turned and recognized casia looking particularly radiant in scarlet and gold silks cailin held out her hands in welcome she had wondered how she would feel seeing casia again but the young woman had always been kind to her fortune has smiled on you i am told she said greeting casia i am happy you could come my lady casia aspar said with a smile and cailin felt a surge of jealousy race through her his eyes were too warm and too knowing my lord it is good to see you once again i owe you a debt of gratitude for introducing me to my prince i had not intended to buy my freedom from villa maxima until next year but when the prince offered me his favor i surprised my masters and purchased myself from them that i might avail myself of the princes munificence casia smiled warmly at them both and settled herself comfortably next to cailin aspar bowed again and replied then you are both happy with the arrangement and for that i am glad casia you are wise enough still i trust to look to your future princes are often fickle casia laughed merrily i am a frugal woman my lord if jovian and phocas had had the slightest inkling of what i had saved during my three years with them they would have set my price higher they did not however and i came away quite comfortably fixed the house in which i reside is also mine i insisted basilicus understood and was generous i will not end my days in the streets like a foolish woman i would be unhappy were it so he answered her there was no time for cailin to interrogate her lover for the rest of their guests were entering the box being introduced and bowing over the ladies bellisarius the famed classical actor and his current lover the ribald comic actor apollodorus were first elegantly attired in white and gold dalmaticas and both quite witty they awed cailin at first she was not used to such men but casia chatted easily with them trading gossip and insults as easily as if she had known them her entire life anastasius the great byzantine singer arrived and spoke to them in a bare whisper which was aspar explained to cailin his custom anastasius spoke little if at all saving his glorious voice for song john andronicus the ivory carver and arcadius the sculptor arrived almost simultaneously the former was a shy man but sweetnatured he greeted his host and hostess politely the latter was his opposite a bold fellow with a bolder eye casia i recognize so it must be this ethereal beauty you want me to immortalize my lord arcadius stared hard at cailin the body i can see he continued mentally stripping her clothes away is obviously every bit as beautiful as the face you will make my summer a joy lady for there is nothing i love better than sculpting a lovely woman aspar smiled amused as cailin blushed again i thought her a perfect subject for your classical hands arcadius she is venus reborn he said i shall certainly gain more pleasure from the work you have commissioned me to do my lord than all the saints i have been sculpting as of late the sculptor admitted suddenly the crowd roared noisily and the inhabitants of aspars box turned to see the emperor and his party entering their box leo had a severe yet serene face but even in his elegant rich robes one could not have called him distinguished or regal it was cailins first glimpse of byzantiums ruler and she had to remember that aspar had chosen this former member of his household staff for greatness because of his other qualities the empress however was a different matter she was a blazing star to her husbands calm moon the rest of the royal party were made up of men and women among whom only basilicuss face was familiar the clergy in their black robes had already taken their place before the imperial party arrived but cailin had been too busy with her own guests to notice them before now after a few minutes time aspar said to cailin watch standing on a marble step placed at the front of his box emperor leo raised a fold of his gold and purple robes and made the sign of the cross three times facing first the center tier of seats and then those to the right and finally to the left he blessed all those in the hippodrome then reaching into his robes he drew forth a white handkerchief which aspar whispered to cailin was called a mappa dropping the white silk square would signal the beginning of the games the mappa fluttered from leos fingers the stable doors of the hippodrome wall were pulled open and the first of the four chariots to race drove out onto the course the audience exploded into cheers the charioteers each controlling four spirited horses were dressed in short sleeveless leather tunics which were held firmly in place by crossed leather belts around their calves were leather puttees all were physically wellformed and many handsome the women called out to them waving the colored ribbons of their favorite teams and the charioteers laughing with exuberance grinned and waved back women should not be allowed at the games the patriarch was heard to mutter darkly in his box it is immodest of them to be here women attended the games in rome a young priest rashly said and look what has happened to rome the patriarch replied grimly while around him the other clerics nodded and agreed have either of you ever been to the races before arcadius asked cailin and casia and when they replied in the negative he said then i will explain all to you in which order the chariots line up is chosen by lot the day before each driver must circle the course seven times see the stand down by the spina where the prefect in the oldfashioned toga is standing do you see the seven ostrich eggs upon the stand they will be removed one by one as each round of the race is run usually a small silver palm is awarded the winner of each race but because today commemorates the founding of our city a golden crown of laurel leaves will be given the winning drivers of all but the last two races there will be a fierce competition between the greens and the blues to see who takes home the most crowns look theyre off the chariots thundered off around the race course within moments the horses were frothing at the mouth and sweat was flying off their shining flanks their drivers drove with a reckless abandon such as cailin had never seen at first it appeared that the race course was wide enough to accommodate all four vehicles but cailin shortly saw that in order to win the drivers had to steer their chariots all over the course this way and that struggling to get ahead of their competitors sparks flew as wheels from opposing chariots clanged together gratingly and the drivers used their whips not only on their horses but on the other drivers in their path as well the crowd screamed itself hoarse as the green teams chariot spun around the final turn on one wheel almost tipping over but quickly righting itself only to be cut off by the blue teams chariot which leapt ahead suddenly crossing the finish line first by just a nose both chariots came to a halt and the drivers of the blue and green teams immediately engaged in a violent fistfight pulled apart they left the track shouting curses at one another as the chariots for the next race queued up and dashed off cailin was delighted by the chariot races a celt in her soul she had always admired good horseflesh and the horses racing were the finest she had ever seen where do those magnificent animals come from she asked aspar ive never seen better they are finerboned than the horses in britain and they look highspirited their speed and surefootedness is commendable they come from the east he told her and are highly prized does no one raise them here in byzantium my lord she wondered not to my knowledge my love why are you so curious could we not take some of your land and instead of growing grain put it into pasture in order to raise these horses if they are so prized here then certainly these animals would bring you a fine profit the market for these beasts would be great as it would be far more accessible to and less risky for the chariot teams than importing animals from the east if we raised our own horses they could see them grow from birth and even choose early those whom they felt showed promise cailin concluded what think you my lord i think she is brilliant arcadius chimed in enthusiastically we would have to find an excellent stallion or two for breeding purposes and we would need at least a dozen mares to start aspar thought aloud i would have to go to syria myself to find the animals we should allow no one there to realize our intent the syrians pride themselves on their fine horses and their profitable export market i can probably obtain young mares here and there by pretending i want them for the ladies in my family who amuse themselves riding when in the country normally he told cailin women do not ride the greens have won the second race while you chattered casia chimed in the blues are crying collusion for the reds and the whites seemed to have made a decided effort to cut off the blue teams driver at every turn and he finished dead last between each of the mornings four races there was a little entertainment as performed by mimes acrobats and finally a man with a troupe of amusing little dogs that leapt through hoops did tumblesaults and danced upon their hind legs to the music of a flute these intervals were brief but a much longer one came between the mornings races and those to be run in the afternoon then the emperors box emptied as did the patriarchs where are they going cailin asked of no one in particular to a small banquet that has been prepared for leo and his invited guests aspar told her look about you my love everyone has brought food and is beginning to eat it and here is zeno with luncheon for our guests as always old friend you are prompt aspar positively dotes upon you casia said in a low voice to cailin as their luncheon was being set out you are very fortunate my young friend to have found such a man the rumor is he would marry you if he could but do not count upon it i do not cailin said i dare not i have grown to love aspar but still something deep within me warns of danger sometimes i can ignore that voice within but at other times it nags and frightens me so that i cannot sleep aspar does not know this i would not distress him in any way he loves me casia and is so good to me you are just fearful because the last time you allowed yourself to love a man with all your heart you were cruelly separated from him cailin it will not happen again she accepted a goblet of wine offered her by the attending zeno and sipped it ahh cyprian delicious an imperial guardsman entered the box my lord general he said politely the emperor requests that you join him at table thank the emperor aspar said annoyed leo knew that he had guests of his own tell hjm it would be impolite of me to leave my own invited guests but that if he needs me i will attend him afterward the guardsman bowed and had turned to go when cailin said wait she took aspars hands in her own and looked up at him go my lord please go if only for my sake no matter how gently you couch your refusal you will insult the emperor i will entertain our guests until your return she leaned over and gave him a gentle kiss upon the cheek now go and you will be pleasant and polite not irritated aspar arose reluctantly for your sake my love but only for your sake you would not have me offend leo yet his invitation offends me because it ignores you and the others with us i do not exist for the emperor nor does casia as for the others they are artisans and actors sometimes invited sometimes not cailin said wisely with a small smile she was quickly learning the ways of byzantiums society go that your return be all the sooner you have more breeding than most of the court arcadius said to her arching a dark eyebrow you are not what you seem i think cailin smiled serenely i am what i am she answered arcadius chuckled and seeing he would get no more from her today turned his attention to the rather excellent ham upon his silver plate he would learn what he wanted to know this summer when she posed for him shortly after aspar had departed the box another imperial guardsman entered it and bowing to cailin said lady you are to come with me if you please what is it you want she asked him and who has sent you the guardsman was young and he blushed at her frank scrutiny lady he agonized i cannot say this is a private matter before cailin might speak again casia leaned forward allowing the young man a very good view of her full bosom do you know who i am young sir she purred at him my my you are such a handsome fellow arcadius snickered casia would have the information she wanted within a very short time by the look on the guardsmans face nay lady i do not know you the young man replied nervously unable to tear his eyes from her snowy white breasts should i i am prince basilicuss special friend young sir and if you do not tell the lady cailin who sent you i shall tell my prince of your rudeness and of how you violated me with your wicked brown eyes now speak the young guardsman guiltily raised his eyes he reddened and then he murmured low the empress lady then looking anxiously at cailin he said she means you no harm lady she is a fine woman both casia and arcadius laughed causing the other guests in the box to look up from their food with curiosity cailin arose since you all know with whom i shall be there is little to fear i will go with you young sir smoothing the wrinkles from her stola she followed him from the box and down the staircase at the foot of the stairs was a small door in the entry wall so cleverly hidden that cailin had not noticed it before the guardsman pressed the wall in a certain spot and the door opened to reveal a second flight of steps she hurried down them following the young soldier they entered what cailin realized was the main corridor to the imperial box the tunnel was welllit with torches and several feet down from where they had entered the guardsman stopped and pressing upon the wall revealed another door which sprang open at his touch before them was a room and within it a woman who turned at the sound of the door opening come in she said in a low wellmodulated voice wait for us outside john she ordered the guardsman you have done well the door shut behind cailin who bowed politely to verina you do not look like a whore the empress said frankly i am not one cailin replied quietly yet you lived at villa maxima for several months and took part in what i am told was one of the most notorious entertainments ever seen in this or any other city verina said if you are not a whore then what exactly are you my name is cailin drusus and i am a briton my family descends from the great roman family my ancestor flavius drusus was a tribune in the fourteenth gemina legion and came to britain with the emperor claudius my father was gaius drusus corinium almost two years ago i was kidnapped and sold into slavery i was a wife and a mother when this happened i was brought in a consignment of slaves to this city jovian maxima bought me in the common market for four folles lady what he did with me you are obviously aware my lord aspar rescued me from that shameful captivity and freed me cailin finished proudly verina was fascinated you have the look of a patrician and you speak well she said you live as aspars mistress dont you cailin drusus they say he loves you not just with his body but with his heart as well i did not think him capable of such a weakness is love then a weakness majesty cailin said softly for those in power it is the empress replied honestly those in power must never have any weakness that can be exploited against them yes love of a woman of children of any kind is a weakness yet your priests teach that love conquers all cailin said you are not a christian then verina asked father michael who was sent to me by the patriarch says that i am not yet ready to be baptized a christian he says i ask too many questions and have not the proper humility for a woman the apostle paul i have been told said that women should humble themselves before men i am afraid i am not humble enough cailin replied verina laughed if most of us were not baptized as infants we should never be for we lack humility as well cailin drusus but you must be baptized if you are to become aspars wife the general of the eastern armies cannot have a pagan for a wife it will not be tolerated surely you can deceive this father michael into believing you have learned humility aspars wife she could not have heard the empress correctly verina saw the startled look on cailins beautiful face and divined immediately what had caused it yes she told the surprised girl you heard me correctly i said aspars wife cailin drusus i have been told that it is impossible for me to attain such a status majesty cailin said slowly she had to think i have been told that there is a law in byzantium forbidding marriages between the nobility and those who are actresses and entertainers i have been told that the time i spent at villa maxima would negate my patrician birth it is important to me verina answered her that i retain the goodwill and support of general aspar it is true that you came here as a slave and served as an entertainer in a brothel cailin drusus but you are a patrician i have no doubts as to your lineage i watched you this morning your manner is cultured and you are obviously wellbred i believe what you have told me of your background is true your time at villa maxima was short those who know of it will remain silent or i will see that they are silenced when you become aspars wife you do want to be his wife cailin nodded slowly and then said what do you want of me majesty such a favor will have a high price i know verina smiled archly you are wise to understand that cailin drusus very well i will help overcome the objections voiced to a marriage between you and general aspar if you in return will guarantee me his aid should i need it and he must swear to me himself on the relic of the true cross that he is my man should i need him i know you can convince him to do this in return for my help cailins heart was hammering this is not something that i can broach easily she said i will speak with him in a few days time majesty but how will i be able to communicate my success or failure to you for now i do not even exist as far as your world is concerned if i did you would have invited me to your banquet not just aspar who had to be separated from me so you and i could meet secretly here beneath the walls of the hippodrome it is so refreshing to have someone speak openly and honestly the empress said here at byzantiums court everyone couches their words in hidden meaning and motives are often so complex as to be unknown speak with your lord and in a few days time i will come one afternoon by sea with a few trusted companions to visit the generals summer villa if anyone learns of my visit it will be thought i am merely curious and it will cause no scandal leo is a very righteous man and i am a most loyal helpmate if he learns of my excursion he will naturally assume i have been led astray by my companions an assumption i will not correct such occurrences have happened before she smiled meaningfully i will do my very best for you majesty cailin said the empress laughed i have no doubt that you will my dear after all both our future happiness depends on your being successful and i am a bad enemy to have i promise you but we must get back if i stay too long away from the banquet my absence will be noted verina went to the door and opened it saying john return this lady to her box and then take up your post as before farewell cailin drusus cailin bowed politely and backed from the room as she followed the guardsman along the tunnel and up the two flights of stairs her mind was awhirl with the events of the last few minutes reentering her box she was accosted by an eager casia what did she want casia whispered and arcadius leaned over to hear cailins answer she was but curious cailin said with a smile how very dull her life must be that she was that curious about aspars mistress ohh casia sighed disappointed but arcadius could see that cailin simply chose not to tell the other woman all that had transpired it was obviously going to be a most interesting summer below them half a dozen jugglers were amusing the restless crowds by parading around the raceway balancing various colored balls in the air above them they were followed by a marvelous procession of exotic animals aspar returned to the box and slipping into the seat next cailin put an arm about her casia looked to arcadius with a smug little smile and he grinned back ohhhh cailin squealed i have never seen beasts like those what are they and striped ones too there are two kinds the great gray mammoths with the long noses are called elephants aspar told her history tells us that the great carthaginian general hannibal crossed over the alps to win many victories on the backs of elephants the striped cats are called tigers they come from india a land far to the east of byzantium the striped horses are zebras the tall spotted creatures my lord and the funny beasts with humps what are they the first are giraffes they are from africa originally but all these creatures live in the imperial zoo now foreign countries are always gifting us with rare animals for our zoo the other animals are camels they are wonderful she said her eyes shining her excitement very much like that of a child i have never seen beasts like this before in britain we have deer rabbits wolves foxes badgers hedgehogs and other common creatures but nothing like elephants ahhh arcadius sighed dramatically to see byzantium afresh through cailin drususs marvelous violet eyes violent eyes who has violent eyes demanded apollodorus the comedian violet you shameless comic arcadius snapped cailin drusus has violetcolored eyes look at them they are beautiful womens eyes never tell the truth apollodorus said wickedly not so casia cried do you tell the truth when you look into a mans eyes the comic demanded courtesans are hardly noted for their veracity and actors are casia replied scathingly anastasius the singer chuckled softly at her reply it was the first sound cailin believed he had made since entering the box the emperor is returning john andronicus the ivory carver warned the combatants he too had said little since joining them cailin now took the opportunity to speak with him we have one of your charming pieces at the villa she told him it is lovely venus surrounded by a group of winged cupids one of my earlier pieces the carver admitted smiling shyly nowadays i do mostly religious works for the churches it is a very lucrative market and it is my way of returning the gift that god has generously given me lady i am doing a nativity for the emperor right now may i join you prince basilicus said slipping discreetly into the generals box casia my love you look delicious enough to eat and i shall later he blew a kiss at her what of your wife eudoxia my friend you should not embarrass her aspar reprimanded the prince sternly her little friend is on duty in the imperial box basilicus said with a grin she wants time to flirt with him and can hardly do so with me hovering by her side besides flacilla and justin gabras are also in the emperors box see there they are on the far side i do not know why leo allows them in his presence but probably he did not invite them my sister undoubtedly did they are really a dreadful pair aspar their parties i am told are so depraved that the inhabitants of sodom and gomorrah would blush what is worse is that they are so happy flacilla has truly found a mate worthy of her they are awful in their perfection together very well you may stay but be discreet aspar warned i am happy to see you my lord cailin said smiling lady you grow more beautiful with each passing minute the prince gallantly responded i can tell you are happy and he is happy too basilicus then turned to casia how lovely you look today my pet scarlet and gold suits you well we will have to see how rubies set in gold look against your soft fair skin eh the races began anew the four horse teams kicking the sandy floor of the hippodrome as they careened and skidded down the course in their quest for victory in the morning the greens had taken two races the blue one and the reds the final race now the white team took the first of the afternoons contests and then the blues had a second victory tying them with the green team but the day was to go to the greens victorious in the last two races they accepted from leos own hands an aurigarion which was a gold emblem a silver helmet and a silver belt the crowds who had already screamed themselves hoarse howled their approval anew and the games were formally concluded as the imperial box emptied of its inhabitants suddenly those people in the seats nearest to aspar saw the green ribbons he carried and took up the cry aspar aspar aspar a small look of annoyance passed quickly over aspars face but it was swiftly gone turning he acknowledged the crowds cheers with a friendly wave of his hand that was enough to satisfy them but not enough to encourage further homage or admiration from the citizens of the city how politic you are basilicus mocked him this little incident will of course be reported to leo magnified with proper embellishments naturally and the poor man will be torn between his gratitude to you and his fear that you may one day displace him the prince laughed leo knows that i prefer being a private citizen to being an emperor aspar said should he ever doubt it i will reassure him once again on the matter frankly if he would let me i should retire not you basilicus said with a broad chuckle you will die in service to byzantium casia my angel have you something delicious for my supper i am coming with you you are not going to the palace for the celebratory banquet aspar asked his friend i know you said earlier you would not but is not your presence mandatory i will not be missed i assure you my friend the prince replied besides the patriarch is invited he will pray over the food for so long that it will be inedible when he is done and hardly worth being thankful for at all he finished with a chuckle i will take better care of him my lord casia said and his meal will be precisely to his liking will it not my prince basilicuss eyes glittered wickedly in agreement casia turned to cailin may i come and see you one day i am so pleased that you included me in your party today we have both come a distance since our days at villa maxima of course you may come cailin said sincerely i have been quite alone at villa mare when my lord is away though i have just obtained a young saxon slave girl who keeps me company i love to listen to your gossip casia you seem to know everything that is going on in constantinople i admit to being happier in the country however the country is pleasant to visit casia responded but i was born in athens and i prefer the city myself basilicus likes to speak greek with me he is so very hellenized for a byzantine cailin bid all of their guests farewell and arcadius promised that he would be arriving at villa mare shortly to begin his work casia entered her litter along with basilicus and they moved off into the crowds leaving the hippodrome cailin climbed into her own conveyance i am required to attend the emperor at the palace aspar said leaning down to speak privately with her i will send my cavalry troup to escort you home and join you as soon as i can i do not need your soldiers beyond the gates my lord the road is safe and busy and it is daylight they will aid me in getting through the crowds but no farther i pray you very well my love i will send a messenger if i am going to be late wait up for me if you can cailin what did the emperor want earlier my lord she asked him curious my presence and nothing more it is his way of exercising his authority and i obey him because it reassures him aspar said wisely the invitation to the banquet when he knows i dislike banquets is but another test the church is always spilling poison in leos ear because i am not orthodox in my beliefs by obeying him unquestioningly i make the patriarchs lies seem foolish leo is not a stupid man he is fearful yes but not unintelligent it is the empress who worries me why cailin said she is ambitious far more so than leo verina would like a son to follow in leos footsteps they have but two daughters i do not know if she will get that son leo prefers prayer to pleasure it seems if that is a virtue my lord and one necessary to an emperor you will indeed never be emperor cailin said with a laugh you far prefer pleasure to prayer i do not think i have ever seen you in prayer to either the christian god or any god in answer he placed his lips upon hers and kissed her slowly with passion she responded warmly running her tongue mischievously along his fleshy mouth as his hand slipped beneath her gown to fondle a breast her nipple immediately hardened and she moaned softly removing his lips from hers he smiled wickedly into her face i will come as soon as i can my love he promised removing his hand from her gown but not before he gave her nipple a little pinch she caught her breath and then letting it out slowly promised him i will wait my lord and be prepared to do your every bidding chapter did you see the way he looked at her flacilla strabo said to her husband justin gabras he loves her he actually loves her her face was angry why do you care he answered you never loved him it should not matter to you that he loves her that is not the point she snapped do not be so stupid justin can you not see how embarrassing his open passion is he did not give his love to me but he has given it to that little whore i will be a laughingstock among all those who know us how dare he bring that creature to the games and sit so boldly with her in his box for all to see even if no one knew who she was practically everyone in constantinople knows casia particularly now that she is prince basilicuss mistress how like aspar to surround himself with artisans actors and whores you are not particularly attractive when you are angry my dear wife justin gabras softly chided flacilla your skin becomes quite mottled you would do well to keep your temper in check particularly when we are in public he leaned across the ripe young body of the slave girl who lay between them and tipping flacillas face up to his kissed her hard i do not choose to discuss this matter any more flacilla my love and further mention of your former husband is apt to rouse my blackest ire you know what happens when my anger is stoked he ran a hand down the slave girls body let us concentrate on far pleasanter diversions like our charming little leah is she not lovely my dear and so eager for our tender attentions are you not leah ohh yes my lord the girl responded dutifully arching herself toward him teasingly i long for your touch justin gabras smiled lazily at the pretty compliant creature then seeing his wife was still not content he said harshly you will have your revenge flacilla but which would you prefer a quick strike which will allow aspar to strike back at us or wait for the right moment and then destroy them both i would have you happy my dear make your choice now and then let us be done with this matter it begins to bore me mightily will he suffer she demanded i want him to suffer for his rejection of me if you will wait for the right moment so i may plan it properly yes he will suffer aspars life will become a hell on earth i promise you but you must be patient flacilla very well she responded i will bide my time justin as impatient as i am to destroy aspar you have a skill for evil such as i have never before witnessed i will trust in that mastery of wickedness that you possess now which one of us is to have leah first flacilla looked upon the girl and smiled she is indeed lovely my lord she is not a virgin is she no he said she is not it would please me if you took her first flacilla i like watching you perform with another woman you are very good at it i must admit and more tender with one of your own sex than you are with those young men you so favor and yet brutalize she smiled archly at him men she said are meant to be punished by women but women should be cherished by lovers of either sex a woman cherished gives far more than one abused justin then aspar must truly cherish the fair cailin he replied cruelly though he looked at her with eyes of love his looks were returned by that adorable little beauty tenfold if he loves her as you so believe she i assure you loves him in return and that knowledge she told him strangely calm will make our revenge so much sweeter justin my lord will it not he laughed you match me evil for evil flacilla i wonder what your friend the empress would think of you if she knew your true character would the beauteous verina be shocked one day i shall have her in my bed i swear she is ripe for rebellion you know leo virtually ignores her these days and spends the time he should spend fucking her on his knees in prayer for an heir or so the court chatter reports to me the very next afternoon the subject of justin gabrass gossip gathered a small party consisting of her brother and two trusted maids and set out from the imperial yacht basin to cruise the early summer seas west of the city it was a perfect afternoon for such sport and theirs was not the only sailing vessel plying the bluegreen waters of the propontis that afternoon there was just enough of a breeze to gently propel the boat the sun shone warmly from a perfectly clear sky basilicus had sailed this small inland sea since his boyhood and he was familiar with its twisting shore and its currents his skill meant that they needed no boatman who might later be bribed for information or carelessly gossip of their destination the two women who accompanied the empress would have died for her their loyalty was such that they could be trusted not to speak even under duress cailin had not known for certain when the empress would come to villa mare but she knew that she would have only a few days after the games before verina would put in an appearance she did not like keeping secrets from aspar and so she spoke to him the morning following their visit to the hippodrome he listened quietly as she told him of verinas secret summons and its outcome his face grave whatever it is she desires of me he said it must be very important to her she agrees to sponsor our marriage if you give it to her cailin said to him still i fear that she might urge you to something unsavory i can do nothing that smacks of treason in the slightest he responded my honor has always been my strongest defense my love as much as i love you and as much as i want you for my wife i will not compromise my honor cailin you do understand that i could not love you flavius aspar if you were not a man of honor cailin told him remember that i was raised in the traditions of the old roman empire honor was still paramount when my ancestor came to britain with claudius and it remained so down through the centuries as we became britons my lord i would ask nothing dishonorable of you still it cannot hurt to hear what the empress has to say i will listen he promised her if verina is to be moved to some foolish action perhaps i may dissuade her from it the empresss mission however was not foolish it stemmed rather from her fears as she explained to aspar in the privacy of his garden while cailin and the maidservants were left behind in the comfort of the atrium with basilicus to amuse them verina was pale and she had obviously not been sleeping well she moved restlessly amid the budding flowers her fingers plucking nervously at her skirts aspar keeping pace with her encouraged her to speak cailin has told me of your meeting on the day of the games he said do not dissemble with me lady what is it you want of me i need to know that should a crisis arise flavius aspar that you will support my position the empress said softly i will be frank lady is this treason you speak of verina paled even more no no she gasped i do not explain well i fear the situation is embarrassing to me oh how shall i say it plainly he told her whatever you say is between us alone lady i will grant you the privacy of the confessional this one time if there is no treason involved then you have nothing to fear from me what is it that troubles you so that you seek my aid in secret it is certain of the priests who surround my husband verina said they encourage him to believe i alone am responsible for the fact we do not have a son i want a son but how can we have one if leo does not visit my bed he has never been an overly passionate man and in recent years he has ceased visiting my bed altogether the priests have become his greatest confidants they exhort him to greater prayer and to almsgiving that god will give us a son but unless my husband binds his body to mine again there will be no child i even brought casia the courtesan my brother favors to the palace in secret to teach me her seductive wiles i wanted to use them to entice my husband but alas it was to no avail the empress said her blue eyes filling with tears now there is a movement afoot among those same priests who influence my husband to put me away in a convent for the remainder of my days that leo might take a new young wife who will the priests assure leo give him the son i cannot i am not a girl any longer my lord verina said with dignity but i am yet capable of bearing a child given the opportunity to do so these wicked clerics really seek to give my husband a wife who will be in their debt and who will spy for them what is it exactly that you want me to do aspar asked her leo both fears and respects you my lord the empress said the respect stems from his many long years in your service and the fear stems from the fact you put him in his high place he sometimes wonders if you might not be capable of also removing him from that place he has quickly grown fond of his position the priests fill his ears with cruel words about you flavius aspar verina continued they tell him you wish to rule through him and that if you find you cannot you will overthrow him and take the throne for yourself i do not wish to be emperor aspar said in his rational moments leo must know that had i wanted the imperial throne it would have been mine i had but to renounce my arian beliefs for more orthodox practices and enough of the clergy would have supported me so that the imperial crown would have rested on my head i realize that my lord which is why i have come to you your motives are honest and your loyalty is to byzantium alone not to any faction or single man help me to retain my place at my husbands side despite the wickedness of those who surround him if you aid and protect me against my enemies i will see to it that leo permits your marriage to cailin drusus aspar pretended to consider her offer although he had already decided to help her the emperor owed flavius aspar his position if his wife was similarly bound to him so much the better his own position would be that much stronger it was very unlikely that leo would ever father another child on any woman he had not the stomach for it he preferred fasting and prayer to the hot sweaty tangle of passion aspar suspected the emperor would actually be secretly delighted to be relieved of such a duty verina had always been a loyal wife to him he would prefer the old and the familiar to anything new and nubile no aspar thought i do not want to be emperor i want my son to be emperor with both leo and verina in his debt he would have the power to foster a betrothal between his younger son patricius and the youngest imperial princess ariadne in a few years time first the marriage and then afterward leo would be convinced to name patricius his heir i will champion your cause lady aspar finally told the empress who sagged visibly relieved against his arm these priests overstep their authority their only duty is to the emperors spiritual welfare i will personally register my distress at their actions to the patriarch once that is done i know we can trust that he will put an end to the matter i am truly shocked those chosen to guide leo spiritually would so abuse their position it must not be allowed to continue you were quite right to come to me for help lady secure now that her cause was just verina straightened herself proudly and said you will not find me ungrateful my lord it will take a little time you know but i will see that you and cailin drusus are allowed to formalize your relationship within the church you have my word on it and you know that word is good i thank you lady aspar said quietly no she responded it is i who must thank you flavius aspar i could only wish byzantium had more men like you in its service when the empress and her party had departed to return to constantinople aspar walked with cailin in the gardens where there was no chance of them being overheard quietly he explained to her exactly what it was verina had sought from him and how he had agreed to help the empress in exchange for her aid in the matter of their marriage you must force yourself to please father michael so he will baptize you aspar told her when the moment comes that the decision is made in our favor i want no impediment to our marriage a baptized orthodox wife can only reflect favorably upon me there is more at stake than you can know right now my love she did not ask him what it was cailin knew that aspar would share that with her when the time was right very well she agreed i will stop asking difficult questions of father michael and meekly accept all he says with the humility a good christian woman should possess if i think the rules and regulations imposed by the church are silly i must admit to liking the words of this jesus of nazareth they alone make sense to me even if the rest of it doesnt she slipped her arms about his neck and pressed her body close to his i want to be your wife flavius aspar i want your children and i want to walk the streets of constantinople proudly the envy of all because i am yours they walked together through the gardens and down to the beach where they removed their garments they strolled hand in hand into the warm sea he had just recently taught her to swim and cailin loved the freedom of the water laughing she teased him and frolicked in the waves until finally he caught her pulling her back up onto the beach he made passionate love to her upon the very shore where he had first revived her passion her cries of pleasure at his possession of her mingled with the mewling cries of the gulls soaring above them his own cries were drowned by the gentle pounding of the surf on the sand afterward they lay sated and contented the bright sun drying their bodies cailins twentieth birthday had passed the summer spun itself out in a succession of long sunny days and hot passionate nights she had never imagined a man could be so virile particularly a man of his age and yet his desire for her never ceased basilicus came quite regularly with casia to visit and when aspar teased his friend about his sudden liking for the country basilicus claimed fussily the city is a cesspit in this heat and i hear rumors of plague besides you have more than enough room for us and should not keep to yourselves so much basilicus also secretly brought them word from verina aspar had indeed gone directly to the patriarch and expressed his great displeasure at any plan to set the empress aside simply over the matter of a male heir another wife would do no good aspar bluntly pointed out to byzantiums chief cleric the fault lay with leo who preferred an uncomplicated ascetic existence now which allowed him to rule more wisely than if he were overburdened with carnal matters there were plenty of men fit to follow leo but a wise and godly emperor was a rare blessing upon byzantium the empress aspar told the patriarch understood this she sought to protect her husband from disturbing influences she was both virtuous and devotedly loyal to disturb her peace of mind was aspar forcefully noted wicked unjust and ungodly basilicus reported that the priests surrounding the emperor had been removed and reassigned to distant places new priests took their place and seemed to devote themselves only to the emperors spiritual life the empress was both relieved and grateful to have this sword of damocles removed from over her beautiful blond head she sent word through her brother that she would keep her promise she had already begun her campaign to influence leo more favorably in the matter of a marriage between the empires first patrician and cailin drusus a young patrician widow from britain who was soon to be baptized into the orthodox christian faith in early autumn aspar was sent to adrianople where the governor of the city was having difficulties with two rival factions that threatened anarchy within the city one of the factions was made up of orthodox christians and the other of arian christians since aspar an arian who served an orthodox ruler had the ability to move easily between these two religious worlds he was the logical choice to make peace men of all faiths respected flavius aspar i wish i could take you with me he told cailin the night before his departure but i must be able to move swiftly and without impediment at all times in a matter like this these fanatics will quarrel with one another over the most foolish things but unless their anger is stayed they cause terrible destruction and lives are lost i would be a weakness to you she said without me you are able to act decisively and you may have to my lord to kill and wreak havoc over a point of religion is pure madness but it happens far too often you will be such a perfect wife for me he said admiringly why she teased him because i share your passion or because i do not complain when you must be away from me both he said with a smile you have an inborn skill for understanding people you know the fine line i must walk between those fanatical factions in adrianople and you do not distract me from my duty those who have opposed our marriage will soon see that they were wrong and that cailin drusus is the only wife for aspar i do not distract you she pretended to be offended and mounting him suddenly glared down into his handsome face her pointed little tongue snaked over her lips suggestively slowly her eyes darkened with her passion and cupping her breasts in her hands she teased her own nipples erect can i not distract you just the tiniest bit my lord he watched her through slitted eyes as she played a faint smile upon her lips he knew her certainty of his love was what made her bold and it was surely to his benefit she was so young and so very beautiful he thought lazily running both his flattened palms up her torso sometimes when he looked at her he wondered if when he became old she would love him still and fear gnawed at his vitals then she would smile at him and kiss him sweetly and reassured he knew she would always love him for it was her nature to be honest and loyal his fingers clamped about her waist and he lifted her up slightly allowing his engorged organ to raise itself up you distract me mightily my love he said softly lowering her slowly encasing himself fully within the warm sweetness of her hot wet sheath then pulling her forward almost roughly he kissed her deeply sensuously his mouth soft yet firm against hers turning her quickly over onto her back so that he now held the ascendant position and you are hereby sentenced to spend the remainder of your days distracting me cailin he growled lovingly in her ear as he plunged with slow deliberation in and out of her eager body i adore you my love and soon you will be mine for all eternity my wife my very life the sweet bright half of my dark dark soul i love you flavius aspar she told him half sobbing and then cailin was lost again in the very special world he seemed to be able to weave about her now she was warm and cold at the same time her heart both raced and soared with his loving but if her place was in his heart and in his arms then why was she afraid then her crisis overwhelming her cailin cried out with pleasure and her fears were quickly forgotten in the security and the safety of his loving arms happily she snuggled against him and fell asleep when she awoke in the morning he was already gone nellwyn brought her a tray with newly made yogurt ripe apricots and fresh bread with a little pot of honey master arcadius asks if you will pose for him today he says he is almost finished and can be gone by weeks end if you will but cooperate i think he is anxious to return to constantinople the summer is over he talks about the autumn games tell him i will be there in an hour cailin told her servant i want the statue completed and mounted upon its pedestal in the garden before my lord returns it will be my wedding surprise for him i never saw anything like it before nellwyn admitted its so beautiful lady i thought only the gods were portrayed so the statue represents venus the old goddess of love cailin explained i have simply posed in place of the goddess for arcadius cailin ate and then having bathed joined the sculptor in his studio nellwyn in attendance she removed her tunica and took her position he worked for a time his eye moving between the smaller clay statue he had originally fashioned from her pose and cailin herself when he saw she was growing tired he stopped and cailin put on her tunica before they went to sit outside in the sunshine and drink sweet freshly squeezed orange juice and nibble upon sesame cakes that zeno brought them i shall miss your company cailin told arcadius i enjoy all your wicked gossip and have learned much of those with whom i will have to associate when i am married to aspar your life will not be easy he answered her frankly those at the court with whom you should associate will avoid you until they know you and even when they know your true worth some will continue to shun you cailin drusus only those of whom you should be wary will be eager to cultivate your friendship due to the influence you have with aspar or because they hope to seduce you as they have so many others your virtue in light of the gossip surrounding you will truly madden them what a paradox you byzantines are cailin said you espouse a religion that preaches goodness and yet there is so much evil among you i do not really understand your people at all our society is simple arcadius told her the rich desire power and more riches these things make them feel invincible and so they behave as other people would not dare to behave they are crueler and more carnal and because their faith promises them forgiveness if they will but repent they do so every now and then ridding themselves of their past sins so they may go and sin some more this is not unique to byzantium alone cailin all civilizations reach this apogee at some point in their development those less rich imitate their betters and the poor are kept in their place by a topheavy bureaucracy and a beneficent ruler who allows them into the games free bread and circuses my dear girl keep the poor in check except for those rare times when plague or famine or war interfere with the workings of the government when those things happen even emperors are not safe on their thrones he chuckled i am a cynic as you can see all i desire cailin replied is to marry my dear lord and if the gods will it bear him a child i shall live here in the country raise my children and be content i want no part of byzantiums intrigues arcadius you will not be able to escape them dear girl he said aspar is not some unimportant noble with a country estate to which he may retire this idyll you have been living cannot continue once you are married you will have to accept your proper place at court as the wife of the empires first patrician take my advice dear girl and do not ally yourself with any faction no matter how seductively they importune you to join them and they will you must remain neutral as does aspar he has but one loyalty and that is to byzantium itself my loyalty is to aspar she said quietly but firmly that is good ah yes dear girl i can see you will not be lured by the sirens song sung at the court you are too sensible now let us return to the business of immortalizing you he said chuckling you have an outrageously lush form for such a practical woman tell me about these games you are so eager to return to the city for arcadius cailin said after she had resumed her pose i thought there were only games in may on the day of commemoration i did not know they were held at other times will there be chariot races i did enjoy the races there are games held several times during the year he answered her but these particular games are being sponsored by justin gabras to celebrate his marriage to aspars former wife flacilla strabo he was unable to schedule them sooner because in the spring everything is concentrated on the may games then the weather grew too hot in the summer so justin gabras planned his games to coincide with the sixthmonth anniversary of his marriage to flacilla there will be racing in the morning and gladiators in the afternoon gabras i am told has paid for death matches i have never seen gladiators cailin said they fight with swords and shields dont they what are death matches well dear girl arcadius began i see that this is another area of your education i shall have to fill in for you gladiatorial bouts first began in ancient campania and etruria from whence our ancestors sprang the first gladiators were slaves made to battle each other to the death for their masters amusement such matches came to rome eventually but were held only during the funeral games for distinguished men they were rare for many years then slowly gladiatorial bouts began being sponsored privately and the emperor augustus funded a few of what he called extraordinary shows eventually the gladiators were scheduled regularly at the public games in december on the saturnalia while politicians and others wishing the publics support supplied free gladiatorial combats at other times the populace loved the excitement and the blood lust of such games in the beginning gladiators were captives taken in war who far preferred death to becoming slaves they were trained fighters soon however with the roman peace imposed over most of the world the supply of captives dwindled and it became necessary to train men who were not soldiers many criminals were sentenced to become gladiators but even so there was not enough of a supply to fill the now great demand many innocent men were accused of petty offenses and condemned to the ring early christians were sacrificed because there were not enough criminals or captives to be found when there were not enough men available women and yes even small children were sent into the ring to fight how awful cailin cried but arcadius continued unmoved there were schools for gladiators in capua praeneste rome and pompeii as well as other cities some schools were owned by wealthy nobles so they might train their own fighters but others were the property of men who dealt in gladiators the schools were strictly run because their purpose was to ensure a steady supply of competent effective fighters the teachers were tough but they trained their charges well and carefully diet was monitored each day held a round of gymnastics and lessons from weapons experts eventually however it became impossible to obtain enough students to train even from among captives and criminals todays gladiators are free men who have chosen the life for themselves i cannot imagine why cailin replied it sounds terrible but what of the weapons they use arcadius and how do they fight in pairs usually he said although in the past gladiatorial combats have pitted masses of men against masses of men usually few were left standing professional gladiators are divided into three groups samnites who are heavily armed thracians who are lightly armed and there are net fighters the net mans weapons are his large net his daggers and a spear you still have not told me what a death match is cailin said the combatants fight to the death unless of course gabras grants the loser of each match mercy knowing justin gabras i doubt he will he will be far more popular with the people if he gives them a show of blood how horrible cailin said shuddering i do not think i would like these gladiatorial combats knowing that one of the two men has to die it adds spice to the match knowing it arcadius said the combatants are always magnificent fighters under such circumstances i am surprised that any free man would agree to fight under such conditions cailin noted to know that you might be killed is such a frightening prospect she shuddered but there is always the chance you will not be killed he answered besides the fee for a death match is far better than for just the ordinary combat the little gossip that reaches me here tells me that the current unbeaten champion a man known as the saxon is to fight in gabrass games i feel sorry for him cailin said if he is the unbeaten champion then all the others will strive harder to bring him down he faces the most danger true arcadius agreed but it will make for a far more exciting match you may step down cailin and clothe yourself i am finished he stepped back to admire his handiwork it is done and it is one of my greatest masterpieces i think he said feigning understatement aspar should be wellpleased and inclined to pay me on time for my efforts what of the base she demanded i want it set in the garden facing the sea before aspar returns from adrianople i have an apprentice in the city working on the pedestal my dear he told her the marble is most unique a pink and white mixture i have no idea where it came from we found it lying about beneath some old clothes in the rear of my studio but when i saw it i knew it was the perfect piece of stone for our venus come and look now cailin had slipped her tunica back on she came around to view her statue the young venus as arcadius liked to call it stood her body slightly curved one arm at her side the other raised the hand palm outward as if shielding her eyes from the sun her hair was piled atop her head but here and there errant ringlets had escaped and curled about her slender neck and delicate ears there was just the faintest hint of a smile upon her face she was both pristine and serene in face and form it is beautiful cailin finally said she was frankly awed by the sculptors skill she could almost see the pulse at the base of the young venus throat each fingernail and toenail was perfect in its detail and there was so much more your simple homage is more than enough praise he said quietly he could see the admiration in her eyes not for how he had portrayed her but for his talent and his art her lack of sophistication was refreshing arcadius thought had this been a woman of the court she would have complained that he had not really caught her essence and then tried to cheat him of his fee well it had been a most pleasant interlude tomorrow he would return to the city and begin a set of six figures for the altar of a new church being built in constantinople when the pedestal is done dear girl he said i shall come myself to see the statue installed upon it i think flavius aspar will be most pleased with what we have accomplished together after he departed the following day cailin found that she missed the scupltors company he had been a charming and most amusing companion nellwyn was a sweet girl but a simple one cailin could not speak on complicated matters with her she just did not understand still she was pleasant company and cailin was glad for her presence the harvest was a good one on flavius aspars estates and as cailin walked across the fields with nellwyn greeting the workers she again considered the possibility of aspars raising horses for the chariot races the estates tenants already raised hay and grain for their cattle and other stock much of the pasturage was as suitable for horses as for cattle if aspar needed even more land perhaps he could obtain it from overtaxed landowners whose properties bordered his own she would bring it up with him again when he returned casia came to visit for a few days duration and brought news of the city basilicus swears to me that leo will give his consent to your marriage when aspar returns the generals efforts in adrianople it seems are proving successful it will cost leo nothing from his imperial treasury to give his general what he truly desires she said with a laugh did arcadius finish your statue a few weeks ago he is coming soon with the pedestal to install it in the garden i want it done before aspar returns cailin answered would you like to see it casia of course the beautiful courtesan said laughing do youthink i mentioned it just merely in passing i am dying of curiosity arcadius calls it the young venus cailin explained as she unveiled the statue in the artists summer studio what do you think casia stood spellbound and then she finally said he has caught you perfectly cailin your youth your beauty that sweet innocence that shows in your face despite all you have been through yes arcadius has caught your very soul and were i not truly your friend i should be very jealous of you she took cailins hand in hers and squeezing it said soon we shall no longer be able to pursue our friendship why cailin demanded because i am to be aspars wife and you are basilicuss mistress no casia i will not play their cruel games we will remain friends no matter the change in my status casias lovely eyes filled with tears and she said i have never had a friend until you cailin drusus i hope you are right i have never had a friend either casia antonia porcius pretended to be my friend though i always knew she was not friends do not betray friends i know we will never betray each other now tell me the gossip from the city i miss arcadiuss ribald chatter they walked from the studio down to the beach where they sat upon the sand and casia told her all the latest news of the town basilicuss wife eudoxia finally seduced her young guardsman he was the very same fellow who brought you to the empress casia began his seed is most potent and poor eudoxia became pregnant practically immediately despite her best efforts to avoid it i am told basilicus was furious she wanted to have an abortion but he would not allow it he has sent her to her parents home outside of ephesus for her confinement i do not know how he dares to be so righteous considering the relationship he has with you cailin said with a small smile it does seem unfair casia agreed but you must remember that there are different rules for men and women basilicus had been most lenient with eudoxia because she is a good wife and mother she is not at all wanton like flacilla that is why he allowed her her little diversion becoming pregnant however was very careless on eudoxias part and has proven a great embarrassment to basilicus eudoxia should have considered the consequences when she acted so rashly the child is due early next summer and will be given in adoption to a good family poor eudoxia will remain in ephesus until it is born i do not mind basilicus is now free to spend more time with me his children are practically grown and do not need him i wonder what they must think of their mother cailin said basilicuss son knows the truth and wanted to dash right off and kill the poor guardsman basilicus explained most forcefully to him that one cannot kill a man for accepting what was freely offered as for the princes daughters they do not know or at least he hopes they do not they have been told their mother has gone to ephesus to care for their sick grandparents and basilicus sent them to st barbaras convent to keep them safe until their mother returns left alone who knows what mischief they might get into girls are most inventive where do you come from cailin asked her friend as they gazed at the water athens i think i once heard you say where is that it is a city on the aegean sea south of constantinople i was born in a brothel that my mother owned my father was an official of the government there he was not i remember wellliked when he died they closed down my mothers business i was just ten but i was sold into slavery immediately i do not know what happened to my mother or little brother i was brought to constantinople and bought by jovian for villa maxima i was very lucky casia said you know how well they treat children at villa maxima they are taught to read and write and to do simple sums they learn manners and how to please the men and women who patronize the establishment when i was thirteen my virginity was auctioned off to the highest bidder jovian and phocas had never before nor have they since received such a high price for a virgin she said proudly because i had been taught well how to please a man and because i seem to have a talent for such work i became quite popular jovian warned me to be choosy about whom i pleasured for it was my right to refuse any man it proved to be excellent advice the more discerning i appeared to be the more desperate men became to have me and the more willing to pay the highest price i managed to garner some magnificent gifts from my appreciative lovers she smiled then basilicus came and after a short time i realized he wanted more than just an occasional visit to my bed i hinted such a thing might be possible he offered to give me my own home in a good district and so i purchased my freedom from villa maxima how old are you cailin asked her but a year your senior casia replied cailin was surprised casia seemed older but then of course she would while i was playing with my dolls cailin thought casia was learning her lessons in a brothel how long will you keep the prince as a lover she asked her friend i mean well you are used to a variety of lovers does not having just one bore you casia laughed had the question come from anyone else she would have been offended but she knew cailin meant no offense by it that she was only curious one lover at a time my friend is really quite enough she replied as for your other question i will remain with basilicus as long as it pleases us both he and i will never marry as you and aspar will i am no patrician like you cailin drusus being a patrician has not protected me from evil cailin said quietly still though i once complained that fortune did not smile upon me i was wrong i may have lost my husband and child but i have been given aspar to love ohh casia he wants children and at his age casia shuddered delicately better you dear friend than me she said i am not the maternal sort i fear fortunately my prince is content with his wifes efforts at producing offspringwhen they are his own they came up from the beach and sat by the fish pond in the atrium sipping sweet wine and indulging themselves with honey cakes that zenos wife anna had made them the city casia said is agog with excitement over the games that justin gabras is sponsoring at the hippodrome in a few days hes brought in gladiators for death matches i can hardly wait arcadius told me cailin responded i am glad i do not have to see such a thing i think its horrible not really casia replied you would get used to it good gladiators are magnificent to watch but they are a rare breed now the church does not approve of them but i will bet the patriarch and his minions will all be there in their box howling with the same blood lust as the rest of us she laughed they are such hypocrites i am sorry you are not going i shall have to sit in the stands then but i would not miss these matches for the world the saxon is fighting he has never they say lost a match he seems to have no fear of death and his other appetites are equally insatiable i am told casia stayed at villa mare for three days the day before she left arcadius arrived with a wagon in which sat the pedestal for the young venus and several beefy helpers who were to move the statue from the studio to its place in the garden the two young women watched fascinated as the work was carried out hard pressed not to laugh at the sculptor who fussed and fumed at the workmen as they went about their task finally the young venus was settled upon her pink and white marble base angled so that she was facing the sea arcadius heaved a great sigh of relief well he demanded what think you casia was visibly impressed and said so cailin simply kissed the sculptor on the cheek causing him to flush with pleasure it is marvelous he agreed with them stay with us tonight cailin said yes casia echoed you can return to the city in the morning in my litter with me arcadius twill be a far nicer trip than if you ride back in the wagon with your workmen who smell of onions and sweat arcadius shuddered at her rather graphic but accurate description i will remain he said and instructed his foreman to take the men and return to constantinople then turning to the women he told them the gladiators arrived yesterday they paraded through the city in full regalia as if that were necessary to stimulate interest in the games the populace is in a frenzy already i cannot tell you how many women fainted at the sight of the champion he is frankly the most magnificent piece of male flesh i have ever seen it would be a pity if he were killed but then he has prevailed so far casia and arcadius city people to the bone chattered on throughout the evening filling cailins ears with all manner of gossip though it was amusing she was frankly relieved to be able to seek her quiet bed that night and to bid her guests farewell in the morning she wondered if she would indeed have to involve herself in the affairs of the court once she and aspar were married perhaps arcadius was wrong in the afternoon cailin swam in the still warm sea and lay naked on the beach drying in the autumn sun the peace was wonderful and she reveled in it she fell asleep and when she awoke she was filled with new energy and was suddenly eager to have aspar home chapter aspar returned to villa mare late the next evening and immediately took cailin to bed in the early morning when they had sated themselves of their desire for each other they lay talking i arrived in constantinople yesterday afternoon he told her and reported immediately to leo the difficulties in adrianople have been overcome there is peace in that city once more although for how long i cannot say i have little patience with those who argue over creed and clan what fools they are they are most of the world cailin said but i agree with you my love most people like to think life a deep and difficult puzzle but it is not i believe we are bound by one threadour humanity if we would but put our differences aside and weave the cloth of our fate with that one thread there would be no more differences between us you are too young to be so wise he teased her kissing her lightly and then he said would you like to know my reward for this recent service to byzantium he smiled into her face his brown eyes twinkling mischievously at her cailins heart began to race she didnt even dare to voice the question she simply nodded you are to be baptized on november first by the patriarch himself in the private chapel of the imperial palace aspar told her then the patriarch will marry us leo and verina will stand as our formal witnesses you will have to choose a byzantine name of course she gasped it was true then annamarie she managed to say anna for your good wife who was the mother of your children and marie for the mother of jesus you have chosen well he said no one can help but approve but i will never call you anything but cailin my love to the world you will be annamarie the wife of flavius aspar but it is cailin with whom i fell in love and will continue to love for all time i cannot believe that the emperor and the patriarch have at last given their consent cailin told him her eyes wet with tears neither of them are fools my love aspar told her your introduction into byzantine society could hardly be called a conventional one he said with a small smile yet both leo and the church know your behavior since i bought and freed you has been far more circumspect than most of the women at court especially in light of the current scandal surrounding basilicuss wife eudoxia as for me i have given my life for byzantium and if in my later years i cannot have what i so deeply desire what further use will i be to the empire did you tell them that cailin asked surprised that he would have lowered his guard so greatly before the emperor and the patriarch aye i did aspar admitted and then chuckled the threat was merely implied my love i hold a great advantage over the emperor in that there is no other soldier of my standing who can lead the armies of the empire if i were to retire from public life he smiled at her again i left it to their imaginations it did not take long for leo to decide and he argued the patriarch into acquiescence most convincingly the emperor has recently learned the value of a loyal and virtuous wife then having gained my hearts desire i was forced to sit through a banquet which is why i was so late in arriving last night did you miss me greatly my love i missed you terribly she flattered him but i was not too lonely arcadius finished the statue it now stands in the garden my wedding gift to you aspar he has also counseled me most wisely on the court i shall remain a party to no faction i promise you do you want to go to court he asked surprised not really cailin told him arcadius says it is my duty once i am the wife of the first patrician of the empire but i would far prefer to remain here in the country then you shall he told her arcadius is just an old gossip you will of course be expected to appear at state functions where i am required to be but otherwise if you choose to live a quiet life you most certainly may i shall give you children to raise and my care will naturally be foremost in your duties your days will be most full he teased her gently running his hand across her shoulder i want to raise chariot horses she told him we have spoken of it before i offer you children to raise and you ask for horses he pretended to be offended but cailin knew better pushing him back amid the pillows she kissed him sliding her hands across his hard chest i am a clever woman my lord i can raise both your children and your horses the celts have a way with horses you are a shameless wench to wheedle me so he said rolling her beneath him then sheathing his hardness within her soft body how many stallions will you need he demanded moving subtly upon her pleased to see the look on her face turning to one of passion how he had missed her i but need this stallion my sweet lord she told him molding her body tightly to his as he stoked her pleasure but two champions should do for the herd of mares we will assemble ohhhhhh the gods she had missed him more than she realized he ceased his movements and lay easily atop her his hands carressing the sweet small melons of her breasts he wanted to prolong this interlude from the first moment he had taken her he felt like a young man again the feeling had never diminished in the months that they were together with anna there was respect with flacilla there was nothing but cailin with cailin he had found everything he had never even dreamed that such love between two people was possible yet here it was you are certain you want to do this he asked her you have seen the chariot races but once he throbbed within her making it almost impossible for her to concentrate on anything else her breasts ached with sweetness beneath his tender touch i am surprised no one thought of it before she managed to say it is such a logical plan ohh my love you are driving me wild surely no wilder than you are driving me he ground out and then unable to contain himself any longer he bent forward taking her lips and thrust with deliberate ferocity into her softness until they both attained their mutual release when aspar was capable of speech once more he told her we will go to the autumn games observe the races again and then if you still desire it we will make preparations to raise chariot horses but flacillas new husband is sponsoring those games cailin said surprised should we be seen there all of constantinople will be there aspar told her including all of flacillas former lovers you may be certain flacilla and justin gabras will sit in the imperial box with leo and verina at least we will not be subjected to them my love may i ask casia she was disappointed that i was not going to these games and said she would be forced to sit in the stands with the plebes i will not desert her because i am to be your wife i would be disappointed in you if you did he answered yes you may invite casia there will be gossip but i care not i do not want to see the gladiatorial matches cailin told him casia says that they are death matches i could not bear to see some poor man die because he was not as quick or skilled as his opponent i think it cruel of flacillas husband to require blood blood pleases the plebes aspar said matteroffactly watch one match cailin you may not be as horrified as you think you will be if you are truly displeased by it then you may leave but it must be done discreetly my love we cannot insult our despicable host cailin sent a messenger to casia that morning inviting her to join them in their box on the morrow when the games would officially begin casias reply was a delighted acceptance the following day cailin was up early for the games would begin at nine oclock of the morning the races lasting until noon she had prepared her costume carefully her stola with its round low neckline and long tight sleeves was of the finest softest white linen the lower third of the sleeves and the wide hemline as well as a broad stripe extending halfway up the skirt were woven in pure gold and emeraldgreen silk threads the stola was belted tightly at the waist with a wide belt of leather layered with beaten gold and decorated with emeralds that matched the gold and emerald collar about her neck and her elaborate pendant earrings because of the time of year cailin had known she would need some sort of outer garment but she did not want to cover her costume she had cut a semicircular cloak of bright green silk which she fastened on her right shoulder with a fibula made from a single ovalshaped emerald set in gold gold kid slippers shod her feet and her costume was nicely completed by a jeweled silken band about her head from which hung a sheer golden veil aspar in a purpleandgoldembroidered ceremonial garment of white silk called a tunica palmata which he wore with a toga picta of finely spun purple wool embroidered with gold nodded with pleasure when he saw her you will cause many tongues to wag today my love you look magnificent as do you my lord she replied are you certain we will not inspire imperial jealousy i have seen the emperor and you my lord are a far moje regal figure than he a thought you will not share with anyone else but me aspar replied seriously leo is a good administrator he is precisely the emperor byzantium needs leo may be emperor of byzantium cailin said candidly but you are the ruler of my heart flavius aspar tis all i care for my dear lord then she kissed his mouth sweetly smiling into his eyes he laughed oh cailin you will rule not just my heart i fear but my soul as well what a sweet minx you are my love casia and basilicus were already awaiting them at the hippodrome as they entered the silkhung box belonging to the empires first patrician the crowds seeing the general began to call his name aspar aspar aspar he stepped forward and saluting them acknowledged their cheers with a modest smile then he retired to the rear of the box that the populace be allowed to quiet down to the right of the imperial box the patriarch and his minions sat observing it all he does not encourage them the patriarchs secretary observed not yet the patriarch replied someday i think he will still he is a curious man and may prove me wrong the hippodrome suddenly exploded in a frenzy of cheers as the emperor and empress along with the games sponsor and their guests entered the imperial box leo and verina accepted the homage of the crowd with smiling graciousness and then presented justin gabras to the assembled who cheered noisily as gabras waved a languid hand at the sound of the trumpets leo stepped forward and performed the ritual that began the festivities as the mappa fluttered from his fingers the stable doors of the hippodrome burst open to allow the chariots in the first race to dash forth the crowds screamed their encouragement to the four teams just look at that flacilla fumed how dare aspar and basilicus bring their whores to our games the games are for everyone my dear justin gabras replied his eyes taking in cailin avidly what a magnificent creature he thought how i would like to have her in my power even for just a few minutes i do not think it right that the empires first patrician flaunt his mistress so publicly flacilla persisted oh flacilla verina said with a light laugh your jealousy is astounding to behold particularly given the fact neither you or aspar could stand one another during your marriage that is not the point flacilla replied aspar should not be seen publicly with a woman of loose morals is that why he was never seen with you my dear her husband inquired drolly and to flacillas mortification both leo and verina laughed she began to weep dear heaven justin gabras exclaimed may i be delivered from the overblown emotions of breeding women he pulled a white silk square from his robes and handed it to his wife wipe your eyes flacilla and do not make a complete fool of yourself you are expecting a child verina was surprised but then that would explain flacillas expanding girth of late flacilla nodded and sniffled in four more months she admitted congratulations were offered all around to justin gabras it could be worse her husband pointed out what if the girl were aspars wife my dear she would take precedence over you at court in her present position she is quite harmless verina could not resist the temptation laid so neatly before her she smiled with false sweetness im afraid that that is exactly what is to happen my lord the emperor and the patriarch have given their permission for aspar to marry with cailin drusus flacilla paled you cannot allow it she gasped the creature is nothing more than a whore oh flacilla verina said calmly you distress yourself over nothing the girls introduction to society here was unconventional i will admit but she was but a short time at villa maxima her background is better than either of ours she conducts herself with a modesty that has even earned the commendation of your cousin the patriarch she will make aspar an excellent wife and believe me in time the rest will be forgotten particularly if you continue to cause such scandals as the one you caused last spring you are a far bigger whore and so are half the women in the court than little cailin drusus the empress smiled and took a cup of wine offered by a servant before flacilla might reply her husband pinched her arm sharply be silent you foolish woman he hissed at her it does not matter not to you flacilla snapped angrily i will never give precedence to that creature never oh flacilla the empress said do not distress yourself look the greens have taken two races in a row this morning she turned to her husband you owe me a new gold necklace my lord and a bracelet too ohhh i hate her flacilla murmured low how i wish i might wreak vengeance on her for her presumption well you cannot now my dear her husband replied softly as aspars mistress she had a certain vulnerability but as aspars wife flacilla she is inviolate look at her modest beautiful soon i wager she will become known for her good works she will be a model mother i have not a doubt she has no fault that i can see if she did we might find a way to spoil aspars happiness but she does not you will have to learn to live with the situation i will not have you upsetting yourself unnecessarily else you lose my child if you do that flacilla i will kill you with my bare hands do you understand me the child means that much to you my lord aye i have never had a legitimate son he said and me my lord do i mean anything to you at all other than as the brood mare who will bear your heir you are the only woman for me flacilla i have told you that often enough but if it pleases you to hear it again very well i never before asked a woman to marry me it is you i want but i want the child too my dear have a care else your bad temper spoil a perfect relationship she turned her eyes to the racecourse knowing that he was right and hating him for it she did not dare look again toward aspars box for she could not bear the sight of her former husband and cailin the chariot races were finally over the interval between the races and the games would be a full hour in the three boxes servants laid out a light luncheon for their masters when they had almost finished eating an imperial guardsman appeared in aspars box the emperor and the empress will receive your loyal respects now my lord and that of your lady too he said bowing politely you did not warn me cailin said to aspar signaling zeno to bring a basin of perfumed water in which to wash her hands she dried them quickly with the linen towel he handed her i was not aware they would receive us today he told her this is a great honor my love they are acknowledging our relationship there can be no going back now cailin you look beautiful casia whispered to her friend i have been watching flacilla she is consumed with jealousy it is a great victory for you my friend savor it aspar and cailin followed the guardsman into the imperial box where the couple knelt before the emperor and empress they are so perfect together verina thought as her husband greeted their guests i have never before seen a bettermatched couple i am almost jealous of their love for each other she was brought back to reality by leos voice and my wife welcomes you also my lady cailin do you not verina indeed my lord the empress replied you can but add more luster to our court lady you are from the former province of britain i am told it is a dark land or so i am informed it is a green and fertile land majesty but perhaps not as sunny and bright a place as is byzantium your springs come earlier and your autumns later than in britain and do you miss your green and fertile land lady the empress inquired politely have you family there yes cailin said i sometimes miss britain majesty i was happy there but she amended with a sweet smile i am happy here with my dear lord aspar wherever he is will be my home well said lady the emperor approved smiling at her how charming she is leo continued after the couple had returned to their own box aspar is a very lucky man i think justin gabras squeezed his wifes hand in warning for he could see she was near to another angry outburst breathe deeply flacilla he instructed her softly and rein in your nasty temper if we are banned from the court because of your ungovernable behavior you will live to regret it i swear it the angry color slowly faded from her face and neck and swallowing hard she nodded her acquiescence i will never be happy again until i can find a way to revenge myself on aspar she whispered let it go my dear he told her there is no way the fat cow is going to have apoplexy casia giggled wickedly in aspars box shes positively purple with rage what did the emperor and the empress say to you that has infuriated her so greatly she has no reason to be angry with us cailin said and then she repeated the conversation she had had with the royal couple suddenly there was a flourish of trumpets and casia said excitedly ohh the games are about to begin i was visiting with my friend mara at villa maxima yesterday and i saw the gladiators there justin gabras has taken it over for the entire term of their stay the public is not allowed he said he wanted his gladiators to have the very best while they were in constantinople jovian is in his glory with all those beautiful young men about and phocas i am told is actually smiling so great a price did gabras pay him wait until you see the champion they call the saxon i have never before seen such a beautiful man castor pollux and apollo pale in comparison ohhhh she squealed here they come now the gladiators marched in procession into the hippodrome parading around it until they reached the imperial box where they stopped weapons raised high they saluted the emperor and their generous patron with a single voice those about to die salute you there is the saxon casia said pointing to the tallest man in the group isnt he magnificent how can you possibly tell cailin teased her friend that helmet with its visor virtually renders him invisible true casia agreed but you will have to take my word for it hes got golden hair and blue blue eyes many saxons do cailin replied aspar leaned over and said the first matches will be fought with blunt weapons my love there will be no blood shed for now and it will give you an idea of the skills involved i think i will prefer it to what must come later cailin told him must all these men fight until only one of them survives no he told her six specific matches will be fought to the death that is the number that gabras purchased from this particular troupe of gladiators two death matches will be fought today two tomorrow and two on the last day of the games the saxon who is the unbeaten champion will fight today and on the last day his main rival is a man called the hun who must fight all three days if he survives the first two days they will probably pair him with the saxon on the last day that should be quite a match i think it horrendous that someone must die cailin said they are young men why it goes against the very teachings of the church to allow such barbarity yet there sits the patriarch and all his priests in their box on the other side of the emperor enjoying this aspar put a gentle hand on hers hush my love lest you be overheard he warned her death is a part of life the battle had begun below them young men with small shields and blunt weapons fought one another en masse the crowds loved it but eventually they began to tire of the mock engagement bring on the saxon bring on the hun they screamed the trumpets sounded a recall and the fighters ran from the arena the groundskeepers came forth and raked the ground smooth then silence descended upon the hippodrome for what seemed several long minutes suddenly the gladiators gate in the wall opened and two men stepped forth the crowds began to scream with their excitement it is the hun aspar said he will fight with a thracian he has no armor cailin said he needs none but the leather shoulder pads he wears my love he is a net man other than his net he has but a dagger and a spear to fight with but i think net men the most dangerous of gladiators the thracian who was helmeted and wore greaves on both legs carried a small shield and a curved sword it seemed to cailin a very unfair match until the two men began to fight the hun tossed his net almost immediately but the thracian sidestepped it and leaping behind his opponent slashed at him the wily hun obviously anticipating the ploy moved quickly and was but scratched by the tip of the thracians blade the men fought back and forth for some minutes while the crowds screamed their encouragement to their favorites finally when cailin had begun to think these combats were vastly overrated for ferocity the hun leapt in the air and with a deft flick of his wrist swirled his net out gracefully the thracian unable to escape was enfolded in the web desperately he thrashed at it with his sword the crowd shrieking with their rising blood lust the hun jammed his spear into the ground drew his dagger out and flung himself down upon the struggling man it happened so quickly that cailin wasnt even certain she had seen it but the sandy floor of the arena was swiftly stained with blood as the hun cut his opponents throat and then stood victorious acknowledging the cheers of the howling mob he was a man of medium height powerfully built and bald but for a horsetail of dark hair sprouting from his skull and tightly wrapped with a leather thong he strode around the ring accepting what he obviously considered his rightful due while he did so the groundskeepers ran forth two of them dragging the lifeless body of the thracian from the arena out through the death gate the other two sprinkling fresh sand atop the blood and raking it vigorously cailin was stunned it was so quick she murmured one moment the thracian had been valiantly defending himself and in the next instant he was dead he had not even cried out gladiators are not usually cruel to one another aspar said gently to her they are generally friends or acquaintances for they live together eat sleep and whore together death matches are rare today and justin gabras must have paid well for them or perhaps these gladiators are just desperate men who do not care some are like that i want to go home cailin said quietly you cannot go now casia cried the last match of the day is about to begin and it is the champion himself the hun is an amateur compared to the saxon if it becomes too bloody you need not look and we will just gossip but you must see him without his helmet he is a god i tell you casia enthused aspar laughed and turning to basilicus said i think i should be worried about casia my old friend if i were you she is obviously quite taken nay fascinated i think a better word by this gladiator he is beautiful to look at casia replied before the prince might say anything but i have usually found that beautiful faces and bodies are all men like the saxon can offer there is nothing else neither wit nor culture after one has enjoyed a good romp in cupids grove it is nice to lie back and chatter is it not my lord basilicus nodded silently but his eyes were twinkling ohh look casia said here are the combatants i should hate to be the poor fellow fighting with the saxon he must know he has no chance how sad for him cailin answered her friend how terrible to know that he is facing his death on this beautiful bright day casia looked discomfited but then she said brightly well there is always the chance that he just might get lucky and beat the champion wouldnt that be exciting at any rate they will put on a good show for us you may be certain the saxon and his opponent were both armed in the samnite fashion each man wore a helmet with a visor each had a thick sleeve on the right arm and a greave on the left leg only the mens waists were encircled with a belt they carried long shields and short swords their combat would be a very close encounter saluting the emperor and their patron they immediately began to fight in spite of herself cailin was fascinated for this match seemed more even than the previous one metal clanged upon metal as the two men thrust and parried with their weapons cailin soon realized that the battle was not so evenly matched after all the saxons antagonist was not his equal in skill the champion jumped and twirled in a series of maneuvers deliberately executed to please the crowd twice the other man left himself open to attack but the saxon feinted to distract attention finally the crowd began to catch on and they screamed with outrage theres few his match basilicus noted hes but tried to give them a good show but they want blood well theyll get it now i think the saxon should have been saved for the final day instead of having him fight two days gabras obviously wanted his moneys worth the combat took a different turn now with the saxon attacking his opponent vigorously while the other man fought desperately to save his life the champion however refused to draw it out any further relentlessly he drove the other samnite across the ring his opponent getting few blows in and striving to protect himself with his shield the saxon rained blow after blow upon it until finally the man fell back exhausted his defense falling from his hand the saxon swiftly and mercifully pierced the other gladiators heart with his sword then he walked across the ring to the cheers of the spectators and saluted the emperor with the bloodied weapon remove your helmet saxon justin gabras said loftily that the emperor may see your face when he congratulates you on your victory the saxon removed his helmet and said there is no victory against a weaker man lord in two days time however i will fight the hun i will bring you his head upon a silver salver and then i will accept your congratulations for a battle well fought you do not fear death the emperor said quietly no majesty the saxon replied i have already lost everything i ever held dear what is death but an escape yet the gods have willed it that i must live for now you are not a christian saxon nay majesty i worship woden and thor they are my gods came the reply but the gods i think do not concern themselves with little men like myself else i should have had my hearts desire cailin stared at the saxon as if mesmerized she could not hear what was being said but she knew he was speaking for his lips were moving it could not be he looked like wulf but it simply could not be wulf was in britain on their lands with a new wife and child this man could not be wulf ironfist and yet she needed to hear his voice to see him up close i told you he was a glorious creature casia purred in smug tones even covered in sweat and dirt he is beautiful is he not cailin cailin cailin she tugged at her friends sleeve what what is it casia what did you say i was not listening i fear you must forgive me i was momentarily distracted casia giggled i can certainly see you were and by what cailin smiled yes he is a beautiful fellow she replied regaining control of herself but despite it all i do not like these gladiatorial combats my lord aspar a guardsman had entered the box the emperor would speak with you a moment aspar hurried from the box when he returned several minutes later he said to cailin there are emissaries here from adrianople it seems the peace there grows more fragile with each hour and fighting is threatening to break out again between the religious factions i am going to try and mediate this here in the palace with leo tonight do you mind going home alone my love cailin shook her head actually she was relieved she needed time to think the resemblance between the saxon and wulf was amazing though his hair was lighter than wulfs corncolored locks had been keep the litter she told aspar whatever time you come home you will need transportation i will go with casia to her house and then her litter will bring me to villa mare of course casia agreed cailin is ever practical my lords basilicus my love you will join me for supper i cannot he said regretfully my sister insists i keep her company this evening for she is entertaining the patriarch perhaps i shall come late my sweet would it please you no casia said i think not my lord if you cannot come to supper then i shall take the time to catch up on my sleep i do not seem to get a great deal of it when you are with me she added suggestively thus tempering her refusal rising she kissed him lightly on the mouth come cailin it will be difficult enough getting through the crowds with the arena emptying itself like a full wine cup good fortune my lord cailin told aspar he bent and cupping her face in his hand touched her lips softly with his when i look at you my love he told her i find my devotion to duty growing weaker and weaker you do not fool me cailin said with a small smile the empire is your first love and i well know it i am willing to share you with byzantium my dearest love he smiled into her face you are without peer among all the women i have ever known cailin drusus i am fortunate to have your love you are fortunate to have his love casia told her as they departed the hippodrome in her large and comfortable litter why did you refuse to allow the prince to come later cailin asked her friend i believe he truly loves you i do not want to cling to basilicus like some dreadful little vine casia said nor do i want basilicus to ever presume upon my love for him i am his mistress not his wife i will not accept part of an evening at his discretion i want an entire evening surely he knew beforehand that he would be with his sister tonight but he did not tell me he presumed that i should be there for him but i am not now am i when cailin did not answer casia focused upon her friend and said have you heard a word that i said what is the matter with you cailin you are suddenly so distracted cailin sighed she needed to confide in someone and casia was the only friend she had it is the saxon she replied aye he is gorgeous casia agreed it is not that cailin answered then what is it casia demanded i think the saxon is wulf ironfist cailin told her friend your husband in britain are you certain the gods i am not certain casia cailin said nervously but i must know we wed because he was tired of fighting and he wanted to settle down my lands were what drew him to me i have thought wulf ironfist to be in britain on those lands these months past i even decided that he must have taken another wife and had a child by now i have to know if the man they call the saxon is he i must know one way or another ohhh cailin you are opening a pandoras box casia warned what if this man is wulf ironfist what will you do do you still love him what of aspar i cannot answer you casia i have no answers i only know i must learn if it is he or if my eyes have been playing tricks upon me she looked so distraught that casias heart went out to her ohhh what am i to do cailin asked and she began to cry well casia said briskly we will simply have to satisfy your curiosity wont we pulling the curtains of her litter open she leaned out and called to her head bearer go to villa maxima peter cailin gasped oh casia no tis madness what if i am seen especially now that i am to be married to aspar who will see us casia said jovian and phocas have closed villa maxima to their regular clientele while the gladiators are in residence i will go in while you remain in the litter with the curtains tightly closed i will seek out jovian and he will know how you may learn if the saxon is your wulf ironfist we will be discreet and you will be safer than if you were in your mothers house again casia promised then you can go home and feel foolish for it is very very unlikely that this gladiator is your man cailin drusus but what if it is wulf cailin fretted casias face grew serious why then my friend you are going to have to decide just what it is you wanta beautiful but savage saxon who is obviously penniless and willing to risk his life in the ring or the cultured and wealthy first patrician of the empire if it were me cailin drusus i would order this litter to turn back and i would return to villa mare this instant if a man like flavius aspar loved me i would thank god each morning when i awoke for the rest of my days i think you are mad to tempt the fates so let me tell peter to turn back i will come home with you and keep you company this night the saxon cannot be wulf ironfist i must know casia seeing him even from a distance has filled my mind with doubts if i do not resolve these doubts how can i ever pledge my faith to aspar what if the saxon is not wulf but someday in the future wulf does appear upon my doorstep what if i still love him the gods forbid it you foolish creature casia exclaimed the litter made its way down the mese and then through a series of side streets the two women had grown quiet casia twisted the rich fabric of her gown with her slender fingers she was already regretting her impulsiveness it was not cailin alone who was opening pandoras box she drew a deep breath nothing was going to come of this cailin having a fit of bridal nerves was seeing ghosts the saxon would turn out to be no one she had ever known still casia started nervously as the litter was set down and her head bearer peter drew back the curtains to reveal that they were in the courtyard of villa maxima cailin reached out touching casias arm encouragingly casia nodded i will find jovian remain here and whatever you do do not open the curtains let them think the litter is empty she stepped from her elegant vehicle peter let no one be aware that i have a companion with me i will not be long yes lady he replied casia hurried into the magnificent atrium of the villa a servant came forward and his eyes widened as he recognized the visitor good afternoon michael casia said will you fetch master jovian to me please i will await him here were you at the games today she inquired brightly was the saxon not wonderful michael allowed himself a small grin casia had a fine eye for the gentlemen and it was apparent she had not lost it he bowed politely at once lady shall i have refreshments sent to you while you wait it is hot for autumn some iced wine perhaps thank you no casia returned i can stay but long enough to speak with master jovian she sat down upon a marble bench watching as the servant went off and wondering how long it would be before jovian put in an appearance the gods why had she ever suggested coming here jovian came into the atrium but to her intense distress he was not alone she silently cursed herself for a fool casia my pet jovian kissed her upon both cheeks what brings you here this day i am quite surprised to see you indeed casia justin gabras purred i too am surprised i wonder if prince basilicus would be also no he would not casia replied sweetly regaining her composure i grant the prince certain favors my lord but he does not own me nor would he presume to interfere with my friendships many of which are of a longstanding nature she turned to jovian may we speak alone before jovian might answer however gabras said secrets my pet i am fascinated what possible secrets could a whore have i believed that everything about you was already common knowledge casia felt her temper rising i wonder how long it will be my lord before you are poisoned with your own venom she snapped jovian where may we speak no no gabras persisted chortling i would know your secrets lady i really will not leave you to master jovian until i do jovian looked helplessly at casia and she shrugged ohh very well if you must know my lord i came to gain a closer look at the gladiators there are you satisfied now justin gabras burst out laughing you women are all alike he said a look you say is that all casia perhaps what you really wanted was to sample their passions which is it who takes your fancy the saxon the hun were you still a resident of this house you would have had your pick of them tonight would you not big sweaty men with big cocks and childish minds do not make particularly good lovers casia replied coolly their bodies however are beautiful and i am a lover of beauty my lord i could see little from our box in the hippodrome which is why i came to villa maxima perhaps i have chosen a bad time i can come back in the morning jovian who was astounded by casias speech finally found his voice yes my darling that would really be better he agreed their day has been long and they are about to enjoy a fine meal and the kind of entertainment that only villa maxima can provide come back in the morning and i will introduce you to them all you may even see them in the baths what was casia about this behavior of hers was quite out of character i will escort you to your litter thank you dear jovian casia said with a smile and i will come too justin gabras told them it is not necessary my lord casia said quickly but i insist justin gabras said smiling toothily at her when they had reached the litter casia said loudly i will come back in the morning jovian and see those beautiful bodies then before she could stop him justin gabras leaned down and pulled the litters curtains aside his eyes widened and reaching in he pulled a resistant cailin forth well well well and what have we here flavius aspars bridetobe come home for a little visit did you come to see the gladiators too my pet or was the purpose of your visit to relive old times cailin shook his hand off her arm and glared icily at him its all my fault casia burst out aspar was called to the palace after the games today i said i would take cailin back to villa mare but i did so want to get a close look at those marvelous men i detoured my litter here cailin did not want to come and as you see she has remained in the litter practically hiding if aspar finds out he will not let us remain friends if aspar finds out the wedding will most likely be off justin gabras said drolly i think not my lord cailin said i have done nothing wrong and my lord aspar knows i am not a liar if i but tell him the truth of this matter he will believe me probably he will justin gabras admitted but will the imperial court or the patriarch they will be all too eager to believe the worst of you cailin drusus he laughed just today i told my wife that you were now inviolate it seems that i was wrong who is to say that we were here today casia demanded given who your wife is my lord do you think you will be believed if you tell tales she pushed past him taking cailins hand in hers come i must get you back to villa mare before it grows dark and the road cannot be seen i will stay the night with you no justin gabras grasped cailins other arm in a bruising grip he had already devised a wicked plan by which he might discredit her jovian casia appealed to the master of the house jovian cannot help you my dears gabras said what do you expect him to do for you you came here of your own free will i did not force you to come now you will stay and amuse my guests my lord gabras cailin said pleadingly why do you do this thing what have i ever done that you should hate my lord aspar so i do not know flavius aspar well enough to hate him was the cold reply but i am tired of hearing my wife flacilla whine for revenge upon him for their loveless marriage no do not tell me that she loved him not she says it often enough herself but hateand hers is very strong toward asparis the other side of the loves coin cailin drusus surely you know that flacillas choler is such that i fear for my unborn child i want that child until this moment i had not the power to give my wife what she claims to desire so dearly your foolishness at coming here has given me an opportunity i never expected to have he smiled cruelly by this time tomorrow flacilla will have her revenge and may rest easy i think spare her casia said and i will personally entertain your guests in any fashion you desire just release cailin i beg you my lord gabras jovian have you no say in any of this i cannot help you jovian said and his eyes filled with tears he would kill me if i tried would you not my lord even if i dared to send for help by the time aspar got here it would be too late you should not have come here tonight casia and you most assuredly should not have brought cailin michael justin gabras called to the servant who came quickly to his side help me take our guests and lock them up until we are ready for them he dragged cailin into the atrium while she struggled in vain to escape his strong fingers let us go casia cried as michael pulled her along in their wake and lock up the whores litter bearers until we are of a mind to release her justin gabras called out to jovian lady i apologize for this michael told cailin as he pushed her into a sparsely furnished windowless room behind casia he shut the door behind them and they heard the lock turning noisily forgive me casia said flinging herself into cailins arms i am a fool to have ever suggested coming here the gods help us both it is as much my fault as yours cailin said generously if i had let the matter of the saxon rest instead of pursuing it we would not be in this predicament what do you think they mean to do it is obvious casia replied gabras will give us to his gladiators it matters not to me i am a whore and used to taking a variety of men between my thighs but you my poor friend she began to cry much to cailins astonishment for casia was not a woman given to tears do not cry cailin comforted her friend strangely she felt nothing right now not even fear gabras will spread word of this incident all over constantinople casia said still sobbing basilicus will never forgive me you love him cailin was again surprised casia nodded aye the gods help me i do he doesnt know of course he is not the kind of man one can confide such an emotion in sadly he will never accept being embarrassed by me i will never see him again after tonight i fear i have ruined not just your life but my own as well perhaps we can escape cailin said hopefully casia her tears finished looked at her friend and shook her head how this room has no windows and but one door which is locked they will come for us and that will be the end of it there is no escape cailin make up your mind to that right now chapter the two women did not have long to wait four male slaves arrived to escort them to the baths where they were thoroughly washed and their bodies rubbed with fragrant oils the bath attendants rubbed cailins auburn ringlets and casias thick long blueblack hair until they were dry their hair was perfumed casias first being braided into a single plait and then floral wreaths were set atop their heads no fresh garments were offered them and the women realized it would be useless to even ask they were then escorted into a large airy room that opened onto the villas beautiful gardens justin gabras sat now garbed in a short white tunic upon a black marble chair the gladiators were assembled before him there were no other women in the room at their entry the men turned their eyes avid with interest the guards forced casia and cailin forward and reaching out justin gabras pulled both women into his lap balancing them each upon a single knee his hands reached up to fondle their breasts pinching at the nipples you have eaten well my friends he said to his guests and now i have a little treat for you these two women are the most exclusive whores in byzantium they are pretty little rabbits are they not we are going to have a little game we shall release these two little rabbits into the gardens and then you as randy a pack of dogs as ive ever seen will chase after them they will hide from you will you not my beauties but someone will find them and whoever the lucky men are will have their pleasure of these women for this entire night there are no losers in this game however the rest of you will have your choice of any other woman in the house after our game is over what think you the gladiators cheered justin gabras lustily by the gods the hun said loudly you give us a difficult choice my lord both of these women are real beauties which do you favor gabras asked him i am not certain the net man replied he turned to his companion what about you wulf ironfist which do you prefer the one i catch the saxon replied and his eyes met cailins casia quickly looked to her friend cailin was paler than she had ever seen her her great violet eyes mirrored both pain and shock is it he casia mouthed silently over the laughter that greeted the saxons remark and cailin nodded if anyone catches cailin casia thought it must be the saxon she looked straight at the hun and smiled her most seductive smile are you as good out of the ring as you are in it she purred suggestively if you are then i shall be happy to be caught in your net to casias surprise the hun turned beetred as his companions whooped with amusement so he was shy but her bold words had certainly made it plain to the others that he was her choice none of the others would dare to come after her now for shy though he might be the hun would want her they would not confront him over a woman she knew she could see the puzzled way in which the saxon was looking at cailin now she must make certain of him cailin drusus she said her friends name loudly do you have a preference among these fine men i think the saxon would suit you admirably i think he would cailin replied having caught on to casias little game so you are no better than the rest of them justin gabras sneered why is it that all women are born whores he did not see how pale the handsome gladiator had become nor the tightening of the saxons lips and the flash of anger in the saxons eyes at his words without waiting for an answer to his question justin gabras dumped the two women from his lap run into the garden and hide yourselves my beauties i will count to fifty and then loose these lusty beasts on you go the two women ran from the room through the marble pillars and out into the early evening twilight when they had gone a ways together into the dimness casia stopped a moment and said hide yourself well cailin and do not come out unless you see the saxon then she was gone down a grassy path cailin fled to the depths of the gardens finally climbing into the branches of a peach tree it was unlikely that anyone would think to look for her up there fifty she heard justin gabras call out the gladiators began to thrash through the gardens noisily seeking the two women within a few minutes she heard the rough voice of the hun crowing triumphantly ive caught a little rabbit lads and casias coy shriek of false surprise the hunt for cailin grew more intense but she felt safe amid the branches of the tree she could even see some of the men below looking under bushes behind the fountains and among the decorative statuary for her they will never find me she thought smugly but then what how could she escape villa maxima without her clothes without a litter suddenly the branch upon which she was perched gave way and cailin fell with a cry to the grass below two men loomed forth from the darkness as she desperately scrambled to her feet a bolt of pain tore through her right ankle but she struggled to remain standing stay back she ordered the two men dont be afraid lambkin she heard one say and then she is mine greek touch her and ill kill you no woman is worth death wulf ironfist the man called greek said and he faded into the darkness are you really the most exclusive whore in byzantium cailin drusus wulf asked her solemnly no she said softly but you had best treat me as if i were your host is my mortal enemy can you walk or is your ankle seriously injured i twisted it when i fell from the tree she answered but it is not broken nonetheless you will have to carry me and i will struggle to escape you justin gabras would think it odd if i did not why he demanded we will talk when we have found a private spot now quickly pick me up before someone else comes along and wonders why we are not already engaged in passions battle he came to stand directly in front of her and reached out to touch her face antonia said you were dead and our child too i suspected she might have told you that cailin answered i want to know what happened he said wulf please she pleaded with him not now gabras will soon come after us he is a terrible and dangerous man there were so many questions swirling about in wulfs head how was it she was alive and here in byzantium but he saw the genuine look of fear in her eyes reaching out he picked her up and threw her over his shoulder she immediately began to beat at him with her little fists as he carried her through the garden and back to where the others waited put me down put me down you great brute cailin shrieked the blood was going to her head and making her dizzy so our other little rabbit has been caught at last she heard gabras say and then he came into her line of vision you have given us all quite a chase my dear where was she in a tree the saxon answered i wouldnt have found her at all but the branch upon which she was perched gave way i want to see you take her justin gabras said here now a goblet of wine was clutched in his hand my public performances are only in the ring wulf ironfist said quietly i want to see this woman humiliated gabras persisted he is dangerous wulf thought and so he replied by morning i will have taken this woman in every way possible and in some ways you have never even considered my lord if she is not dead then she will be incapable of even crawling from the room where we will lie this night he turned to jovian maxima i want a room with no windows so none may be disturbed by her cries it is to be furnished with a good mattress and i will want wine also a dog whip women frequently need to be schooled in their duties and this woman is too free i can tell it is obvious to me she does not know her place but she will learn it we saxons like our females docile and subservient by the gods justin gabras said a genuine smile lighting his handsome features you are a man after my own heart give him what he wants jovian maxima the wench is in good hands a few moments later they were escorted to the same room where cailin and casia had earlier been imprisoned now however the room was newly furnished with a large comfortable bed upon a dais several low tables a pitcher of wine and two goblets two oil lamps burning sweetscented oil a tall floor lamp and set at the foot of the mattress the whip that wulf had requested jovian who had accompanied them personally looked nervously at it and wulf grinned at him wickedly close the door the saxon said softly i wish to speak with you jovian complied with the saxons request but he looked distinctly uncomfortable just tell gabras that i threatened you if we were not granted absolute privacy wulf told the man what is it you want of me gladiator jovian asked him tell me the nature of the danger cailin drusus faces from justin gabras wulf demanded he will use what has happened what will happen this night to discredit the lady cailin before the imperial court and the patriarch who will then forbid her marriage to general flavius aspar this is what gabras seeks the rest the lady cailin must tell you herself if you are of a mind to listen to her he is wulf ironfist my husband cailin said quietly the gods he is jovian maxima looked thunderstruck and then he said this is the truth my lady that is why i came jovian she admitted when i saw him today in the ring i was not certain i had to be certain before i pledged my faith to aspar wulf ironfist and i must speak together now and then i must remain in this room till the morning when the dawn comes however i beg you to help me return to villa mare and help casia as well if we are clever we can keep this from prince basilicus she loves him you know jovian nodded aye and the prince loves casia even as she loves him but he cannot say it to her he told me once when he was in his cups when this night is over i will tell her it will give her comfort i think now i must leave you both else gabras become overly suspicious of why i linger here the door closed behind jovian and wulf set the wooden bar into place which would protect their privacy cailins heart was beating very quickly it was really wulf with shaking hands she poured two goblets of wine sipping nervously at hers as he turned back to her and took up his own goblet he drained it swiftly and said bluntly so you are to be married you have the look of a woman who has prospered and one who is wellloved and you who loved me for my lands left those lands quickly enough you told me you had tired of fighting but perhaps a gladiator earns more coin and certainly he has better privileges than a mere soldier in the legions cailin countered she had been mad to come and madder still to believe there was anything left between them how came you to byzantium he asked her in the hold of a slave galley out of massilia wulf ironfist cailin said harshly i was walked the length of gaul to get there before that my time was spent in a drugged state in a slave pen in londinium she gulped at her wine i believe our child lives but what antonia did with it i cannot say were you even interested enough to find out she said that both you and the child had perished in the ordeal of childbirth he defended himself and then went on to tell her of what had transpired when he had gone to antonias villa to bring her home what of our bodies cailin said angrily did you not even ask to see our bodies she said she had cremated you both and even gave me a container of ashes i interred them with your family he finished helplessly i thought you would want it that way the macabre humor of it struck cailin and she laughed i suspect what you interred was a container of wood or charcoal ashes she said draining her cup and pouring herself more wine how is it that you know jovian maxima he suddenly demanded because he bought me in the slave marketplace and brought me here she told him coolly are you certain you wish to know more she was not the same person he realized but then how could she be he nodded slowly then listened his face alternating between anger pain and sympathy as she told her tale when she had finished he was silent for a long moment and then said will we allow antonia porcius to destroy the happiness we had cailin drusus ohh wulf she replied so much time has passed for us i thought you would stay with the lands that were my familys i believed you would have taken another wife by now and had another child of your loins how could i have ever believed that we would meet again here in byzantium or anywhere on this earth she sighed and lowered her head to hide the tears that had sprung into her eyes from nowhere it seemed so you went on with your life he asked her almost bitterly what else was i to do she cried to him aspar rescued me from this silken hades and freed me he sheltered me and loved me he has offered me the protection of his name despite incredible odds i have learned to love him wulf ironfist and have you forgotten the love that we shared cailin drusus he demanded fiercely reaching out he pulled her roughly into his arms have you forgotten what it once was like between us lambkin his lips gently touched her brow when antonia told me you and the child were dead i was devastated i could not believe it and then she was handing me that damned container of ashes i returned to our hall and buried them i tried to go on with my life but you were everywhere your very essence permeated the hall the lands and without you there was nothing none of it meant anything to me without you cailin one morning i awoke i took my helmet my shield and my sword and i left i didnt know where i was going but i knew that i must get away from your memory i wandered the face of gaul into italy in capua i met some gladiators at a tavern i enrolled in the school there and once i began to fight i quickly became a champion i had no fear of death you see that fear is a gladiators greatest enemy but i did not feel it why should i what did i have to lose that i had not already lost except my life which was now worthless to me and did you escape my memory in your combats in a wine jug or in the arms of other women wulf ironfist she asked him you have been ever with me cailin drusus in my thoughts and in my heart lambkin i could not escape you i fear he held her close breathing in her scent rubbing his cheek against her head the stone that her heart had become when she saw him again began to crumble what do you want of me wulf she asked him softly we have found one another my sweet lambkin he told her could we not begin again the gods have reunited us to what purpose i wonder she answered he tilted her face up to his and his mouth slowly closed over hers his lips were warm and so very soft and as the kiss deepened cailins heart almost broke in two she still loved him worse she loved aspar too what was she to do unable to help herself she let her arms slip up and about his neck i no longer know what is right or what is wrong she said helplessly ohh cease wulf i cannot think do not he said tell me you do not love me cailin drusus and i will help you to escape villa maxima now i will leave constantinople and you will never see me again perhaps it would be better that way our child is lost to us and the life you lead here in byzantium is a better life for you civilization suits you lambkin you know the rough destiny facing us back in britain yet despite his words he held her close as if he could not bear to let her go cailin was silent for what seemed an eternity and then she said the child might yet live wulf i somehow feel it does what kind of parents are we that we do not even seek to find our child what of this flavius aspar the man you are to wed he asked is there not enough between you that you would remain here with him there is much between us she replied quietly more than you can possibly know i give up much to return to britain with you wulf ironfist but there is much waiting for us in britain there are our lands which i have no doubt antonia has appropriated once more and there is the hope of finding our child the land has a certain meaning for me aspars love however far outweighs it it is our child that tips the balance of the scales in your favor once and it seems so long ago now we pledged ourselves to each other in wedlock our marriage would not be recognized by those in power here in byzantium should i choose aspar over you it was not celebrated within their church but the vows we made in our own land are sacred and i will not deny them now that i know you live i am a drusus corinium and we are raised to honor our promises not simply when they are convenient but always i am not a duty to be done he said offended cailin heard his tone she smiled up at him no wulf ironfist you are not a duty but you are my husband unless you choose here and now to renounce the vows we made to one another in my grandfathers hall that autumn night remember before you speak however that in denying me you deny our lost child to us as well you are certain of what you are saying lambkin he asked no i am not wulf ironfist she told him candidly aspar has been good to me i love him and i will hurt him when i leave him but i love you also it would seem and there is our child what if we cannot find it he questioned then there will be others she said softly cailin he whispered i want to love you as we once loved it is expected of us she replied is it not the door is barred and they will leave us in peace until the morning but you must take that short tunic off wulf ironfist the gods it leaves little to the imagination and i prefer you without it now they both stood naked in the flickering light of the lamps cailin filled her eyes with him she had forgotten much but now memory surged strongly through her reaching out she touched a crescentshaped scar on his chest just above his left breast this is new she said i got it at the school in capua he told her and then held out his right arm to her and this one at the spring games in ravenna this past year i was blocking a net man and thinking he had me he already had his dagger out he died well as i remember cailin leaned forward and kissed the scar upon his arm you must never go into the ring again wulf i lost you once but i will not lose you again there is no safe place he told her there is always danger lurking somewhere my beloved then his two big hands cupped her face and he pressed kisses on her lips her eyes her cheeks her skin was so soft she murmured low her head falling back her white throat straining he licked hotly at the column of perfumed flesh his lips lingering at the base of her neck feeling the beating pulse beneath i love you lambkin he murmured i always have she suddenly seemed to flame with desire she devoured him with her kisses her lips and her tongue kissing touching licking at him she touched the scar on his breastbone with her mouth and he groaned as if in pain she straightened herself and they stared deeply into each others eyes for what seemed an eternity they were past words reaching out she touched his manhood stroking him gently her fingers slipping around him to softly caress his pouch of life you will unman me sweet he grated you are no green boy she reassured him and we may as well put to good use the things i have learned for our mutual pleasure slipping to her knees before him she kissed his belly and thighs then taking him in her mouth she loved him until he begged her stop pulling her to her feet to kiss her hungrily he drew her over to the dais and they lay together upon the mattress their bodies entwined kissing more she was no longer the shy girl he had known her hands were bold and touched him knowledgeably he didnt know whether to be shocked or delighted but in the end he erred on the side of delight he had lost a sweet young wife he had regained a passionate woman cradling her in the crook of his arm he began to stroke her body and she purred at him like a wellfed feline encouraging him crying out softly as her own pleasure began to build he cuddled the perfect globes of her breasts tenderly leaning forward to lick at the nipples with a warm tongue rousing the rosy tips the taste of her was exciting and he began to lick at her warm silken skin his tongue sweeping over her flesh between her breasts up her throat back down again to her belly cailin moaned fitfully and half sobbed do you know how to pleasure a woman as i pleasured you aye he rasped and lowered his head that he might do her bidding flicking lightly at her little jewel but then he probed at her more deeply his tongue pushing into her suggestively ahhhh she cried out and her body arched to meet him he was driving her wild and she sensed he knew it then wulf pulled himself up and seeking her womans passage slid slowly and sensuously into her when he had sheathed himself as deeply as he could he let himself rest a moment his manhood throbbing its passionate message to her then grasping her hips in his hands he moved rhythmically within her until her whimpering cries rang in his ears cailins lids were heavy but she forced her eyes open that she might look into his face as he possessed her he took her tenderly kissing her face murmuring his love and longing into her ear she was full of him and yet she longed for more of him she had forgotten the passion that had once existed between them but now he stirred the embers of her memory until she was afire and remained so throughout the night as they made love to one another over and over again seemingly unable to gain satisfaction for very long finally exhausted they fell into a light slumber only to be awakened by a pounding upon the door of the chamber wulf stumbled to his feet the floor lamp and one of the smaller oil lamps had burned out unbarring the door he opened it to find casia and jovian before him what do you want he growled justin gabras has sent to flavius aspar jovian said his voice was highpitched and he appeared frightened cailin scrambled up my clothes jovian i must get dressed immediately and for pitys sake find something respectable for wulf ironfist to wear when he meets the general casia who was already dressed in the garments she had worn yesterday said i have your clothes cailin come with me did you mean what you said last night wulf asked her aye cailin answered him with a smile we are going home to britain to reclaim our lands and find our child aye i meant it she pushed past him and with casia leading the way hurried down the corridor you are mad casia told her as she helped cailin dress you would give up becoming aspars wife and all that byzantium has to offer for that saxon no man is that wonderful in bed cailin laughed he is but it isnt just that casia wulf ironfist is my husband we have a child lost to us right now to be certain but we will find our child when we return home tis madness casia repeated how will you get back to britain what will you use for money the chances of finding your child are incredible cailin have you no thought for aspar you will break his heart i fear cailin sighed deeply do you think i do not know that casia what would you do caught between the love of two men i cannot have them both and so i must decide between them though it pains me to do so the slave woman isis came and told them flavius aspar and prince basilicus await you in the atrium my ladies basilicus oh the gods casia sobbed when they reached the atrium they found justin gabras was also there as was jovian and wulf ironfist you see gabras crowed triumphantly what did i tell you my lords once a whore always a whore i was shocked when they arrived last evening and then stayed to entertain the gladiators as only they are capable how easily the lie rolls off your tongue justin gabras cailin said coldly do you deny that you spent the night locked in the arms of the brawny saxon or that casia entertained the gladiator known as the hun do you deny that that you forced us to it stripping us of our garments and making us play hide and seek in the gardens until we were caught and given as prizes to the gladiators i did not kidnap you and bring you here lady gabras replied smugly you came here of your own free will and now you would cry rape when your lewd behavior is found out be silent flavius aspar thundered and cailin drew a sharp breath for she had never seen him so angry as he was at this minute he pierced her with a hard look did you come here of your own free will yesterday lady do not blame her it is my fault casia burst out she was near to tears a state that surprised the men who knew her aspars stern face softened a bit tell me the truth of this my love he said turning to cailin you have never lied to me nor will i now my lord aspar cailin said quietly yesterday at the games i thought i recognized one of the gladiators i confided in casia and she felt we should come to villa maxima that i might see this man at a closer range in order to determine if i did indeed know him she was reluctant to come casia broke in she was concerned if someone saw us it would reflect badly on you my lord you need not defend me casia cailin chided her friend gently my lord knows my character well and when you saw this gladiator close up cailin drusus was he indeed the man you thought he was aspar asked her yes my lord he was i fear the man who is known as the saxon is my husband wulf ironfist cailin said and while the two men were absorbing that startling revelation she went on to explain what had happened to herself and to casia at the hands of justin gabras when she had concluded her tale casia broke in quickly the hun did not have me my prince he has it seems a very weak head for wine my plan was to get him drunk and then hit him upon the head but three goblets of jovians best cyprian brew and he was snoring like a wild boar with a bellyful of acorns and roots it was obvious that basilicus wanted very much to believe casia relief spread over his features when wulf ironfist said she is probably speaking the truth my lord i have lived with the hun these months past and it is true that he has no head for wine and you cailin drusus aspar said did you get the saxon drunk too she saw the pain in his eyes which he strove to hide from the others and vowed silently that gabras would not have this victory over flavius aspar nor would she hurt him with this particular truth wulf and i spent the night talking my lord there was much for us to talk about was there not wulf the saxon realized what she was doing and wondered if flavius aspar would believe the lie that he now gave voice to in her support cailin speaks the truth my lord there was much unresolved between us they are lying justin gabras shouted it is impossible for him to have spent the night with her and not made love to her am i some green boy you snake that i must poke my sword in every pretty sheath that comes along to call me a liar gabras is to seek death justin gabras paled and took a step backward youve done your mischief gabras prince basilicus said now get you gone from here and if one word of this scandal should reach my ears i will personally see that you meet a most unpleasant end you have no real friends in byzantium and if you want to see your child born then you will forget what you have done is he not to be punished casia demanded relieved not to be in her lovers bad graces look at the trouble he has caused basilicus laughed he is married to flacilla strabo that is punishment enough i think as justin gabras turned to leave phocas maxima stepped from the shadows a moment my lord gabras there is the matter of the bill i think i should be wise to settle it today you have made powerful enemies here this morning and the span of your life is no longer certain he took the mans arm and led him off jovian looking at the five people in his atrium wondered what was to come next he had not long to wait aspar took cailins hand in his tell me he said i must go home to britain my lord she said quietly but there were tears in her eyes when she said it how easily you leave me my love he said bitterly no cailin told him it is not easy for me to leave you for i love you but i have thought long and hard about what i must do in the eyes of your orthodox church i am not married and therefore free to wed you aspar but i know that under the old laws of marriage in britain i am wulfs wife once the empress told me that love was a weakness for those in power i did not believe her my lord but now i do what if the saxon had not been wulf ironfist what would you have done knowing i had been forcibly violated what if i had been driven mad by the incident gabras himself planned to have me i know how would you have felt upon learning that the woman you loved and planned to make your wife had been hurt and shamed so your value to the empire would have come to an end my lord had any of these things come to pass i am your weakness flavius aspar your enemies can reach out and strike at you through me through the children i would have given you i was a childish fool to believe that we could live as quiet a life as my parents lived at their country villa you are important to byzantium my love and your usefulness is not yet at an end besides she smiled at him you quite enjoy being an emperormaker you would be bored raising horses hay and grain i must leave you my dear lord if i am to save you from your enemies there is no other way and in your heart you know that i am right in this and what of wulf ironfist he and i have lands in britain that we must reclaim and a child who is lost but whom we will find i cannot turn my back on any of this though i am torn between you both once i said that fortuna was not kind to me but she has been too kind i think for what other woman has been so wellloved by two such wonderful men it is possible you know for a woman to love two men had i ever believed that i should be reunited with wulf ironfist again i should not have allowed you to love me flavius aspar you do not really need me i am but a liability to you wulf needs me you could not have ever kept me from loving you cailin drusus aspar told her sadly but if you feel you must leave me then i will not stand in your way he wanted to plead with her to stay with him he wanted to tell her that she was no liability to him or if it was so then he would take his chances with his enemies if it meant having her by his side instead he said you must take nellwyn with you britain is her home too and i would not know what to do with her if you left her behind she would be but a constant reminder of you yes i will take nellwyn i will send word to zeno to pack your belongings and send them here with the girl unless you would like to return to villa mare and oversee this business yourself my love i can take nothing from you my lord cailin said under the circumstances it would not be right do not be a little fool the practical casia snapped at her friend you need clothing cailin i will go to villa mare and pack the garments that will best serve you it is true that you will not need the more glorious clothing you possess but you should take a warm cloak some simple stolas camisas and slippers for you will do a great deal of walking i suspect before you get home to your britain jovian silent through all of this now spoke up phocas and i own a small trading vessel that is leaving for massilia on the afternoon tide it will not be luxurious but it will get you to gaul in just a few weeks i can arrange passage for you if you wish it i think that would be an excellent idea aspar said best to get this over with quickly he thought do not forget her jewelry casia no cailin cried stricken i cannot take it indeed it would be dangerous to carry such valuables wulf said you will need it to help you start over in britain wulf ironfist aspar said addressing him for the first time money may not buy happiness as we know it but it buys a great deal of other things including cattle and loyalty cailin and nellwyn can sew the jewelry into your cloaks for safekeeping i will see that you have coin as well my lord wulf did not know what to say i want her taken care of saxon flavius aspar said harshly do you understand me she is never to want for anything wulf nodded and wondered if cailin had chosen aspar over him would he have been so gallant he wasnt certain jovian left them to go arrange passage for the trio of travelers the trading vessel upon which they would travel occasionally took passengers it had one tiny wooden shed of a cabin upon the deck which the captain and his mate shared unless there was a paying passenger along when that happened the captain and his mate slept in hammocks upon the open deck the ship would never travel out of sight of land for too long it was not large enough for an adequate water supply jovian had six barrels of fresh water brought aboard and stored for cailin and her party he saw that there was a goat for milk a pen full of chickens several boxes of bread four cheeses and fruit the vessel was to carry bolts of cloth woven in constantinople to gaul there were also some expensive luxuries hidden among the cloth in order to escape the custom agents eyes although he was well bribed to overlook such infractions of the law casia met them at the boat she had not only packed the necessary clothing for her friend but a comb a pair of boots and the jewelry as well nellwyn was astounded by the turn of events but excited to actually be returning to britain casia had explained everything to her her eyes widened at the sight of wulf ironfist wulfs possessions were few and had been easily gathered together the other gladiators were still sleeping and would probably not miss the saxon until the following day when he did not appear for his match it will be a great disappointment to the populace to find that the great unbeaten champion has disappeared jovian noted we must see that they hold gabras responsible they may riot against him perhaps even burn his palace down ahh the possibilities are simply endless casia my dear i do not think i would go to the games tomorrow i would have only gone to see the saxon casia said with a small smile then turning to cailin she hugged her i will miss your honesty go with the gods dear friend when the winter winds curse this city i will think of you back home in your beloved britain i still think it a savage place and you a madwoman to go she sniffed audibly and i will miss your irreverent ways cailin said softly we will not be back to britain by winter though perhaps in the springtime farewell dear casia may the gods favor you always she turned to aspar who stood silently taking his hand she raised it to her lips and kissed it if you regret one moment i shall never forgive you flavius aspar our love is real and it is true but the fates have governed that we go in separate directions i will never forget you my dear lord the memory of you will have to suffice me he replied quietly i will never forget you cailin drusus you taught me how to love and for that i am not certain that i can forgive you perhaps it is better not to know how to love than to ache with the loss of it god go with you my precious love he finished and he tenderly kissed her lips bringing tears to her eyes damn you aspar she whispered i was born beneath the sign of the scorpion my love i sting when i am hurt now get aboard before i decide i cannot be noble the ship sailed out of the walled phosphorion harbor around the point of the city past the imperial palace the day was bright and the water sparkled as they passed the marble tower that marked the end of the citys walls their vessel skimmed the waves the fresh breeze sending it onward wulf ironfist put a hard arm about cailin and drew her close to him i hope that neither of us regrets the bargain between us i do not think so she told him and as their ship swept past villa mare she whispered a silent final goodbye to flavius aspar he would survive and so would she she was becoming good at survival she thought and then she turned her face to the ships bow the wind caught at her long auburn curls and blew them about as she looked west for the first time in months she knew who she was she was cailin drusus a briton descendant of a roman tribune and a host of celtic ancestors and she was going home home to britain britain ad chapter it took forty days to sail from byzantium to the city of massilia in gaul the trading vessel exited through the hellespont and crossed the mare thracium past mighty mount athos and on into the aegean sea wending its way along the greek coast past delos and the cyclades as they reached methone the captain came to cailin and wulf and said master jovian wanted you to have this choice i can either sail north along the greek coast and then cross over to italia at the narrowest point separating the two or we can sail straight across the ionian sea to sicilia in half the time the weather is good and will continue to hold but we would be out of sight of land for several days storms are known to arise suddenly and you are not sailors but even should a storm come up i will get you safely to massilia he smiled explaining i get a percentage of the cargo profits sail straight for sicilia wulf said making the decision for them we are anxious to reach britain before spring for almost seven days they did not see land but finally the toe of italias boot and sicilia with its rugged mountains rose up on their horizon to their right and left the ship negotiated the straits of messina in the tyrrhenian sea they stopped several times to refill their water barrels but the ships captain preferred to anchor along deserted stretches of coast to avoid paying port taxes when all he needed was water the customs men are all thieves they always claim to have found contraband upon your vessel particularly if you are just passing through then they confiscate the cargo its just plain stealing he finished indignantly they cruised along italias coast past tempsa neapolis ostia pisae and genna at last they had almost reached their destination and cailin was vastly relieved she wanted a bath and there were certain to be public baths in massilia on their first day aboard she had gone through the clothing that casia had packed for her and to her surprise found two small bags of coins one held twenty gold solidi and the other was crammed with copper folles she showed wulf and he nodded silently there is a loose board beneath my pallet she told him softly i will hide our hoard beneath it but there must always be someone in the cabin so that we are not robbed this and my jewelry is all we have to make our way with once we arrive at massilia and when we reach home we may need what remains to start again i trust the captain but the two mates are another thing i do not like the way they eye nellwyn nellwyn is a foolish little rabbit he replied if she is not careful she will be eaten by dogs she is your slave speak to her it is not my place to do so why are you so irritable she asked him you are like an old cat with a stiff paw are you not happy we have been reunited i cannot believe our good fortune he said honestly i thought you dead and then found you alive you chose to return to britain with me over marrying a wealthy and powerful man but we have not been alone since we found each other and we are not likely to be for months you are beautiful cailin my wife and i desire you you will have to learn patience she said serenely then giggled mischievously and so will i wulf ironfist when they finally docked at massilia the captain was thoughtful enough to tell them that parties of merchants traveled up the roman roads of gaul toward the coast facing britain on a regular basis wulf would find the respectable travelers at an inn called the golden arrow you dont want to try to go it alone sir too many bandits and youve got the women to consider a big strong fellow like you will be welcome in any party if the women are willing to help with the chores so much the better wulf thanked the captain for his advice and their bags of coins and cailins jewels safely hidden the trio departed the ship both cailin and nellwyn were plainly garbed and their hoods were pulled well up over their heads they kept their eyes modestly lowered following wulf ironfist as they made their way through the bustling ports streets to the inn where wulf inquired about caravans departing for the northern coast of gaul there are several leaving in a day or two sir the innkeeper replied how far are you going will it just be yourself we need to get to gesoriacum wulf told him and my wife and her servant will be going with me we have come from byzantium and are going to britain ill wager the innkeeper said wulf nodded im a big fellow as you can see he told the innkeeper and i have served my time in the legions im a good swordsman and my wife and servant can cook well be no liability can you pay the innkeeper asked they didnt look like beggers but still one could never tell in these days it must be reasonable wulf said slowly weve not a great deal left our passage from byzantium was dear will not our service be enough but then if we must pay ill expect to receive our food in exchange youre in luck the innkeeper told him theres a large caravan of merchants leaving tomorrow that will go all the way to gesoriacum some of the party will stop at other towns along the way but the main caravan is going to the northern coast i know the caravan master he is the big redhaired fellow drinking in my courtyard right now he can always use an extra man tell him that paulus recommends you you must do your own bargaining i thank you sir wulf said can you rent me a room for myself and my wife and servant for tonight and we need to be directed to the public baths then i must buy horses for our journey i have no private rooms but your women can have pallets in the loft with others of their sex you will have to sleep down here like all the men do who stop at the golden arrow the innkeeper said while cailin and nellwyn bathed wulf went to the market and purchased two horses for them one was a fine strong chestnutcolored gelding and the other a sturdy black mare strong enough to carry both women upon her back should it be necessary he returned to the bathhouse where cailin and nellwyn were waiting for him their precious hoard and the horses remained in their charge while wulf washed the forty days at sea from his skin then they made their way back to the inn where wulf introduced himself to the caravan master who was named garhard the bargain was soon struck between the two men for garhard was a man who made quick decisions their places would cost them two folles apiece wulf would help to protect the caravan and the two women would be expected to help with the meals in exchange they would travel in safety and be allowed to eat from the common pot if you want wine bring it garhard said you supply your own plates and spoons i dont want your women whoring for extra coins it causes too much trouble among the men the women are my wife and her servant wulf said quietly they do not whore and if your men look at them askance or speak to them with disrespect they will have me to deal with understood garhard replied we leave at dawn they hurried back to the market where cailin purchased newly made wood plates and spoons for them and a single goblet that they would all share she found a woman selling freshly stuffed pallets and bought three along with some blankets we should have a cart she told her husband the mare can pull it and it will hold our worldly goods we cannot carry it all you are used to sleeping upon the ground but nellwyn and i are not and we will need water bags and a brazier and charcoal it is almost winter wulf and the farther north we go the greater chance there is of snow a cart will offer us some protection from bad weather and wild animals he laughed you have been living like a young queen in byzantium i would have thought you had forgotten such practical matters but i see you have not come let us purchase what you think we need they left just before dawn the next morning the two women drove the little cart with its clothcovered sides and roof they had carefully packed all their possessions inside along with extra provisions to supplement the communal pot the water bags hung from the cart the caravan traveled the roman roads up the spine of gaul through arelate lugudunum augustodunum and agedincum to durocortorum they then took the road that turned slightly more north moving on through samarobriva and finally arriving at gesoriacum an ancient naval port it had taken them many weeks to reach their destination it was already midfebruary they arranged their next passage with a coastal trader he would take them across the thirty miles of sea separating gaul and britain to the port of dubris as the sun rose over gaul which now lay behind them they made landfall in britain on the morning of february twentieth cailin wept unashamedly i did not think i should ever see my native land again she said sobbing as wulf comforted her we have been traveling for over four months he said would you not like to rest for a few days now that we are back in britain cailin shook her head no i want to go home the cart lumbered its way up to londinium cailin looked about her remembering little of her last visit once this place would have awed her but now it looked insignificant when compared to constantinople she was happy to take stane street west to corinium when they reached that town of her familys origin cailin was shocked the once thriving corinium was almost silent and deserted rubbish littered the streets the buildings were in poor repair in the amphitheater there were weeds growing between the stone seats which were cracked and broken many houses were locked and empty it was not as she remembered it what has happened she asked wulf he shook his head i do not know except perhaps without a central government the town cannot maintain itself look about you most whom we see in the streets are elderly they stay obviously because there is nowhere else for them to go the market thrives however it seems to be the only thing that does but it is mostly foodstuffs she noted there are few other goods for sale what has happened to trade and the pottery works people must eat he said as for the rest i do not know he shrugged come lambkin we have two more days of traveling before we reach our lands let us not dally we will have antonia porcius to contend with i am certain she has undoubtedly annexed our lands for herself once more at least we will know better than to trust her this time and your dobunni family will rejoice to learn you are alive their cart moved up the fosse way until finally they turned off on a barely discernible tract it was raining when they made camp that night they huddled within the cart listening to the rain on its canvas roof the small space nicely warmed as it had all winter long by the little brazier cailin had insisted upon they had seen virtually no one since leaving corinium but wulf insisted on their keeping watch nonetheless we cant afford to lose everything now he said well move out before dawn with any luck we should reach our hall by midafternoon it rained again the next day and huddled upon the bench in the cart driving the black mare cailin realized she had forgotten how damp and chilly an english spring could be she almost missed the constantly sunny days she had enjoyed in byzantium but still she was content to be home she decided shivering around her the land was familiar once again suddenly they topped a hillock and stopping cailin looked down upon her familys lands for the first time in almost three years wulf swore volubly the hall is burned he said damn antonia for an interfering bitch shell pay for it i vow why did bodvoc not stop her i wonder cailin asked i do not know but i will soon find out we will have to begin from the beginning once more lambkin i am sorry it is not your fault wulf cailin soothed him we will survive this as we have survived all the rest of our dark destiny as they made their way down the hillside cailin noticed that the fields lay fallow and the orchards were not pruned what had happened here she brought her cart to a halt before what had been their little hall the damage to her great relief did not look as bad now that they could see it close up as it had appeared from the hillside their thatched roof had indeed been burned but as they walked about cailin and wulf could see the heavy beams of the roof were just scorched the fire pits were intact and some of their furnishings battered but repairable were still there much was gone however including the heavy oaken doors of the hall still with a new roof they could salvage it well have to thatch the roof first he said we cannot do it ourselves cailin answered him where are our slaves and farm workers she sighed you know the answer to that as well as i do we will have to go to her and retake our property then too there is the matter of our child antonia is the only one who has the answer to that puzzle and i will pry it out of her let us go to the dobunni first wulf suggested they will know what has happened i think we are wiser learning that before we beard antonia porcius over these matters she has obviously driven bodvoc and nuala off or they would have protected our holding let us bring the cart into the hall cailin said then we can take the horses to my grandfathers village should anyone pass by it will seem as if nothing is different here as long as the cart is hidden do not leave me here alone nellwyn begged them i am afraid you and i will ride the mare together cailin reassured her servant the hall is uninhabitable but soon we will repair it they led the black mare into the hall unhitched her from the cart and pushed the vehicle into a dark corner where it was obscured from view even to someone entering the half ruin then the two women mounted the beast cailin rode in front holding the reins and nellwyn behind her clutching her mistress about her slender waist wulf led the mare from the building and mounting his own animal they headed off up the hills across the meadows and through the woods to berikoss dobunni village they knew immediately as they approached the hill fort that something was very wrong there were no guards posted and they were able to enter the village unimpeded the place was deserted and upon closer inspection they could see it had been so for some time what has happened cailin said not just a little afraid wulf shook his head there were other villages i know can you tell me where they were located lambkin the dobunni cannot have simply disappeared from the face of the earth in the two and a half years that we were gone from britain they must be here somewhere there were other villages but i never saw them she said i spent my time here i know however that these villages must be near for berikoss territory was not very large let us simply ride we are bound to come upon someone i can think of no better plan he said and so they began to ride slowly to the northeast seeking signs of life at first the landscape appeared pristine and empty but eventually they began to see signs of habitation cattle grazing a flock of sheep in a meadow and finally a shepherd whom they hailed is there a dobunni village nearby lad wulf asked him who be ye the shepherd asked not answering their question i am wulf ironfist this is my wife cailin drusus the granddaughter of berikos the niece of eppilus the cousin of corio we have been away for some time and when we returned we sought out the hill fort of berikos only to find it deserted where is everyone you will find our village on the other side of the hill the shepherd replied again not answering the question asked eppilus is there they rode over the hill and there in a small quiet valley was the dobunni village guards strategically placed watched silently as they passed by and into the center of the village wulf dismounted and lifted first his wife and then nellwyn from the mares back they looked about and when cailin shrugged back her hood revealing her face a woman with two children clinging to her skirts gasped and cried out cailin is it truly you they said that you were dead nuala cailin ran forward and embraced her cousin it is truly me and i have come home how is bodvoc and ceara and maeve and what of berikos does the old devil still hold sway despite his illness or has eppilus truly become chief of the dobunni bodvoc is dead nuala said softly he died in the plague epidemic last year that took so many of our people ceara maeve and our grandfather among them we lost almost all our old people and many children corio survived amazingly and it never touched me or my children despite bodvocs illness these are my bairns commius the boy is the elder twas he i carried on my wedding day the girl is morna come eppilus will want to see you she turned away from cailin a moment and said greetings wulf ironfist greetings nuala i am sorry to hear of bodvocs death he was a good man but now i understand why you were not on the lands we gave you a woman alone with two children could not manage such responsibility we barely had a chance to even settle on those lands wulf she told him antonia porcius drove us away as soon as you left she insisted that the drusus corinium lands were her late husbands and now they were hers and her sons bodvoc felt we could not fight her they followed nuala into her fathers hall eppilus already aware of their arrival came forward to greet the travelers it was told us that you died in childbirth cailin he said and then wulf ironfist disappeared what happened to you my niece come sit by the fire bring wine for our guests who is this pretty girl with you he peppered her with questions this is nellwyn uncle cailin said smiling she is my servant and has traveled all the way from byzantium with me for that is where i was cailin then went on to narrate her adventures and wulfs to her assembled kin and the others who had crowded into the hall our hall has been partly burned she concluded what happened while we were gone and why is berikoss hill fort deserted so many in berikoss village died of plague eppilus explained that it was not practical for us to remain there antonia porcius has a new husband he is neither celt nor romanobriton he is a saxon and his name is ragnar strongspear there are many saxons now entering this region to settle here even this village is no longer completely dobunni saxons live among us and are intermarrying with our children nuala has taken one for a new husband he invited a pleasantlooking young blond man with mild blue eyes to step forward this is winefrith my soninlaw i am happy to have him related to me he is a good husband to my daughter and a good father to my grandchildren i greet you winefrith husband of nuala wulf said i greet you wulf ironfist came the polite reply tell me about this ragnar strongspear wulf ironfist said to eppilus leaning forward his interest apparent in his blue eyes what kind of a man is he from what we have seen and learned eppilus said slowly he is a bully he came swaggering across the land some months ago with a troup of bandits like himself he slaughtered everything in his path looting and burning as he went along i expect that is when your hall was damaged he stumbled upon antonias villa he brought with him two wives but he made antonia his wife too though the gods know why antonia lives with the other women her father and the many children who always seem to be underfoot this saxon is already consolidating his hold on the surrounding countryside demanding fealty and heavy tribute he has not yet found our village here in this valley but we expect he soon will we will be forced to accept him as our overlord if we are to survive there is no other choice aye there is wulf ironfist said you can accept me as your overlord eppilus nuala says the plague struck down the very old and the very young that means that most of the men i trained several years ago are still alive if they will give me their service we will be able to overcome the threat of ragnar strongspear you will be able to live in peace beneath my protection we are kin eppilus and i will not abuse those i am sworn to defend the times in which we now live are different than those we once knew your village and the other nearby villages need a strong man to protect them you have a choice between either me or ragnar strongspear we would choose you of course wulf ironfist eppilus said we know you to be a fair and an honest man who will not mistreat us or our families how can we help you first i must speak with the men they must quickly refamiliarize themselves with their fighting skills perhaps there are even some new men in this village who would join us i will said nualas husband winefrith i am a smith and can make and repair weapons for you whatever i can do to make the countryside safe from ragnar strongspear i will do wulf ironfist good wulf said smiling at the young man go and speak to the other saxons who live in this village tell them it is not a matter of saxon against celt but what is right against what is wrong winefrith nodded there is no friction between saxon and celt here he said and the others agreed we are simple people trying to live together in peace i will need the roof of my hall rethatched and cannot do it alone wulf said and i must put a wall about it for better defense we can help said eppilus i will send to the other two villages left in the area for aid it is unlikely that ragnar strongspear will know we are repairing the hall he rarely goes there for he is very superstitious and believes the hall haunted by cailins family i expect that antonia told him of the lands history and he drew his own conclusions if antonia told him of the lands history it was done deliberately and for a purpose cailin interjected i wonder why she did it they stayed the night in eppiluss village when the morning came they were surprised to find that at least a hundred young men some of whom they recognized and others they did not had arrived wulf appointed both corio and winefrith his secondsincommand those who had already had training in martial skills began to train those young men who had not another group of twenty men rode with wulf cailin and nellwyn back to their hall they carried with them enough thatch for the roof and began work almost immediately eppilus had sent a wagonload of provisions along cailin and nellwyn cooked simple meals that satisfied the workers before they fell asleep each night upon the floor in the hall when they were not engaged over the cookfires cailin and her servant swept the dirt and the debris from the hall along with a young fox vixen who had decided to make her den there and a number of field mice who had attracted the fox in the first place the furniture that was repairable was set aside each morning the work began anew until several days later the hall was reroofed winefrith arrived with nuala and began to repair the furniture that had been smashed cailin sat outside the hall on a bench with her cousin your father likes your new husband and he seems a fair man she remarked he is not bodvoc nuala admitted but then there will never be another like bodvoc winefrith loves me totally and he is so good if there is no longer excitement in my life at least i am not unhappy cailin do you remember the old fortuneteller at the beltane fair back long ago who said i would have two husbands and many children well she was right bodvoc and i spawned two bairns before he died her hand went protectively to her belly winefrith and i married last december at the solstice i am already well gone with our first child you are fortunate cailin told her i do not know what happened to the child i bore wulf before i was kidnapped into slavery i do not even know if it was a son or a daughter you will have others nuala said reassuringly not unless wulf and i can find some privacy cailin admitted with a wry smile our reunion was so swift and then we escaped byzantium we sailed for forty days upon a tiny trading vessel with no possible opportunity to be alone then we traveled through gaul with nellwyn always by our side and all those merchants with us it has been the three of us on the road here in britain until we reached home we have been so busy repairing the damaged caused by that damned ragnar there is just no time for us nuala i know that there will be but when as for the child lost to us if it lives we want it it is our flesh and has a heritage to be proud of that we would share i can understand exactly how you feel nuala replied i love little commius and morna dearly if they were stolen from me i should want to get them back i would not just let them go who is that on the hillside cailin suddenly asked her cousin nuala looked hard then said i do not know but it could be one of ragnars men yes i think it may be for he is turning away and riding off we had best tell your husband wulf and the others were just refitting new oak doors to the hall when cailin and nuala told him of the horseman on the hillside since we have not yet had time to build the wall it is good we can at least close off the hall wulf said grimly he turned to winefrith what do you think will he come with a large armed party this man was probably out hunting and just rode past by chance winefrith said there are enough of us here to make it a standoff for now i think my lord i will warn the men to be on their guard until we see what is to happen nuala go into the hall i do not want you outside should there be any kind of attack he called you my lord cailin said in a low tone to her husband after nuala had obeyed her husbands order several of the men are beginning to do so wulf said it is only natural i am their leader lambkin i intend to be overlord of these lands and all the lands to the north and east encompassing the dobunni territory that once was if i can hold them i have the right to do it the first challenge i face is ragnar strongspear he may have the territory to the south and west if he chooses but these lands are mine and i will fight for them i will be by your side my lord husband cailin said quietly he put an arm about her shoulder we will survive this new age lambkin and we will leave a great holding for our sons and our daughters we will not be moved from our lands again and we will make antonia porcius tell us what happened to our child i did not deliver a son so large that i was torn apart there is something i am striving to remember about those last moments wulf i distinctly recall hearing the cry of a healthy infant but there is something more if i could but remember it i know our child is alive if he is lambkin we will find him wulf said there appeared on the crest of the hill a party of some ten horsemen who began their descent they were led by a large helmeted man who carried a long spear i remain by your side cailin said forestalling her husbands objection i run from no man and especially not on our own lands he said nothing but he was proud to have her for a wife she was a strong woman to have survived slavery and if they could ever find a moment to be together again they would make strong sons the horsemen rode relentlessly onward ragnar strongspear observed the silent couple as he came the man was a warrior he was certain no saxon farmer to be easily frightened off the woman was beautiful but she was not a saxon woman a briton most likely and a proud wench to boot she stood unafraid by her mans side an almost defiant stance to her body it was a body he thought he could enjoy becoming familiar with and from the look of her she was a woman who had both met and enjoyed passion as the horsemen drew to a halt before wulf and cailin their helmeted leader said in a deep hard voice you are trespassing here are you the savage who tried to burn my hall wulf demanded coolly in reply if you are then you owe me a forfeit and ill have it now it was hardly the answer ragnar strongspear was expecting he glared at his antagonist and snarled fiercely who are you i am wulf ironfist and this is my wife cailin drusus who are you and what do you do here on my lands i am ragnar strongspear and these are my lands was the reply i hold them for one of my wives antonia porcius these lands do not belong to antonia porcius wulf answered and they never did ragnar strongspear you have been misled if she told you so these lands are the hereditary holdings of the drusus corinium family my wife cailin is the sole surviving member of that family these are her lands i hold them for her we have been away in byzantium and i return to find my hall half destroyed my belongings either stolen or ravaged and my slaves disappeared this is your doing i assume or am i mistaken wulf finished looking hard at the man do you expect me to just take your word for such a claim ragnar strongspear said angrily i am not a fool why should i believe you does old anthony porcius still live wulf asked aye he has a place in my hall ragnar strongspear said and are his wits still with him aye they are why do you ask wulf ironfist because he can attest to the truth of my words ragnar strongspear i will come with you now you will see i speak the truth very well i am as eager as you to settle this matter was the surly reply ragnar strongspear took in all that had been done to restore the hall he was impressed by what he saw he knew in his heart that wulf ironfist had not invested his time and effort for naught he did not appear to be the sort of man who took foolish chances and the fact that he knew anthony porcius by name led ragnar to believe the warrior spoke the truth why had antonia lied to him wulf and cailin reappeared now on horseback surrounded by a group of a dozen armed men you will not mind that we are escorted wulf said with a straight face i cannot know what we may encounter ragnar strongspear nodded you do not offend me but you have my word wulf ironfist that no harm will come to you from me or from mine this day i am an honorable man let us go he turned his horse and moved off with his small party of retainers in his wake as they rode ragnar wondered what else antonia had told him that wasnt true he had stormed across her lands well over a year ago finding her unprotected he had claimed both the woman and her property for his own he had two other wives harimann and perahta saxons both they were devoted to him and hardworking each had given him two children a son and a daughter apiece antonia had two children as well a boy and a girl she hadnt wanted to become his wife but he had raped her before her father and servants in the atrium of her villa making her further refusal impossible she was an odd woman given to airs and other than her lands she had no value he could see but for one thing he had never in his life had such an avaricious hot bedmate whereas harimann and perahta were complaisant antonia was eager and had the instincts of a skilled whore he tolerated her for that alone now however he was beginning to wonder if he had not made a bad bargain of it after all were her abilities in their bed worth the trouble she was obviously about to cause him where antonias villa had once stood in its pristine glory there were now ruins nearby a new hall had been raised about it was a wall of stone they entered through a pair of open gates the doors of which had been fashioned from the old bronze doors of the villa your men are welcome in my hall ragnar strongspear said you have given me your pledge for our safety wulf replied i will leave them outside but for two to show my good faith corio and winefrith you will come with us yes my lord the two men chorused almost as one and ragnar strongspear was further impressed wulfs men were all obviously quite loyal and not only were there saxons among them but celts as well they entered a large aisled hall there were several fire pits but the ventilation was poor and it was slightly smoky two large handsome women with long blond braids little children about their feet sat weaving and talking together antonia come to me at once ragnar strongspear called loudly i am here my lord came the reply and she glided forward a false smile of welcome upon her face she hated him and everything he stood for do you know these people antonia he demanded of her antonias eyes swung first to cailin and then to wulf her hand flew to her breast and she paled her heart began to increase in its tempo until she thought it would fly from her chest she couldnt seem to breathe and she gaped like a fish out of water she had never in her life been so filled with fear for before her was her greatest nightmare come to life how had they survived but it did not matter they had survived her revenge and had now obviously returned to take theirs she stepped back with a shriek ohh villainess cailin cried surprising the men as she leapt forward at antonia you never thought to see me again in this life did you but here i am antonia porcius alive and strong now where is my child i want my child i know you have my baby i do not know what you are talking about antonia quavered you are lying antonia wulf said and his blue eyes were bright with his anger lying as you lied to me when you told me that cailin was dead in childbirth of a difficult birth of a son who tore her apart and then died too you lied when you told me you cremated their remains i found my wife in byzantium by merest chance preparing to wed another man damn you do you know how very much i want to kill you right now do you know all the misery you have caused us and once again you have tried to steal our lands antonia porcius you will not succeed now just as you did not succeed before did i hurt you wulf antonia suddenly flared did the knowledge that cailin was dead cause you unbearable pain i am glad if it did i am glad now you know the pain you caused me when you killed my beloved quintus i wanted you to suffer and i wanted cailin to suffer as well if she had not returned from her grave that first time you would not have killed my husband and i should not have lost my second son all my misery is due to the two of you and now here you are again to cause me heartache a pox upon you i hate you both give me my child you bitch cailin cried out angrily what child antonia said with false sweetness you had no child cailin drusus the child died at birth i do not believe you cailin replied i heard my child cry strongly before your herbs rendered me unconscious give me my child give her the child antonia anthony porcius came forward he had aged greatly in the last few years his step was slow and his hair was snowwhite but it was his sad eyes that touched cailin reaching out he took her hand in his she told me that you had died and that wulf would not take the child he said she claimed to be raising her out of the goodness of her heart but there is i now see no goodness in my daughters heart it is black with bitterness and hatred the child has your husbands coloring but in features she is your image each day she grows more so and of late antonia has begun to hate her for it her cailin whispered softly and then suddenly she cried out to her husband that is what she said wulf i remember it now the last thing i heard before i fell unconscious on that day our child was born was antonias voice saying i always wanted a daughter we have a daughter give her to me you viper give me my daughter ragnar strongspears first wife harimann came forward leading a small girl by the hand this is your daughter lady she is called aurora she is a good child though the lady antonia beats her cailin knelt and took the little girl into her arms she was several months from her third birthday but she was a tall child her tunic dress was ragged and her blond hair lank there was a frightened look in her eyes and upon her cheek was a purple bruise cailin looked up at antonia and said quietly you will pay dearly for that lady then she hugged the trembling child setting her back down finally so they might look at one another i am your mother aurora i have come to take you away from the lady antonia who stole you from me do not be afraid the child said nothing she just stared at cailin with large eyes why does she not speak cailin demanded she does sometimes harimann said but she is always afraid poor child we tried to soften the lady antonias unreasonable anger toward aurora but it only made it worse she is half starved though we had sought to feed her when the lady antonia was not about antonias son however follows his mothers direction and would tell on us then aurora would be beaten finally she would take no food from us for fear of being punished the boy is abusive to her as well quintus the younger is as much of a toad as his father i see cailin said scornfully you have reason to be proud antonia she turned to the elderly anthony porcius could you do nothing sir i tried he said but i am an old man cailin drusus and my place in this hall depends upon my daughters goodwill tell ragnar strongspear the land is mine she said to him i can do that cailin drusus he replied and then he turned to his saxon soninlaw the lands she claims are her familys lands and belong to her antonia had no right to them at all she claimed to me that she was holding them for aurora but i know that is not true ragnar strongspear nodded then it is settled he said it is settled wulf ironfist answered him reaching down he lifted the little girl into his arms i am your father aurora he told the child can you say father to me little one she nodded her eyes huge and blue he grinned i would hear it then my daughter he cocked his head to one side as if listening hard father the little girl whispered shyly he kissed her cheek aye sweeting i am your father and i will never allow you to be harmed by anyone again he turned to cailin and their two companions let us go home now you will not stay the night i have some fine mead ragnar strongspear said jovially and there is a boar roasting on the hearth thank you but no wulf ironfist replied the last time i left my hall some damned savage came through and burned it i will not take any further chances ragnar strongspear there is the matter of ourslaves cailin prompted her husband i do not know about that the burly saxon answered i can separate the drusus corinium servants from antonias the elderly porcius said then do so old man his soninlaw said and see that they are sent back with as much haste as possible i want no quarrel between wulf ironfist and myself we are to be neighbors after all when wulf and cailin and their party had departed antonia porcius said angrily to her husband you were a fool not to kill him and cailin drusus besides ragnar wulf is no coward and he will not let you steal back his lands you will be fortunate if he does not take ours he slapped her hard sending her reeling do not ever lie to me again antonia he told her i will kill you next time as for wulf ironfist i will have his lands eventually and i will have his wife as well she sets my blood afire with her beauty antonia clutched at her aching jaw i hate you she said fiercely one day i will kill you ragnar he laughed aloud you have not the courage antonia he said and if you did what would you do then who would protect you and these lands i took from you the next man might not care if you lived or you died you are no beauty my dear your bitterness shows in your face rendering you less than attractive these days you will regret your cruel words she warned him be careful he responded that i do not throw you your sniveling whelp and your old father out into the cold lady i do not need you antonia i keep you because you amuse me in bed but eventually even that charm of yours is apt to fade if you remain shrewish she glared at him and walked from the hall making her way through the courtyard she moved to the gates and stopped she could see wulf ironfist and his party in the distance and she cursed them softly beneath her breath they would pay they would all pay we are being watched cailin said as they rode wulf turned a moment and then turning back said it is antonia she hates us so terribly cailin said to have done what she did and stolen our child she kissed the top of auroras head the child was settled before her on the black mare antonias venom is not what i fear he said i do not believe ragnar strongspear will be content until he has wrested our lands back for his own he is a fierce man but i will contain his ambitions he will wait for us to plant the fields and harvest the grain before he attacks us winefrith said but that will give us the summer months to strengthen our defenses why would he wait that long cailin asked curiously because if he attacks after the harvest he can destroy the grain and hay thus starving us and our animals over the next winter is he that strong she wondered we do not know yet lambkin wulf said but we will then too there is the chance ragnar will align himself with another warlord i do not think so winefrith interjected i think it will be a matter of pride with him that he overcome you himself perhaps wulf smiled wickedly we have an advantage our friend ragnar knows nothing about we have our villages over the hill we must decide how we are going to defend it all over the next few days and then we will implement our plans so that when ragnar strongspear comes calling we will be able to foil him you will have to kill him and antonia too cailin said bluntly you know this for certain the voice within speaks to you she nodded it does my lord then so be it he said quietly but we will wait for ragnar to make the first move the defense we make is better if it is of our own choosing and not one we are forced into making agreed aye my lord his captains answered enthusiastically chapter the villages had never before possessed names in past times they had simply been known by the name of whoever was in charge which more often than not led to confusion now wulf decided that each village needed a firm identity one that would not change with every change in leadership the britons were no longer a nomadic people berikoss old hill fort was resettled and called branddun for since it sat high it would be the logical place for beacons to be lit branddun meant beacon hill eppiluss village became braleah which meant hillslope meadow and indeed it had a fine one as they had discovered the morning of their return the other two villages were called denetun because it now belonged to the estate in the valley and orrford which was set by a stream whose shallow waters made it a perfect cattle crossing for drovers the hall itself was named caddawic which meant warriors estate an agreement was forged between wulf ironfist and the men in the villages in return for recognizing him as their overlord he would lead them and protect them from all comers all the lands that had been claimed in the past by the dobunni celts were now ceded to wulf ironfist and his descendants the villagers would be given the rights to the common fields to their kitchen gardens and to graze their animals in the common pasture their homes were theirs but the land beneath it was not they had the right to personally own cattle horses pigs barnyard fowl cats and dogs they would toil three days each week for their overlord at a variety of tasks they would tend his fields and his livestock those with special skills such as the cooper the thatchers and the ironworkers would also contribute their efforts they would all spend some time in military training for the defense of the lands and if war came wulf ironfist would lead them he would be father judge warrior and friend to them all it was a different sort of order than they had ever known but it seemed to eppilus and the others to be the best way to live now in their changing world they needed to be united and they needed a strong leader whom other ambitious men would respect and fear the women cailin among them planted the fields they tended the growing grain and the animals while the men went about the task of building defenses for the hall as well as for the villages the hall they had left to last knowing that ragnar strongspear had set a man to spy upon them from the hill above antonias husband was lulled into a false sense of security as the hall remained undefended by any barriers ragnar strongspear did not know that each of the nearby villages was being prepared to defend itself should he discover them as he and others eventually would in midsummer he finally withdrew his spy deciding the mans time would be better spent elsewhere than lying lazily on the hill wulf ironfists hall would be his when he chose to take it ragnar boasted to his wives antonia her body bruised by a recent beating her husband had administered shook her head wearily she was fairly certain she was with child that at least should stem ragnars irritation with her for the present and give her time to think her saxon husband was going to lose everything for them if she did not intervene in the matter ragnar was not really a clever man he was more like a marauding bull and then too there was her darling son quintus to consider these lands ragnar claimed to have conquered were really quintuss lands she could not allow this selfglorifying saxon oaf to steal from quintus meanwhile when ragnar strongspear withdrew his spy wulf and his men began to build a defense around the hall it was an earthworks that they topped with a stone wall small wooden towers were set atop the wall allowing for an excellent view of the surrounding valley winefrith worked long hours in his smithy producing doors for the walls they were made of strong aged oak a foot in thickness and wellsheathed in forged iron there had never been doors like them the hall was always busy and always full of wulfs men there was so much work to do and even more to oversee as mistress here it was cailins duty to provide direction she seemed to have no time for herself nor any privacy one day in an effort to escape it all she climbed the ladder to the solar above the hall it was not a large room its wood floor covering only a third of the hall below there were four bed spaces set into the stone walls they were bare and empty of bedding for she and wulf had been taking their rest below with everyone else cailin sighed wistfully remembering the early days of her marriage when he could hardly wait to bed her since that wonderful night in byzantium they had not found time to couple wulf seemed totally absorbed in his task of raising the halls defenses he came to bed late tired and never woke her she had tried several times to wait for him but to no avail she was exhausted herself for her days were long and began early a ray of sun cut through one of the two narrow windows partly illuminating the room and cailin began to visualize it as she had once planned it her loom would be by a window to catch the light there would be a rectangular oak table and two chairs where they might dine in private the bed spaces would be empty but for the one in which they would sleep eventually their family would share the solar but not at first they would have their privacy for now why not a determined look came into cailins eyes why should she not complete the solar she had her loom and the furniture was sitting in a distant corner of the hall below gathering dust going over to each of the two narrow windows in the room cailin unfastened the small casements with their panes of animal membrane warm sweet air filled the solar and she was immediately encouraged leaving the windows open she climbed down into the hall again she saw her cousin corio at the high board eating bread and cheese and called to him corio come give me your aid he arose how may i help you cousin cailin explained and before she knew it corio with the help of several young men had lifted her loom the table the chairs and the bedding to the solar above take the brazier too she told him handing him up the iron heater they had traveled with through gaul he grinned wickedly i do not think you will need it sweeting wulfs passion is poorly pent up he is set to explode with it he chuckled but give him the chance cousin and youll have no need for yon little charcoal burner is nothing a secret in this hall she demanded her cheeks red with her embarrassment did everyone know she and wulf werent coupling very little corio answered her dryly then he took the brazier from her but if you insist cousin he said grinning mischievously when the men had gone back to their assigned tasks cailin clambered back up the ladder to the solar corio bless him had had far more sense than she he had seen that the chests they used to store their personal belongings had been brought up into the room as well she fussed with the positioning of her loom and its stool so she would have the proper light the table was not quite centered cailin thought but she righted its position and straightened the chairs she filled their bed space with fresh hay she lugged up the ladder and mixed it with lavender sprigs handfuls of rose petals and sweet herbs the feather bed in its practical cotton ticking she slipped into a cover of skyblue silk that she had made for it it was an outrageous luxury but who would know but them fluffing the feather bed she placed it over the hay where it settled on the fragrant herbage removing the small alabaster lamp from the niche in the bed space she filled it with scented oil and putting a wick into it replaced the lamp in its space she lay a fox coverlet across the foot of the bedspace the bedspace was now ready for occupants cailin looked about the solar although it needed wall hangings and more pieces of furniture to make it really comfortable they would manage for the time being at least it was ready for habitation although privacy was not something the saxons held dear cailin was used to it having been raised with it wulf would not find it a burden she thought smiling then she heard him calling her from the hall below cailin scrambled down the ladder from the solar hurrying to greet her husband we have finished the defenses for the hall he told her proudly obviously wellpleased the gates have just now been fitted to the entry the barns within the walls are finished also she told him and the harvest is almost all in i did not go to the fields today for i was about other business my lord she looked askance at his filthy con dition you need a bath wulf ironfist you stink of your labor i am too tired to go to the stream and bathe he told her let it be lambkin i will bathe in the morning now she said firmly in a tone he had not heard her use before and not in an icy stream either my lord sit by the fire and have some ale while i make the preparations i have spent the better part of this day making the solar fit for our habitation i will not sleep in the hall another night wulf ironfist if aurora is to have a brother we must have some time to ourselves there is gossip already the world will not come to an end because we seek our privacy each night should not our daughter sleep in the solar too he queried her mischievously cocking a bushy tawny eyebrow quizzically for now cailin answered him severely aurora will remain in the hall with nellwyn to care for her then she left him and went to the end of the room calling instructions to her household servants he watched somewhat astounded as a large oaken tub was slowly rolled into a corner of the hall he had never seen it before and he realized she must have had their cooper make it she had great foresight he decided a hot bath would feel good a line of male servants began running back and forth with pails of steaming water which they dumped into the great tub it took fully half of an hour to fill the tub to cailins satisfaction while it was being done she marshaled soap and other implements necessary to bathing then she signaled him and he arose walking down the hall to where she waited tapping an impatient foot remove your clothing my lord she said then ordered the serving men to place screening about the tub as he took each item of clothing from his tired body she gathered it up into a pile when he was entirely naked cailin handed it over the screen to the woman appointed laundress for the hall at her command he climbed sheepishly into the tub he was astounded when she stripped off her own clothing and joined him you mean to make my bath a pleasant experience i see he said grinning lecherously at her i mean to make it a thorough one she countered sternly twill not be easy a roman bath is best but this is better than nothing she took up her strigil and began to scrape the sweaty dirt from his neck shoulders and chest the water in their tub just barely concealed her breasts but wulfs body was exposed from his waist up reaching out he cupped the twin orbs in his big hands and began to play with them as she worked we must begin to bathe again every day he murmured leaning forward to kiss her earlobe she giggled behave yourself wulf ironfist how can i do a proper job of bathing you if you distract me so am i indeed distracting you lambkin he said softly his tongue swirling about the shell of her ear he slipped a hand below the waterline to give her right buttock a gentle squeeze her violet eyes twinkled at him you are very distracting my lord she admitted to him and you must not be or i shall never get done if i do not we shall never reach the solar where our newly prepared bed space is awaiting us there is food and wine there aplenty my love once we have gained the privacy of that chamber and drawn the ladder up behind us no one will be able to reach us then she pressed herself against him teasingly do you not wish to be alone with me wulf my husband she ran her tongue over his lips and then kissed him quickly his aquamarineblue eyes smoldered at her their look was eloquent beyond measure finish your task lambkin he ground out it is far past time aurora had a brother and if you are not finished quickly we shall begin our endeavor right here in this tub cailin smiled alluringly at him and without another word began to smear soft soap over his skin with gentle fingers she bathed him and then sent him from the tub to dry himself while she washed her own body a fresh tunic barely covering his thighs was set out for him cailin exiting the tub dried herself under his hot gaze and slipped on a long camisa we must have a special place where we can bathe she said it is too difficult for the servants to have to be constantly moving this great tub do you like it my lord i had it made aye i like it he said it is pleasant to wash with warm water and not cold there are some things from your old civilization that i enjoy we will have a bathhouse built next to the hall where the tub may remain and there will be a fire to heat the water he took her hand in his come lambkin i would see the solar now the hall seemed strangely deserted as they made their way to the ladder leading up into their chamber wulf climbed behind cailin and having gained the room he leaned over and drew the ladder up behind him then he shut the trapdoor shoving the iron bolts hard into their casing and laying the ladder across the door turning about he inspected the room the last of the sunset was coming through the two narrow windows he could see the stars beginning to speckle the sky are you hungry she said there was food laid out for them on the table you have worked hard later he told her it will keep and then he pulled his tunic off nodding at her to do the same cailin removed the shapeless gown she had put on after her bath your hunger is of another kind she observed softly i have waited long he said quietly but seeing you like this now lambkin i find i cannot wait another moment longer i fear i am past the niceties she could see he was almost trembling and his male organ was engorged and eager reaching out she caressed him with gentle fingers and he shuddered i will show you a pleasure i learned in byzantium she told him in a way it is similar to something we did when i was carrying aurora she was surprised to find that she was as eager for him as he for her despite their lack of foreplay taking her husbands hand she led him to their bed space but instead of entering it cailin knelt upon the bedding and instructed him find my womans passage my love enter me this way and see the delights you gain she felt him seeking carefully and then she felt the tip of his weapon touching her wet and pulsing sheath his big hands grasped her hips firmly and he rammed himself home groaning with undisguised pleasure as he realized he was deeper within her than he had ever been for a moment he simply enjoyed the sensation of warmth and tightness then unable to help himself he felt his buttocks begin to contract and release contract and release as he propelled himself with ever growing urgency and impetus within her feminine channel actually feeling her expand to accommodate his yet swelling throbbing member his fingers dug into her soft flesh holding her firmly that he might have more of her kneeling upon the bedding cailin arched her back thrusting her hips up at him that he might delve even deeper she had gasped at his entry having forgotten how big he was but then the rhythmic thrust of his weapon began to communicate its passion to her she whimpered as he filled her passage the torrid heat of him astounding her she cried out at the fires he was arousing the culmination of their combined passions exploded almost as rapidly as it had begun he collapsed atop her nearly sobbing with relief cailin was almost smothered in the feather bed by the weight of him but she somehow managed to squirm from beneath him rolling onto her back she lay quietly allowing her own heart to cease its frantic pumping finally she said softly i had almost forgotten how wonderful a lover you can be wulf ironfist you have restored my memory admirably he raised his head up his blue eyes solemn but his words were humorous you will surely not forget again lambkin reaching over she gently yanked a lock of his long corncolored hair i will not forget again she promised him with utmost seriousness but in return you must promise not to let me be stolen away ever again she righted herself in the bed space and encouraged him to do so as well taking him into her arms so that his golden head rested upon her bosom he nuzzled the soft flesh gently i will never let you go cailin my wife he assured her never ever they made love again this time in a more gentle and leisurely manner she took his face in her hands and kissed him passionately as they reached the peak of their mutual desire then they fell asleep exhausted when they awoke in the middle of the starry night it was to discover that they were both hungry but this time their hunger was for food cailin had brought a roasted capon bread cheese crisp apples and a heady wine to the solar together they shared the feast returning to their bed space to kiss and to caress and to love some more the happiness that they had gained in finding each other again quickly communicated itself to all the inhabitants of the hall aurora who had been so withdrawn and frightened was now a laughing happy child adored by both of her parents her unpleasant memories were fading thanks to her relatively young age and her third birthday was celebrated with much festivity and not just a little excitement aurora had not been expected until at least the end of august but she had chosen to be born on the nineteenth of that month the day of her third birthday dawned clear and warm the grain harvest was all in and stored in the barns within the walls the workers were preparing to harvest apples to make cider the watch upon the walls suddenly called out horsemen upon the hillcrest and immediately the gates of caddawic were shut and barred the horsemen descended the hill slowly as wulf ironfist was called from the solar and hurried to a vantage point atop the walls ragnar strongspears dark blue eyes narrowed with irritation as he saw the newly built defenses about the hall too late he realized his error in withdrawing his spy as he drew closer he observed that the wall enclosing caddawic was a very strong one and the fields about the hall had all been harvested but where were the grain barns within those damned walls he suspected and safe from him ragnar was not a man of great intellect but he knew that retaking these lands was not going to be as easy a task as he had earlier anticipated looking up he saw wulf ironfist upon the walls watching his approach ragnar smiled toothily and said in his booming voice good morrow wulf ironfist surely you have not closed your gates to me we are neighbors and should be friends friends do not come calling at dawn with a party of heavily armed men came the reply state your business with me ragnar strongspear tis just a friendly visit the older man declared will you not open your gates and let me in my friend we are not friends wulf ironfist replied coldly if you wish to enter caddawic then you may but you must leave your troop outside my walls we are a peaceful community and seek no warring very well ragnar said deciding that he must get a look inside the walls of caddawic if he was to eventually take it he dismounted and handed the reins of his horse to his secondincommand my lord the man whose name was harald said it is not safe it is safe his master assured him softly if our positions were reversed twould not be so but wulf ironfist is a man of his word the gate was opened just enough for ragnar to squeeze through and then the strong iron bars were lowered securing the entry from intruders he noted that the gates were sheathed in iron caddawic was well thought out the well was in the courtyards center and there were several grain barns well away from the walls tis virtually impregnable wulf ironfist said in answer to ragnars thoughts as he joined his guest have you eaten come into the hall ragnar strongspear the hall doors were also thick oak and bound with bands of iron studded with large iron nails the two men passed through them into the hall it was not like his smoky and dirty hall ragnar noted indeed the smoke from the fire pits was drawn directly out several smoke holes in the roof the rushes upon the floor were clean and filled with sweet herbs that gave off their perfume as they were crushed beneath his feet several wellfed sleek hounds came up to sniff him and then returned to their places by the fires the two men seated themselves at the high board at once a line of quiet contentedlooking servants began to serve them bringing platters of food and pouring brown ale ragnars eyes grew wide at the variety of foods offered him he was certainly not fed like this in his hall there was a thick pottage warm newly baked bread hardboiled eggs broiled trout ham sweet butter hard cheese and a bowl filled with apples and pears were you expecting guests he asked his host no wulf said my wife keeps a good table doesnt yours there is not this variety ragnar admitted and helped himself liberally to everything offered there was silence as the two men ate when they had finished and the table cleared wulf said quietly if you thought to retake these lands ragnar strongspear put it from your mind they belong to me only as long as you can hold them the older man said grinning i will hold them for longer than you have life was the cool reply this hall and the lands to the north and to the east are mine i will keep them seek out the lands to the south for yourself and your children you cannot have my estates you have taken dobunni lands ragnar was surprised they have given me the fealty wulf told him a small smile upon his lips while you spent the summer months plotting and planning ragnar strongspear i spent those months doing go home and tell antonia porcius to cease her greedy thoughts i cannot imagine why you took her to wife she is a very evil woman if you do not know this be warned no doubt she wants her lands back for her son quintus she will do what she must to gain her desire she will even destroy you if she can you seem to know my wife well ragnar said dryly after antonia had stolen my daughter and sent my wife into slavery she told me that they were both dead wulf answered she offered herself to me disrobing in the atrium of her villa and pushing her breasts into my face i found her singularly undesirable she can be at times ragnar admitted but she is also the best damn fuck i have ever had i swear it by woden himself then i congratulate you on your good fortune wulf said but i still advise you to beware her there is no necessity for us to quarrel ragnar strongspear there is more than enough land for us all stay to the south and there will be peace between us his guest nodded in reply then he said where is your wife wulf ironfist i hope she is not ill nay but she is seeing to the preparations for a small celebration of our daughters natal day it is the first time since auroras birth that we have been able to celebrate it together he told the other man as you know we did not even realize we had a daughter until several months ago ragnar flushed that was not my fault he said i believed antonia when she said the child was hers she is fair like antonia why should i have not believed her we do not hold you responsible wulf assured him graciously i must go ragnar said rising wulfs manner was beginning to irritate him i thank you for the meal i will certainly consider your words wulf ironfist as ragnar departed caddawic his thoughts were somewhat confused wulf ironfist had actually given him good advice the lands to the south of him were rich and most of the poor souls farming it could not withstand the force of his might those lands could be his for the taking and with little loss of life on his side he was not afraid of death nor of battle but there was something about this britain that made a man desire peace more than war he did not understand it but neither did it make him unhappy antonia however did not quite see it that way why would you settle for less than you can have she demanded of him scornfully to her credit he thought she was not afraid of his anger she knew herself safe as she was growing big with his child he did not believe in beating a woman who was with child though the gods knew this particular woman tried him sorely his two saxon wives were strong women as well but they had a sweetness to them antonia was bitterly hard of heart her only softness being that which she showed toward her son the boy ragnar thought was a cowardly little weasel always hiding behind his mothers skirts what would you have of me then he demanded irritably why should i war with wulf ironfist over his lands when the lands to the south are as rich and easier pickings perhaps antonia you hope that wulf ironfist will vanquish me and you will regain control of these lands for your son put such thoughts from your head wife soon my brother and his family will join us if i die an unnatural death gunnar will be here to avenge me and to hold these lands for himself and our sons she was astounded this was the first she had heard of his brother but used to deceit antonia covered her surprise with a sweet smile you did not tell me that you had a brother ragnar or that he would be coming to join us has he wives and children when is he to arrive we must prepare a proper welcome for our family ragnars booming laughter filled their bed space by woden antonia you are clever but i see through you you were not expecting that i had additional family but we saxons are good breeders as your belly attests to he told her patting the place where his child grew within her you had some scheme in mind and now i have not a doubt you will form another crafty plot to replace it very well if it amuses you to do so breeding women are given to such vagaries and it is harmless enough i think he lowered his dark blond head and kissed her plump shoulder his shoulderlength hair brushed her breasts reaching up antonia thoughtfully stroked his beard she hated him but he was the most virile man she had ever known do not be a fool ragnar she finally told him take the lands to the south for wulf ironfist has given you good advice even i will admit to that lull our enemy into a false sense of security and when he least expects it seize his lands as well why settle for being a minor lordling when you could be a king at her words the child within her kicked mightily and ragnar strongspear felt the movement beneath his resting hand it is an omen he said almost fearfully why else would the child grow so restive in your womb antonia surely it is a sign of some sort our son knows that i speak the truth my husband she told him or perhaps it is the gods who speak to you through the babe what a fool he is she thought to herself if the gods existed and frankly antonia was no longer certain that they did why would they bother to concern themselves with one as foolish and superstitious as this great bull of a man who lay by her side contemplating the future my brother and his family should be here in a few days time he told her finally he has just a single wife as he has never been able to afford more but now of course that will change he is younger than i am by several years but he fathered his first child on his wife when he was but fourteen there are eight living children six sons what a fine family antonia said dryly thinking that this horrid hall he had built to replace her beautiful villathe villa he had destroyedwas already badly overcrowded the addition of ten more people would but add to the noise and the filth the gods she missed her bath with its lovely rejuvenating steam and its delicious hot water how ragnars other wives mocked her when she insisted on washing herself in a little oaken tub filled with warm water but she didnt care she would wager that cailin drusus had better bathing accommodations the bitch ragnar she said to her husband who was half dozing what he grunted if caddawic is truly fortified so well it cannot be taken in battle then we will have to think of another way to capture it he shook his head at her there is no way wulf ironfist has built strongly and he has built well even the water supply is safely within his walls i am not a man to easily admit defeat antonia but caddawic cannot be taken it simply cannot be let me tell you a tale of ancient times ragnar antonia said patiently but he silenced her with a wave of his hand another time woman he said and rolled her onto her side i have other things in mind for you and then i must sleep in the morning you may tell me your fable but now i want to fuck you your needs are so simple she taunted him hissing softly as he penetrated her expertly if you are as good a warrior as you are a lover my husband you will have no difficulty in taking caddawic once i have shown you how ahhh yess ragnar yesss caddawic he thought about it as he methpdically pumped her the lands were good the hall sound and cailin would be an extra bonus he had seen her several times but he could not dismiss her from his mind what fire and spirit she had he imagined she would be as strong and sweet as his saxon wives and as lustful as antonia it was a perfect combination and he meant to have her there was time however neither she nor wulf ironfist were going anywhere they had made it abundantly clear that the land meant everything to them he would have more than enough time to take the lands to the south to settle his brother and his family on a nearby holding to find gunnar a second wife with a good dowry oh yes there was plenty of time the autumn came and nuala bore winefrith a fine big son who was called barre it meant a gateway between two places nuala thought it appropriate for barre was indeed a bridge between the britain of old and the new britain cailin was present at the birth and afterward marveled at the childs size and how strongly he tugged upon his mothers breast when he was put there to nurse youll have a son of your own soon enough nuala teased her surely you and wulf do not spend all that time in the solar just talking cousin she giggled i know i wouldnt fresh from childbirth and totally shameless cailin said pretending to be scandalized for your information wulf enjoys watching me at my loom nuala and then of course we sing together nuala looked thunderstruck you jest she said i assure you it is quite true cailin replied sweetly indeed it is wulf said agreeing with his wife whom he had overheard spinning her mischievous tale cailin weaves a most marvelous spell about me when we are in the solar together and sings passions song far better than any i have ever known nuala burst out laughing realizing that they were teasing her the infant at her breast hiccuped and began to wail ohh see what you have done to barre she scolded them suddenly all maternal concern and caring there my little sweetheart do not fuss by the winterfest the lady of caddawic was beginning to swell with another child much to everyones delight it would be born cailin told them after beltane and it is a son i am certain she assured wulf how can you tell he asked her smiling she shrugged i just can she said a woman senses such things is that not so she turned to the other women in the hall for support and they all nodded in agreement you see the winter set in and the land around them grew white and silent the days were short and quick in the long nights the wolves could be heard howling about caddawic their eerie cries answered by the mournful howls of the hounds in the hall who grew restless at the knowledge of the predators prowling beyond the strong iron and oak gates wulf and cailin were alone for the others had returned to their own villages after the winterfest cailin missed nuala nellwyn though sweet and loyal was not particularly interesting to chat with by the fire aurora however adored her and without anything being said cailins former slave became the childs nursemaid it was just as well for cailin did not need a personal servant her mother had raised her to be a useful person who could do for herself now as mistress of caddawic cailin found herself responsible for the wellbeing of all those in her charge finally the days began to grow discernibly longer the air felt milder patches of earth became visible and the snow cover shrank rapidly as the earth began to grow warmer with the coming spring snowdrops narcissi and violets began to make their appearance cailin was pleased to find several large clumps growing near the graves of her family the marble marker had never been finished and it was now unlikely that it ever would be it simply read the family of gaius drusus corinium looking down at it cailin sighed her hand moving to her swollen belly in a protective gesture how her family would have spoiled her children this child i carry is a son she assured them aloud how i wish you could be here to see him when he is born he is to be called royse aurora is very excited about the new baby ohh cailin looked up as an arm went about her shoulders wulf how you startled me you miss your family dont you he replied i cannot even remember my mother i often wonder what she was like until they were murdered cailin answered him they were my whole life i cannot help but wonder what it would have been like if they had not died my parents of course would not be much changed but my brothers would they would truly be men now with families how my grandmother would have enjoyed those greatgrandchildren i think perhaps it is brenna i miss the most how strange that must sound to you i am sorry that i did not know them he told her then together they returned to the hall where their daughter ran to greet them the spring was well under way and the plowing started when the gates were opened one morning to reveal a young girl crumpled upon the earth before them wulf and cailin were summoned from the hall the gods cailin exclaimed the child has been beaten cruelly is she dead how came she here to caddawic the girl moaned as if in answer and rolled over just enough to reveal a form more mature than they had thought she was small and slender but obviously older than they had originally believed cailin knelt and gently touched the maidens arm can you hear me lass she asked her what has happened to you the girl opened her eyes slowly they were a pale green in color and the look in them was one of total confusion where am i she whispered so low that cailin had to bend closer to hear her you are at caddawic the holding of wulf ironfist she replied who are you where have you come from and who has mistreated you so cruelly she shifted herself uncomfortable in this position as she was within a month of bearing her child the girl looked uncertain as to what to answer and her eyes filled with tears that spilled down her very pretty face what is your name cailin gently pressed her the girl appeared to think a moment and then she said aelfa aelfa is my name i remember i am called aelfa where have you come from cailin asked again the girl appearedto consider and then said i do not know lady the tears slipped silently down her face again poor little thing wulf said the beating she has received has obviously addled her wits she will remember in time i will carry her into the hall said corio who had come but the day before from braleah gently he lifted the girl into his arms and when her head fell against his shoulder a strange look crossed the young mans face no woman had yet captured corios heart the girl was brought to the hall where cailin carefully examined her other than her bruises she seemed fine but for her loss of memory cailin had the tub brought and bathed the girl herself aelfas hair was like cornsilk a pale almost silvery gold in color a tunica and camisa were quickly found to fit her dainty stature as she was brought to the high board everyone in the hall could see that aelfa was not simply a pretty girl she was a beautiful one corio appeared besotted as he watched her eating picking sparingly at the food he is bewitched cailin whispered to her husband as i would be had i not found you lambkin he answered cailin was discomfited by his reply to her great surprise she had not thought herself capable of such silly jealousy she gazed from beneath her lashes at the girl i am just as lovely when i do not look like a sow ready to birth her piglets she decided why are men such fools over a beautiful helpless female i should far rather be strong when aelfa had finished eating wulf gently asked her have you remembered anything else about yourself that might help us to find to whom you belong surely your family is worried perhaps she is a slave a runaway cailin suggested she wears no collar wulf replied did you see any mark of ownership upon her when you bathed her lambkin cailin shook her head nay i did not i can remember nothing of myself aelfa said in a sweet almost musical voice oh i am afraid why can i not remember you will remember in time cailin said briskly seeing that aelfa was preparing to weep once more the men were being foolish enough without being subjected to that have you not work in the fields cailin asked her husband do not worry about aelfa she will stay with me and i will keep her safe corio will your father not want you at home to help we are so pleased you came to visit but go and do not come back until the beltane fires cousin are all women so impatient when they are close to delivering their young corio asked wulf as they exited the hall i have never seen cailin so short of temper then dismissing his cousin he said is not aelfa the most exquisite creature you have ever seen i think i am in love with her already is such a thing possible wulf ironfist wulf laughed aye it is he admitted and i can see you are certainly taken with our waifchild if we learn anything of import about her like a husband languishing somewhere i will send word to you aelfa however could not seem to remember anything of her life before they had found her apart from her name wulf felt that all evidence pointed to a gentle birth and had wanted to house her in the solar not the hall cailin had with strangely uncharitable feelings refused the solar is for the lord and his family she said sharply to her husband aelfa is not family she is safe in the hall and to house her with us would say otherwise causing unpleasant talk among whom he had wanted to ask but cailins expression was so forbidding he dared not he put her irritation down to the fact the childs birth was near and that she was anxious for it to be born you are mistress of this hall he soothed her and was surprised when she glared up at him he had never seen her like this certainly she had not been so easily angered when she had carried aurora the girl must stay cailin said it goes against all the laws of hospitality for us to expel her from caddawic due to the mysterious circumstances surrounding her arrival nonetheless she is not family and i will not have her treated as such lest it be misunderstood he was forced to agree and aelfa settled into the routine of their lives she was courteous and pleasant to all but cailin thought she seemed more so to the men cailin did not know what it was that made her suspicious of aelfa but her voice within was strong she had long ago learned not to deny it even when she did not fully understand the warning cailin knew from her past experiences that all would be revealed in time until then she would be vigilant and on her guard her family and all she held dear were once again being threatened would there never come a time when they would know real peace she despaired silently across the hall aelfa sat upon the floor with nellwyn giggling as they played with aurora they made a most charming picture even if that was precisely what aelfa had intended cailin thought angrily wondering why the others could not see the girl for the schemer she was in time that little voice counseled her wisely in time chapter there would never be a beltane celebration cailin thought pensively when she would not remember the tragedy that had struck her family the merriment of the festival would always be tinged with sadness for her when she and wulf had returned to britain last year the holiday had been a subdued one for them because they were too involved with rebuilding their lives this year however it was different the fields were already green with new grain there was an air of new hope about them that she could not remember having felt in all her life the weather was perfect and despite the impending birth of her child cailin arose early to gather flowering branches for the hall she took aurora with her and upon their return cailin noticed nellwyn and aelfa loitering about the halls gates flirting with the men on duty she called sharply to nellwyn to come and take aurora and scolded aelfa for her idleness then she hurried into the hall hearing laughter behind her and knowing that aelfa had probably said something rude cailin could not understand why the girls memory had not returned she had not been that badly injured when they had found her in fact neither her head nor her face had been touched it seemed she had been treated with great kindness in the weeks she was with them cailin suspected that the girl knew full well who her people were and where she had come from but would say nothing lest she be dislodged from her comfortable place at caddawic which was obviously better than anything she had ever known cailin realized that she did not want aelfa at caddawic much longer if the girl could or would not remember then a husband must be found for her in one of the villages by summers end cailin was perfectly willing to supply the dowry but aelfa must go mama mama see fire aurora who was snuggled into her mothers arms pointed with fat little fingers at the beltane fires leaping up across the hillsides as the sun set aye aurora i see cailin answered her daughter pretty aurora said look at papa cailin smiled as wulf leapt the fire laughing and then other men and women both began to follow him mama jump aurora commanded her mother nay precious not this year cailin laughed i am too fat with the new baby next year she promised aelfa leapt over the flames her pale gold hair flying she was laughing and cailin had to admit even grudgingly that she was beautiful the men clustered about her like bees to a honey pot corio had come from braleah village just to see her but aelfa did not seem to favor him to his great disappointment her two favorite swains were menatarms albert and branhard who vied mightily for her attention it was just as well cailin thought she was sorry to see the look of hurt on corios face but she also knew he could do better than aelfa if he really desired a wife she watched half amused half annoyed as aelfa disappeared into the darkness first with one of her admirers and then returned with him to shortly go off with the other she has the morals of a mink cailin said to wulf she will have those two at each others throats before the night is out she is young and it is beltane he answered mildly we must find her a husband and the sooner the better from what i have observed here tonight my lord cailin told him severely the gods she sounded like an old woman what was the matter with her i suspect you are right lambkin he answered to her great surprise she is far too lovely a maid to be allowed to run freely much longer i cannot have dissension among my men over a pretty girl discord is a weakness we can ill afford ragnar strongspear has taken my advice and is expanding his territory to the south he has been joined by his brother gunnar i have no doubt that egged on by antonia he will be foolish enough to turn his eyes toward our lands sometime in the future we must remain strong aurora half asleep was heavy in cailins arms nellwyn she called to the nursemaid take aurora and put her to bed then she turned back to her husband make inquiries in orrford to see if any young men need wives if you make aelfa choose between albert and branhard there will be hard feelings between those two she is in love with neither but rather plays with each like a cat with a mouse corio is taken with her but she is not the right woman for him best we send her as far from caddawic and braleah as we can that way none of her admirers here is apt to see her again for a long time if ever by summers end aelfa must be wed i must make a tour of all the villages soon to see how it goes with them wulf told his wife i but wait for the son you have promised me before leaving you lambkin i will personally seek out and find the right young man for aelfa to wed in orrford good cailin said but despite their agreement in the matter her voice within nagged her yet she remained on her guard but for what she was unable to tell royse wulfsone was born on the nineteenth day of may unlike his sisters hard birth his entry into the world was a swift and easy one cailin awoke in the hour of the false dawn to realize her waters had broken within minutes she was being racked with labor and in the hour that the sky began to lighten with the new day the baby was born howling lustily his face red his small arms flailing nellwyn had assisted her mistress with the birth but aelfa swooned at the sight of the blood involved and had to be carried from the solar cailin and wulfs son was strong and healthy from the moment of his birth he suckled eagerly at his mothers breasts and always seemed hungry denied her daughters infancy cailin reveled in her motherhood sensitive however to auroras feelings she involved the little girl in her brothers care as much as she could so that aurora would not feel neglected as a big sister aurora who would be four in the late summer did admirably running to fetch her mother at her baby brothers least cry helping to dress him watching over him with nellwyn she is so patient with him cailin observed he is going to be very spoiled i fear he already recognizes her do you see how strong he is wulf said proudly he will be a big man someday perhaps even bigger than i am when royse was six weeks old and cailin fully recovered from the birth wulf ironfist set off to visit his villages before he left he called aelfa into his and cailins presence she came meekly looking particularly pretty in a pale blue tunica she had made from a length of fabric cailin had given her on beltane how may i serve you lord she inquired politely has your memory returned yet even in part maiden he asked her quietly his voice both gentle and encouraging aelfas light green eyes grew visibly misty alas my lord no she answered him i have tried to remember something of myself but i cannot ohh what will become of me it is time that you were wed wulf answered her wed aelfa looked startled this was obviously not something that she had even considered you would marry me cailin hissed angrily the nerve of the wench not i he said somewhat startled himself by her words i go tomorrow to tour the villages belonging to my holding since you can remember nothing of yourself and we have heard of no lost lasses in the time you have been with us then it is time for you to begin a new life as lord of this land your welfare is my responsibility i will therefore seek out a good husband for you and you will be wed as soon as it is possible before the summers end i think but i do not think i want a husband aelfa said nervously perhaps i already have a husband my lord what if that is so is it aelfa do you have a husband he pierced her with a sharp look perhaps you have run away from a husband who caught you with a lover and then beat you for your faithlessness i cannot remember my lord she stubbornly insisted then wulf said smiling benignly i think it best we find you a good man and resettle you maiden is it agreed for a very long moment aelfa was silent and then finally she said yes my lord but could you not marry me yourself one wife is more than enough for me he replied with a chuckle eh lambkin he swept a loving look at cailin by his side you will never need another she said quietly when nellwyn learned of the other girls fate she complained to her mistress why is it that aelfa is to have a husband and i am not have i not served you well my lady more than well nellwyn cailin assured her you may have a husband whenever you choose him unless of course you would prefer that my lord and i select a good man for you aelfa is alone in the world and needs our aid but you nellwyn have always had me and whatever you desire within reason i will give you for your faithful service when aelfa first came nellwyn told her mistress i thought her nice but she is not my lady she teases the men to distraction i know cailin replied that is why i suggested to my lord that he find her a husbandin orrford if possible orrford nellwyn giggled it is far my lady and not very big and there are so many cows more than people i think indeed cailin said a single eyebrow cocked she will have to work very hard nellwyn continued life is harsh is orrford and once she is married she cannot flirt with others no cailin answered solemnly husbands will take umbrage if a wife flirts with other men nellwyn aelfa will have to become a very good and most proper wife wont she she grinned at her servant nellwyn giggled i do not think aelfa will like either that or orrford my lady she pretends to be meek and modest before you and my lord but her tongue is sharp and sometimes foul she is not i think what she pretends to be yet never has she spoken to me of her past she does not even talk in her sleep for i have listened soon aelfa will not be our worry any longer cailin said soothingly to nellwyn by summers end she will be gone from us to a husband good riddance nellwyn said feelingly i shall not be sorry to see the back of that one my lady cailin suddenly had a flash of intuition is it albert or branhard you favor nellwyn my lass she asked the girl nellwyn blushed to the roots of her yellow hair ohh my lady how did you know tis albert the fool but he cannot see me for his eyes are too full of aelfa though she toys with him first favoring him and then branhard both are confused by her wicked behavior but tis albert i love he will have forgotten her by samain i promise cailin said to the girl then we will see if he favors a marriage with you nellwyns blue eyes filled with tears oh my lady thank you i would make albert a good wife i would the fool yes cailin thought after her revealing discussion with nellwyn the sooner aelfa was gone from caddawic the better still her conscience nagged at her was she being fair foisting the wench off on some poor unsuspecting young man wulf however was fully aware of aelfas shortcomings he would choose the right man it would be up to the bridegroom to correct aelfas behavior cailin hoped he would be strong enough wulf had been gone for over a week when aelfa disappeared one afternoon has she run away perhaps cailin wondered aloud aelfa however reappeared before the gates were closed that evening when questioned about her whereabouts she claimed to have been out berrying you brought no berries back cailin noted sharply i could find none my lady was the meek reply she lies nellwyn said as she and her mistress made their rounds to see that the fires were banked for the night that the door was bolted and everything else in the hall was secure she had no basket with her my lady how could she berry without a basket she could not cailin answered more than likely she was out meeting a lover upon the hillside the bold wench albert and branhard were looking something fierce at each other in the hall at supper my lady nellwyn reported there is our answer cailin said she is setting those two against one another again but for what purpose i do not know cailin climbed to the solar where aurora and royse were already long asleep lifting the baby from his cradle she fed the halfsleeping infant before finding her own rest she could not imagine a better life than the one she had wulf their children caddawic sometimes she would glimpse the old marble floor of what had once been her childhood home and the memories would flood her being lately when that happened she found she was no longer sad most of her memories were good ones and whatever happened those memories could not be taken from her she would always have them and in having them she would always have her family with her cailin slept not hearing the bolt to the hall door being drawn softly the door opened and then it closed as silently as aelfa could make it she stood outside the entry a long minute listening to the sounds of the night and then she ran on bare feet across the courtyard to the gatehouse the waning moon silvered her naked form she carried a small skin of wine in her hand gaining her destination aelfa quickly entered the small gatehouse shutting the door quietly a smile of derision crossed her face at the sight of the dozing man on the stool in the corner what a weakling he was and his sense of duty was certainly lacking kneeling down next to him aelfa kissed branhards mouth startling the man awake did you not want to see me she murmured seductively at him and his eyes widened at her nudity i have brought you some fine wine from the lords own barrel it will not ever be missed she reassured him and handed him the full skin have some she kissed him quickly a second time aelfa he said in a strangled voice you should not be here where is your clothing what if someone should come albert would not be so faint of heart aelfa taunted him he met me on the hillside today and tried to have his way with me i fought him off and refused him for it is you branhard that i really want let albert have nellwyn who is so coweyed over him her small hands reached down and fumbled beneath his tunic you are a real man i know you are then she kissed him hard do you not want me branhard my big strong warrior aelfa ran her tongue over her lips seductively branhard found to his surprise that he was holding his breath he let it out with a slow hiss as her hands found his manhood and began to play with it she was skilled beyond any he had ever known his eyes closed and pure pleasure such as he had never experienced filled his being her little fingers stroked him slowly lingeringly at first then pushing the covering from his battering ram she worked him swiftly he began to ache with his great need aelfa he groaned hungrily catching his hand in her hair and drawing her closer to him i want you aelfa giggling she took his cloak and spread it upon the narrow floor of the tiny gatehouse laying down upon it she opened her legs wide and said huskily come stuff me with that great pole of yours branhard you want me every bit as much as i want you no one will come and find us all are abed and we may take our pleasure as much of it as we like he could not have stopped himself if he had wanted to she was beautiful and she was hot for him no man in his right mind would refuse aelfas plea with a low cry he fell upon her pushing his engorged organ into her hot wet sheath humping her almost violently while she encouraged him onward murmuring a soft stream of foul yet madly exciting obscenities into his ear as she writhed wildly beneath him he was astounded that she would know such words for she looked so pure but it lessened his guilt at using her so enthusiastically she seemed to fill him with incredible strength and his lust knew no bounds he pumped and pumped and pumped himself into her while aelfa twisted and moaned beneath him her little cries arousing him even further finally he could no longer contain himself and his passions burst violently within her throbbing body he collapsed upon her with a groan of satisfaction by woden wench you are the best i have never had better i swear it his oniony breath assailed her get off me you oaf she said you are crushing me he rolled away from her wheres that wine you brought he demanded feeling relaxed now and more in control of the situation lets have a drink together and then ill give you another bit of a poke if youre of a mind you will be wont you he said with a leering grin ive never known such a woman as you aelfa you be one of those girls who cannot get enough arent you he sat himself back down upon his stool pulling his garments into some semblance of order again then reaching out for her he drew her near tweaking the rosy nipples of her full fat breasts her clothing had never given him any indication that she had such fine teats but they were magnificent rutting fool aelfa thought as she smiled up at him she lifted up the skin of wine and pretended to drink before handing it on to him hmmmm tis good she said as he swilled away some of the purplered liquid drizzling down into his thick blond beard branhard let the sweet cool liquid run down his throat it was the best drink he had ever tasted wulf ironfist lived well he handed her back the wineskin and began to fondle aelfas big breasts youve the best pair ive ever seen wench he said by way of a compliment and your cunt is the tightest of any ive ever reamed i swear it you really know how to give a man his pleasure aelfa i can hardly believe it but im ready to have at you again on your back my girl he said as loosing his organ from his clothing once more he pushed her down to the floor what he lacked in subtlety he more than made up for in endurance and brute strength aelfa thought as she pretended to be overcome with passion she had taken her own pleasure with him the first time but now she could not allow herself the luxury when his lust exploded again and he rolled away from her she offered him the wineskin once more smiling encouragingly as he gulped down the potent liquid this time within moments branhard fell into unconsciousness aelfa sighed with her relief she was actually sore with his enthusiastic attentions a third bout with him would have certainly rendered her raw she rose from the floor of the gatehouse and after much effort managed to drag branhards limp heavy body back onto his stool his shaggy head lay upon his chest he appeared to be dozing she slipped from the building and ran quickly back across the courtyard to the hall letting herself in she hurried to her bed space the hall was quite silent the contented snores of its inhabitants the only sounds she heard aelfa put on her clothes and then returned to the gatehouse where branhard sat unconscious seating herself upon the floor where she would not be seen she waited for the predawn when it finally came aelfa stood up stretched and then leaving the gatehouse went directly to the great gates of caddawic slowly and with great difficulty she pushed the heavy bar that lay across one of the gates to one side above her the sky was quickly lightening perspiration half due to exertion half to fear of discovery rolled down her back as she struggled with the bar when at last she succeeded the single door swung open to reveal a large party of armed men uncle aelfa said archly welcome to caddawic you have done well niece ragnar strongspear said and then led his men quietly through the gates into the courtyard where is the mistress of the hall and how long before wulf ironfists return cailin sleeps in the solar with her children aelfa replied as for her husband he should return in a few days time i expect secure this place ragnar said to his secondincommand harald and then he turned back to aelfa fetch the lady cailin to me girl and her children too i will want food also yes uncle aelfa said she hurried off back into the hall to do his bidding only realizing too late that cailin always drew the ladder to the solar up each night there was no other way into the room but through the trapdoor as ragnar strode into the hall she ran back to him and explained the dilemma no matter he said she must come down eventually and i will be waiting for her the lady cailin is a most toothsome wench you desire her aelfa was surprised she thought cailin far too prim and proper for her lusty uncle she was also too old being past twenty do not be fooled by her dignity and manners girl he told her beneath it all she is a woman and a fiery woman i will wager the sleepy and surprised inhabitants of caddawic were roused and brought before ragnar strongspear outside the menatarms were rounded up subdued and marched into the hall including the halfconscious branhard this place is now mine by right of conquest ragnar said in a sonorous voice no harm will come to you if you obey my wishes if you try to rebel you will be killed now start your day as you normally would and someone bring me some food i am fair starved for a moment they looked at him still but half awake and totally unaware of what they should do how had this happened how had ragnar strongspear gained entry to caddawic it was a common thought you will obey ragnar strongspear for now cailin said as she came into their midst i want none of you harmed she was very beautiful in a dark green tunic dress decorated with gold threads cailin turned to ragnar and demanded in proud tones how came you here his eyes devoured her by woden she was a beauty and he would have her this night beneath him by means of a trojan horse he answered her do you know the story antonia told it me cailin nodded i know the tale well she said and then a light of understanding dawned in her eyes her gaze swept the room and found what it was seeking aelfa she said aelfa was your trojan horse was she not ragnar strongspear who is she my brother gunnars eldest daughter she is fifteen and very wily he said chuckling the girl aelfa has betrayed us cailin told the gathering of her people she is ragnar strongspears niece a terrible groan arose from branhard bitch he cried and then flung himself before cailin lady you must forgive me i desired her and she knew it she came to me last night as i kept watch and offered herself to me then she fed me drugged wine to render me unconscious it is my fault that the hall is taken forgive me you are a fool branhard but get up and go about your duties what is done is done although you are not likely to escape some punishment from my husband when he returns cailin told him branhard scrambled to his feet his complexion had a decidedly yellowgreen tinge to it he looked as if he would be sick at any moment thank you lady he managed to gasp cailin realized now that the reason aelfa had fixed her attentions on poor branhard and the hapless albert was that they were the two men assigned to the gatehouse each took his turn in rotation keeping the watch through the night aelfa did not care for either of them and poor albert could have just as easily been her victim had he been on duty last night it was only bad luck for branhard that it had been his turn how did aelfa communicate with you cailin asked ragnar as they seated themselves at the high board and the hall regained some semblance of normalcy i sensed something wrong but did not know what he looked eagerly toward the end of the hall for the servants who would soon be coming from the cook house with the morning meal ragnar well remembered the good table cailin kept i had a man on the hill watching from the day you found her at your gates he told cailin and then he gulped down the good brown ale poured into his cup ive never tasted better he complimented her with a grin yesterday cailin said slowly she contacted the man yesterday afternoon when she slipped out ostensibly to berry but she took no basket with her i knew it a lie but not the reason for the lie the food was now beginning to arrive ragnar took his knife from his belt and cut himself two thick slabs of ham he helped himself to several hardboiled eggs and a small loaf of bread more ale he commanded the attending servant then he asked cailin where are your children lady i hear you had a son but a few weeks back that bitch antonia lost my child after the solstice it was a son too she is a bad breeder but you will be a good breeder for me did you know that i am going to make you my wife cailin the first time i ever laid eyes on you i knew that i wanted you my saxon women are good creatures loyal and hardworking like milk cows antonia is a viper but sometimes a little poison is sweet you however my little fox vixen with your russet curls will give me the greatest pleasure of all i have a husband cailin said quietly she was not afraid of this braggart he could not have taken caddawic without treachery and he would be driven out i will kill wulf ironfist ragnar bragged i think rather he will kill you cailin replied quietly your children he demanded again where are they they are gone she said with a small smile that cannot be he roared angrily furious for her children were the weapon he intended to use against her how can they be gone the veins in his thick neck stood out clearly and they were throbbing you gained entry to caddawic by means of a ruse ragnar strongspear she said i was already awake when you entered the hall at first i believed my husband had returned i opened the door to look down and saw you my son was newly fed and so i awoke my daughter i dressed both children and while you were bragging and bellowing and attempting to put the fear of the gods into my people i brought my children down into the hall gave them into the keeping of my servant nellwyn and watched while she walked through the gates with them your men were so busy trying to bully mine that they never even noticed nellwyn pass them by she is now well on her way to braleah you will not catch her i think cailin concluded laughing lightly braleah what is that place he growled one of the villages belonging to caddawic she told him surely you did not think we were alone but for a few of my dobunni kin caddawic has four villages belonging to it you will be unable to hold them if you can even find them nellwyn will raise the alarm against you and wulf ironfist will come with many men to drive you out if i were you i should finish my meal and hurry home what a woman you are he answered her grinning even if i were to take your advice i should take you with me cailin you are not simply strong and beautiful you think like a warrior i do not believe i should like such a trait in any other woman but it becomes you my fox vixen by woden it becomes you well cailin sipped her watered wine and ate heartily of bread ham and hard cheese she had nothing more to say to ragnar strongspear finally she stood up and strode from the high board should i stop her lord harald asked nervously are the gates now secured ragnar demanded sarcastically aye lord harald said then let her be you fool where will she go that i cannot find her she is i suspect about her daily duties and nothing more cailin was but she also made the rounds of caddawic reassuring each and every member of the household with her calm manner what shall we do my lady albert asked her nervously he was more than well aware how close to disaster he himself had come do not resist she told him as she had the others unless of course your very life is threatened go about your daily duties as you normally do wulf ironfist will come soon and he will drive ragnar strongspear back to his own lands do not fear nellwyn will raise the alarm and ragnar strongspears only advantage was in surprise he no longer has that advantage cailin moved on in early afternoon she gathered the women about her telling them i will not allow anyone to abuse you hide yourselves in the cellar beneath the largest grain barn do it as soon as you can and remember to bring water skins do not come out until morning when i shall come to fetch you hurry now but what of you lady one of the serving women asked i will not be harmed cailin assured them she had already decided what she must do if she could not deter ragnar strongspear from his lustful intent then she must kill him her breasts were beginning to ache dreadfully and looking down she grimaced with irritation her milk was beginning to leak through her nipples and stain her tunic dress royse last nursed in the early morning nellwyn would have found a nursing mother for him at braleah and cailin knew she would have to do something to rid herself of her milk cailin took bread from the bake house and a small cheese from the dairy the servants would have put several pitchers of water in the solar as was the usual practice entering the hall cailin saw that ragnar strongspear was not there with a chuckle she climbed up to the solar and pulling the ladder behind her bolted the door fast there was no other ladder available that would reach the chamber she would be safe for a time removing her tunic dress she sighed at the sight of her soaked camisa she pulled it off too and then expressed the milk from her swollen breasts into an empty basin immediately she felt better and washing herself off she put on clean garments she could hear fresh activity in the hall below she had given her menservants orders to serve the evening meal as usual and deny the intruders nothing in the way of food and drink she had to keep ragnar strongspear and his men as content as possible until wulf ironfist returned cailin had absolutely no doubt that her husband would come and when he did he would regain caddawic no one was going to take this land from her from them she had been born here as had ten generations of her family they would live on through her children no one would take these lands from her again not ragnar strongspear not antonia porcius no one lady are you in the solar she heard ragnar strongspear calling up to her lady i would have you join us at table come down i am ill cailin answered him the excitement of today has been too much for me ragnar strongspear i must rest it has been but a short time since i gave birth to my son i am yet weak you would feel better lady if you ate it will help to build your strength up come down my little fox vixen i will feed you dainty morsels of meat from my own plate and give you sweet wine to ease your distress he told her in dulcet tones cailin smothered her giggles i think not ragnar strongspear i am best left alone she replied and then made a series of rather convincing noises to give the impression that she was retching and quite close to vomiting ohhhh she moaned sounding quite desperate perhaps you are better alone he agreed nervously and she heard him hastily moving away from below the solar door i will see you tomorrow lady nothing cailin thought with a mischievous grin discouraged a lustful man from his chosen path more than a woman threatening to disgorge the contents of her stomach in his lap she tore a chunk of bread from the loaf and sliced a wedge of cheese off the piece she had taken she washed them down with cool water from a pitcher and then sat down to work her tapestry when the light had faded from the sky so that she could no longer see what she was doing cailin sat quietly listening to the sounds from the hall below the men were growing drunk she could tell by the high hilarity the laughter and the singing occasionally she heard the sound of breaking crockery and was angered it was difficult obtaining good samienware now eventually however the din lessened and finally the hall grew silent satisfied that the intruders were sleeping a drunken sleep cailin arose and stretched she was exhausted with the tension involved in keeping a step ahead of ragnar strongspear with her very last bit of strength she shoved two storage chests over the solar door for extra protection the windows were much too narrow for anyone to get through she wondered what had happened to aelfa the bitch would have been the only woman in evidence tonight cailin removed her tunic dress and lay down in her bed space how long would it take wulf to return she wondered and then fell into an uneasy sleep she awoke automatically as she always did and arising went to the window to look out the sky was already growing light and she could see smoke coming from the bake house her breasts were full again and she once more expressed her milk cailin splashed water on her face relieved herself and quickly dressed pushing the chests away from the solar door she slipped the bolt silently opening the door she lowered the ladder to climb down into the hall about her she observed ragnar strongspear and his men sprawled in their drunken slumber there was absolutely no sign of aelfa but then the wench was no longer her concern the hall was a shambles of overturned benches and tables broken pottery and vomit cailin wrinkled her nose distastefully the rushes would have to be changed immediately the hall door had not been bolted and so she slipped out into the courtyard although the gates were barred she could see no one on duty hurrying to the bake house she entered and asked the baker where are the men there is no one in the yard i do not know lady the baker replied nervously i have not left the bake house since the intruders came i am safest here i think aye cailin agreed you are do not fear wulf ironfist will come soon and then these men will be driven from caddawic cailin left the bake house and hurried to the storage barn come out she called to the women servants it is morning and the invaders lie drunk in the hall it is safe now the women climbed up from the cellar beneath the barn and stood before their mistress she viewed them carefully two were young and very pretty they were still apt to be in danger but the others older and plainer would not be unless the men were very drunk and very randy she sent the two pretty maids to the bake house tell the baker you are to remain with him you should be safe if you stay there if any of ragnar strongspears men come in keep your heads down your eyes lowered and if you must look up twist your faces to look ugly it may be your only protection go now the yard is safe and empty our men seem to have disappeared the two girls ran off and cailin then told the remaining women go about your duties as you normally would if wulf ironfist does not come today then you must hide here again tonight i will not be able to come for you when the time is right you must help yourselves it is all i can do to stay out of ragnar strongspears clutches the trespasser and his men finally awoke and stumbled from the hall to relieve themselves cailin and her women swept the hall free of debris and all signs of sickness fresh rushes were laid mixed with fragrant herbs the morning meal was served but eaten by few before being cleared away ragnar sat at the high board a large goblet of wine gripped in his fist where are your men he demanded of cailin i do not know she said i thought perhaps that you had locked them up somewhere when i awoke this morning they were gone if they knew a means of escape i am angry at them that they did not take me with them she concluded and her irritated tone convinced him more than her words that she was speaking the truth he nodded very well i see your women have returned i sent them into safe keeping for the night cailin answered tartly i will have no rape or abuse of the women in my charge where is aelfa i have not seen your niece all morning she is to marry harald at lugh they are probably somewhere making the beast with two backs aelfa is a very passionate girl she has the morals of a mink cailin observed dryly aye she does ragnar said with a hearty laugh i have warned harald that she will make him a very bad wife but he is determined to have her so what can i do my brother has given his permission for the marriage i could not withhold mine the remainder of the day seemed to pass more slowly than any day she could remember as the sun began to set cailin was pleased to see that the women had all disappeared once again she hurried to reach the solar before ragnar strongspear could find and stop her her breasts were near to bursting with her milk and it was already leaking through her clothing once more quickly climbing the ladder she pulled it up behind her closing and bolting the door she shoved the clothing chests atop the door and sighed relieved stripping off her garments she reached for the basin and began to relieve herself of the pressure that was making her breasts ache so unbearably where was wulf if he didnt come soon her milk would finally run dry then she would have to give her precious royse to some other woman to nurse what are you doing the sound of ragnar strongspears voice rendered her icy with fear her eyes widened as he climbed from her bed space how did you get in here she demanded her heart was beating wildly i climbed the ladder he said simply and she silently cursed her stupidity that she had not hidden it what are you doing he repeated his dark blue eyes sweeping admiringly over her lush form it was then cailin recalled her state she was naked before this mans eyes but it was done and there was no helping it i must express the milk from my breasts she said as my son is not here to take its nourishment her voice was cold and emotionless a slow smile lit his face and moving to stand before her he clamped his big hands about her waist lifting her up he positioned her so that her breasts hung over his face then lowering her slightly he began to suckle upon her it was to cailins mind as great a violation of her body as if he had raped her which she knew he fully intended to do next dont she cried out anguished but it was as if she had never spoken she writhed desperately but the mouth on her breast could not be dislodged when he had drained the first breast he looked into her eyes with a smile i like the taste he told her it is said that if a man takes the milk of his lovers breasts he is rendered potent beyond any other man then his greedy mouth grasped her other breast and he began suckling hard on it when he had taken every drop she had to give he carried her to the bed space and threw her roughly upon the feather bed she watched horrified as he pulled his clothing off to match her state ive never had a completely naked woman he said cailin attempted to escape the bed space she was in a total panic ragnar laughed uproariously at her efforts holding her down with one hand he climbed atop her positioning himself upon her breasts open your mouth he commanded her and when she shook her head refusing he pinched her nose tightly until unable to breathe and starting to lose consciousness cailin gasped for air as she did so he thrust his organ into her mouth if you bite he warned her i will have every tooth in your head pulled out and she believed him suckle me my little fox vixen as nicely as i suckled you he ordered her she shook her head in the negative but he only smiled and reaching back found her little jewel with his fingers and began to pinch it cruelly cailin cried out with the pain and beaten began to comply with his desire ahh yes my little fox vixen he groaned as she stirred up his lust youre skilled beyond any ive ever known his eyes closed with his pleasure cailin stealthily moved her arms back over her head even as she continued to tease her captor with her tongue one hand began to surreptitiously feel beneath the feather bed in the straw she moved carefully slowly terrified that she might attract his attention to what she was doing where was it had he found it himself enough roared ragnar strongspear drawing his engorged organ from her mouth this randy fellow wants to seek his proper place he began to slide himself down her body so he might couple with her she couldnt find it cailins fingers sought desperately it had to be there she must delay him in his intent ohhh my lord she pleaded prettily with him will you not give me a bit of the same pleasure i have given you ohh please i must have it laughter rumbled up from his chest then you shall have your desire my russethaired little fox vixen i will not disappoint you yanking her legs apart he almost dove between them cailin attempted to block the feel of his wet tongue on her flesh frantic she dug into the straw beneath the feather bed and just when she was certain that he must have found it and removed it earlier her hand was sliced slightly by the blade she sought relief pouring through her cailin grasped the weapon ignoring the pain of her wound ohhh ohhh she cried remembering he would expect something of her for his obscene efforts oh it is good i am ready for you my lord wordless ragnar strongspear positioned himself ohh kiss me cailin cried to him and when he leaned forward to cover her mouth with his she plunged her knife several times into his back with a surprised grunt he rolled off of her onto his back he was wounded but not mortally so she saw bitch he growled at her youll pay for that cailin quickly straddled him grasped his head by the hair and yanking it back swiftly cut ragnar strongspears throat the look of total amazement in his eyes faded so rapidly that she wasnt even certain she had actually seen it she scrambled off of him and stood shivering staring down at the dead man not even sure he was really dead she was afraid for a long moment that he would jump up but no he was dead very dead she had killed ragnar strongspear she had killed a man cailin began to weep softly with relief when at last her sobs subsided she became aware of the fact that she was covered in blood his blood she shuddered with distaste and forcing herself to function moved across the solar poured water into a basin and washed washed washed until finally she was clean again being clean and having fresh garments seemed to help a little she avoided looking across the room to the bed space where ragnar strongspear lay sprawled in a widening pool of his own blood instead she sat down by her loom eventually dozing with exhaustion until the birds twittering excitedly in the predawn roused her starting awake cailin remembered what had happened the previous night what was she going to do when ragnars men discovered that she had killed their master and they certainly would they would kill her she would never see wulf and their children again nervous tears began to slide down her pale cheeks no she would not allow herself to be slaughtered like a frightened rabbit perhaps she could escape caddawic before ragnars body was discovered it was very early and no one was stirring in the hall she could climb down and then she would hide the ladder to the solar everyone would assume ragnar was sleeping off the excesses of his nights sport she would rouse the other women and together they would all slip through the gates on one pretext or another no it simply wouldnt work there were too many of them not to seem suspicious she couldnt leave the other women behind to face the violent wrath of ragnar strongspears men she would go and fetch the two girls hidden in the bake house they would join the other women beneath the grain storage barn yes that was a far better plan no one would find them there and surely wulf would come soon cailin pushed the chests from atop the door and sliding the bolt opened it and lowered the ladder before her drawing the door softly shut after her she swiftly descended into the hall where would she hide the ladder cailin wondered she would throw it down the well she could never go back into the solar again not after what had happened to her there last night a hand fell heavily upon her shoulder and unable to help herself cailin screamed softly with her terror lambkin it is i she whirled heart pounding and wulf ironfist stood before her beyond them in the hall ragnar strongspears men stood shackled and surrounded by their own people ohh wulf she sobbed collapsing with relief into his arms after a moment she stiffened and pulling away from him she queried how did you get into caddawic were the walls not manned by ragnar strongspears men we got in the same way our men got out the other night there is a small trapdoor in one of the gatehouses it leads to a narrow tunnel beneath our defenses lambkin i sent corio back for the men they departed the other night by means of that tunnel then they told me in detail of ragnar strongspears defenses we returned this dawning the same way and took back caddawic why did i not know of this tunnel cailin demanded outraged i had to hide our women in the cellar beneath the grain barns to keep them safe from these intruders why was i not told of it corio sent albert to look for you lambkin but you had disappeared albert had no choice but to go with the others wulf explained but cailin would not have any of it he might have told one of the women she insisted forgetting that she herself had hidden the women away for safetys sake i had to barricade myself in the solar to escape the unpleasant attentions of ragnar strongspear would you have had me wandering the hall playing the gracious hostess to that savage pig she was furious but you did not escape my uncle last night aelfa said meanly coming forward a nasty smile upon her beautiful face you look quite well considering the active night you must have had beneath my uncle i will kill him if he has touched you wulf ironfist said angrily i already have cailin told him bluntly and aelfa grew pale at her words he did not rape me my lord though he sought to do so how could you have killed so large a man lambkin her husband gently inquired was she truly all right he wondered i slit his throat cailin said tonelessly with what he asked the gods she was so pale the voice within would not stop nagging at me she began i do not know why i did it but when you departed to visit our villages i put a knife beneath the feather bed in our bed space when he climbed atop me i found it and i killed him there was so much blood wulf i can never sleep in that solar again ever she began to weep he comforted her as best he could and when she had ceased to sob he told her i have much news lambkin and it is good then seeing the darkling stain spreading across her tunic dress he cried out lambkin are you injured cailin looked down and laughed weakly i need royse she said my breasts are overflowing with my milk nellwyn will have him here shortly he promised her and put a loving arm about her aurora too how devoted you are to each other aelfa sneered but what is to become of us i should like to know her memory has returned i take it wulf said with a small attempt at humor they walked into the hall and seated themselves at the high board aelfa followed but positioned herself next to harald she never lost her memory cailin told him let me tell you a story that i learned as a child in ancient times a grecian king named menelaeus had a beautiful queen who was called helen the king was old but he loved his wife the queen however was young and she fell in love with a handsome youth paris they fled to his fathers city of troy a war between troy and several powerful grecian states erupted over the insult to menelaeus and his efforts to regain helen the beauteous queen troy however was considered impregnable enormous high walls surrounded it there was a goodly supply of fresh water and food for many years the greeks besieged it but they could not take the city finally they agreed to cease their war with troy and as a gesture of peace the departing greek armies left a magnificent large carved and decorated horse on wheels behind for the trojans the citizens of troy opened their gates and brought the horse into the city all day they celebrated their victory over menelaeus and his allies in the dark of the night when all lay sleeping the greek army which had secreted itself within the belly of the trojan horse came forth and took the city of troy showing no mercy all were killed and the city destroyed aelfa was ragnar strongspears trojan horse she allowed herself to be beaten and she pretended to have no knowledge of herself but her name so that she might gain our sympathies then she set about to fascinate and lure both our gatekeepers because she could not be certain which one of them would be on duty the night she intended to let her uncle and his men into caddawic albert and branhard told me what happened wulf said i have forgiven them both they have learned a valuable lesson by this he looked out over the hall at ragnars men now i must decide what to do with these men shall i kill them or show mercy mercy lord the men cried with one voice mercy cailin leaned over and whispered to her husband ragnars brother gunnar will think to profit from his brothers death but his daughter aelfa is i think ambitious she will want her uncles lands for harald who is to be her husband is there not some way in which we might set these men against each other if they are busy battling one another they will not have time to bother with us my lord and let us not forget our old friend antonia porcius those lands were hers before ragnar strongspear stormed across them i do not think antonia is ready to let go of her dreams for quintus the younger yet wulf grinned at his wife truly flavius aspar and byzantium lost a valuable strategist in you lambkin then he turned to his prisoners his look fierce ragnar strongspear is dead he told them harald swiftsword will you swear fealty to me if you do i will not oppose your taking of ragnar strongspears lands you are i think your masters natural heir his sons are too young to be strong neighbors what of my father aelfa demanded he is ragnars brother should he not inherit my uncles lands why would you want your father to have what your husband could have aelfa gunnarsdottar if harald does not claim ragnar strongspears lands for himself he will never have anything of his own if he is strong enough to hold them against your father why should you mind do you not desire to be a great lady i am strong enough to hold those lands for myself harald bragged loudly and turned to the other men are you with me he demanded and they cried their assent harald turned back to wulf ironfist then i will swear to be your man my lord and keep the peace between us aelfa what say you yes she said it was decided long ago between us harald and if i would take you landless i would certainly not reject you when you are about to become a great and propertied lord then said wulf ironfist i will free you all and they cheered him loudly ale was brought and a toast drunk to the peace between wulf ironfist and harald swiftsword then they prepared to march from the hall but wulf took harald aside and told him beware of the lady antonia the lands you now claim were her familys lands for many generations perhaps you might take her as a second wife to keep her from another man who might attempt to gain those lands through the woman i thank you for the advice harald replied it might not be such a bad idea ragnar always said she was badtempered but the best fuck he had ever had in his life under the circumstances i must either wed her or kill her ill think on it best to marry her wulf said she and aelfa will battle each other constantly and consequently keep out of your business harald laughed perhaps you are right he said slowly yes i know you are when they were gone and the morning was beginning to take on a more normal tone wulf took his wife by the hand and led her out into the summer sunlight they strolled together amid the ripening grain this incident has made me realize that we cannot remain at caddawic he told her it is too prone to attack here in its narrow valley the hills press too closely about us we cannot see our enemy until they are almost upon us i have ordered a new hall to be built at branddun for us it sits upon a hill and we cannot be taken unawares by an enemy we will continue to farm these fields and tend to the orchards that once belonged to your family but we will no longer live here lambkin will you mind very much cailin shook her head no she told him though i have many happy memories of the house in which i grew up it is gone the earth is drenched with my familys blood and now the blood of ragnar strongspear as well i do not think i could remain here even if you wanted me to my lord he nodded with understanding and she continued in my childhood the roads that the romans built to connect the towns they erected in britain became unsafe there was a time not in my memory but surely in my fathers memory when those roads were safe but then the legions left and with them the way of life we had known for centuries departed as well no one would have dared to attack the estate of gaius drusus corinium or anthony porcius in that faded past times are different now wulf and your people are a different people to survive we must change and i think we can do so without sacrificing the values that we hold dear you are not like ragnar strongspear or harald swiftsword you are a different kind of saxon your feet like mine are not mired in the intractable past you too dream of a future that cannot even be imagined by most i will gladly go with you to branddun there is nothing left for us here at caddawic but memories i will discard the bad ones and leave them behind the good ones i will carry in my heart always ohh wulf we almost lost each other once but the gods ruled that we should be reunited to love again i am so happy mama mama aurora came running through the fields toward them her silky golden hair flying her little legs pumping for all they were worth mama behind her nellwyn came carrying royse cailin swept her daughter up into her arms and covered the childs face with kisses i missed you my darling she told her daughter did you miss mama are the bad men gone mama aurora asked nervously they are gone forever and will never come back i promise you my daughter cailin answered the child hugging her when shall we leave for branddun wulf asked his wife his heart full with his love for this brave woman who was his mate today cailin said have our men take our things from the hall we will burn what we can of it and tear down what is left it is finished where are we going nellwyn asked as she came abreast of them cailin took royse from her servant praising her bravery then as she sat down upon the ground and put her son to her aching breasts wulf explained to nellwyn what had been decided when he had finished and while royse suckled greedily cailin said to her husband nellwyn must have a husband she desires albert will you arrange it my lord i will he said and gladly your loyalty saved our childrens lives nellwyn it is little enough repayment albert is a very lucky fellow and i shall tell him so wulf gave the order to empty the hall of their possessions and as it was being done he climbed to the solar ragnar strongspear lay spread upon his back naked and as white as a fishs belly there seemed to be blood everywhere gingerly wulf pulled the mans head back for it had fallen upon his chest his eyes were wide and sightless and there was a look of surprise on his face the gaping wound shocked him ragnar strongspears throat was deeply slashed from ear to ear how had she done it his delicate lambkin did not seem capable of such a savage act but he could not deny the evidence of his own eyes it was certainly a most mortal wound and hardly the sort of death a man would want to face at best a man died in battle at worst of old age in his bed to die at the hands of a frail woman was shameful there would be no valhalla for ragnar strongspear he would likely haunt this place forever cailin had been correct they could hardly sleep and make love in the place where ragnar had attempted to rape her and where she had killed him is the hall cleared yet he called down aye my lord a voice answered him we are ready to fire it hand me up a torch wulf ironside said we will start here when the torch was given to him he set fire to the bed space where ragnar strongspear lay then tossing the torch aside he climbed down into the hall and directed his men to set the rest of the building alight he exited the burning hall to find cailin awaiting him already mounted upon her mare aurora was seated before her mother and nellwyn was settled in the cart royse in her arms he looked at his wife and their eyes met in silent understanding he looked at his children and smiled aurora and royse and the children who would come after them were a bright future he no longer feared a dark destiny whatever happened the years ahead would be golden with their love and the hope of a better world to come mounting his stallion wulf ironfist smiled at his wife and cailin smiled back at him with his love to sustain her she thought she could face any obstacle and overcome it i love you she said softly and was thrilled when he responded i love you too lambkin together they rode away from the bleak past and into a shining tomorrow authors note the celtic tribes of britain faded into history as they intermingled their blood with that of the newcomers only in cornwall and wales could any strong evidence of them be found again in britain the saxons the jutes and the angles poured into britain in increasing numbers seeking land and a decent future for their peoples for the next six centuries their combined cultures spawned kingdoms with names like northumbria which combined bernicia and deira east anglia mercia kent essex sussex and wessex kings with names like albert ethelred edward aethelswith and edwin ruled britain became england the land of the angles then in the normans arrived to take england by conquest once more another culture combined and mingled itself and the blood of its people with that of those who had come before them this is the way of the world even today nothing remains the same ever i hope you have enjoyed to love again next year ballantine and i will bring you love remember me the story of nyssa wyndham the daughter of blaze and her many adventures in the court of henry viii and two of his queens the clever and witty anne of cleves and the charming but foolish catherine howard until then i wish you much good reading bertrice w small southold ny and
