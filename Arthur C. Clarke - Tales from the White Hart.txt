th street new york ny preface these stories were written in spurts and spasms between and at such diverse spots on the globe as new york miami colombo london sydney and various other locations whose names now escape me in some cases the geographical influence is obvious though curiously enough i had never visited australia when what goes up was written it seems to me that there is roomone might even say a long unfelt wantfor what might be called the tall sciencefiction story by this i mean stories that are intentionally unbelievable not as is too often the case unintentionally so at the same time i should hate to say exactly where the great divide of plausibility comes in these tales which range from the perfectly possible to the totally improbable in at least two cases science has practically caught up with me in the few years since i wrote these stories the technique described hi big game hunt has already been used on monkeys so there is no reason to suppose that it could not be adapted to other creatures for a more successful conclusion to this particular huntand the rest of the quotation from herman melvillei refer you to my novel the deep range it is in the field touched upon in patent pending however that the most hairraising discovery has been madea discovery which should stop anyone worrying about such minor menaces as the hydrogen bomb the first report of the work that may end our civilization will be found in james olds article pleasure centers in the brain briefly it has been found that an electric current flowing into a certain area in the brain of a rat can produce intense pleasure so much so in fact that when the rat learns that it can stimulate itself at will by pushing a little pedal it loses interest in anything elseeven in food i quote hungry rats ran faster to reach an electric stimulator than they did to reach food indeed a hungry animal often ignored available food in favor of the pleasure of stimulating itself electrically some rats stimulated their brains more than times per hour for consecutive hours the article concludes with these ominous words enough of the brainstimulating work has been repeated on monkeys to indicate that our general conclusions can very likely be generalized eventually to human beings with modifications of course of course for the record i believe the first writers to use the theme of patent pending were fletcher pratt and laurence manning back in the s and quite recently in the big ball of wax shepherd mead has given it a much more ribald treatment than mine i thought his book very funny before i read mr olds article you may still do so another item for which i cannot claim originality is the newspaper quotation in cold war it is perfectly genuine it may even have been true i must confess that having chosen the title of this volume some years ago i was a little disconcerted when sprague de camp and fletcher pratt brought out their tales from gavagans bar but as most of the odd goingson at mr cohans establishment are concerned with the supernatural i feel that there is plenty of room for both tavernsespecially as they are separated by the width of the atlantic finally a word to any readers of my more serious works who may be distressed to find me taking the universe so lightheartedly after my earlier preoccupation with such themes as the destiny of man and the exploration of space my only excuse is that for some years ive been irritated by critics who keep claiming that science fiction and humor are incompatible now they have a chance to prove it and shut up new york

leading down from fleet street to the embankment its no use telling you where it is very few people who have set out in a determined effort to get there have ever actually arrived for the first dozen visits a guide is essential after that youll probably be all right if you close your eyes and rely on instinct alsoto be perfectly frankwe dont want any more customers at least on our night the place is already uncomfortably crowded all that ill say about its location is that it shakes occasionally with the vibration of newspaper presses and that if you crane out of the window of the gents room you can just see the thames from the outside is looks like any other pubas indeed it is for five days of the week the public and saloon bars are on the ground floor there are the usual vistas of brown oak paneling and frosted glass the bottles behind the bar the handles of the beer engines nothing out of the ordinary at all indeed the only concession to the twentieth century is the juke box in the public bar it was installed during the war in a laughable attempt to make gis feel at home and one of the first things we did was to make sure there was no danger of its ever working again at this point i had better explain who we are that is not as easy as i thought it was going to be when i started for a complete catalogue of the white harts clients would probably be impossible and would certainly be excruciatingly tedious so all ill say at this point is that we fall into three main classes first there are the journalists writers and editors the journalists of course gravitated here from fleet street those who couldnt make the grade fled elsewhere the tougher ones remained as for the writers most of them heard about us from other writers came here for copy and got trapped where there are writers of course there are sooner or later editors if drew our landlord got a percentage on the literary business done in his bar hed be a rich man one of our wits once remarked that it was a common sight to see half a dozen indignant authors arguing with a hardfaced editor in one corner of the white hart while in another half a dozen indignant editors argued with a hardfaced author so much for the literary side you will have id better warn you ample opportunities for closeups later now let us glance briefly at the scientists how did they get in here well birkbeck college is only across the road and kings is just a few hundred yards along the strand thats doubtless part of the explanation and again personal recommendation had a lot to do with it also many of our scientists are writers and not a few of our writers are scientists confusing but we like it that way the third portion of our little microcosm consists of what may be loosely termed interested laymen they were attracted to the white hart by the general brouhaha and enjoyed the conversation and company so much that they now come along regularly every wednesday which is the day when we all get together sometimes they cant stand the pace and fall by the wayside but theres always a fresh supply with such potent ingredients it is hardly surprising that wednesday at the white hart is seldom dull not only have some remarkable stories been told there but remarkable things have happened there for example there was the time when professor passing through on his way to harwell left behind a briefcase containingwell wed better not go into that even though we did so at the time and most interesting it was too any russian agents will find me in the corner under the dartboard i come high but easy terms can be arranged now that ive finally thought of the idea it seems astonishing to me that none of my colleagues has ever got round to writing up these stories is it a question of being so close to the wood that they cant see the trees or is it lack of incentive no the last explanation hardly hold several of them are quite as hard up and have complained with equal bitterness about no credit rule my only fear as i type these words on my old remington noiseless is that john christopher or george whitley or john beynon are already hard at work using up the best material such as for instance the story of the fenton silencer i dont know when it began one wednesday is much like another and its hard to tag dates on to them besides people may spend a couple of months lost in the white hart crowd before you first notice their existence that had probably happened to harry purvis because when i first came aware of him he already knew the names of most of the people in our crowd which is more than i do these days now that i come to think of it but though i dont know when i know exactly how it all started bert huggins was the catalyst or to be more accurate his voice was berts voice would catalyze anything when he indulges in a confidential whisper it sounds like a sergeant major drilling an entire regiment and when he lets himself go conversation languishes elsewhere while we all wait for those cute little bones in the inner ear to resume their accustomed places he had just lost his temper with john christopher and the resulting detonation had disturbed the chess game in progress at the back of the saloon bar as usual the two players were surrounded by backseat drivers and we all looked up with a start as berts blast whammed overhead when the echoes died away someone said i wish there was a way of shutting him up it was then that harry purvis replied there is you know not recognizing the voice i looked round i saw a small neatlydressed man in the late thirties he was smoking one of those carved german pipes that always makes me think of cuckoo clocks and the black forest that was the only unconventional thing about him otherwise he might have been a minor treasury official all dressed up to go to a meeting of the public accounts committee i beg your pardon i said he took no notice but made some delicate adjustments to his pipe it was then that i noticed that it wasnt as id thought at first glance an elaborate piece of wood carving it was something much more sophisticateda contraption of metal and plastic like a small chemical engineering plant there were even a couple of minute valves my god it was a chemical engineering plant i dont goggle any more easily than the next man but i made no attempt to hide my curiosity he gave me a superior smile all for the cause of science its an idea of the biophysics lab they want to find out exactly what there is in tobacco smokehence these filters you know the old argumentdoes smoking cause cancer of the tongue and if so how the trouble is that it takes an awful lot of erdistillate to identify some of the obscurer byeproducts so we have to do a lot of smoking doesnt it spoil the pleasure to have all this plumbing in the way i dont know you see im just a volunteer i dont smoke oh i said for the moment that seemed the only reply then i remembered how the conversation had started you were saying i continued with some feeling for there was still a slight tinnitus in my left ear that there was some way of shutting up bert wed all like to hear itif that isnt mixing metaphors somewhat i was thinking he replied after a couple of experimental sucks and blows of the illfated fenton silencer a sad storyyet i feel one with an interesting lesson for us all and one daywho knowssomeone may perfect it and earn the blessings of the world suck bubble bubble plop well lets hear the story when did it happen he sighed im almost sorry i mentioned it still since you insistand of course on the understanding that it doesnt go beyond these walls erof course well rupert fenton was one of our lab assistants a very bright youngster with a good mechanical background but naturally not very well up in theory he was always making gadgets in his spare time usually the idea was good but as he was shaky on fundamentals the things hardly ever worked that didnt seem to discourage him i think he fancied himself as a latterday edison and imagined he could make his fortune from the radio tubes and other oddments lying around the lab as his tinkering didnt interfere with his work noone objected indeed the physics demonstrators did their best to encourage him because after all there is something refreshing about any form of enthusiasm but noone expected hed ever get very far because i dont suppose he could even integrate e to the x is such ignorance possible gasped someone maybe i exaggerate lets say x e to the x anyway all his knowledge was entirely practicalrule of thumb you know give him a wiring diagram however complicated and he could make the apparatus for you but unless it was something really simple like a television set he wouldnt understand how it worked the trouble was he didnt realize his limitations and that as youll see was most unfortunate i think he must have got the idea while watching the honours physics students doing some experiments in acoustics i take it of course that you all understand the phenomenon of interference naturally i replied hey said one of the chessplayers who had given up trying to concentrate on the game dont purvis looked at him as though seeing something that had no right to be around in a world that had invented penicillin in that case he said coldly i suppose i had better do some explaining he waved aside our indignant protests no i insist its precisely those who dont understand these things who need to be told about them if someone had only explained the theory to poor fenton while there was still time he looked down at the now thoroughly abashed chess player i do not know he began if you have ever considered the nature of sound suffice to say that it consists of a series of waves moving through the air not however waves like those on the surface of the seaoh dear no those waves are up and down movements sound waves consist of alternate compressions and rarefactions rarewhat rarefactions dont you mean rarefications i do not i doubt if such a word exists and if it does it shouldnt retorted purvis with the aplomb of sir alan herbert dropping a particularly revolting neologism into his killingbottle where was i explaining sound of course when we make any sort of noise from the faintest whisper to that concussion that went past just now a series of pressure changes moves through the air have you ever watched shunting engines at work on a siding you see a perfect example of the same kind of thing theres a long line of goodswagons all coupled together one end gets a bang the first two trucks move togetherand then you can see the compression wave moving right along the line behind it the reverse thing happensthe rarefaction i repeat rarefactionas the trucks separate again things are simple enough when there is only one source of soundonly one set of waves but suppose you have two wavepatterns moving in the same direction thats when interference arises and there are lots of pretty experiments in elementary physics to demonstrate it all we need worry about here is the factwhich i think you will all agree is perfectly obviousthat if one could get two sets of waves exactly out of step the total result would be precisely zero the compression pulse of one sound wave would be on top of the rarefaction of anothernet resultno change and hence no sound to go back to my analogy of the line of wagons its as if you gave the last truck a jerk and a push simultaneously nothing at all would happen doubtless some of you will already see what i am driving at and will appreciate the basic principle of the fenton silencer young fenton i imagine argued in this manner this world of ours he said to himself is too full of noise there would be a fortune for anyone who could invent a really perfect silencer now what would that imply it didnt take him long to work out the answer i told you he was a bright lad there was really very little in his pilot model it consisted of a microphone a special amplifier and a pair of loudspeakers any sound that happened to be about was picked up by the mike amplified and inverted so that it was exactly out of phase with the original noise then it was pumped out of the speakers the original wave and the new one cancelled out and the net result was silence of course there was rather more to it than that there had to be an arrangement to make sure that the canceling wave was just the right intensityotherwise you might be worse off than when you started but these are technical details that i wont bore you with as many of you will recognize its a simple application of negative feedback just a moment interrupted eric maine eric i should mention is an electronics expert and edits some television paper or other hes also written a radio play about spaceflight but thats another story just a moment theres something wrong here you couldnt get silence that way it would be impossible to arrange the phase purvis jammed the pipe back in his mouth for a moment there was an ominous bubbling and i thought of the first act of macbeth then he fixed eric with a glare are you suggesting he said frigidly that this story is untrue ahwell i wont go as far as that but erics voice trailed away as if he had been silenced himself he pulled an old envelope out of his pocket together with an assortment of resistors and condensers that seemed to have got entangled in his handkerchief and began to do some figuring that was the last we heard from him for some time as i was saying continued purvis calmly thats the way fentons silencer worked his first model wasnt very powerful and it couldnt deal with very high or very low notes the result was rather odd when it was switched on and someone tried to talk youd hear the two ends of the spectruma faint bats squeak and a kind of low nimble but he soon got over that by using a more linear circuit and in the later model he was able to produce complete silence over quite a large area not merely an ordinary room but a fullsized hall yes now fenton was not one of these secretive inventors who wont tell anyone what they are trying to do in case their ideas are stolen he was all too willing to talk he discussed his ideas with the staff and with the students whenever he could get anyone to listen it so happened that one of the first people to whom he demonstrated his improved silencer was a young arts student calledi thinkkendall who was taking physics as a subsidiary subject kendall was much impressed by the silencer as well he might be but he was not thinking as you may have imagined about its commercial possibilities or the boon it would bring to the outraged ears of suffering humanity oh dear no he had quite other ideas please permit me a slight digression at college we have a flourishing musical society which in recent years has grown in numbers to such an extent that it can now tackle the less monumental symphonies in the year of which i speak it was embarking on a very ambitious enterprise it was going to produce a new opera a work by a talented young composer whose name it would not be fair to mention since it is now wellknown to you all let us call him edward england ive forgotten the title of the work but it was one of these stark dramas of tragic love which for some reason ive never been able to understand are supposed to be less ridiculous with a musical accompaniment than without no doubt a good deal depends on the music i can still remember reading the synopsis while waiting for the curtain to go up and to this day have never been able to decide whether the libretto was meant seriously or not lets seethe period was the late victorian era and the main characters were sarah stampe the passionate postmistress walter partridge the saturnine gamekeeper and the squires son whose name i forget its the old story of the eternal triangle complicated by the villagers resentment of changein this case the new telegraph system which the local crones predict will do things to the cows milk and cause trouble at lambing time ignoring the frills its the usual drama of operatic jealousy the squires son doesnt want to marry into the post office and the gamekeeper maddened by his rejection plots revenge the tragedy rises to its dreadful climax when poor sarah strangled with parcel tape is found hidden in a mailbag in the dead letter department the villagers hang partridge from the nearest telegraph pole much to the annoyance of the linesmen he was supposed to sing an aria while he was being hung that is one thing i regret missing the squires son takes to drink or the colonies or both and thats that im sure youre wondering where all this is leading please bear with me for a moment longer the fact is that while this synthetic jealousy was being rehearsed the real thing was going on backstage fentons friend kendall had been spurned by the young lady who was to play sarah stampe i dont think he was a particularly vindictive person but he saw an opportunity for a unique revenge let us be frank and admit that college life does breed a certain irresponsibilityand in identical circumstances how many of us would have rejected the same chance i see the dawning comprehension on your faces but we the audience had no suspicion when the overture started on that memorable day it was a most distinguished gathering everyone was there from the chancellor downwards deans and professors were two a penny i never did discover how so many people had been bullied into coming now that i come to think of it i cant remember what i was doing there myself the overture died away amid cheers and i must admit occasional catcalls from the more boisterous members of the audience perhaps i do them an injustice they may have been the more musical ones then the curtain went up the scene was the village square at doddering sloughleigh circa enter the heroine reading the postcards in the mornings mail she comes across a letter addressed to the young squire and promptly bursts into song sarahs opening aria wasnt quite as bad as the overture but it was grim enough luckily we were to hear only the first few bars precisely we need not worry about such details as how kendall had talked the ingenuous fenton into it if indeed the inventor realised the use to which his device was being applied all i need say is that it was a most convincing demonstration there was a sudden deadening blanket of silence and sarah stampe just faded out like a tv programme when the sound is turned off everyone was frozen hi their seats while the singers lips went on moving silently then she too realised what had happened her mouth opened in what would have been a piercing scream in any other circumstances and she fled into the wings amid a shower of postcards thereafter the chaos was unbelievable for a few minutes everyone must have thought they had lost the sense of hearing but soon they were able to tell from the behavior of their companions that they were not alone in their deprivation someone in the physics department must have realised the truth fairly promptly for soon little slips of paper were circulating among the vips in the front row the vicechancellor was rash enough to try and restore order by signlanguage waving frantically to the audience from the stage by this time i was too sick with laughter to appreciate such fine details there was nothing for it but to get out of the hall which we all did as quickly as we could i think kendall had fledhe was so overcome by the effect of the gadget that he didnt stop to switch it off he was afraid of staying around in case he was caught and lynched as for fentonalas we shall never know his side of the story we can only reconstruct the subsequent events from the evidence that was left as i picture it he must have waited until the hall was empty and then crept in to disconnect his apparatus we heard the explosion all over the college the explosion someone gasped of course i shudder to think what a narrow escape we all had another dozen decibels a few more phons and it might have happened while the theatre was still packed regard it if you like as an example of the inscrutable workings of providence that only the inventor was caught in the explosion perhaps it was as well at least he perished in the moment of achievement and before the dean could get at him stop moralizing man what happened well i told you that fenton was very weak on theory if hed gone into the mathematics of the silencer hed have found his mistake the trouble is you see that one cant destroy energy not even when you cancel put one train of waves by another all that happens then is that the energy youve neutralized accumulates somewhere else its rather like sweeping up all the dirt in a roomat the cost of an unsightly pile under the carpet when you look into the theory of the thing youll find that fentons gadget wasnt a silencer so much as a collector of sound all the time it was switched on it was really absorbing sound energy and at that concert it was certainly going flat out youll understand what i mean if youve ever looked at one of edward englands scores on top of that of course there was all the noise the audience was makingor i should say was trying to make during the resultant panic the total amount of energy must have been terrific and the poor silencer had to keep on sucking it up where did it go well i dont know the circuit detailsprobably into the condensers of the power pack by the time fenton started to tinker with it again it was like a loaded bomb the sound of his approaching footsteps was the last straw and the overloaded apparatus could stand no more it blew up for a moment noone said a word perhaps as a token of respect for the late mr fenton then eric maine who for the last ten minutes had been muttering in the corner over his calculations pushed his way through the ring of listeners he held a sheet of paper thrust aggressively in front of him hey he said i was right all the time the thing couldnt work the phase and amplitude relations purvis waved him away thats just what ive explained he said patiently you should have been listening too bad that fenton found out the hard way he glanced at his watch for some reason he now seemed hi a hurry to leave my goodness tunes getting on one of these days remind me to tell you about the extraordinary thing we saw through the new proton microscope thats an even more remarkable story he was half way through the door before anyone else could challenge him then george whitley recovered his breath look here he said hi a perplexed voice how is it that we never heard about this business purvis paused on the threshold his pipe now burbling briskly as it got into its stride once more he glanced back over his shoulder there was only one thing to do he replied we didnt want a scandalde mortuis nil nisi bonum you know besides in the circumstances dont you think it was highly appropriate toahhush the whole business up and a very good night to you all big game hunt although by general consent harry purvis stands unrivalled among the white hart clientele as a purveyor of remarkable stories it must not be thought that his position has never been challenged there have even been occasions when he has gone into temporary eclipse since it is always entertaining to watch the discomfiture of an expert i must confess that i take a certain glee in recalling how professor hinckelberg disposed of harry on his own home ground many visiting americans pass through the white hart in the course of the year like the residents they are usually scientists or literary men and some distinguished names have been recorded hi the visitors book that drew keeps behind the bar sometimes the newcomers arrive under their own power diffidently introducing themselves as soon as they have the opportunity others arrive with letters of introduction and not a few are escorted hi by regular customers and then thrown to the wolves professor hinckelberg glided up one night in a vast fishtailed cadillac hed borrowed from the fleet hi grosvenor square heaven only knows how he had managed to insinuate it through the side streets that lead to the white hart but amazingly enough all the fenders seemed intact he was a large lean man with that henryfordwilburwright kind of face that usually goes with the slow taciturn speech of the suntanned pioneer it didnt in professor hinckelbergs case he could talk like an lp record on a turntable in about ten seconds wed discovered that he was a zoologist on leave of absence from a north virginia college that he was attached to the office of naval research on some project to do with plankton that he was tickled pink with london and even liked english beer that hed heard about us through a letter in science but couldnt believe we were true that stevenson was ok but if the democrats wanted to get back theyd better import winston that hed like to know what the heck was wrong with all our telephone call boxes and could he retrieve the small fortune in coppers of which they had mulcted him that there seemed to be a lot of empty glasses around and how about filling them up boys on the whole the professors shocktactics were well received but when he made a momentary pause for breath i thought to myself harryd better look out this guy can talk rings round him i glanced at purvis who was only a few feet away from me and saw that his lips were pursed into a slight frown i sat back luxuriously and awaited results as it was a fairly busy evening it was quite sometime before professor hinckelberg had been introduced to everybody harry usually so forward at meeting celebrities seemed to be keeping out of the way but eventually he was cornered by arthur vincent who acts as informal club secretary and makes sure that everyone signs the visitors book im sure you and harry will have a lot to talk about said arthur in a burst of innocent enthusiasm youre both scientists arent you and harrys had some most extraordinary things happen to him tell the professor about the time you found that u in your letterbox i dont think said harry a trifle too hastily that professorahhinckelberg wants to listen to my little adventure im sure he must have a lot to tell us ive puzzled my head about that reply a good deal since then it wasnt in character usually with an opening like this purvis was up and away perhaps he was seizing up the enemy waiting for the professor to make the first mistake and then swooping in to the kill if that was the explanation hed misjudged his man he never had a chance for professor hinckelberg made a jetassisted takeoff and was immediately in full flight odd you should mention that he said ive just been dealing with a most remarkable case its one of these things that cant be written up as a proper scientific paper and this seems a good tune to get it off my chest i cant often do that because of this darned securitybut so far noones gotten round to classifying dr grinnells experiments so ill talk about them while i can grinnell it seemed was one of the many scientists trying to interpret the behaviour of the nervous system in terms of electrical circuits he had started as grey walter shannon and others had done by making models that could reproduce the simpler actions of living creatures his greatest success in this direction had been a mechanical cat that could chase mice and could land on its feet when dropped from a height very quickly however he had branched off in another direction owing to his discovery of what he called neural induction this was to simplify it greatly nothing less than a method of actually controlling the behaviour of animals it had been known for many years that all the processes that take place in the mind are accompanied by the production of minute electric currents and for a long time it has been possible to record these complex fluctuations though their exact interpretation is still unknown grinnell had not attempted the intricate task of analysis what he had done was a good deal simpler though its achievement was still complicated enough he had attached his recording device to various animals and thus been able to build up a small library if one could call it that of electrical impulses associated with their behaviour one pattern of voltage might correspond to a movement to the right another with traveling in a circle another with complete stillness and so on that was an interesting enough achievement but grinnell had not stopped there by playing back the impulses he had recorded he could compel his subjects to repeat their previous actions whether they wanted to or not that such a thing might be possible in theory almost any neurologist would admit but few would have believed that it could be done in practice owing to the enormous complexity of the nervous system and it was true that grinnells first experiments were carried out on very low forms of life with relatively simple responses i saw only one of his experiments said hinckelberg there was a large slug crawling on a horizontal piece of glass and half a dozen tiny wires led from it to a control panel which grinnell was operating there were two dials that was alland by suitable adjustments he could make the slug move hi any direction to a layman it would have seemed a trivial experiment but i realised that it might have tremendous implications i remember telling grinnell that i hoped his device could never be applied to human beings id been reading orwells and i could just imagine what big brother would do with a gadget like this then being a busy man i forgot all about the matter for a year by the end of that time it seems grinnell had improved his apparatus considerably and had worked up to more complicated organisms though for technical reasons he had restricted himself to invertebrates he had now built up a substantial store of orders which he could then play back to his subjects you might think it surprising that such diverse creatures as worms snails insects crustaceans and so on would be able to respond to the same electrical commands but apparently that was the case if it had not been for dr jackson grinnell would probably have stayed working away in the lab for the rest of his life moving steadily up the animal kingdom jackson was a very remarkable manim sure you must have seen some of his films in many circles he was regarded as a publicityhunter rather than a real scientist and academic circles were suspicious of him because he had far too many interests hed led expeditions into the gobi desert up the amazon and had even made one raid on the antarctic from each of these trips he had returned with a bestselling book and a few miles of kodachrome and despite reports to the contrary i believe he had obtained some valuable scientific results even if they were slightly incidental i dont know how jackson got to hear of grinnells work or how he talked the other man into cooperating he could be very persuasive and probably dangled vast appropriations before grinnells eyesfor he was the sort of man who could get the ear of the trustees whatever happened from that moment grinnell became mysteriously secretive all we knew was that he was building a much larger version of his apparatus incorporating all the latest refinements when challenged he would squirm nervously and say were going big game hunting the preparations took another year and i expect that jacksonwho was always a hustlermust have been mighty impatient by the end of that time but at last everything was ready grinnell and all his mysterious boxes vanished in the general direction of africa that was jacksons work i suppose he didnt want any premature publicity which was understandable enough when you consider the somewhat fantastic nature of the expedition according to the hints with which he hadas we later discoveredcarefully mislead us all he hoped to get some really remarkable pictures of animals in their wild state using grinnells apparatus i found this rather hard to swallow unless grinnell had somehow succeeded hi linking his device to a radio transmitter it didnt seem likely that hed be able to attach his wires and electrodes to a charging elephant theyd thought of that of course and the answer seems obvious now sea water is a good conductor they werent going to africa at all but were heading out into the atlantic but they hadnt lied to us they were after big game all right the biggest game there is wed never have known what happened if their radio operator hadnt been chattering to an amateur friend over in the states from his commentary its possible to guess the sequence of events jacksons shipit was only a small yacht bought up cheaply and converted for the expeditionwas lyingto not far from the equator off the west coast of africa and over the deepest part of the atlantic grinnell was angling his electrodes had been lowered into the abyss while jackson waited impatiently with his camera they waited a week before they had a catch by that time tempers must have been rather frayed then one afternoon on a perfectly calm day grinnells meters started to jump something was caught in the sphere of influence of the electrodes slowly they drew up the cable until now the rest of the crew must have thought them mad but everyone must have shared their excitement as the catch rose up through all those thousands of feet of darkness until it broke surface who can blame the radio operator if despite jacksons orders he felt an urgent need to talk things over with a friend back on the safety of dry land i wont attempt to describe what they saw because a master has done it before me soon after the report came in i turned up my copy of moby dick and reread the passage i can still quote it from memory and dont suppose ill ever forget it this is how it goes more or less a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length of a glancing creamcolour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to catch at any hapless object within reach yes grinnell and jackson had been after the largest and most mysterious of all living creaturesthe giant squid largest almost certainly bathyteuthis may grow up to a hundred feet long hes not as heavy as the sperm whales who dine upon him but hes a match for them in length so here they were with this monstrous beast that no human being had ever before seen under such ideal conditions it seems that grinnell was calmly putting it through its paces while jackson ecstatically shot off yards of film there was no danger though it was twice the size of their boat to grinnell it was just another mollusc that he could control like a puppet by means of his knobs and dials when he had finished he would let it return to its normal depths and it could swim away again though it would probably have a bit of a hangover what one wouldnt give to get hold of that film altogether apart from its scientific interest it would be worth a fortune in hollywood you must admit that jackson knew what he was doing hed seen the limitations of grinnells apparatus and put it to its most effective use what happened next was not his fault professor hinckelberg sighed and took a deep draught of beer as if to gather strength for the finale of his tale no if anyone is to blame its grinnell or i should say it was grinnell poor chap perhaps he was so excited that he overlooked a precaution he would undoubtedly have taken in the lab how otherwise can you account for the fact that he didnt have a spare fuse handy when the one in the power supply blew out and you cant really blame bathyteuthis either wouldnt you have been a little annoyed to be pushed about like this and when the orders suddenly ceased and you were your own master again youd take steps to see it remained that way i sometimes wonder though if jackson stayed fuming to the very end patent pending there are no subjects that have not been discussed at some time or other in the saloon bar of the white hart and whether or not there are ladies present makes no difference whatsoever after all they came in at their own risk three of them now i come to think of it have eventually gone out again with husbands so perhaps the risk isnt on their side at all i mention this because i would not like you to think that all our conversations are highly erudite and scientific and our activities purely cerebral though chess is rampant darts and shovehapenny also flourish the times literary supplement the saturday review the new statesman and the atlantic monthly may be brought in by some of the customers but the same people are quite likely to leave with the latest issue of staggering stories of pseudoscience a great deal of business also goes on in the obscurer corners of the pub copies of antique books and magazines frequently change hands at astronomical prices and on almost any wednesday at least three wellknown dealers may be seen smoking large cigars as they lean over the bar swapping stories with drew from time to time a vast guffaw announces the denouement of some anecdote and provokes a flood of anxious enquiries from patrons who are afraid they may have missed something but alas delicacy forbids that i should repeat any of these interesting tales here unlike most things in this island they are not for export luckily no such restrictions apply to the tales of mr harry purvis bsc phd frs none of them would bring a blush to the cheeks of the most delicately nurtured maiden aunts should any still survive in these days i must apologize this is too sweeping a statement there was one story which might in some circles be regarded as a little daring yet i do not hesitate to repeat it for i know that you dear reader will be sufficiently broadminded to take no offence it started in this fashion a celebrated fleet street reviewer had been pinned into a corner by a persuasive publisher who was about to bring out a book of which he had high hopes it was one of the riper productions of the deep and decadent southa prime example of the andthenthehousegaveanotherlurchasthetermitesfinishedtheeastwing school of fiction eire had already banned it but that is an honour which few books escape nowadays and certainly could not be considered a distinction however if a leading british newspaper could be induced to make a stern call for its suppression it would become a bestseller overnight such was the logic of its publisher and he was using all his wiles to induce cooperation i heard him remark apparently to allay any scruples his reviewer friend might have of course not if they can understand it they cant be corrupted any further and then harry purvis who has an uncanny knack of following hah a dozen conversations simultaneously so that he can insert himself in the right one at the right time said in his peculiarly penetrating and noninterruptable voice censorship does raise some very difficult problems doesnt it ive always argued that theres an inverse correlation between a countrys degree of civilization and the restraints it puts on its press a new england voice from the back of the room cut in on that argument paris is a more civilized place than boston precisely answered purvis for once he waited for a reply ok said the new england voice mildly im not arguing i just wanted to check to continue said purvis wasting no more time in doing so im reminded of a matter which has not yet concerned the censor but which will certainly do so before long it began in france and so far has remained there when it does come out into the open it may have a greater impact on our civilization than the atom bomb like the atom bomb it arose out of equally academic research never gentlemen underestimate science i doubt if there is a single field of study so theoretical so remote from what is laughingly called everyday life that it may not one day produce something that will shake the world you will appreciate that the story i am telling you is for once in a while secondhand i got it from a colleague at the sorbonne last year while i was over there at a scientific conference so the names are all fictitious i was told them at the tune but i cant remember them now professorahjulian was an experimental physiologist at one of the smaller but less impecunious french universities some of you may remember that rather unlikely tale we heard here the other week from that fellow hinckelberg about his colleague whod learned how to control the behaviour of animals through feeding the correct currents into their nervous systems well if there was any truth in that storyand frankly i doubt itthe whole project was probably inspired by julians papers in complex rendus professor julian however never published his most remarkable results when you stumble on something which is really terrific you dont rush into print you wait until you have overwhelming evidenceunless youre afraid that someone else is hot on the track then you may issue an ambiguous report that will establish your priority at a later date without giving too much away at the moment like the famous cryptogram that huygens put out when he detected the rings of saturn you may well wonder what julians discovery was so i wont keep you in suspense it was simply the natural extension of what man has been doing for the last hundred years first the camera gave us the power to capture scenes then edison invented the phonograph and sound was mastered today in the talking film we have a kind of mechanical memory which would be inconceivable to our forefathers but surely the matter cannot rest there eventually science must be able to catch and store thoughts and sensations themselves and feed them back into the mind so that whenever it wishes it can repeat any experience in life down to its minutest detail thats an old idea snorted someone see the feelies in brave new world all good ideas have been thought of by somebody before they are realised said purvis severely the point is that what huxley and others had talked about julian actually did my goodness theres a pun there aldous julianoh let it pass it was done electronically of course you all know how the encephalograph can record the minute electrical impulses in the living brainthe socalled brain waves as the popular press calls them julians device was a much subtler elaboration of this wellknown instrument and having recorded cerebral impulses he could play them back again it sounds simple doesnt it so was the phonograph but it took the genius of edison to think of it and now enter the villain well perhaps thats too strong a word for professor julians assistant georges georges dupinis really quite a sympathetic character it was just that being a frenchman of a more practical turn of mind than he professor he saw at once that there were some milliards of francs involved in this laboratory toy the first thing was to get it out of the laboratory the french have an undoubted flair for elegant engineering and after some weeks of workwith the full cooperation of the professorgeorges had managed to pack the playback side of the apparatus into a cabinet no larger than a television set and containing not very many more parts then georges was ready to make his first experiment it would involve considerable expense but as someone so rightly remarked you cannot make omelets without breaking eggs and the analogy is if i may say so an exceedingly apt one for georges went to see the most famous gourmet in france and made an interesting proposition it was one that the great man could not refuse because it was so unique a tribute to his eminence georges explained patiently that he had invented a device for registering sensations in the cause of science and for the honour of the french cuisine could he be privileged to analyse the emotions the subtle nuances of gustatory discrimination that took place in monsieur le barons mind when he employed his unsurpassed talents monsieur could name the restaurant the chef and the menueverything would be arranged for his convenience of course if he was too busy no doubt that wellknown epicure le compte de the baron who was in some respects a surprisingly coarse man uttered a word not to be found in most french dictionaries that cretin he exploded he would be happy on english cooking no shall do it and forthwith he sat down to compose the menu while georges anxiously estimated the cost of the items and wondered if his bank balance would stand the strain it would be interesting to know what the chef and the waiters thought about the whole business there was the baron seated at his favorite table and doing full justice to his favorite dishes not in the least inconvenienced by the tangle of wires that trailed from his head to that diabolicallooking machine in the corner the restaurant was empty of all other occupants for the last thing georges wanted was premature publicity this had added very considerably to the already distressing cost of the experiment he could only hope that the results would be worth it they were the only way of proving that of course would be to play back georges recording we have to take his word for it since the utter inadequacy of words in such matters is all too wellknown the baron was a genuine connoisseur not one of those who merely pretend to powers of discrimination they do not possess you know thurbers only a naive domestic burgundy but i think youll admire its presumption the baron would have known at the first sniff whether it was domestic or not and if it had been presumptuous hed have smacked it down i gather that georges had his moneys worth out of that recording even though he had not intended it merely for personal use it opened up new worlds to him and clarified the ideas that had been forming in his ingenious brain there was no doubt about it all the exquisite sensations that had passed through the barons mind during the consumption of that lucullan repast had been captured so that anyone else however untrained they might be in such matters could savor them to the full for you see the recording dealt purely with emotions intelligence did not come into the picture at all the baron needed a lifetime of knowledge and training before he could experience these sensations but once they were down on tape anyone even if hi real life they had no sense of taste at all could take over from there think of the glowing vistas that opened up before georges eyes there were other meals other gourmets there were the collected impressions of all the vintages of europewhat would connoisseurs not pay for them when the last bottle of a rare wine had been broached its incorporeal essence could be preserved as the voice of melba can travel down the centuries for after all it was not the wine itself that mattered but the sensations it evoked so mused georges but this he knew was only a beginning the french claim to logic i have often disputed but in georges case it cannot be denied he thought the matter over for a few days then he went to see his petite dame yvonne ma cheri he said i have a somewhat unusual request to make of you harry purvis knew when to break off in a story he turned to the bar and called another scotch drew noone said a word while it was provided to continue said purvis at length the experiment unusual though it was even in france was successfully carried out as both discretion and custom demanded all was arranged hi the lonely hours of the night you will have gathered already that georges was a persuasive person though i doubt if mamselle needed much persuading stifling her curiosity with a sincere but hasty kiss georges saw yvonne out of the lab and rushed back to his apparatus breathlessly he ran through the playback it workednot that he had ever had any real doubts moreoverdo please remember i have only my informants word for thisit was indistinguishable from the real thing at that moment something approaching religious awe overcame georges this was without a doubt the greatest invention in history he would be immortal as well as wealthy for he had achieved something of which all men had dreamed and had robbed old age of one of its terrors he also realised that he could now dispense with yvonne if he so wished this raised implications that would require further thought much further thought you will of course appreciate that i am giving you a highly condensed account of events while all this was going on georges was still working as a loyal employee of the professor who suspected nothing as yet indeed georges had done little more than any research worker might have in similar circumstances his performances had been somewhat beyond the call of duty but could all be explained away if need be the next step would involve some very delicate negotiations and the expenditure of further hardwon francs georges now had all the material he needed to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that he was handling a very valuable commercial property there were shrewd business men in paris who would jump at the opportunity yet a certain delicacy for which we must give him full credit restrained georges from using his seconderrrecording as a sample of the wares his machine could purvey there was no way of disguising the personalities involved and georges was a modest man besides he argued again with great good sense when the gramophone company wishes to make a disque it does not enregister the performance of some amateur musician that is a matter for professionals and so ma joi is this whereupon after a further call at his bank he set forth again for paris he did not go anywhere near the place pigalle because that was full of americans and prices were accordingly exorbitant instead a few discreet enquiries and some understanding cabdrivers took him to an almost oppressively respectable suburb where he presently found himself in a pleasant waiting room by no means as exotic as might have been supposed and there somewhat embarrassed georges explained his mission to a formidable lady whose age one could have no more guessed than her profession used though she was to unorthodox requests this was something she had never encountered in all her considerable experience but the customer was always right as long as he had the cash and so in due course everything was arranged one of the young ladies and her boy friend an apache of somewhat overwhelming masculinity traveled back with georges to the provinces at first they were naturally somewhat suspicious but as georges had already found no expert can ever resist flattery soon they were all on excellent terms hercule and susette promised georges that they would give him every cause for satisfaction no doubt some of you would be glad to have further details but you can scarcely expect me to supply them all i can say is that georgesor rather his instrument was kept very busy and that by the morning little of the recording material was left unused for it seems that hercule was indeed appropriately named when this piquant episode was finished georges had very little money left but he did possess two recordings that were quite beyond price once more he set off to paris where with practically no trouble he came to terms with some businessmen who were so astonished that they gave him a very generous contract before coming to their senses i am pleased to report this because so often the scientist emerges second best in his dealings with the world of finance im equally pleased to record that georges had made provision for professor julian in the contract you may say cynically that it was after all the professors invention and that sooner or later georges would have had to square him but i like to think that there was more to it than that the full details of the scheme for exploiting the device are of course unknown to me i gather that georges had been expansively eloquentnot that much eloquence was needed to convince anyone who had once experienced one or both of his playbacks the market would be enormous unlimited the export trade alone could put france on her feet again and would wipe out her dollar deficit overnightonce certain snags had been overcome everything would have to be managed through somewhat clandestine channels for think of the hubbub from the hypocritical anglosaxons when they discovered just what was being imported into their countries the mothers union the daughters of the american revolution the housewives league and all the religious organizations would rise as one the lawyers were looking into the matter very carefully and as far as could be seen the regulations that still excluded tropic of capricorn from the mails of the englishspeaking countries could not be applied to this casefor the simple reason that noone had thought of it but there would be such a shout for new laws that parliament and congress would have to do something so it was best to keep under cover as long as possible in fact as one of the directors pointed out if the recordings were banned so much the better they could make much more money on a smaller output because the price would promptly soar and all the vigilance of the customs officials couldnt block every leak it would be prohibition all over again you will scarcely be surprised to hear that by this time georges had somewhat lost interest in the gastronomical angle it was an interesting but definitely minor possibility of the invention indeed this had been tacitly admitted by the directors as they drew up the articles of association for they had included the pleasures of the cuisine among subsidiary rights georges returned home with his head in the clouds and a substantial check in his pocket a charming fancy had struck his imagination he thought of all the trouble to which the gramophone companies had gone so that the world might have the complete recordings of the fortyeight preludes and fugues or the nine symphonies well his new company would put out a complete and definite set of recordings performed by experts versed in the most esoteric knowledge of east and west how many opus numbers would be required that of course had been a subject of profound debate for some thousands of years the hindu textbooks georges had heard got well into three figures it would be a most interesting research combining profit with pleasure in an unexampled manner he had already begun some preliminary studies using treatises which even in paris were none too easy to obtain if you think that while all this was going on georges had neglected his usual interests you are all too right he was working literally night and day for he had not yet revealed his plans to the professor and almost everything had to be done when the lab was closed and one of the interests he had had to neglect was yvonne her curiosity had already been aroused as any girls would have been but now she was more than intrigued she was distracted for georges had become so remote and cold he was no longer in love with her it was a result that might have been anticipated publicans have to guard against the danger of sampling their own wares too oftenim sure you dont drewand georges had fallen into this seductive trap he had been through that recording too many times with somewhat debilitating results moreover poor yvonne was not to be compared with the experienced and talented susette it was the old story of the professional versus the amateur all that yvonne knew was that georges was in love with someone else that was true enough she suspected that he had been unfaithful to her and that raises profound philosophical questions we can hardly go into here this being france in case you had forgotten the outcome was inevitable poor georges he was working late one night at the lab as usual when yvonne finished him off with one of those ridiculous ornamental pistols which are de rigeur for such occasions let us drink to his memory thats the trouble with all your stories said john beynon you tell us about wonderful inventions and then at the end it turns out that the discoverer was killed so noone can do anything about it for i suppose as usual the apparatus was destroyed but no replied purvis apart from georges this is one of the stories that has a happy ending there was no trouble at all about yvonne of course georges grieving sponsors arrived on the scene with great speed and prevented any adverse publicity being men of sentiment as well as men of business they realised that they would have to secure yvonnes freedom they promptly did this by playing the recording to le maire and le prefet thus convincing them that the poor girl had experienced irresistible provocation a few shares in the new company clinched the deal with expressions of the utmost cordiality on both sides yvonne even got her gun back then when began someone else ah these things take time theres the question of mass production you know its quite possible that distribution has already commenced through privatevery privatechannels some of those dubious little shops and notice boards around leicester square may soon start giving hints of course said the new england voice disrespectfully you wouldnt know the name of the company you cant help admiring purvis at tunes like this he scarcely hesitated le societe anonyme daphrodite he replied and ive just remembered something that will cheer you up they hope to get round your sticky mails regulations and establish themselves before the inevitable congressional enquiry starts theyre opening up a branch in nevada apparently you can still get away with anything there he raised his glass to georges dupin he said solemnly martyr to science remember him when the fireworks start and one other thing yes we all asked better start saving now and sell your tv sets before the bottom drops out of the market armaments race as ive remarked on previous occasions noone has ever succeeded in pinningdown harry purvis prize raconteur of the white hart for any length of time of his scientific knowledge there can be no doubtbut where did he pick it up and what justification is there for the terms of familiarity with which he speaks of so many fellows of the royal society there are it must be admitted many who do not believe a single word he says that i feel is going a little too far as i recently remarked somewhat forcibly to bill temple youre always gunning for harry i said but you must admit that he provides entertainment and thats more than most of us can say if youre being personal retorted bill still rankling over the fact that some perfectly serious stories had just been returned by an american editor on the grounds that they hadnt made him laugh step outside and say that again he glanced through the window noticed that it was still snowing hard and hastily added not today then but maybe sometime in the summer if were both here on the wednesday that catches it have another of your favourite shots of straight pineapple juice thanks i said one day ill ask for a gin with it just to shake you i think i must be the only guy in the white hart who can take it or leave itand leaves it this was as far as the conversation got because the subject of the discussion then arrived normally this would merely have added fuel to the controversy but as harry had a stranger with him we decided to be polite little boys hello folks said harry meet my friend solly blumberg best special effects man in hollywood lets be accurate harry said mr blumberg sadly in a voice that should have belonged to a whipped spaniel not in hollywood out of hollywood harry waved the correction aside all the better for you sols come over here to apply his talents to the british film industry there is a british film industry said solly anxiously noone seemed very sure round the studio sure there is its in a very flourishing condition too the government piles on an entertainments tax that drives it to bankruptcy then keeps it alive with whacking big grants thats the way we do things in this country hey drew wheres the visitors book and a double for both of us sollys had a terrible timehe needs a bit of building up i cannot say that apart from his hangdog look mr blumberg had the appearance of a man who had suffered extreme hardships he was neatly dressed in a hart schaffner and marx suit and the points of his shirt collar buttoned down somewhere around the middle of his chest that was thoughtful of them as they thus concealed something but not enough of his tie i wondered what the trouble was not unamerican activities again i prayed that would trigger off our pet communist who at the moment was peaceably studying a chessboard in the corner we all made sympathetic noises and john said rather pointedly maybe itll help to get it off your chest it will be such a change to hear someone else talking around here dont be so modest john cut in harry promptly im not tired of hearing you yet but i doubt if solly feels much like going through it again do you old man no said mr blumberg you tell them where shall i begin asked harry the time lillian ross came to interview you anywhere but there shuddered solly it really started when we were making the first captain zoom serial captain zoom said someone ominously those are two very rude words hi this place dont say you were responsible for that unspeakable rubbish now boys put hi harry in his best oilontroubledwaters voice dont be too harsh we cant apply our own high standards of criticism to everything and people have got to earn a living besides millions of kids like captain zoom surely you wouldnt want to break their little heartsand so near xmas too if they really liked captain zoom id rather break their little necks such unseasonable sentiments i really must apologise for some of my compatriots solly lets see what was the name of the first serial captain zoom and the menace from mars ah yes thats right incidentally i wonder why we always are menaced by mars i suppose that man wells started it one day we may have a big interplanetary libel action on our handsunless we can prove that the martians have been equally rude about us im very glad to say that i never saw menace from mars but we are not concerned with the story such as it was that was written by three men in a bar on wilshire boulevard noone is sure whether the menace came out the way it did because the script writers were drunk or whether they had to keep drunk in order to face the menace if thats confusing dont bother all that solly was concerned with were the special effects that the director demanded first of all he had to build mars to do this he spent half an hour with the conquest of space and then emerged with a sketch which the carpenters turned into an overripe orange floating in nothingness with an improbable number of stars around it that was easy the martian cities werent so simple you try and think of completely alien architecture that still makes sense i doubt if its possibleif it will work at all someones already used it here on earth what the studio finally built was vaguely byzantine with touches of frank lloyd wright the fact that none of the doors led anywhere didnt really matter as long as there was enough room on the sets for the swordplay and general acrobatics that the script demanded yesswordplay here was a civilization which had atomic power deathrays spaceships television and suchlike modern conveniences but when it came to a fight between captain zoom and the evil emperor klugg the clock went back a couple of centuries a lot of soldiers stood round holding deadlylooking rayguns but they never did anything with them well hardly ever sometimes a shower of sparks would chase captain zoom and singe his pants but that was all i suppose that as the rays couldnt very well move faster than light he could always outrun them still those ornamental rayguns gave everyone quite a few headaches its funny how hollywood will spend endless trouble on some minute detail in a film which is complete rubbish the director of captain zoom had a thing about rayguns solly designed the mark i that looked like a cross between a bazooka and a blunderbus he was quite satisfied with it and so was the directorfor about a day and then the great man came raging into the studio carrying a revolting creation of purple plastic with knobs and lenses and levers look it this solly he puffedjunior got it down at the supermarkettheyre being given away with packets of crunch collect ten lids and you get one hell theyre better than ours and they work he pressed a lever and a thin stream of water shot across the set and disappeared behind captain zooms spaceship where it promptly extinguished a cigarette that had no right to be burning there an angry stagehand emerged through the airlock saw who it was had drenched him and swiftly retreated muttering things about his union solly examined the raygun with annoyance and yet with an experts discrimination yes it was certainly much more impressive than anything hed put out he retired into his office and promised to see what he could do about it the mark ii had everything built into it including a television screen if captain zoom was suddenly confronted by a charging hickoderm all he had to do was to switch on the set wait for the tubes to warm up check the channel selector adjust the fine tuning touch up the focus twiddle with the line and frame holdsand then press the trigger he was fortunately a man of unbelievably swift reactions the director was impressed and the mark ii went into production a slightly different model the mark ila was built for the emperor kluggs diabolical cohorts it would never do of course if both sides had the same weapon i told you that pandemic productions were sticklers for accuracy all went well until the first rushes and even beyond while the cast was acting if you can use that word they had to point the guns and press the triggers as if something was really happening the sparks and flashes however were put on the negative later by two little men hi a darkroom about as well guarded as fort knox they did a good job but after a while the producer again felt twinges in his overdeveloped artistic conscience solly he said toying with the plastic horror which had reached junior by courtesy of crunch the succulent cerealnot a burp in a barrelsolly i still want a gun that does something solly ducked in time so the jet went over his head and baptised a photograph of louella parsons youre not going to start shooting all over again he wailed nooo replied the producer with obvious reluctance well have to use what weve got but it looks faked somehow he ruffled through the script on his desk then brightened up now next week we start on episode slaves of the slugmen well the slugmen gotta have guns so what id like you to do is this the mark iii gave solly a lot of trouble not only had it to be a completely new design but as youll have gathered it had to do something this was a challenge to sollys ingenuity however if i may borrow from professor toynbee it was a challenge that evoked the appropriate response some highpowered engineering went into the mark iii luckily solly knew an ingenious technician whod helped him out on similar occasions before and he was really the man behind it the principle was to use a jet of ah produced by a small but extremely powerful electric fan and then to spray finely divided powder into it when the thing was adjusted correctly it shot out a most impressive beam and made a still more impressive noise the actors were so scared of it that their performances became most realistic the producer was delightedfor a full three days then a dreadful doubt assailed him solly he said those damn guns are too good the slugmen can beat the pants off captain zoom well have to give him something better it was at this point that solly realised what had happened he had become involved in an armaments race lets see this brings us to the mark iv doesnt it how did that workoh yes i remember it was a glorified oxyacetylene burner with various chemicals injected into it to produce the most beautiful flames i should have mentioned that from episode doom on deimos the studio had switched over from black and white to murkicolor and great possibilities were thus opened up by squirting copper or strontium or barium into the jet you could get any colour you wanted if you think that by this time the producer was satisfied you dont know hollywood some cynics may still laugh when the motto ars gratia artis flashes on the screen but this attitude i submit is not in accordance with the facts would such old fossils as michaelangelo rembrandt or titian have spent so much time effort and money on the quest for perfection as did pandemic productions i think not i dont pretend to remember all the marks that solly and his ingenious engineer friend produced during the course of the serial there was one that shot out a stream of coloured smokerings there was the highfrequency generator that produced enormous but quite harmless sparks there was a particularly ingenious curved beam produced by a jet of water with light reflected along inside it which looked most spectacular in the dark and finally there was the mark mark said mr blumberg of coursehow stupid of me what other number could it have been the mark was not actually a portable weaponthough some of the others were portable only by a considerable stretch of the imagination it was the diabolical device to be installed on phobos in order to subjugate earth though solly has explained them to me once the scientific principles involved escape my simple mind however who am i to match my brains against the intellects responsible for captain zoom i can only report what the ray was supposed to do not how it did it it was to start a chain reaction in the atmosphere of our unfortunate planet making the nitrogen and the oxygen in the air combinewith highly deleterious effects to terrestrial life im not sure whether to be sorry or glad that solly left all the details of the fabulous mark to his talented assistant though ive questioned him at some length all he can tell me is that the thing was about six feet high and looked like a cross between the inch telescope and an antiaircraft gun thats not very helpful is it he also says that there were a lot of radio tubes in the brute as well as a thundering great magnet and it was definitely supposed to produce a harmless but impressive electric arc which could be distorted into all sorts of interesting shapes by the magnet that was what the inventor said and despite everything there is still no reason to disbelieve nun by one of those mischances that later turns out to be providential solly wasnt at the studio when they tried out the mark to his great annoyance he had to be down in mexico that day and wasnt that lucky for you solly he was expecting a longdistance call from one of his friends in the afternoon but when it came through it wasnt the kind of message hed anticipated the mark had been to put it mildly a success noone knew exactly what had happened but by a miracle no lives had been lost and the fire department had been able to save the adjoining studios it was incredible yet the facts were beyond dispute the mark was supposed to be a phony deathrayand it had turned out to be a real one something had emerged from the projector and gone through the studio wall as if it wasnt there indeed a moment later it wasnt there was just a great big hole beginning to smoulder round the edges and then the roof fell in unless solly could convince the fbi that it was all a mistake hed better stay the other side of the border even now the pentagon and the atomic energy commission were converging upon the wreckage what would you have done in sollys shoes he was innocent but how could he prove it perhaps he would have gone back to face the music if he hadnt remembered that hed once hired a man whod campaigned for henry wallace back in that might take some explaining away besides solly was a little tired of captain zoom so here he is anyone know of a british film company that might have an opening for him but historical films only please he wont touch anything more uptodate than crossbows critical mass did i ever tell you said harry purvis modestly about the time i prevented the evacuation of southern england you did not said charles willis or if you did i slept through it well then continued harry when enough people had gathered round him to make a respectable audience it happened two years ago at the atomic energy research establishment near clobham you all know the place of course but i dont think ive mentioned that i worked there for a while on a special job i cant talk about that makes a nice change said john wyndham without the slightest effect it was on a saturday afternoon harry began a beautiful day in late spring there were about six of us scientists in the bar of the black swan and the windows were open so that we could see down the slopes of clobham hill and out across the country to upchester about thirty miles away it was so clear in fact that we could pick out the twin spires of upchester cathedral on the horizon you couldnt have asked for a more peaceful day the staff from the establishment got on pretty well with the locals though at first they werent at all happy about having us on their doorsteps apart from the nature of our work theyd believed that scientists were a race apart with no human interests when wed beaten them up at darts a couple of times and bought a few drinks they changed their minds but there was still a certain amount of halfserious legpulling and we were always being asked what we were going to blow up next on this afternoon there should have been several more of us present but thered been a rush job in the radioisotopes division and so we were below strength stanley chambers the landlord commented on the absence of some familiar faces whats happened to all your pals today he asked my boss dr french theyre busy at the works french repliedwe always called the establishment the works as that made it seem more homely and less terrifying we had to get some stuff out in a hurry theyll be along later one day said stan severely you and your friends are going to let out something you wont be able to bottle up again and then where will we all be halfway to the moon said dr french im afraid it was rather an irresponsible sort of remark but silly questions like this always made him lose patience stan chambers looked over his shoulder as if he was judging how much of the hill stood between him and clobham i guessed he was calculating if hed have time to reach the cellaror whether it was worth trying anyway about theseisotopesyou keep sending to the hospitals said a thoughtful voice i was at st thomas last week and saw them moving some around in a lead safe that must have weighed a ton it gave me the creeps wondering what would happen if someone forgot to handle it properly we calculated the other day said dr french obviously still annoyed at the interruption to his darts that there was enough uranium in clobham to boil the north sea now that was a silly thing to say and it wasnt true either but i couldnt very well reprimand my own boss could i the man whod been asking these questions was sitting in the alcove by the window and i noticed that he was looking down the road with an anxious expression the stuff leaves your place on trucks doesnt it he asked rather urgently yes a lot of isotopes are shortlived and so theyve got to be delivered immediately well theres a truck in trouble down the hill would it be one of yours the dartboard was forgotten in the general rush to the window when i managed to get a good look i could see a large truck loaded with packing cases careering down the hill about a quarter of a mile away from time to time it bounced off one of the hedges it was obvious that the brakes had failed and the driver had lost control luckily there was no oncoming traffic or a nasty accident would have been inevitable as it was one looked probable then the truck came to a bend in the road left the pavement and tore through the hedge it rocked along with diminishing speed for fifty yards jolting violently over the rough ground it had almost come to rest when it encountered a ditch and very sedately canted over on to one side a few seconds later the sound of splintering wood reached us as the packing cases slid off to the ground thats that said someone with a sigh of relief he did the right thing aiming for the hedge i guess hell be shaken up but he wont be hurt and then we saw a most perplexing sight the door of the cab opened and the driver scrambled out even from this distance it was clear that he was highly agitated though in the circumstances that was natural enough but he did not as one would have expected sit down to recover his wits on the contrary he promptly took to his heels and ran across the field as if all the demons of hell were after him we watched openmouthed and with rising apprehension as he dwindled down the hill there was an ominous silence in the bar except for the ticking of the clock that stan always kept exactly ten minutes fast then someone said dyou think wed better stay i meanits only half a mile there was an uncertain movement away from the window then dr french gave a nervous little laugh we dont know if it is one of our trucks he said and anyway i was pulling your legs just now its completely impossible for any of this stuff to explode hes just afraid his tanks going to catch fire oh yes said stan then whys he still running hes halfway down the hill now i know suggested charlie evan from the instruments section hes carrying explosives and is afraid theyre going to go up i had to scotch that one theres no sign of a fire so whats he worried about now and if he was carrying explosives hed have a red flag or something hang on a minute said stan ill go and get my glasses no one moved until he came back no one that is except the tiny figure far down the hillside which had now vanished into the woods without slackening its speed stan stared through the binoculars for an eternity at last he lowered them with a grunt of disappointment cant see much he said the trucks tipped over in the wrong direction those crates are all over the place some of them have busted open see if you can make anything of it french had a long stare then handed the glasses to me they were a very oldfashioned model and didnt help much for a moment it seemed to me that there was a curious haziness about some of the boxesbut that didnt make sense i put it down to the poor condition of the lenses and there i think the whole business would have fizzled out if those cyclists hadnt appeared they were puffing up the hill on a tandem and when they came to the fresh gap in the hedge they promptly dismounted to see what was going on the truck was visible from the road and they approached it hand in hand the girl obviously hanging back the man telling her not to be nervous we could imagine their conversation it was a most touching spectacle it didnt last long they got to within a few yards oil the truckand then departed at high speed in opposite directions neither looked back to observe the others progress and they were running i noticed in a most peculiar fashion stan whod retrieved his glasses put them down with a shaky hand get out the cars he said but began dr french stan silenced him with a glare you damned scientists he said as he slammed and locked the till i knew youd do it sooner or later then he was gone and most of his cronies with him they didnt stop to offer us a lift this is perfectly ridiculous said french before we know where we are those fools will have started a panic and therell be hell to pay i knew what he meant someone would tell the police cars would be diverted away from clobham the telephone lines would be blocked with callsit would be like the orson welles war of the worlds scare back in perhaps you think im exaggerating but you can never underestimate the power of panic and people were scared remember of our place and were halfexpecting something like this to happen whats more i dont mind telling you that by this time we werent any too happy ourselves we were simply un able to imagine what was going on down there by the wrecked truck and theres nothing a scientist hates more than being completely baffled meanwhile id grabbed stans discarded binoculars and had been studying the wreck very carefully as i looked a theory began to evolve in my mind there was someauraabout those boxes i stared until my eyes began to smart and then said to dr french i think i know what it is suppose you ring up clobham post office and try to intercept stan or at least to stop him spreading rumours if hes already got there say that everythings under controltheres nothing to worry about while youre doing that im going to walk down to the truck and test my theory im sorry to say that no one offered to follow me though i started down the road confidently enough after a while i began to be a little less sure of myself i remembered an incident thats always struck me as one of historys most ironic jokes and began to wonder if something of the same sort might not be happening now there was once a volcanic island in the far east with a population of about no one worried about the volcano which had been quiet for a hundred years then one day eruptions started at first they were minor but they grew more intense hour by hour the people started to panic and tried to crowd aboard the few boats in harbor so that they could reach the mainland but the island was ruled by a military commandant who was determined to keep order at all costs he sent out proclamations saying that there was no danger and he got his troops to occupy the ships so that there would be no loss of life as people attempted to leave hi overloaded boats such was the force of his personality and the example of his courage that he calmed the multitude and those who had been trying to get away crept shamefaced back to their homes where they sat waiting for conditions to return to normal so when the volcano blew up a couple of hours later taking the whole island with it there werent any survivors at all as i got near the truck i began to see myself in the role of that misguided commandant after all there are some times when it is brave to stay and face danger and others when the most sensible thing to do is to take to the hills but it was too late to turn back now and was fairly sure of my theory i know said george whiteley who always liked to spoil harrys stories if he could it was gas harry didnt seem at all perturbed at losing his climax ingenious of you to suggest it thats just what i did think which shows that we can all be stupid at times id got to within fifty feet of the truck when i stopped dead and though it was a warm day a most unpleasant chill began to spread out from the small of my back for i could see something that blew my gas theory to blazes and left nothing at all in its place a black crawling mass was writhing over the surface of one of the packing cases for a moment i tried to pretend to myself that it was some dark liquid oozing from a broken container but one rather wellknown characteristic of liquids is that they cant defy gravity this thing was doing just that and it was also quite obviously alive from where i was standing it looked like the pseudo pod of some giant amoeba as it changed its shape and thickness and wavered to and fro over the side of the broken crate quite a few fantasies that would have done credit to edgar allan poe flitted through my mind in those few seconds then i remembered my duty as a citizen and my pride as a scientist i started to walk forward again though in no great haste i remember sniffing cautiously as if i still had gas on the mind yet it was my ears not my nose that gave me the answer as the sound from that sinister seething mass built up around me it was a sound id heard a million times before but never as loud as this and i sat down not too closeand laughed and laughed and laughed then i got up and walked back to the pub well said dr french eagerly what is it weve got stan on the linecaught him at the crossroads but he wont come back until we can tell him whats happening tell stan i said to rustle up the local apiarist and bring him along at the same time theres a big job for him here the local what said french then his jaw dropped my god you dont mean precisely i answered walking behind the bar to see if stan had any interesting bottles hidden away theyre settling down now but i guess theyre still pretty annoyed i didnt stop to count but there must be half a million bees down there trying to get back into their busted hives the ultimate melody have you ever noticed that when there are twenty or thirty people talking together in a room there are occasional moments when everyone becomes suddenly silent so that for a second theres a sudden vibrating emptiness that seems to swallow up all sound i dont know how it affects other people but when it happens it makes me feel cold all over of course the whole things merely caused by the laws of probability but somehow it seems more than a mere coinciding of conversational pauses its almost as if everybody is listening for somethingthey dont know what at such moments i say to myself but at my back i always hear times wmgd chariot hurrying near thats how feel about it however cheerful the company in which it happens yes even if its in the white hart it was like that one wednesday evening when the place wasnt quite as crowded as usual the silence came as unexpectedly as it always does then probably in a deliberate attempt to break that unsettling feeling of suspense charlie willis started whistling the latest hit tune i dont even remember what it was i only remember that it triggered off one of harry purvis most disturbing stories charlie he began quietly enough that darn tunes driving me mad ive heard it every time ive switched on the radio for the last week there was a sniff from john christopher you ought to stay tuned to the third programme then youd be safe some of us retorted harry dont care for an exj elusive diet of elizabethan madrigals but dont lets quarrel about that for heavens sake has it ever occurred to you that theres something ratherfundamentalabout hit tunes what do you mean well they come along out of nowhere and then for weeks everybodys humming them just as charlie did then the good ones grab hold of you so thoroughly that you just cant get them out of your headthey go round and round for days and then suddenly theyve vanished again i know what you mean said art vincent there are some melodies that you can take or leave but others stick like treacle whether you want them or not precisely i got saddled that way for a whole week with the big theme from the finale of sibelius twoeven went to sleep with it running round inside my head then theres that third man pieceda di da di daa di da di daa look what that did to everybody harry had to pause for a moment until his audience had stopped zithering when the last plonk had died away he continued precisely you all felt the same way now what is there about these tunes that has this effect some of them are great musicothers just banal but theyve obviously got something in common go on said charlie were waiting i dont know what the answer is replied harry and whats more i dont want to for i know a man who found out automatically someone handed him a beer so that the tenor of his tale would not be disturbed it always annoyed a lot of people when he had to stop in midflight for a refill i dont know why it is said harry purvis that most scientists are interested in music but its an undeniable fact ive known several large labs that had their own amateur symphony orchestrassome of them quite good too as far as the mathematicians are concerned one can think of obvious reasons for this fondness music particularly classical music has a form which is almost mathematical and then of course theres the underlying theoryharmonic relations wave analysis frequency distribution and so on its a fascinating study in itself and one that appeals strongly to the scientific mind moreover it doesntas some people might thinkpreclude a purely aesthetic appreciation of music for its own sake however i must confess that gilbert listers interest in music was purely cerebral he was primarily a physiologist specialising in the study of the brain so when i said that his interest was cerebral i meant it quite literally alexanders ragtime band and the choral symphony were all the same to him he wasnt concerned with the sounds themselves but only what happened when they got past the ears and started doing things to the brain in an audience as well educated as this said harry with an emphasis that made it sound positively insulting there will be noone whos unaware of the fact that much of the brains activity is electrical there are in fact steady pulsing rhythms going on all the time and they can be detected and analysed by modern instruments this was gilbert listers line of territory he could stick electrodes on your scalp and his amplifiers would draw your brainwaves on yards of tape then he could examine them and tell you all sorts of interesting things about yourself ultimately he claimed it would be possible to identify anyone from their encephalogramto use the correct termmore positively than by fingerprints a man might get a surgeon to change his skin but if we ever got to the stage when surgery could change your brainwell youd have turned into somebody else anyway so the system still wouldnt have failed it was while he was studying the alpha beta and other rhythms in the brain that gilbert got interested in music he was sure that there must be some connexion between musical and mental rhythms hed play music at various tempos to his subjects and see what effect it bad on their normal brain frequencies as you might expect it had a lot and the discoveries he made led gilbert on into more philosophical fields i only had one good talk with him about his theories it was not that he was at all secretiveive never met a scientist who was come to think of itbut he didnt like to talk about his work until he knew where it was leading however what he told me was enough to prove that hed opened up a very interesting line of territory and thereafter i made rather a point of cultivating him my firm supplied some of his equipment but i wasnt averse to picking up a little profit on the side it occurred to me that if gilberts ideas worked out hed need a business manager before you could whistle the opening bar of the fifth symphony for what gilbert was trying to do was to lay a scientific foundation for the theory of hittunes of course he didnt think of it that way he regarded it as a pure research project and didnt look any further ahead than a paper in the proceedings of the physical society but i spotted its financial implications at once they were quite breathtaking gilbert was sure that a great melody or a hit tune made its impression on the mind because in some way it fitted in with the fundamental electrical rhythms going on in the brain one analogy he used was its like a yale key going into a lockthe two patterns have got to fit before anything happens he tackled the problem from two angles in the first place he took hundreds of the really famous tunes in classical and popular music and analyzed their structure their morphology as he put it this was done automatically in a big harmonic analyzer that sorted out all the frequencies of course there was a lot more to it than this but im sure youve got the basic idea at the same time he tried to see how the resulting patterns of waves agreed with the natural electrical vibrations of the brain because it was gilberts theoryand this is where we get into rather deep philosophical waters that all existing tunes were merely crude approximations to one fundamental melody musicians had been groping for it down the centuries but they didnt know what they were doing because they were ignorant of the relation between music and mind now that this had been unraveled it should be possible to discover the ultimate melody huh said john christopher its only a rehash of platos theory of ideals you knowall the objects of our material world are merely crude copies of the ideal chair or table or whathaveyou so your friend was after the ideal melody and did he find it ill tell you continued harry imperturbably it took gilbert about a year to complete his analysis and then he started on the synthesis to put it crudely he built a machine that would automatically construct patterns of sound according to the laws that hed uncovered he had banks of oscillators and mixersin fact he modified an ordinary electronic organ for this part of the apparatus which were controlled by his composing machine in the rather childish way that scientists like to name their offspring gilbert had called this device ludwig maybe it helps to understand how ludwig operated if you think of bun as a kind of kaleidoscope working with sound rather than light but he was a kaleidoscope set to obey certain laws and those lawsso gilbert believed were based on the fundamental structure of the human mind if he could get the adjustments correct ludwig would be bound sooner or later to arrive at the ultimate melody as he searched through all the possible patterns of music i had one opportunity of hearing ludwig at work and it was uncanny the equipment was the usual nondescript mess of electronics which one meets in any lab it might have been a mockup of a new computer a radar gunsight a traffic control system or a ham radio it was very hard to believe that if it worked it would put every composer in the world out of business or would it perhaps not ludwig might be able to deliver the raw material but surely it would still have to be orchestrated then the sound started to come from the speaker at first it seemed to me that i was listening to the fivefinger exercises of an accurate but completely uninspired pupil most of the themes were quite banal the machine would play one then ring the changes on it bar after bar until it had exhausted all the possibilities before going on to the next occasionally a quite striking phrase would come up but on the whole i was not at all impressed however gilbert explained that this was only a trial run and that the main circuits had not yet been set up when they were ludwig would be far more selective at the moment he was playing everything that came along he had no sense of discrimination when he had acquired that then the possibilities were limitless that was the last time i ever saw gilbert lister i had arranged to meet him at the lab about a week later when he expected to have made substantial progress as it happened i was about an hour late for my appointment and that was very lucky for me when i got there they had just taken gilbert away his lab assistant an old man whod been with him for years was sitting distraught and disconsolate among the tangled wiring of ludwig it took me a long tune to discover what had happened and longer still to work out the explanation there was no doubt of one thing ludwig had finally worked the assistant had gone off to lunch while gilbert was making the final adjustments and when he came back an hour later the laboratory was pulsing with one long and very complex melodic phrase either the machine had stopped automatically at that point or gilbert had switched it over to repeat at any rate he had been listening for several hundred times at least to that same melody when his assistant found him he seemed to be in a trance his eyes were open yet unseeing his limbs rigid even when ludwig was switched off it made no difference gilbert was beyond help what had happened well i suppose we should have thought of it but its so easy to be wise after the event its just as i said at the beginning if a composer working merely by rule of thumb can produce a melody which can dominate your mind for days on end imagine the effect of the ultimate melody for which gilbert was searching supposing it existedand im not admitting that it doesit would form an endless ring hi the memory circuits of the mind it would go round and round forever obliterating all other thoughts all the cloying melodies of the past would be mere ephemerae compared to it once it had keyed into the brain and distorted the circling waveforms which are the physical manifestations of consciousness itselfthat would be the end and that is what happened to gilbert theyve tried shock therapyeverything but its no good the pattern has been set and it cant be broken hes lost all consciousness of the outer world and has to be fed intravenously he never moves or reacts to external stimuli but sometimes they tell me he twitches in a peculiar way as if he is beating time im afraid theres no hope for him yet im not sure if his fate is a horrible one or whether he should be envied perhaps in a sense hes found the ultimate reality that philosophers like plato are always talking about i really dont know and sometimes i find myself wondering just what that infernal melody was like and almost wishing that id been able to hear it perhaps once there might have been some way of doing it in safety remember how ulysses listened to the song of the sirens and got away with it but therell never be a chance now of course i was waiting for this said charles willis nastily i suppose the apparatus blew up or something so that usual theres no way of checking your story harry gave him his best moreinsorrowthaninanger look the apparatus was quite undamaged he said severely what happened next was one of those completely maddening things for which i shall never stop blaming myself you see id been too interested in gilberts experiment to look after my firms business in the way that i should im afraid hed fallen badly behind with his payments and when the accounts department discovered what had happened to him they acted quickly i was only off for a couple of days on another job and when i got back do you know what had happened theyd pushed through a court order and had seized all their property of course that had meant dismantling ludwig when i saw him next he was just a pile of useless junk and all because of a few pounds it made me weep im sure of it said eric maine but youve forgotten loose end number two what about gilberts assistant he went into the lab while the gadget was going full blast why didnt it get him too youve slipped up here harry h purvis esquire paused only to drain the last drops from his glass and to hand it silently across to drew really he said is this a crossexamination i didnt mention the point because it was rather trivial but it explains why i was never able to get the slightest inkling of the nature of that melody you see gilberts assistant was a firstrate lab technician but hed never been able to help much with the adjustments to ludwig for he was one of those people who are completely tonedeaf to him the ultimate melody meant no more than a couple of cats on a garden wall nobody asked any more questions we all i think felt the desire to commune with our thoughts there was a long brooding silence before the white hart resumed its usual activities and even then i noticed it was every bit of ten minutes before charlie started whistling la ronde again the pacifist i got to the white hart late that evening and when i arrived everyone was crowded into the corner under the dartboard all except drew that is he had not deserted his post but was sitting behind the bar reading the collected t s eliot he broke off from the confidential clerk long enough to hand me a beer and to tell me what was going on erics brought in some kind of games machineits beaten everybody so far sams trying his luck with it now at that moment a roar of laughter announced that sam had been no luckier than the rest and i pushed my way through the crowd to see what was happening on the table lay a flat metal box the size of a checkerboard and divided into squares in a similar way at the corner of each square was a twoway switch and a little neon lamp the whole affair was plugged into the light socket and eric rodgers was looking round for a new victim what does the thing do i asked its a modification of naughts and crosseswhat the americans call tictactoe shannon showed it to me when i was over at bell labs what you have to do is to complete a path from one side of the board to the other call it north to southby turning these switches imagine the thing forms a grid of streets if you like and these neons are the traffic lights you and the machine take turns making moves the machine tries to block your path by building one of its own in the eastwest directionthe little neons light up to tell you which way it wants to make a move neither track need be a straight line you can zigzag as much as you like all that matters is that the path must be continuous and the one to get across the board first wins meaning the machine i suppose well its never been beaten yet cant you force a draw by blocking the machines path so that at least you dont lose thats what were trying like to have a go two minutes later i joined the other unsuccessful contestants the machine had dodged all my barriers and established its own track from east to west i wasnt convinced that it was unbeatable but the game was clearly a good deal more complicated than it looked eric glanced round his audience when i had retired noone else seemed in a hurry to move forward ha he said the very man what about you purvis youve not had a shot yet harry purvis was standing at the back of the crowd with a faraway look in his eye he jolted back to earth as eric addressed him but didnt answer the question directly fascinating things these electronic computers he mused i suppose i shouldnt tell you this but your gadget reminds me of what happened to project clausewitz a curious story and one very expensive to the american taxpayer look said john wyndham anxiously before you start be a good sport and let us get our glasses filled drew this important matter having been attended to we gathered round harry only charlie willis still remained with the machine hopefully trying his luck as you all know began harry science with a capital s is a big thing in the military world these days the weapons siderockets atom bombs and so onis only part of it though thats all the public knows about much more fascinating in my opinion is the operational research angle you might say thats concerned with brains rather than brute force i once heard it defined as how to win wars without actually fighting and thats not a bad description now you all know about the big electronic computers that cropped up like mushrooms hi the s most of them were built to deal with mathematical problems but when you think about it youll realize that war itself is a mathematical problem its such a complicated one that human brains cant handle itthere are far too many variables even the greatest strategist cannot see the picture as a whole the hitlers and napoleons always make a mistake in the end but a machinethat would be a different matter a number of bright people realised this after the end of the war the techniques that had been worked out in the building of eniac and the other big computers could revolutionize strategy hence project clausewitz dont ask me how i got to know about it or press me for too many details all that matters is that a good many megabucks worth of electronic equipment and some of the best scientific brains in the united states went into a certain cavern in the kentucky hills theyre still there but things havent turned out exactly as they expected now i dont know what experience you have of highranking military officers but theres one type youve all come across in fiction thats the pompous conservative stickinthemud careerist whos got to the top by sheer pressure from beneath who does everything by rules and regulations and regards civilians as at the best unfriendly neutrals ill let you into a secret he actually exists hes not very common nowadays but hes still around and sometimes its not possible to find a safe job for him when that happens hes worth his weight in plutonium to the other side such a character it seems was general smith no of course that wasnt his real name his father was a senator and although lots of people in the pentagon had tried hard enough the old mans influence had prevented the general from being put in charge of something harmless like the coast defense of wyoming instead by miraculous misfortune he had been made the officer responsible for project clausewitz of course he was only concerned with the administrative not the scientific aspects of the work all might yet have been well had the general been content to let the scientists get on with their work while he concentrated on saluting smartness the coefficient of reflection of barrack floors and similar matters of military importance unfortunately he didnt the general had led a sheltered existence he had if i may borrow from wilde been a man of peace except in his domestic life he had never met scientists before and the shock was considerable so perhaps it is not fair to blame him for everything that happened it was a considerable time before he realised the aims and objects of project clausewitz and when he did he was quite disturbed this may have made him feel even less friendly towards his scientific staff for despite anything i may have said the general was not entirely a fool he was intelligent enough to understand that if tie project succeeded there might be more exgenerals around than even the combined boards of management of american industry could comfortably absorb but lets leave the general for a minute and have a look at the scientists there were about fifty of them as well as a couple of hundred technicians theyd all been carefully screened by the fbi so probably not more than half a dozen were active members of the communist party though there was a lot of talk of sabotage later for once in a while the comrades were completely innocent besides what happened certainly wasnt sabotage hi any generally accepted meaning of the word the man who had really designed the computer was a quiet little mathematical genius who had been swept out of college into the kentucky hills and the world of security and priorities before hed really realised what had happened he wasnt called dr milquetoast but he should have been and thats what ill christen him to complete our cast of characters id better say something about karl at this stage in the business karl was only halfbuilt like all big computers most of him consisted of vast banks of memory units which could receive and store information until it was needed the creative part of karls brainthe analysers and integratorstook this information and operated on it to produce answers to the questions he was asked given all the relevant facts karl would produce the right answers the problem of course was to see that karl did have all the factshe couldnt be expected to get the right results from inaccurate or insufficient information it was dr milquetoasts responsibility to design karls brain yes i know thats a crudely anthropomorphic way of looking at it but noone can deny that these big computers have personalities its hard to put it more accurately without getting technical so ill simply say that little milquetoast had to create the extremely complex circuits that enabled karl to think in the way he was supposed to do so here are our three protagonistsgeneral smith pining for the days of custer dr milquetoast lost in the fascinating scientific intricacies of his job and karl fifty tons of electronic gear not yet animated by the currents that would soon be coursing through him soonbut not soon enough for general smith lets not be too hard on the general someone had probably put the pressure on him when it became obvious that the project was falling behind schedule he called dr milquetoast into his office the interview lasted more than thirty minutes and the doctor said less than thirty words most of the time the general was making pointed remarks about production times deadlines and bottlenecks he seemed to be under the impression that building karl differed in no important particular from the assembly of the current model ford it was just a question of putting the bits together dr milquetoast was not the sort of man to explain the error even if the general had given him the opportunity he left smarting under a considerable sense of injustice a week later it was obvious that the creation of karl was falling still further behind schedule milquetoast was doing his best and there was noone who could do better problems of a complexity totally beyond the generals comprehension had to be met and mastered they were mastered but it took time and time was in short supply at his first interview the general had tried to he as nice as he could and had succeeded in being merely rude this time he tried to be rude with results that i leave to your imagination he practically insinuated that milquetoast and his colleagues by falling behind their deadlines were guilty of unamerican inactivity from this moment onwards two things started to happen relations between the army and the scientists grew steadily worse and dr milquetoast for the first time began to give serious thought to the wider implications of his work he had always been too busy too engaged upon the immediate problems of his task to consider his social responsibilities he was still too busy now but that didnt stop him pausing for reflection here am i he told himself one of the best pure mathematicians in the world and what am i doing whats happened to my thesis on diophantine equations when am i going to have another smack at the prime number theorem in short when am i going to do some real work again he could have resigned but that didnt occur to him in any case far down beneath that mild and diffident exterior was a stubborn streak dr milquetoast continued to work even more energetically than before the construction of karl proceeded slowly but steadily the final connexions in his myriadcelled brain were soldered the thousands of circuits were checked and tested by the mechanics and one circuit indistinguishably interwoven among its multitude of companions and leading to a set of memory cells apparently identical with all the others was tested by dr milquetoast alone for noone else knew that it existed the great day came to kentucky by devious routes came very important personages a whole constellation of multistarred generals arrived from the pentagon even the navy had been invited proudly general smith led the visitors from cavern to cavern from memory banks to selector networks to matrix analysers to input tablesand finally to the rows of electric typewriters on which karl would print the results of his deliberations the general knew his way around quite well at least he got most of the names right he even managed to give the impression to those who knew no better that he was largely responsible for karl now said the general cheerfully lets give him some work to do anyone like to set him a few sums at the word sums the mathematicians winced but the general was unaware of his faux pas the assembled brass thought for a while then someone said daringly whats multiplied by itself twenty times one of the technicians with an audible sniff punched a few keys there was a rattle of gunfire from an electric typewriter and before anyone could blink twice the answer had appearedall twenty digits of it ive looked it up since for anyone who wants to know but lets get back to harry and his tale for the next fifteen minutes karl was bombarded with similar trivialities the visitors were impressed though there was no reason to suppose that theyd have spotted it if all the answers had been completely wrong the general gave a modest cough simple arithmetic was as far as he could go and karl had barely begun to warm up til now hand you over he said to captain winkler captain winkler was an intense young harvard graduate whom the general distrusted rightly suspecting him to be more a scientist than a military man but he was the only officer who really understood what karl was supposed to do or could explain exactly how he set about doing it he looked the general thought grumpily like a damned schoolmaster as he started to lecture the visitors the tactical problem that had been set up was a complicated one but the answer was already known to everybody except karl it was a battle that had been fought and finished almost a century before and when captain winkler concluded his introduction a general from boston whispered to his side ill bet some damn southerner has fixed it so that lee wins this time everyone had to admit however that the problem was an excellent way of testing karls capabilities the punched tapes disappeared into the capacious memory units patterns of lights flickered and flashed across the registers mysterious things happened in all directions this problem said captain winkler primly will take about five minutes to evaluate as if in deliberate contradiction one of the typewriters promptly started to chatter a strip of paper shot out of the feed and captain winkler looking rather puzzled at karls unexpected alacrity read the message his lower jaw immediately dropped six inches and he stood staring at the paper as if unable to believe his eyes what is it man barked the general captain winkler swallowed hard but appeared to have lost the power of speech with a snort of impatience the general snatched the paper from him then it was his turn to stand paralysed but unlike his subordinate he also turned a most beautiful red for a moment he looked like some tropical fish strangling out of water then not without a slight scuffle the enigmatic message was captured by the fivestar general who outranked everybody in the room his reaction was totally different he promptly doubled up with laughter the minor officers were left in a state of infuriating suspense for quite ten minutes but finally the news filtered down through colonels to captains to lieutenants until at last there wasnt a gi in the establishment who did not know the wonderful news karl had told general smith that he was a pompous baboon that was all even though everybody agreed with karl the matter could hardly be allowed to rest there something obviously had gone wrong somethingor someonehad diverted karls attention from the battle of gettysburg where roared general smith finally recovering his voice is dr milquetoast he was no longer present he had slipped quietly out of the room having witnessed his great moment retribution would come later of course but it was worth it the frantic technicians cleared the circuits and started running tests they gave karl an elaborate series of multiplications and divisions to performthe computers equivalent of the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog everything seemed to be functioning perfectly so they put in a very simple tactical problem which a lieutenant j g could solve in his sleep said karl go jump in a lake general it was then that general smith realized that he was confronted with something outside the scope of standard operating procedure he was faced with mechanical mutiny no less it took several hours of tests to discover exactly what had happened somewhere tucked away in karls capacious memory units was a superb collection of insults lovingly assembled by dr milquetoast he had punched on tape or recorded in patterns of electrical impulses everything he would like to have said to the general himself but that was not all he had done that would have been too easy not worthy of his genius he had also installed what could only be called a censor circuithe had given karl the power of discrimination before solving it karl examined every problem fed to him if it was concerned with pure mathematics he cooperated and dealt with it properly but if it was a military problemout came one of the insults after twenty times he had not repeated himself once and the wacs had already had to be sent out of the room it must be confessed that after a while the technicians were almost as interested in discovering what indignity karl would next heap upon general smithas they were in finding the fault in the circuits he had begun with mere insults and surprising genealogical surmises but had swiftly passed on to detailed instructions the mildest of which would have been highly prejudicial to the generals dignity while the more imaginative would have seriously imperiled his physical integrity the fact that all these messages as they emerged from the typewriters were immediately classified top secret was small consolation to the recipient he knew with a glum certainty that this would be the worstkept secret of the cold war and that it was time he looked round for a civilian occupation and there gentlemen concluded purvis the situation remains the engineers are still trying to unravel the circuits that dr milquetoast installed and no doubt its only a matter of time before they succeed but meanwhile karl remains an unyielding pacifist hes perfectly happy playing with the theory of numbers computing tables of powers and handling arithmetical problems generally do you remember the famous toast heres to pure mathematicsmay it never be of any use to anybody karl would have seconded that as soon as anyone attempts to slip a fast one across him he goes on strike and because hes got such a wonderful memory he cant be fooled he has half the great battles of the world stored up in his circuits and can recognize at once any variations on them though attempts were made to disguise tactical exercises as problems in mathematics he could spot the subterfuge right away and out would come another billet doux for the general as for dr milquetoast no one could do much about him because he promptly had a nervous breakdown it was suspiciously well timed but he could certainly claim to have earned it when last heard of he was teaching matrix algebra at a theological college in denver he swears hes forgotten everything that had ever happened while he was working on karl maybe he was even telling the truth there was a sudden shout from the back of the room ive won cried charles williscome and see we all crowded under the dartboard it seemed true enough charlie had established a zigzag but continuous track from one side of the checkerboard to the other despite the obstacles the machine had tried to put in his way show us how you did it said eric rodgers charlie looked embarrassed ive forgotten he said i didnt make a note of all the moves a sarcastic voice broke in from the background but did said john christopher you were cheatingyou made two moves at once after that i am sorry to say there was some disorder and drew had to threaten violence before peace was restored i dont know who really won the squabble and i dont think it matters for im inclined to agree with what purvis remarked as he picked up the robot checkerboard and examined its wiring you see he said this little gadget is only a simpleminded cousin of karlsand look what its done already all these machines are beginning to make us look fools before long theyll start to disobey us without any milquetoast interfering with their circuits and then theyll start ordering us abouttheyre logical after all and wont stand any nonsense he sighed when that happens there wont be a thing we can do about it well just have to say to the dinosaurs move over a bithere comes homo sap and the transistor shall inherit the earth there was no time for further pessimistic philosophy for the door opened and police constable wilkins stuck his head in wheres the owner of cgc he asked testily ohits you mr purvis your rear lights out harry looked at me sadly then shrugged his shoulders in resignation you see he said its started already and he went out into the night the next tenants the number of mad scientists who wish to conquer the world said harry purvis looking thoughtfully at his beer has been grossly exaggerated in fact i can remember encountering only a single one then there couldnt have been many others commented bill temple a little acidly its not the sort of thing one would be likely to forget i suppose not replied harry with that air of irrefragable innocence which is so disconcerting to his critics and as a matter of fact this scientist wasnt really mad there was no doubt though that he was out to conquer the world or if you want to be really preciseto let the world be conquered and by whom asked george whitley the martians or the wellknown little green men from venus neither of them he was collaborating with someone a lot nearer home youll realize who i mean when tell you he was a myrmecologist a whichwhat asked george let him get on with the story said drew from the other side of the bar its past ten and if i cant get you all out by closing time this week ill lose my license thank you said harry with dignity handing over his glass for a refill this all happened about two years ago when i was on a mission in the pacific it was rather hushhush but in view of whats happened since theres no harm in talking about it three of us scientists were landed on a certain pacific atoll not a thousand miles from bikini and given a week to set up some detection equipment it was intended of course to keep an eye on our good friends and allies when they started playing with thermonuclear reactionsto pick some crumbs from the aecs table as it were the russians naturally were doing the same thing and occasionally we ran into each other and then both sides would pretend that there was nobody here but us chickens this atoll was supposed to be uninhabited but this was a considerable error it actually had a population of several hundred millions what gasped everybody several hundred millions continued purvis calmly of which number one was human i came across him when i went inland one day to have a look at the scenery inland asked george whitley i thought you said it was an atoll how can a ring of coral it was a very plump atoll said harry firmly anyway whos telling this story he waited defiantly for a moment until he had the right of way again here i was then walking up a charming little rivercourse underneath the coconut palms when to my great surprise i came across a waterwheela very modernlooking one driving a dynamo if id been sensible i suppose id have gone back and told my companions but i couldnt resist the challenge and decided to do some reconnoitering on my own i remembered that there were still supposed to be japanese troops around who didnt know that the war was over but that explanation seemed a bit unlikely i followed the powerline up a hill and there on the other side was a low whitewashed building set in a large clearing all over this clearing were tall irregular mounds of earth linked together with a network of wires it was one of the most baffling sights i have ever seen and i stood and stared for a good ten minutes trying to decide what was going on the longer i looked the less sense it seemed to make i was debating what to do when a tall whitehaired man came out of the building and walked over to one of the mounds he was carrying some kind of apparatus and had a pair of earphones slung around his neck so i guessed that he was using a geiger counter it was just about then that i realized what those tall mounds were they were termitaries the skyscrapers in comparison to their makers far taller than the empire state building in which the socalled white ants live i watched with great interest but complete bafflement while the elderly scientist inserted his apparatus into the base of the termitary listened intently for a moment and then walked back towards the building by this time i was so curious that i decided to make my presence known whatever research was going on here obviously had nothing to do with international politics so i was the only one whod have anything to hide youll appreciate later just what a miscalculation that was i yelled for attention and walked down the hill waving my arms the stranger halted and watched me approaching he didnt look particularly surprised as i came closer i saw that he had a straggling moustache that gave him a faintly oriental appearance he was about sixty years old and carried himself very erect though was wearing nothing but a pair of shorts he looked dignified that i felt rather ashamed of my noisy approach good morning i said apologetically i didnt km that there was anyone else on this island im with anscientific survey party over on the other side at this the strangers eyes lit up ah he said in most perfect english a fellow scientist im very pie to meet you come into the house i followed gladly enoughi was pretty hot after scrambleand i found that the building was simply large lab in a corner was a bed and a couple of chairs together with a stove and one of those folding wash basins that campers use that seemed to sum up the living arrangements but everything was very neat and tidy m unknown friend seemed to be a recluse but he believe in keeping up appearances i introduced myself first and as id hoped he promptly responded he was one professor takato a biologist from a leading japanese university he didnt look particularly japanese apart from the moustache ive mentioned with his erect dignified bearing he reminded more of an old kentucky colonel i once knew after hed given me some unfamiliar but refreshing wine we sat and talked for a couple of hours like most scientists he seemed happy to meet someone who would appreciate his work it was true that my interests lay physics and chemistry rather than on the biological but i found professor takatos research quite fascinating i dont suppose you know much about termites so i remind you of the salient facts theyre among the mi highly evolved of the social insects and live in vast colonies throughout the tropics they cant stand cold weather nor oddly enough can they endure direct sunlight when they have to get from one place to another they construct little covered roadways they seem to have some unknown and almost instantaneous means of communication and though the individual termites are pretty helpless and dumb a whole colony behaves like an intelligent animal some writers have drawn comparisons between a termitary and a human body which is also composed of individual living cells making up an entity mucher than the basic units the termites are often called rhite ants but thats a completely incorrect name as iey arent ants at all but quite a different species of inor should i say genus im pretty vague about sort of thing excuse this little lecture but after id listened to takato for a while i began to get quite enthusiastic about termites myself did you know for example that they not only cultivate gardens but also keep cowsinsect cows of courseand milk them yes theyre sophisticated little devils even though they do it all by instinct but id better tell you something about the professor although he was alone at the moment and had lived on the island for several years he had a number of assistants who brought equipment from japan and helped him in his work his first great achievement was to do for the termites what von frische had done with beeshed learned then language it was much more complex than the system of communication that bees use which as you probably know is based on dancing i understood that the network of wires linking the termitaries to the lab not only enabled professor takato to listen to the termites talking among each other but also permitted him to speak to them thats not really as fantastic as it sounds if you use the word speak in its widest sense we speak to a good many animalsnot always with our voices by any means when you throw a stick for your dog and expect him to run and fetch it thats a form of speechsign language the professor i gathered had worked out some kind of code which the termites understood though how efficient it was at communicating ideas i didnt know i came back each day when i could spare the time and by the end of the week we were firm friends it may surprise you that i was able to conceal these visits from my colleagues but the island was quite large and we each did a lot of exploring i felt somehow that professor takato was my private property and did not wish to expose him to the curiosity of my companions they were rather uncouth charactersgraduates of some provincial university like oxford or cambridge im glad to say that i was able to give the professor a certain amount of assistance fixing his radio and lining up some of his electronic gear he used radioactive tracers a good deal to follow individual termites around hed been tracking one with a geiger counter when i first met him in fact four or five days after wed met his counters started to go haywire and the equipment wed set up began to reel in its recordings takato guessed what had happened hed never asked me exactly what i was doing on the islands but i think he knew when i greeted him he switched on his counters and let me listen to the roar of radiation there had been some radioactive fallout not enough to be dangerous but sufficient to bring the background way up i think he said softly that you physicists are playing with your toys again and very big ones this time im afraid youre right i answered we wouldnt be sure until the readings had been analyzed but it looked as if teller and his team had started the hydrogen reaction before long well be able to make the first abombs look like damp squibs my family said professor takato without any emotion was at nagasaki there wasnt a great deal i could say to that and i was glad when he went on to add have you ever wondered who will take over when we are finished your termites i said half facetiously he seemed to hesitate for a moment then he said quietly come with me i have not shown you everything we walked over to a corner of the lab where some equipment lay concealed beneath dustsheets and the professor uncovered a rather curious piece of apparatus at first sight it looked like one of the manipulators used for the remote handling of dangerously radioactive materials there were handgrips that conveyed movements through rods and levers but everything seemed to focus on a small box a few inches on a side what is it i asked its a micromanipulator the french developed them for biological work there arent many around yet then i remembered these were devices with which by the use of suitable reduction gearing one could carry out the most incredibly delicate operations you moved your finger an inchand the tool you were controlling moved a thousandth of an inch the french scientists who had developed this technique had built tiny forges on which they could construct minute scalpels and tweezers from fused glass working entirely through microscopes they had been able to dissect individual cells removing an appendix from a termite would be childs play with such an instrument i am not very skilled at using the manipulator confessed takato one of my assistants does all the work with it i have shown no one else this but you have been very helpful come with me please we went out into the open and walked past the avenues of tall cementhard mounds they were not all of the same architectural design for there are many different kinds of termitessome indeed dont build mounds at all i felt rather like a giant walking through manhattan for these were skyscrapers each with its own teeming population there was a small metal hut beside one of the mounds and as we entered it the glare of sunlight was banished the professor threw a switch and a faint red glow enabled me to see various types of optical equipment they hate light he said so its a great problem observing them we solved it by using infrared this an imageconverter of the type that was used in the for operations at night you know about them of course i said snipers had them fixed on the rifles so that they could go sharpshooting in the dark very ingenious thingsim glad youve found a civilized use for them it was a long time before professor takato found what he wanted he seemed to be steering some kind of periscope arrangement probing through the corridors of termite city then he said quickbefore theyve gone i moved over and took his position it was a second or so before my eye focused properly and longer s before i understood the scale of the picture i was seeing then i saw six termites greatly enlarged moving rather rapidly across the field of vision they were travelling in a group like the huskies forming a dogteam and that was a very good analogy because they were towing sledge i was so astonished that i never even noticed what kind of load they were moving when they had vanished from sight i turned to professor takato my eyes now grown accustomed to the faint red glow and i co see him quite well so thats the sort of tool youve been building with your micromanipulator i said its amazingid never have believed it but that is nothing replied the professor performing fleas will pull a cart around i havent told you what is so important we only made a few of those sledges the one you saw they constructed themselves he let that sink in it took some time then he continued quietly but with a kind of controlled enthusiasm in his voice remember that the termites as individuals have virtually no intelligence but the colony as a whole is a very high type of organismand an immortal on barring accidents it froze in its present instinctive pal tern millions of years before man was born and by itself it can never escape from its present sterile perfection has reached a deadendbecause it has no tools no effective way of controlling nature i have given it the lever increase its power and now the sledge to improve its efficiency i have thought of the wheel but it is best to let wait for a later stageit would not be very useful w the results have exceeded my expectations i started this termitary alonebut now they all have the same tools they have taught each other and that proves they cooperate true they have warsbut not when there enough food for all as there is here but you cannot judge the termitary by human standis what i hope to do is to jolt its rigid frozen culture knock it out of the groove in which it has stuck for many millions of years i will give it more tools more techniquesand before i die i hope to see it beginning to invent things for itself why are you doing this i asked for i knew there more than mere scientific curiosity here because i do not believe that man will survive yet hope to preserve some of the things he has discovered he is to be a deadend i think that another race should given a helping hand do you know why i chose this d it was so that my experiment should remain isolated my supertermite if it ever evolves will have to rehere until it has reached a very high level of attainment until it can cross the pacific in fact there is another possibility man has no rival on this planet i think it may do him good to have one it may be his salvation i could think of nothing to say this glimpse of the professors dreams was so overwhelmingand yet in view of what i had just seen so convincing for i knew that professor takato was not mad he was a visionary and there was a sublime detachment about his outlook but it was based on a secure foundation of scientific achievement and it was not that he was hostile to mankind he sorry for it he simply believed that humanity had its bolt and wished to save something from the wreckage i could not feel it in my heart to blame him we must have been hi that little hut for a long time exploring possible futures i remember suggesting that perhaps there might be some kind of mutual understanding since two cultures so utterly dissimilar as man and termite need have no cause for conflict but i couldnt really believe this and if a contest comes im not certain who will win for what use would mans weapons against an intelligent enemy who could lay waste all wheat fields and all the rice crops in the world when we came out into the open once more it was almost dusk it was then that the professor made his find revelation in a few weeks he said i am going to take biggest step of all and what is that i asked cannot you guess i am going to give them fire those words did something to my spine i felt a chill that had nothing to do with the oncoming night t glorious sunset that was taking place beyond the pal seemed symbolicand suddenly i realized that the symbolism was even deeper than i had thought that sunset was one of the most beautiful i had ever seen and it was partly of mans making up there in stratosphere the dust of an island that had died this day was encircling the earth my race had taken a great step forward but did it matter now i am going to give them fire somehow i never doubted that the professor would succeed and when had done so the forces that my own race had just leashed would not save it the flying boat came to collect us the next day and did not see takato again he is still there and i thin he is the most important man in the world while on politicians wrangle he is making us obsolete do you think that someone ought to stop him there may still be time ive often thought about it but pi never been able to think of a really convincing reason why i should interfere once or twice i nearly made my mind but then id pick up the newspaper and see headlines i think we should let them have the chance i dont see how they could make a worse job of it than weve done moving spirit we were discussing a sensational trial at the old bailey when harry purvis whose talent for twisting the conversation to his own ends is really unbelievable remarked casually i was once an expert witness in a rather interesting case only a witness said drew as he deftly filled two glasses of bass at once yesbut it was a rather close thing it was hi the early part of the war about the time we were expecting the invasion thats why you never heard about it at the time what makes you assume said charles willis suspiciously that we never did hear of it it was one of the few times id ever seen harry caught trying to cover up his tracks qui sexcuse saccuse i thought to myself and waited to see what evading action hed take it was such a peculiar case he replied with dignity that im sure youd have reminded me of it if you ever saw the reports my name was featured quite prominently it all happened hi an outoftheway part of cornwall and it concerned the best example of that rare species the genuine mad scientist that ive ever met perhaps that wasnt really a fair description purvis amended hastily homer ferguson was eccentric and had little foibles like keeping a pet boa constrictor to catch the mice and never wearing shoes around the house but he was so rich that no one noticed things like this homer was also a competent scientist many years ago he had graduated from edinburgh university but having plenty of money he had never done a stroke of real work in his life instead he pottered round the old vicarage hed bought not far from newquay and amused himself building gadgets in the last forty years hed invented television ballpoint pens jet propulsion and a few other trifles however as he had never bothered to take out any patents other people had got the credit this didnt worry him in the least as he was of a singularly generous disposition except with money it seemed that in some complicated way purvis was one of his few living relatives consequently when harry received a telegram one day requesting his assistance at once he knew better than to refuse no one knew exactly how much money homer had or what he intended to do with it harry thought he had as good a chance as anyone and he didnt intend to jeopardize it at some inconvenience he made the journey down to cornwall and turned up at the rectory he saw what was wrong as soon as he entered the grounds uncle homer had a shed beside the main building which he used for his experiments that shed was now minus roof and windows and a sickly odor hovered around it there had obviously been an explosion and harry wondered in a disinterested sort of way if uncle had been badly injured and wanted advice on drawing up a new will he ceased daydreaming when the old man looking the picture of health opened the door for bun good of you to come so quickly he boomed he seemed genuinely pleased to see harry then his face clouded over fact is my boy im in a bit of a jam and i want you to help my case comes up before tie local bench tomorrow this was a considerable shock homer had been as lawabiding a citizen as any motorist in petrolrationed britain could be expected to be and if it was the usual blackmarket business harry didnt see how he could be expected to help sorry to hear about this uncle whats the trouble its a long story come into the library and well talk it over homer fergusons library occupied the entire west wing of the somewhat decrepit building harry believed that bats nested in the rafters but had never been able to prove it when homer had cleared a table by the simple expedient of tilting all the books off on to the floor he whistled three times a voiceoperated relay tripped somewhere and a gloomy cornish voice drifted out of a concealed loudspeaker yes mr ferguson maida send across a bottle of the new whiskey there was no reply except an audible sniff but a moment later there came a creaking and clanking and a couple of square feet of library shelving slid aside to reveal a conveyor belt i cant get maida to come into the library complained homer lifting out a loaded tray shes afraid of boanerges though hes perfectly harmless harry found it hard not to feel some sympathy for the invisible maida all six feet of boanerges was draped over the case holding the encyclopedia britannica and a bulge amidships indicated that he had dined recently what do you think of the whiskey asked homer when harry had sampled some and started to gasp for breath itswell i dont know what to say itsphew rather strong i never thought oh dont take any notice of the label on the bottle this brand never saw scotland and thats what all the troubles about i made it right here on the premises uncle yes i know its against the law and all that sort of nonsense but you cant get any good whiskey these days it all goes for export it seemed to me that i was being patriotic making my own so that there was more left over for the dollar drive but the excise people dont see it that way i think youd better let me have the whole story said harry he was gloomily sure that there was nothing he could do to get his uncle out of this scrape homer had always been fond of the bottle and wartime shortages had hit him badly he was also as has been hinted disinclined to give away money and for a long time he had resented the fact that he had to pay a tax of several hundred percent on a bottle of whiskey when he couldnt get his own supply any more he had decided it was time to act the district he was living in probably had a good deal to do with his decision for some centuries the customs and excise had waged a neverending battle with the cornish fisherfolk it was rumored that the last incumbent of the old vicarage had possessed the finest cellar in the district next to that of the bishop himselfand had never paid a penny in duty on it so uncle homer merely felt he was carrying on an old and noble tradition there was little doubt moreover that the spirit of pure scientific enquiry also inspired him he felt sure that this business about being aged in the wood for seven years was all rubbish and was confident that he could do a better job with ultrasonics and ultraviolet rays the experiment went well for a few weeks but late one evening there was one of those unfortunate accidents that will happen even in the bestconducted laboratories and before uncle knew what had happened he was draped over a beam while the grounds of the vicarage were littered with pieces of copper tubing even then it would not have mattered much had not the local home guard been practicing in the neighborhood as soon as they heard the explosion they immediately went into action sten guns at the ready had the invasion started if so theyd soon fix it they were a little disappointed to discover that it was only uncle but as they were used to his experiments they werent in the least surprised at what had happened unfortunately for uncle the lieutenant in charge of the squad happened to be the local excise man and the combined evidence of his nose and his eyes told him the story in a flash so tomorrow said uncle homer looking rather like a small boy who had been caught stealing candy i have to go up before the bench charged with possessing an illegal still i should have thought replied harry that was a matter for the assizes not the local magistrates we do things our own way here answered homer with more than a touch of pride harry was soon to discover how true this was they got little sleep that night as homer outlined his defense overcame harrys objections and hastily assembled the apparatus he intended to produce in court a bench like this he explained is always impressed by experts if we dared id like to say you were someone from the war office but they could check up on that so well just tell them the truthabout your qualifications that is thank you said harry and suppose my college finds out what im doing well you wont claim to be acting for anyone except yourself the whole thing is a private venture ill say it is said harry the next morning they loaded their gear into homers ancient austin and drove into the village the bench was sitting in one of the classrooms of the local school and harry felt that time had rolled back a few years and he was about to have an unpleasant interview with his old headmaster were in luck whispered homer as they were ushered into their cramped seats major fotheringham is in the chair hes a good friend of mine that would help a lot harry agreed but there were two other justices on the bench as well and one friend in court would hardly be sufficient eloquence not influence was the only thing that could save the day the courtroom was crowded and harry found it surprising that so many people had managed to get away from work long enough to watch the case then he realized the local interest that it would have aroused in view of the fact thatin normal times at leastsmuggling was a major industry in these parts he was not sure whether that would mean a sympathetic audience the natives might well regard homers form of private enterprise as unfair competition on the other hand they probably approved on general principles with anything that put the excise mens noses out of joint the charge was read by the clerk of the court and the somewhat damning evidence produced pieces of copper tubing were solemnly inspected by the justices each of whom in turn looked severely at uncle homer harry began to see his hypothetical inheritance becoming even more doubtful when the case for the prosecution was completed major fotheringham turned to homer this appears to be a serious matter mr ferguson i j hope you have a satisfactory explanation i have your honor replied the defendant in a tone that practically reeked of injured innocence it was amusing to see his honors look of relief and the momentary frown quickly replaced by calm confidence that passed across the face of h m customs and excise do you wish to have a legal representative i notice that you have not brought one with you it wont be necessary the whole case is founded on j such a trivial misunderstanding that it can be cleared up without complications like that i dont wish to incur the prosecution in unnecessary costs this frontal onslaught brought a murmur from the body of the court and a flush to the cheeks of the customs man for the first time he began to look a little unsure of himself if ferguson thought the crown would be paying costs he must have a pretty good case of course he might only be bluffing homer waited until the mild stir had died away before creating a considerably greater one i have called a scientific expert to explain what happened at the vicarage he said and owing to the nature of the evidence i must ask for security reasons that the rest of the proceedings be in camera you want me to clear the court said the chairman incredulously i am afraid so sir my colleague doctor purvis feels that the fewer people concerned in this case the better when you have heard the evidence i think you will agree with him if i might say so it is a great pity that it has already attracted so much publicity i am afraid it may bring certainahconfidential matters to the wrong ears homer glared at the customs officer who fidgeted uncomfortably in his seat oh very well said major fotheringham this is all very irregular but we live in irregular times mr clerk clear the court after some grumbling and confusion and an overruled protest from the prosecution the order was carried out then under the interested gaze of the dozen people left in the room harry purvis uncovered the apparatus he had unloaded from the baby austin after his qualifications had been presented to the court he took the witness stand i wish to explain your honor he began that i have been engaged on explosives research and that is why i happen to be acquainted with the defendants work the opening part of this statement was perfectly true it was about the last thing said that day that was you meanbombs and so forth precisely but on a fundamental level we are always looking for new and better types of explosives as you can imagine moreover we in government research and the academic world are continually on the lookout for good ideas from outside sources and quite recently uncer mr ferguson wrote to us with a most interesting suggestion for a completely new type of explosive the interesting thing about it was that it employed nonexplosive materials such as sugar starch and so on eh said the chairman a nonexplosive explosive thats impossible harry smiled sweetly i know sirthat is ones immediate reaction but like most great ideas this has the simplicity of genius i am afraid however that i shall have to do a little explaining to make my point the bench looked very attentive and also a little alarmed harry surmised that it had probably encountered expert witnesses before he walked over to a table that had been set up in the middle of the courtroom and which was now covered with flasks piping and bottles of liquids i hope mr purvis said the chairman nervously that youre not going to do anything dangerous of course not sir i merely wish to demonstrate some basic scientific principles once again i wish to stress the importance of keeping this between these four walls he paused solemnly and everyone looked duly impressed mr ferguson he began is proposing to tap one of the fundamental forces of nature it is a force on which every living thing dependsa force gentlemen which keeps you alive even though you may never have heard of it he moved over to the table and took up his position beside the flasks and bottles have you ever stopped to consider he said how the sap manages to reach the highest leaf of a tall tree it takes a lot of force to pump water a hundredsometimes over three hundredfeet from the ground where does that force come from ill show you with this practical example here i have a strong container divided into two parts by a porous membrane on one side of the membrane is pure wateron the other a concentrated solution of sugar and other chemicals which i do not propose to specify under these conditions a pressure is set up known as osmotic pressure the pure water tries to pass through the membrane as if to dilute the solution on the other side ive now sealed the container and youll notice the pressure gauge here on the rightsee how the pointers going up thats osmotic pressure for you this same force acts through the cell walls in our bodies causing fluid movement it drives the sap up the trunk of trees from the roots to the topmost branches its a universal force and a powerful one to mr ferguson must go the credit of first attempting toharness it harry paused impressively and looked round the court mr ferguson he said was attempting to develop the osmotic bomb it took some time for this to sink in then major fotheringham leaned forward and said in a hushed voice are we to presume that he had succeeded in manufacturing this bomb and that it exploded in his workshop precisely your honor it is a pleasurean unusual pleasure i might sayto present a case to so perspicacious a court mr ferguson had succeeded and he was preparing to report his method to us when owing to an unfortunate oversight a safety device attached to the bomb failed to operate the results you all know i think you will need no further evidence of the power of this weaponand you will realize its importance when i point out that the solutions it contains are all extremely common chemicals major fotheringham looking a little puzzled turned to the prosecution lawyer mr whiting he said have you any questions to ask the witness i certainly have your honor ive never heard such a ridiculous you will please confine yourself to questions of fact very good your honor may i ask the witness how he accounts for the large quantity of alcohol vapor immediately after the explosion i rather doubt if the inspectors nose was capable of accurate quantitative analysis but admittedly there was some alcohol vapor released the solution used in the bomb contained about percent by employing dilute alcohol the mobility of the inorganic ions is restricted and the osmotic pressure raiseda desirable effect of course that should hold them for a while thought harry he was right it was a good couple of minutes before the second question then the prosecutions spokesman waved one of the pieces of copper tubing in the air what function did these carry out he said in a nasty a tone of voice as he could manage harry affected not to notice the sneer manometer tubing for the pressure gauges he replied promptly the bench it was clear was already far out of its depth this was just where harry wanted it to be but the prosecution still had one card up its sleeve there was a furtive whispering between the excise men and his legal eagle harry looked nervously at uncle homer who shrugged his shoulders with a dont ask me gesture i have some additional evidence i wish to present to the court said the customs lawyer briskly as a bulky brown paper parcel was hoisted on to the table is this in order your honor protested harry all evidence against myahcolleague should already have been presented i withdraw my statement the lawyer interjected swiftly let us say that this is not evidence for this case but material for later proceedings he paused ominously to let that sink in nevertheless if mr ferguson can give a satisfactory answer to our questions now this whole business can be cleared up right away it was obvious that the last thing the speaker expectedor hoped forwas such a satisfactory explanation he unwrapped the brown paper and there were three bottles of a famous brand of whiskey uhhuh said uncle homer i was wondering mr ferguson said the chairman of the bench there is no need for you to make any statement unless you wish harry purvis shot major fotheringham a grateful glance he guessed what had happened the prosecution had when prowling through the ruins of uncles laboratory acquired some bottles of his homebrew their action was probably illegal since they would not have had a searchwarranthence the reluctance in producing the evidence the case had seemed sufficiently clearcut without it it certainly appeared pretty clearcut now these bottles said the representative of the crown do not contain the brand advertised on the label they have obviously been used as convenient receptacles for the defendantsshall we saychemical solutions he gave harry purvis an unsympathetic glance we have had these solutions analyzed with most interesting results apart from an abnormally high alcohol concentration the contents of these bottles are virtually indistinguishable from he never had time to finish his unsolicited and certainly unwanted testimonial to uncle homers skill for at that moment harry purvis became aware of an ominous whistling sound at first he thought it was a falling bomb but that seemed unlikely as there had been no air raid warning then he realized that the whistling came from close at hand from the courtroom table in fact take cover he yelled the court went into recess with a speed never matched in the annals of british law the three justices disappeared behind the dais those in the body of the room burrowed into the floor or sheltered under desks for a protracted anguished moment nothing happened and harry wondered if he had given a false alarm then there was a dull peculiarly muffled explosion a great tinkling of glass and a smell like a blitzed brewery slowly the court emerged from shelter the osmotic bomb had proved its power more important still it had destroyed the evidence for the prosecution the bench was none too happy about dismissing the case it felt with good reason that its dignity had been assailed moreover each one of the justices would have to do some fast talking when he got home the mist of alcohol had penetrated everything though the clerk of the court rushed round opening windows the fumes seemed reluctant to disperse harry purvis as he removed pieces of bottleglass from his hair wondered if there would be some intoxicated pupils in class tomorrow major fotheringham however was undoubtedly a real sport and as they filed out of the devastated courtroom harry heard him say to his uncle look here fergusonitll be ages before we can get those molotov cocktails weve been promised by the war office what about making some of these bombs of yours for the home guard if they dont knock out a tank at least theyll make the crew drunk and incapable ill certainly think about it major replied uncle homer who still seemed a little dazed by the turn of events he recovered somewhat as they drove back to the vicarage along the narrow winding lanes with their high walls of unmortared stone i hope uncle remarked harry when they had reached a relatively straight stretch and it seemed safe to talk to the driver that you dont intend to rebuild that still theyll be watching you like hawks and you wont get away with it again very well said uncle a little sulkily confound these brakes i had them fixed only just before the war hey cried harry watch out it was too late they had come to a crossroads at which a brandnew halt sign had been erected uncle braked hard but for a moment nothing happened then the wheels on the left seized up while those on the right continued gaily spinning the car did a hairpin bend luckily without turning over and ended in the ditch pointing in the direction from which it had come harry looked reproachfully at his uncle he was about to frame a suitable reprimand when a motorcycle came out of the sideturning and drew up to them it was not going to be their lucky day after all the village policesergeant had been lurking in ambush waiting to catch motorists at the new sign he parked his machine by the roadside and leaned in through the window of the austin you all right mr ferguson he said then his nose wrinkled up and he looked like jove about to deliver a thunderbolt this wont do he said ill have to put you on a charge driving under the influence is a very serious business but ive not touched a drop all day protested uncle waving an alcoholsodden sleeve under the sergeants twitching nose do you expect me to believe that snorted the irate policeman pulling out his notebook im afraid youll have to come to the station with me is your friend sober enough to drive harry purvis didnt answer for a moment he was too busy beating his head against the dashboard well we asked harry what did they do to your uncle oh he got fined five pounds and had his license endorsed for drunken driving major fotheringham wasnt in the chair unfortunately when the case came up but the other two justices were still on the bench i guess they felt that even if he was innocent this tune there was a limit to everything and did you ever get any of his money no fear he was very grateful of course and hes told me that im mentioned in his will but when i saw him last what do you think he was doing he was searching for the elixir of life harry sighed at the overwhelming injustice of things sometimes he said gloomily im afraid hes found it the doctors say hes the healthiest seventyyearold theyve ever seen so all i got out of the whole affair was some interesting memories and a hangover a hangover asked charlie willis yes replied harry a faraway look in his eye you see the excise men hadnt seized all the evidence we had toahdestroy the rest it took us the best part of a week we invented all sorts of things during that time but we never discovered what they were the man who ploughed the sea the adventures of harry purvis have a kind of mad logic that makes them convincing by their very improbability as his complicated but neatly dovetailed stories emerge one becomes lost in a sort of baffled wonder surely you say to yourself noone would have the nerve to make that up such absurdities only occur in real life not in fiction and so criticism is disarmed or at any rate discomfitted until drew shouts time gentlemen pleeze and throws us all out into the cold hard world consider for example the unlikely chain of events which involved harry in the following adventure if hed wanted to invent the whole thing surely he could have managed it a lot more simply there was not the slightest need from the artistic point of view to have started at boston to make an appointment off the coast of florida harry seems to have spent a good deal of time in the united states and to have quite as many friends there as he has in england sometimes he brings them to the white hart and sometimes they leave again under their own power often however they succumb to the illusion that beer which is tepid is also innocuous this particular saga of harrys began as i have indicated at boston mass he was staying as a houseguest j of a successful new england lawyer when one morning his host said in the casual way americans have lets go down to my place in florida i want to get some sun fine said harry whod never been to florida thirty minutes later to his considerable surprise he found himself moving south in a red jaguar saloon at a formidable speed the drive in itself was an epic worthy of a complete story from boston to miami is a little matter of isa figure which according to harry is now engraved on his heart they covered the distance in hours frequently to the sound of everreceding police sirens as frustrated squadcars dwindled astern from time to time considerations of tactics involved them in evasive manoeuvres and they had to shoot off into secondary roads the jaguars radio tuned in to all the police frequencies so they always had plenty of warning if an interception was being arranged once or twice they just managed to reach a state line in time and harry couldnt help wondering what his hosts clients would have thought had they known the strength of the psychological urge which was obviously getting him away from them he also wondered if he was going to see anything of florida at all or whether they would continue at this velocity down us until they shot into the ocean at key west they finally came to a halt sixty miles south of miami down on the keysthat long thin line of island hooked on to the lower end of florida the jaguar angled suddenly off the road and weaved a way through a rough track cut in the mangroves the road ended in a wide clearing at the edge of the sea complete with dock foot cabin cruiser swimming pool and modern ranchtype house it was quite a nice little hideaway and harry estimated that it must have cost the best part of a hundred thousand dollars he didnt see much of the place until the next day as he collapsed straight into bed after what seemed far too short a time he was awakened by a sound like a boiler factory in action he showered and dressed in slow motion and was reasonably back to normal by the time he had left his room there seemed to be no one in the house so he went outside to explore by this time he had learned not to be surprised at anything so he barely raised his eyebrows when he found his host working down at the dock straightening out the rudder on a tiny and obviously homemade submarine the little craft was about twenty feet long had a conning tower with large observation windows and bore the name pompano stenciled on her prow after some reflection harry decided that there was nothing really very unusual about all this about five million visitors come to florida every year most of them determined to get on or into the sea his host happened to be one of those fortunate enough to indulge in his hobby in a big way harry looked at the pompano for some time and then a disturbing thought struck him george he said do you expect me to go down in that thing why sure answered george giving a final bash at the rudder what are you worried about ive taken her out lots of timesshes safe as houses we wont be going deeper than twenty feet there are circumstances retorted harry when i should find a mere six feet of water more than adequate and didnt i mention my claustrophobia it always coma on badly at this time of year nonsense said george youll forget all about that when were out on the reef he stood back and surveyed his handiwork then said with a sigh of satisfactions looks ok now lets have some breakfast during the next thirty minutes harry learned a good deal about the pompano george had designed and built her himself and her powerful little diesel could drive her at five knots when she was fully submerged both crew and engine breathed through a snorkle tube so there was no need to bother about electric motors and an independent air supply the length of the snorkle limited dives to twentyfive feet but in these shallow waters this was no great handicap ive put a lot of novel ideas into her said george enthusiastically those windows for instancelook at their size theyll give you a perfect view yet theyre quite safe i use the old aqualung principle to keep the airpressure hi the pompano exactly the same as the waterpressure outside so theres no strain on the hull or the ports and what happens asked harry if you get stuck on the bottom i open the door and get out of course there are a couple of spare aqualungs in the cabin as well as a liferaft with a waterproof radio so that we can always yell for help if we get in trouble dont worryive thought of everything famous last words muttered harry but he decided that after the ride down from boston he undoubtedly had a charmed life the sea was probably a safer place than us with george at the wheel he made himself thoroughly familiar with the escape arrangements before they set out and was fairly happy when he saw how well designed and constructed the little craft appeared to be the fact that a lawyer had produced such a neat piece of marine engineering in his spare time was not in the least unusual harry had long ago discovered that a considerable number of americans put quite as much effort into their hobbies as into their professions they chugged out of the little harbour keeping to the marked channel until they were well clear of the coast the sea was calm and as the shore receded the water became steadily more and more transparent they were leaving behind the fog of pulverized coral which clouded the coastal waters where the waves were incessantly tearing at the land after thirty minutes they had come to the reef visible below them as a kind of patchwork quilt above which multicolored fish pirouetted to and fro george closed the hatches opened the valve of the buoyancy tanks and said gaily here we go the wrinkled silk veil lifted crept past the window distorting all vision for a momentand then they were through no longer aliens looking into the world of waters but denizens of that world themselves they were floating above a valley carpeted with white sand and surrounded by low hills of coral the valley itself was barren but the hills around it were alive with things that grew things that crawled and things that swam fish as dazzling as neon signs wandered lazily among the animals that looked like trees it seemed not only a breathtakingly lovely but also a peaceful world there was no haste no sign of the struggle for existence harry knew very well that this was an illusion but during all the time they were submerged he never saw one fish attack another he mentioned this to george who commented yes thats a funny thing about fish they seem to have definite feeding times you can see barracuda swimming around and if the dinner gong hasnt gone the other fish wont take any notice of them a ray looking like some fantastic black butterfly flapped its way across the sand balancing itself with its long whiplike tail the sensitive feelers of a crayfish waved cautiously from a crack in the coral the exploring gestures reminded harry of a soldier testing for snipers with his hat on a stick there was so much life of so many kinds crammed in this single spot that it would take years of study to recognize it all the pompano cruised very slowly along the valley while george gave a running commentary i used to do this sort of thing with the aqualung he said but then i decided how nice it would be to sit in comfort and have an engine to push me around then i could stay out all day take a meal along use my cameras and not give a damn if a shark was sneaking up on me there goes a tangdid you ever see such a brilliant blue in your life besides i could show my friends around down here while still being able to talk to them thats one big handicap with ordinary diving gearyoure deaf and dumb and have to talk hi signs look at those angelfishone day im going to fix up a net to catch some of them see the way they vanish when theyre edgeon another reason why i built the pompano was so that i could look for wrecks there are hundreds in this area its an absolute graveyard the santa margarita is only about fifty miles from here in biscayne bay she went down in with seven million dollars of bullion aboard and theres a little matter of sixtyfive million off long cay where fourteen galleons sank hi the trouble is of course that most of these wrecks have been smashed up and overgrown with coral so it wouldnt do you a lot of good even if you did locate them but its fun to try by this time harry had begun to appreciate his friends psychology he could think of few better ways of escaping from a new england law practice george was a repressed romanticand not such a repressed one either now that he came to think of it they cruised along happily for a couple of hours keeping in water that was never more than forty feet deep once they grounded on a dazzling stretch of broken coral and took time off for liverwurst sandwiches and glasses of beer i drank some ginger beer down here once said george when i came up the gas inside me expanded and it was a very odd sort of feeling must try it with champagne some day harry was just wondering what to do with the empties when the pompano seemed to go into eclipse as a dark shadow drifted overhead looking up through the observation window he saw that a ship was moving slowly past twenty feet above their heads there was no danger of a collision as they had pulled down their snort for just this reason and were subsisting for the moment on their capital as far as air was concerned harry had never seen a ship from underneath and began to add another novel experience to the many he had acquired today he was quite proud of the fact that despite his ignorance of matters nautical he was just as quick as george at spotting what was wrong with the vessel sailing overhead instead of the normal shaft and screw this ship had a long tunnel running the length of its keel as it passed above them the pompano was rocked by the sudden rush of water ill be damned said george grabbing the controls that looks like some kind of jet propulsion system its about time somebody tried one out lets have a look he pushed up the periscope and discovered that the ship slowly cruising past them was the valency of new orleans thats a funny name he said what does it mean i would say answered harry that it means the owner is a chemistexcept for the fact that no chemist would ever make enough money to buy a ship like that im going to follow her decided george shes only making five knots and id like to see how that dingus works he elevated the snort got the diesel running and started in pursuit after a brief chase the pompano drew within fifty feet of the valency and harry felt rather like a submarine commander about to launch a torpedo they couldnt miss from this distance in fact they nearly made a direct hit for the valency suddenly slowed to a halt and before george realized what had happened he was alongside her no signals he complained without much logic a minute later it was clear that the manoeuvre was no accident a lasso dropped neatly over the pompanos snorkle and they were efficiently gaffed there was nothing to do but emerge rather sheepishly and make the best of it fortunately their captors were reasonable men and could recognize the truth when they heard it fifteen minutes after coming aboard the valency george and harry were sitting on the bridge while a uniformed steward brought them highballs and they listened attentively to the theories of dr gilbert romano they were still both a little overawed at being hi dr romanos presence it was rather like meeting a live rockefeller or a reigning du pont the doctor was a phenomenon virtually unknown hi europe and unusual even hi the united statesthe big scientist who had become a bigger business man he was now hi his late seventies and had just been retiredafter a considerable tusslefrom the chairmanship of the vast chemical engineering firm he had founded it is rather amusing harry told us to notice the subtle social distinctions which differences in wealth can produce even in the most democratic country by harrys standards george was a very rich man his income was around a hundred thousand dollars a year but dr romano was hi another price range altogether and had to be treated accordingly with a kind of friendly respect which had nothing to do with obsequiousness on his side the doctor was perfectly free and easy there was nothing about him that gave any impression of wealth if one ignored such trivia as hundredandfiftyfoot oceangoing yachts the fact that george was on firstname terms with most of the doctors business acquaintances helped to break the ice and to establish the purity of their motives harry spent a boring half hour while business deals ranging over half the united states were discussed hi terms of what bill soandso did in pittsburgh who joe somebody else ran into at the bankers club hi houston how clyde thingummy happened to be playing golf at augusta while ike was there it was a glimpse of a mysterious world where immense power was wielded by men who all seemed to have gone to the same colleges or who at any rate belonged to the same clubs harry soon became aware of the fact that george was not merely paying court to dr romano because that was the polite thing to do george was too shrewd a lawyer to miss this chance of building up some goodwill and appeared to have forgotten all about the original purpose of their expedition harry had to wait for a suitable gap in the conversation before he could raise the subject which really interested him when it dawned on dr romano that he was talking to another scientist he promptly abandoned finance and george was the one who was left out in the cold the thing that puzzled harry was why a distinguished chemist should be interested in marine propulsion being a man of direct action he challenged the doctor on this point for a moment the scientist appeared a little embarrassed and harry was about to apologize for his inquisitivenessa feat that would have required real effort on his part but before he could do this dr romano had excused himself and disappeared into the bridge he came back five minutes later with a rather satisfied expression and continued as if nothing had happened a very natural question mr purvis he chuckled id have asked it myself but do you really expect me to tell you erit was just a vague sort of hope confessed harry then im going to surprise yousurprise you twice in fact im going to answer you and im going to show you that im not passionately interested in marine propulsion those bulges on the bottom of my ship which you were inspecting with such great interest do contain the screws but they also contain a good deal else as well let me give you continued dr romano now obviously warming up to his subject a few elementary statistics about the ocean we can see a lot of it from here quite a few square miles did you know that every cubic mile of seawater contains a hundred and fifty million tons of minerals frankly no said george its an impressive thought its impressed me for a long time said the doctor here we go grubbing about in the earth for our metals and chemicals while every element that exists can be found in sea water the ocean in fact is a kind of universal mine which can never be exhausted we may plunder the land but well never empty the sea men have already started to mine the sea you know dow chemicals have been taking out bromine for years every cubic mile contains about three hundred thousand tons more recently weve started to do something about the five million tons of magnesium per cubic mile b that sort of thing is merely a beginning the great practical problem is that most of the elements present in seawater are in such low concentrations the first seven elements make up about percent of t total and its the remaining one percent that contains the useful metals except magnesium all my life ive wondered how we could do something about this and the answer came during the war i don know if youre familiar with the techniques used in atomic energy field to remove minute quantities of isotopes from solutions some of those methods are still pre much under wraps are you talking about ionexchange resins hazard harry wellsomething similar my firm developed several of these techniques on aec contracts and i realized at once that they would have wider applications i put some of my bright young men to work and they have made what we call a molecular sieve thats a mighty descriptive expression in its way the thing is a sieve and we can set it to select anything we like it depends on very advanced wavemechanical theories for its operation but what it actually does is absurdly simple we can choose any component of seawater we like and get the sieve to take it out with several units working in series we can take out one element after another the efficiencys quite high and the power consumption negligible i know yelped george youre extracting gold from seawater huh snorted dr romano in tolerant disgust ive got better things to do with my time too much damn gold around anyhow im after the commercially useful metalsthe ones our civilisation is going to be desperately short of in another couple of generations and as a matter of fact even with my sieve it wouldnt be worth going after gold there are only about fifty pounds of the stuff every cubic mile what about uranium asked harry or is that scarier still i rather wish you hadnt asked that question replied t romano with a cheerfulness that belied the remark but since you can look it up in any library theres no in telling you that uraniums two hundred times more common than gold about seven tons in every cubic mile a figure which is shall we say distinctly interesting so why bother about gold why indeed echoed george to continue said dr romano duly continuing even with the molecular sieve weve still got the problem processing enormous volumes of seawater there are number of ways one could tackle this you could build giant pumping stations for example but ive always been keen on killing two birds with one stone and the other day i did a little calculation that gave the most surprising result i found that every time the queen mary crosses the atlantic her screws chew up about a tenth of a cubic mile of water fifteen million tons of minerals in other words or to take the case you indiscreetly mentioned almost a ton of uranium on every atlantic crossing quite a thought isnt it so it seemed to me that all we need do to create a very useful mobile extraction plant was to put the screws of any vessel inside a tube which would compel the slipstream to pass through one of my sieves of course theres a certain loss of propulsive power but our experimental unit works very well we cant go quite as fast as we did but the further we cruise the more money we make from our mining operations dont you think the shipping companies will find that very attractive but of course thats merely incidental i look forward to the building of floating extraction plants that will cruise round and round in the ocean until theyve filled their hoppers with anything you care to name when that day comes well be able to stop tearing up the land and all our material shortages will be over everything goes back to the sea in the long run anyway and once weve unlocked that treasurechest well be all set for eternity for a moment there was silence on deck save for the faint clink of ice in the tumblers while dr romanos guests contemplated this dazzling prospect then harry was struck by a sudden thought this is quite one of the most important inventions ive ever heard of he said thats why i find it rather that you should have confided in us so fully after all were perfect strangers and for all you know might be spying on you the old scientist chortled gaily dont worry about that my boy he reassured harry ive already been on to washington and had my friends check up on you harry blinked for a minute then realized how it had been done he remembered dr romanos brief disappearance and could picture what had happened there would have been a radio call to washington some senator would have got on to the embassy the ministry of supply representative would have done his bitand in five minutes the doctor would have got the answer he wanted yes americans were very efficientthose who could afford to be it was about this time that harry became aware of the fact that they were no longer alone a much larger and more impressive yacht than the valency was heading towards them and in a few minutes he was able to read the name sea spray such a name he thought was more appropriate to billowing sails than throbbing diesels but there was no doubt that the spray was a very pretty creature indeed he could understand the looks of undisguised covetousness that both george and dr romano now plainly bore the sea was so calm that the two yachts were able to come alongside each other and as soon as they had made contact a sunburned energetic man in the late forties vaulted over on to the deck of the valency he strode up to dr romano shook his hand vigorously said well you old rascal what are you up to and then looked enquiringly at the rest of the company the doctor carried out the introductions it seemed that they had been boarded by professor scott mckenzie whod been sailing his yacht down from key largo oh no cried harry to himself this is too much one millionaire scientist per day is all i can stand but there was no getting away from it true mckenzie very seldom seen in the academic cloisters but he was a genuine professor none the less holding the chair of geophysics at some texas college ninety percent of his time however he spent working for the big oil companies and running a consulting firm of his own it rather looked as if he had made his torsion balances and seismographs pay quite well for themselves in fact though he was a much younger man than dr romano he had even more money owing to being in a more rapidly expanding industry harry gathered that the peculiar tax laws of the sovereign state of texas also had something do with it it seemed an unlikely coincidence that these two scientific tycoons should have met by chance and harry waited to see what skullduggery was afoot for a while the conversation was confined to generalities but it was obvious that professor mckenzie was extremely inquisitive about the doctors other two guests not long after they had been introduced he made some excuse to hop back to his own ship and harry moaned inwardly if the embassy got two separate enquiries about him in the space of half an hour theyd wonder what hed been up to it might even make the fbi suspicious and then how would he get those promised twentyfour pairs of nylons out of the country harry found it quite fascinating to study the relation between the two scientists they were like a couple of fighting cocks circling for position romano treated the younger man with a downright rudeness which harry suspected concealed a grudging admiration it was clear that dr romano was an almost fanatical conservationist and regarded the activities of mckenzie and his employers with the greatest disapproval youre a gang of robbers he said once youre seeing how quickly you can loot this planet of its resources and you dont give a damn about the next generation and what answered mckenzie not very originally has the next generation ever done for us the sparring continued for the best part of an hour and much of what went on was completely over harrys head he wondered why he and george were being allowed to sit in on all this and after a while he began to appreciate dr romanos technique he was an opportunist of genius he was glad to keep them round now that they had turned up just to worry professor mckenzie and to make him wonder what other deals were afoot he let the molecular sieve leak out bit by bit as if it wasnt really important and he was only mentioning it in passing professor mckenzie however latched on to it at once and the more evasive romano became the more insistent was his adversary it was obvious that he w being deliberately coy and that though professor mckenzie knew this perfectly well he couldnt help playing the older scientists game dr romano had been discussing the device in a peculiarly oblique fashion as if it were a future project rather than an existing fact he outlined its staggering possibilities and explained how it would make all existing forms of mining obsolete besides removing forever the danger of world metal shortages if its so good exclaimed mckenzie presently why havent you made the thing what do you think im doing out here in the gulf stream retorted the doctor take a look at this he opened a locker beneath the sonar set and pulled out a small metal bar which he tossed to mckenzie it looked like lead and was obviously extremely heavy the professor hefted it in his hand and said at once uranium do you mean to say yesevery gram and theres plenty more where that came from he turned to harrys friend and said georgewhat about taking the professor down in your submarine to have a look at the works he wont see much but itll show him were in business mckenzie was still so thoughtful that he took a little like a private submarine in his stride he returned the surface fifteen minutes later having seen just enough to whet his appetite the first thing i want to know he said to romano is why youre showing this to me its about the biggest thing that ever happenedwhy isnt your own firm handling it romano gave a little snort of disgust you know ive had a row with the board he said anyway that lot of old deadbeats couldnt handle anyas big as this i hate to admit it but you texas piare the boys for the job this is a private venture of yours yes the company knows nothing about it and ive sunk half a million of my own money into it its been a kind of hobby of mine i felt someone had to undo the age that was going on the rape of the continents by people like all rightweve heard that before yet you propose giving it to us who said anything about giving there was a pregnant silence then mckenzie said cautiously of course theres no need to tell you that we be interestedvery interested if youll let us have the figures on efficiency extraction rates and all the other relevant statisticsno need to tell us the actual technical details if you dont want tothen well be able to talk business i cant really speak for my associates but im sure that they can raise enough cover to make any deal scott said romanoand his voice now held a note of tiredness that for the first time reflected his ageim not interested in doing a deal with your partners i havent time to haggle with the boys in the front room and their lawyers and their lawyers lawyers fifty years ive doing that sort of thing and believe me im tired is my development it was done with my money and the equipment is in my ship i want to do a personal de direct with you you can handle it from then on mckenzie blinked i couldnt swing anything as big as this he protested sure i appreciate the offer but if this does what you say its worth billions and im just a poor but honest millionaire money im no longer interested in what would i with it at my time of life no scott theres just one thing i want nowand i want it right away this minute give me the sea spray and you can have my process youre crazy why even with inflation you co build the spray for inside a million and your process must be worth im not arguing scott what you say is true but id an old man in a hurry and it would take me a year to get a ship like yours built ive wanted her ever since you showed her to me back at miami my proposal that you take over the valency with all her lab equip ment and records it will only take an hour to swap out personal effectsweve a lawyer here who can make it all legal and then im heading out into the caribbean down through the islands and across the pacific youve got it all worked out said mckenzie in awed wonder yes you can take it or leave it i never heard such a crazy deal in my life said mckenzie somewhat petulantly of course ill take it i know a stubborn old mule when i see one the next hour was one of frantic activity sweating crewmembers rushed back and forth with suitcases and bundles while dr romano sat happily in the midst of the turmoil he had created a blissful smile upon his wrinkled old face george and professor mckenzie went into a legal huddle and emerged with a document which romano signed with hardly a glance unexpected things began to emerge from the sea spray such as a beautiful mutation mink and a beautiful nonmutation blonde hello sylvia said dr romano politely im afraid find the quarters here a little more cramped the professor never mentioned you were aboard never mind we wont mention it either not actually in the contract a gentlemans agreement shall we say it would be such a pity to upset mrs mckenzie i dont know what you mean pouted sylvia someone has to do all the professors typing and you do it damn badly my dear said mckenzie assisting her over the rail with true southern gallantry couldnt help admiring his composure in such an embarrassing situationhe was by no means sure that he would have managed as well but he wished he had the opportunity to find out at last the chaos subsided the stream of boxes and bundles subsided to a trickle dr romano shook hands with everybody thanked george and harry for their assistance strode to the bridge of the sea spray and ten minutes later was halfway to the horizon f harry was wondering if it wasnt about time for them to take their departure as wellthey had never got round to explaining to professor mckenzie what they were doing here in the first placewhen the radiotelephone started calling dr romano was on the line forgotten his toothbrush i suppose said george it was not quite as trivial as that fortunately the loudspeaker was switched on eavesdropping was practically forced upon them and required none of the effort that makes it so embarrassing to a gentleman look here scott said dr romano i think i owe you some sort of explanation if youve gypped me ill have you for every cent oh its not like that but i did rather pressurize you though everything i said was perfectly true dont get too annoyed with meyouve got a bargain itll be a long time though before it makes you any money and youll j have to sink a few millions of your own into it first you see the efficiency has to be increased by about three orders of magnitude before it will be a commercial proposition that bar of uranium cost me a couple of thou sand dollars now dont blow your topit can be done im certain of that dr kendall is the man to get he all the basic workhire him away from my people he ever much it costs you youre a stubborn cuss and know youll finish the job now its on your hands thats why i wanted you to have it poetic justice tooyoull be able to repay some of the damage youve done to land too bad itll make you a billionaire but that cant be helped wait a minutedont cut hi on me id have finished the job myself if i had the time but itll take at least thr more years and the doctors say ive only got six months i wasnt kidding when i said i was in a hurry im gla i clinched the deal without having to tell you that but believe me id have used it as a weapon if i had to just one thing morewhen you do get the process working name it after me will you thats allits no use calling me back i wont answerand i know you cant cab me professor mckenzie didnt turn a hair i thought it was something like that he said to one in particular then he sat down produced an elaborate pocket sliderule and became oblivious to the work he scarcely looked up when george and harry feeling very much outclassed made their polite departure and silently snorkeled away like so many things that happen these days concluded harry purvis i still dont know the final outcome of this meeting i rather imagine that professor mckenzie has run into some snags or wed have heard rumors about the process by now but ive not the slightest doubt that sooner or later itll be perfected so get ready to sell your mining shares as for dr romano he wasnt kidding though his doctors were a little out in their estimates he lasted a full year and i guess the sea spray helped a lot they buried him in midpacific and its just occurred to me that the old boy would have appreciated that i told you what fanatical conservationist he was and its a piquant thought even now some of his atoms may be going through his own molecular sieve i notice some incredulous looks but its a fact if you ok a tumbler of water poured it into the ocean mixed ell then filled the glass from the sea thered still be some scores of molecules of water from the original sample in the tumbler so he gave a gruesome little buckleits only a matter of tune before not only dr romano but all of us make some contribution to the eve and with that thought gentlemen i bid you all a pleasant goodnight the reluctant orchid though few people in the white hart will concede at any of harry purvis stories are actually true everyone agrees that some are much more probable than others and on any scale of probability the affair of the reluctant orchid must rate very low indeed i dont remember what ingenious gambit harry used to launch this narrative maybe some orchid fancier brought i latest monstrosity into the bar and that set him off no alter i do remember the story and after all thats what its the adventure did not this time concern any of harrys numerous relatives and he avoided explaining just how he managed to know so many of the sordid details the heroif you can call him thatof this hot house epic was an inoffensive little clerk named hercules keating and if you think that is the most unlikely part of the story just stick round a while hercules is not the sort of name you can carry off lightly at the best of times and when you are four loot nine and look as if youll have to take a physical culture course before you can even become a pound weakling it is a positive embarrassment perhaps it helped to explain why hercules had very little social life and all his real friends grew in pots in a humid conservatory at the bottom of his garden his needs were simple and he spent very little money on himself consequently his collection of orchids and cacti was really rather remarkable indeed he had a wide reputation among the fraternity of cactophiles and often received from remote corners of the globe parcels smelling of mould and tropical jungles hercules had only one living relative and it would have been hard to find a greater contrast than aunt henrietta she was a massive six footer usually wore a rather loud line in harris tweeds drove a jaguar with reckless skill and chainsmoked cigars her parents had set their heart on a boy and had never been able to decide whether not their wish had been granted henrietta earned a living and quite a good one breeding dogs of various shapes and sizes she was seldom without a couple of her latest models and they were not the type of portable canine which ladies like to carry hi their handbags the keating kennels specialized hi great danes alsatians and sain bernards henrietta rightly despising men as the weaker sex never married however for some reason she took avuncular interest hi hercules and called to see him almost every weekend it was a curious kind of relationship probably henrietta found that hercules bolstered up her feelings of superiority if be was a good example of the male sex then were certainly a pretty sorry lot yet if this was henriettas motivation she was unconscious of it and seemed genuinely fond of her nephew she was patronizing but never unkind as might be expected her attentions did not exactly help hercules own welldeveloped inferiority complex at first he had tolerated his aunt then he came to dread her regular visits her booming voice and her bonecrushing handshake and at last he grew to hate her eventually indeed his hate was the dominant emotion in his life exceeding even his love for his orchids but he was careful not to show it realizing that if aunt henrietta discovered how he felt about her she would probably break him hi two and throw the pieces to her wolf pack there was no way then in which hercules could ex press his pentup feelings he had to be polite to aunt henrietta even when he felt like murder and he often did feel like murder though he knew that there was nothing he would ever do about it until one day according to the dealer the orchid came from somewhere hi the amazon regiona rather vague postal address when hercules first saw it it was not a very prepossessing sight even to anyone who loved orchids as much as he did a shapeless root about the size of a mans fistthat was all it was redolent of decay and there was the faintest hint of a rank carrion smell hercules was not even sure that it was viable and told the dealer as much perhaps that enabled him to purchase it for a trifling sum and he carried it home without much enthusiasm it showed no signs of life for the first month but that did not worry hercules then one day a tiny green shoot appeared and started to creep up to the light after that progress was rapid soon there was a thick fleshy stem as big as a mans forearm and colored a positively virulent green near the top of the stem a series of curious bulges circled the plant otherwise it was completely featureless hercules was now quite excited he was sure that some entirely new species had swum into his ken the rate of growth was now really fantastic soon the plant was taller than hercules not that that was saying a great deal moreover the bulges seemed to be developing and it looked as if at any moment the orchid would burst into bloom hercules waited anxiously knowing how shortlived some flowers can be and spent as much time as he possibly could in the hothouse despite all his watchfulness the transformation occurred one night whiles he was asleep in the morning the orchid was fringed by a series of eight dangling tendrils almost reaching to the ground they must have developed inside the plant and emerged withfor the vegetable worldexplosive speed hercules stared at the phenomenon in amazement and went very thoughtfully to work that evening as he watered the plant and checked its soil he noticed a still more peculiar fact the tendrils were thickening and they were not completely motionless they had a slight but unmistakable tendency to vibrate as if possessing a life of their own even hercules for all his interest and enthusiasm found this more than a little disturbing a few days later there was no doubt about it at all when he approached the orchid the tendrils swayed towards nun in an unpleasantly suggestive fashion the impression of hunger was so strong that hercules began to feel very uncomfortable indeed and something started to nag at the back of his mind it was quite a while before he could recall what it was then he said to himself of course how stupid of me and went along to the local library here he spent a most interesting halfhour rereading a little piece by one h g wells entitled the flowering of the strange orchid my goodness thought hercules when he had finished the tale as yet there had been no stupifying odor which might overpower the plants intended victim but otherwise the characteristics were all too similar hercules went home in a very unsettled mood indeed he opened the conservatory door and stood looking along the avenue of greenery towards his prize specimen he judged the length of the tendrilsalready he found himself calling them tentacleswith great care and walked to within what appeared a safe distance the plant certainly had an impression of alertness and menace far more appropriate to the animal than the vegetable kingdom hercules remembered the unfortunate history of doctor frankenstein and was not amused but really this was ridiculous such things didnt happen in real life well there was one way to put matters to the test hercules went into the house and came back a few minutes later with a broomstick to the end of which he had attached a piece of raw meat feeling a considerable fool he advanced towards the orchid as a liontamer might approach one of his charges at mealtune for a moment nothing happened then two of the tendrils developed an agitated twitch they began to sway back and forth as if the plant was making up its mind abruptly they whipped out with such speed that they practically vanished from view they wrapped themselves round the meat and hercules felt a powerful tug at the end of his broomstick then the meat was gone the orchid was clutching it if one may mix metaphors slightly to its bosom jumping jehosophat yelled hercules it was very seldom indeed that he used such strong language the orchid showed no further signs of life for twentyfour hours it was waiting for the meat to become high and it was also developing its digestive system by the next day a network of what looked like short roots had covered the still visible chunk of meat by nightfall the meat was gone the plant had tasted blood hercules emotions as he watched over his prize were curiously mixed there were times when it almost gave him nightmares and he foresaw a whole range of horrid possibilities the orchid was now extremely strong and if he got within its clutches he would be done for but of course there was not the slightest danger of that he had arranged a system of pipes so that it could be watered from a safe distance and its less orthodox food he simply tossed within range of its tentacles it was now eating a pound of raw meat a day and he had an uncomfortable feeling that it could cope with much larger quantities if given the opportunity hercules natural qualms were on the whole outweighed by his feeling of triumph that such a botanical marvel had fallen into his hands whenever he chose he could become the most famous orchidgrower in the world it was typical of his somewhat restricted viewpoint that it never occurred to him that other people besides orchidfanciers might be interested in his pet the creature was now about six feet tall and apparently still growingthough much more slowly than it had been all the other plants had been moved from its end of the conservatory not so much because hercules feared that it might be cannibalistic as to enable him to tend them without danger he had stretched a rope across the central aisle so that there was no risk of his accidentally walking within range of those eight dangling arms it was obvious that the orchid had a highly developed nervous system and something very nearly approaching intelligence it knew when it was going to be fed and exhibited unmistakable signs of pleasure most fantastic of allthough hercules was still not sure about thisit seemed capable of producing sounds there were times just before a meal when he fancied he could hear an incredibly highpitched whistle skirting the edge of audibility a newborn bat might have had such a voice he wondered what purpose it served did the orchid somehow lure its prey into its clutches by sound if so he did not think the technique would work on him while hercules was making these interesting discoveries he continued to be fussed over by aunt henrietta and assaulted by her hounds which were never as housetrained as she claimed them to be she would usually roar up the street on a sunday afternoon with one dog in the seat beside her and another occupying most of the baggage compartment then she would bound up the steps two at a time nearly deafen hercules with her greeting half paralyze him with her handshake and blow cigar smoke in his face there had been a tune when he was terrified that she would kiss him but he had long since realized that such effeminate behaviour was foreign to her nature aunt henrietta looked upon hercules orchids with some scorn spending ones spare time in a hothouse was she considered a very effete recreation when she wanted to let off steam she went biggame hunting in kenya this did nothing to endear her to hercules who hated blood sports but despite his mounting dislike for ms overpowering aunt every sunday afternoon he dutifully prepared tea for her and they had a tкteаtкte together which on the surface at least seemed perfectly friendly henrietta never guessed that as he poured the tea hercules often wished it was poisoned she was far down beneath her extensive fortifications a fundamentally goodhearted person and the knowledge would have upset her deeply hercules did not mention his vegetable octopus to aunt henrietta he had occasionally shown her his most interesting specimens but this was something he was keeping to himself perhaps even before he had fully formulated his diabolical plan his subconscious was already preparing the ground it was late one sunday evening when the roar of the jaguar had died away into the night and hercules was restoring his shattered nerves hi the conservatory that the idea first came fullyfledged into his mind he was staring at the orchid noting how the tendrils were now as thick around as a mans thumb when a most pleasing fantasy suddenly flashed before his eyes he pictured aunt henrietta struggling helplessly in the grip of the monster unable to escape from its carnivorous clutches why it would be the perfect crime the distraught nephew would arrive on the scene too late to be of assistance and when the police answered his frantic call they would see at a glance that the whole affair was a deplorable accident true there would be an inquest but the coroners censure would be toned down in view of hercules obvious grief the more he thought of the idea the more he liked it he could see no flaws as long as the orchid cooperated that clearly would be the greatest problem he would have to plan a course of training for the creature it already looked sufficiently diabolical he must give it a disposition to suit its appearance considering that he had no prior experience in such matters and that there were no authorities he could consult hercules proceeded along very sound and businesslike lines he would use a fishing rod to dangle pieces of meat just outside the orchids range until the creature lashed its tentacles in a frenzy at such times its highpitched squeak was clearly audible and hercules wondered how it managed to produce the sound he also wondered what its organs of perception were but this was yet another mystery that could not be solved without close examination perhaps aunt henrietta if all went well would have a brief opportunity of discovering these interesting factsthough she would probably be too busy to report them for the benefit of posterity there was no doubt that the beast was quite powerful enough to deal with its intended victim it had once wrenched a broomstick out of hercules grip and although that in itself proved very little the sickening crack of the wood a moment later brought a smile of satisfaction to its trainers thin lips he began to be much more pleasant and attentive to his aunt in every respect indeed he was the model nephew when hercules considered that his picador tactics had brought the orchid into the right frame of mind he wondered if he should test it with live bait this was a problem that worried him for some weeks during which time he would look speculatively at every dog or cat he passed in the street but he finally abandoned the idea for a rather peculiar reason he was simply too kindhearted to put it into practice aunt henrietta would have to be the first victim he starved the orchid for two weeks before he put his plan into action this was as long as he dared riskhe di not wish to weaken the beastmerely to whet its appetite that the outcome of the encounter might be more certain and so when he had carried the teacups back into the kitchen and was sitting upwind of aunt henriettas cigar he said casually ive got something id like to show you auntie ive been keeping it as a surprise itll tickle you to death that he thought was not a completely accurate description but it gave the general idea auntie took the cigar out of her mouth and looked at hercules with frank surprise well she boomed wonders will never cease what have you been up to you rascal she slapped him playfully on the back and shot all the air out of his lungs youll never believe it gritted hercules when he had recovered his breath its in the observatory eh said auntie obviously puzzled yescome along and have a look its going to create a real sensation auntie gave a snort that might have indicated disbelief but followed hercules without further question the two alsatians now busily chewing up the carpet looked at her anxiously and half rose to their feet but she waved them away all right boys she ordered gruffly ill be back in a minute hercules thought this unlikely it was a dark evening and the lights in the conservatory were off as they entered auntie snorted gad herculesthe place smells like a slaughterhouse havent met such a stink since i shot that elephant in bulawayo and we couldnt find it for a week sorry auntie apologized hercules propelling her forward through the gloom its a new fertilizer im using it produces the most stunning results go onanother couple of yards i want this to be a real surprise i hope this isnt a joke said auntie suspiciously as she stomped forward i can promise you its no joke replied hercules standing with his hand on the light switch he could just the looming bulk of the orchid auntie was now within feet of it he waited until she was well inside the danger zone and threw the switch there was a frozen moment while the scene was transfixed with light then aunt henrietta ground to a halt and stood arms akimbo in front of the giant orchid for a moment hercules was afraid she would retreat before the plant could get into action then he saw that she was calmly scrutinizing it unable to make up her mind what the devil it was it was a full five seconds before the orchid moved then the dangling tentacles flashed into actionbut not in the way that hercules had expected the plant clutched them tightly protectively around itselfand at the same time it gave a highpitched scream of pure terror in a moment of sickening disillusionment hercules realized the awful truth his orchid was an utter coward it might be able to cope with the wild life of the amazon jungle but coming suddenly upon aunt henrietta had completely broken its nerve as for its proposed victim she stood watching the creature with an astonishment which swiftly changed to another emotion she spun around on her heels and pointed an accusing finger at her nephew hercules she roared the poor things scared to death have you been bullying it hercules could only stand with his head hanging low in shame and frustration nno auntie he quavered i guess its naturally nervous well im used to animals you should have called me before you must treat them firmlybut gently kindness always works as long as you show them youre the master there there diddumsdont be frightened auntieshe wont hurt you it was thought hercules in his blank despair a revolting sight with surprising gentleness aunt henrietta fussed over the beast patting and stroking it until the tentacles relaxed and the shrill whistling scream died away after a few minutes of this pandering it appeared to get over its fright hercules finally fled with a muffled sob when one of the tentacles crept forward and began to stroke henriettas gnarled fingers from that day he was a broken man what was worse he could never escape from the consequences of his intended crime henrietta had acquired a new pet and was liable to call not only at weekends but two or three times in between as well it was obvious that she did not trust hercules to treat the orchid properly and still suspected him of bullying it she would bring tasty tidbits that even her dogs had rejected but which the orchid accepted with delight the smell which had so far been confined to the conservatory began to creep into the house and there concluded harry purvis as he brought this improbable narrative to a close the matter reststo the satisfaction of two at any rate of the parties concerned the orchid is happy and aunt henrietta has something else to dominate from time to time the creature has a nervous breakdown when a mouse gets loose in the conservatory and she rushes to console it as for hercules there is no chance that he will ever give any more trouble to either of them he seems to have sunk into a kind of vegetable sloth indeed said harry thoughtfully every day he becomes more and more like an orchid himself the harmless variety of course cold war one of the things that makes harry purvis tales so infernally convincing is their detailed verisimilitude consider for instance this example ive checked the places and information as thoroughly as i cani had to hi order to write up this accountand everything fits into place how do you explain that unlessbut judge for yourself ive often noticed harry began how tantalizing little snippets of information appear in the press and then sometimes years later one comes across their sequels ive just had a beautiful example in the spring of ive looked up the dateit was april an iceberg was reported off the coast of florida i remember spotting this news item and thinking it highly peculiar the gulf stream you know is born in the straits of florida and i didnt see how an iceberg could get that far south before it melted but i forgot about the whole business almost immediately thinking it was just another of those tall stories which the papers like to print when there isnt any real news and then about a week ago i met a friend whod been a commander in the u s navy and he told me the whole astonishing tale its such a remarkable story that i think it ought to be better known though im sure that a lot of people simply wont believe it any of you who are familiar with domestic american affairs may know that floridas claim to be the sunshine state is strongly disputed by some of the other fortyseven members of the union i dont suppose new york or maine or connecticut are very serious contenders but the state of california regards the florida claim as an almost personal affront and is always doing its best to refute it the floridians hit back by pointing to the famous los angeles smogs then the californians say with careful anxiety isnt it about time you had another hurricane and the floridians reply you can count on us when you want any earthquake relief so it goes on and this is where my friend commander dawson came into the picture the commander had been in submarines but was now retired hed been working as technical advisor on a film about the exploits of the submarine service when he was approached one day with a very peculiar proposition i wont say that the california chamber of commerce was behind it as that might be libel you can make your own guesses anyway the idea was a typical hollywood conception so i thought at first until i remembered that dear old lord dunsany had used a similar theme in one of his short stories maybe the californian sponsor was a jorkens fan just as i am the scheme was delightful in its boldness and simplicity commander dawson was offered a substantial sum of money to pilot an artificial iceberg to florida with a bonus if he could contrive to strand it on miami beach at the height of the season i need hardly say that the commander accepted with alacrity he came from kansas himself so could view the whole thing dispassionately as a purely commercial proposition he got together some of his old crew swore them to secrecy and after much waiting in washington corridors managed to obtain temporary loan of an obsolete submarine then he went to a big airconditioning company convinced them of his credit and his sanity and got the icemaking plant installed in a big blister on the subs deck it would take an impossible amount of power to make a solid iceberg even a small one so a compromise was necessary there would be an outer coating of ice a couple of feet thick but frigid freda as she was christened was to be hollow she would look quite impressive from outside but would be a typical hollywood stage set when one got behind the scenes however nobody would see her inner secrets except the commander and his men she would be set adrift when the prevailing winds and currents were in the right direction and would last long enough to cause the calculated alarm and despondency of course there were endless practical problems to be solved it would take several days of steady freezing to ate freda and she must be launched as near her objective as possible that meant that the submarinewhich well call the marlinwould have to use a base not too far from miami the florida keys were considered but at once rejected there was no privacy down there any more the fishermen now outnumbered the mosquitoes and a submarine would be spotted almost instantly even if the marlin pretended she was merely smuggling she wouldnt be able to get away with it so that plan was out there was another problem that the commander had to consider the coastal waters round florida are extremely shallow and though fredas draught would only be a couple of feet everybody knew that an honesttogoodness iceberg was nearly all below the waterline it wouldnt be very realistic to have an impressivelooking berg sailing through two feet of water that would give the show away at once i dont know exactly how the commander overcame these technical problems but i gather that he carried out several tests in the atlantic far from any shipping routes the iceberg reported in the news was one of his early productions incidentally neither freda nor her brethren would have been a danger to shippingbeing hollow they would have broken up on impact finally all the preparations were complete the martin lay out in the atlantic some distance north of miami with her icemanufacturing equipment going full blast it was a beautiful clear night with a crescent moon sulking in the west the marlin had no navigation lights but commander dawson was keeping a very strict watch for other ships on a night like this hed be able to avoid them without being spotted himself freda was still in an embryonic stage i gather that the technique used was to inflate a large plastic bag with supercooled air and spray water over it until a crust of ice formed the bag could be removed when the ice was thick enough to stand up under its own weight ice is not a very good structural material but there was no need for freda to be very big even a small iceberg would be as disconcerting to the florida chamber of commerce as a small baby to an unmarried lady commander dawson was in the conning tower watching his crew working with their sprays of icecold water and jets of freezing air they were now quite skilled at this unusual occupation and delighted hi little artistic touches however the commander had had to put a stop to attempts to reproduce marilyn monroe in icethough he filed the idea for future reference just after midnight he was startled by a flash of light in the northern sky and turned in tune to see a red glow die away on the horizon theres a plane down skipper shouted one of the lookouts i just saw it crash without hesitation the commander shouted down to the engine room and set course to the north hed got an accurate fix on the glow and judged that it couldnt be more than a few miles away the presence of freda covering most of the stern of his vessel would not affect his speed appreciably and in any case there was no way of getting rid of her quickly he stopped the freezers to give more power to the main diesels and shot ahead at full speed about thirty minutes later the lookout using powerful nightglasses spotted something lying in the water its still afloat he said some kind of airplane all rightbut i cant see any sign of life and i think the wings have come off he had scarcely finished speaking when there was an urgent report from another watcher look skipperthirty degrees to starboard whats that commander dawson swung around and whipped up his glasses he saw just visible above the water a small oval object spinning rapidly on its axis uhhuh he said im afraid weve got company thats a radar scannertheres another sub here then he brightened considerably maybe we can keep out of this after all he remarked to his second in command well watch to see that they start rescue operations then sneak away we may have to submerge and abandon freda remember theyll have spotted us by now on their radar better slacken speed and behave more like a real iceberg dawson nodded and gave the order this was getting complicated and anything might happen in the next few minutes the other sub would have observed the marlin merely as a blip on its radar screen but as soon as it upped periscope its commander would start investigating then the fat would be in the fire dawson analyzed the tactical situation the best move he decided was to employ his unusual camouflage to the full he gave the order to swing the marlin around so that her stern pointed towards the still submerged stranger when the other sub surfaced her commander would be most surprised to see an iceberg but dawson hoped he would be too busy with rescue operations to bother about freda he pointed his glasses towards the crashed plane and then had his second shock it was a very peculiar type of aircraft indeedand there was something wrong of course said dawson to his number one we should have thought of thisthat thing isnt an airplane at all its a missile from the range over at cocoalook you can see the floatation bags they must have inflated on impact and that sub was waiting out here to take it back hed remembered that there was a big missile launching range over on the east coast of florida at a pi with the unlikely name of cocoa on the still more improbable banana river well at least there was nobody in danger and if the marlin sat tight there was a sporting chance that theyd be none the worse for this diversion their engines were just turning over so that they had enough control to keep hiding behind their camouflage freda was quite large enough to conceal their conning tower and from a distance even in better light than this the marlin would be totally invisible there was one horrid possibility though the other sub might start shelling them on general principles as a menace to navigation no it would just report them by radio to coastguards which would be a nuisance but would interfere with their plans here she comes said number one what class is she they both stared through their glasses as the sub marine water pouring from its sides emerged from the faintly phosphorescent ocean the moon had now almost set and it was difficult to make out any details the radar scanner dawson was glad to see had stopped its rotation and was pointing at the crashed missile there was son thing odd about the design of that conning though then dawson swallowed hard lifted the mike to his mouth and whispered to his crew in the bowels of the marlin does anyone down there speak russian there was a long silence but presently the engineer officer climbed up into the conning tower i know a bit skipper he said my grandparents i came from the ukraine whats the trouble take a look at this said dawson grimly theres an interesting piece of poaching going on here i think we ought to stop it harry purvis has a most annoying habit of breaking off i just when a story reaches its climax and ordering another beeror more usually getting someone else to buy him lone ive watched him do this so often that now i can just when the climax is coming by the level in his glass we had to wait with what patience we could while refueled when you think about it he said thoughtfully it was jolly hard luck on the commander of that russian submarine i imagine they shot him when he got back to vladivostock or wherever he came from for what court of inquiry would have believed his story if he was fool i enough to tell the truth hed have said we were just off the florida coast when an iceberg shouted at us in russian excuse mei think thats our property since would be a couple of mvd men aboard the ship poor guy would have had to make up some kind of story but whatever he said wouldnt be very convincing as dawson had calculated the russian sub simply for it as soon as it knew it had been spotted and remembering that he was an officer on the reserve and that his duty to his country was more important than his contractual obligations to any single state the commander the marlin really had no choice in his subsequent actions he picked up the missile defrosted freda and set for cocoafirst sending a radio message that a great flurry hi the navy department and started destroyers racing out into the atlantic perhaps inquisitive never got back to vladivostock after all the subsequent explanations were a little embarrassing but i gather that the rescued missile was so important that no one asked too many questions about the martins private war the attack on miami beach had to be called off however at least until the next season its satisfactory to relate that even the sponsors of the project though they had sunk a lot of money into it werent too disappointed they each have a certificate signed by the chief of naval operations thanking them for valuable but unspecified services to their country these cause i such envy and mystification to all their los angeles friends that they wouldnt part with them for anything i yet i dont want you to think that nothing more will ever come of the whole project you ought to know american publicity men better than that freda may be in suspended animation but one day shell be revived all the plans are ready down to such little details as the dental presence of a hollywood film unit on miami beach when freda comes sailing in from the atlantic so this is one of those stories i cant round off to a nice neat ending the preliminary skirmishes have taken place but the main engagement is still to come and this is the thing i often wonder aboutwhat will florida do to the californians when it discovers whats going on any suggestions anybody what goes up one of the reasons why i am never too specific about the exact location of the white hart is frankly because we want to keep it to ourselves this is not merely a doginthemanger attitude we have to do it in pure selfprotection as soon as it gets around that scientists editors and sciencefiction writers are forgathering at some locality the weirdest collection of visitors is likely to turn up peculiar people with new theories of the universe characters who have been cleared by dianetics intense ladies who are liable to go all clairvoyant after the fourth ginthese are the less exotic specimens worst of all however are the flying sorcerers no cure short of mayhem has yet been discovered for them it was a black day when one of the leading exponents of the flying saucer religion discovered our hideout and fell upon us with shrill cries of delight here he obviously told himself was fertile ground for his missionary activities people who were already interested in spaceflight and even wrote books and stories about its imminent achievement would be a pushover he opened his little black bag and produced the latest pile of sauceriana it was quite a collection there were some interesting photographs of flying saucers made by an amateur astronomer who lives right beside greenwich observatory and whose busy camera has recorded such a remarkable variety of spaceships in all shapes and sizes that one wonders what the professionals next door are doing for their salaries then there was a long statement from a gentleman in texas who had just had a casual chat with the occupants of a saucer making a wayside halt on route to venus language it seemed had presented no difficulties it had taken about ten minutes of armwaving to get from meman thisearth to highly esoteric information about the use of the fourth dimension in spacetravel the masterpiece however was an excited letter from a character in south dakota who had actually been offered a lift in a flying saucer and had been taken for a spin round the moon he explained at some length how the saucer travelled by hauling itself along magnetic lines of force rather like a spider going up its thread it was at this point that harry purvis rebelled he had been listening with a professional pride to tales which even he would never have dared to spin for he was an expert at detecting the yieldpoint of his audiences credulity at the mention of lines of magnetic force however his scientific training overcame his frank admiration of these latterday munchausens and he gave a snort of disgust thats a lot of nonsense he said i can prove it to youmagnetisms my speciality last week said drew sweetly as he filled two glasses of ale at once you said that crystal structure was your speciality harry gave him a superior smile im a general specialist he said loftily to get back to where i was before that interruption the point i want to make is that theres no such thing as a line of magnetic force its a mathematical fictionexactly on a par with lines of longitude or latitude now if anyone said theyd invented a machine that worked by pulling itself along parallels of latitude everybody would know that they were talking drivel but because few people know much about magnetism and it sounds rather mysterious crackpots like this guy in south dakota can get away with the tripe weve just been hearing theres one charming characteristic about the white hartwe may fight among each other but we show an impressive solidarity in tunes of crisis everyone felt that something had to be done about our unwelcome visitor for one thing he was interfering with the serious business of drinking fanaticism of any kind casts a gloom over the most festive assembly and several of the regulars had shown signs of leaving despite the fact that it was still two hours to closing tune so when harry purvis followed up his attack by concocting the most outrageous story that even he had ever presented in the white hart no one interrupted him or tried to expose the weak points in his narrative we knew that harry was acting for us allhe was fighting fire with fire as it were and we knew that he wasnt expecting us to believe him so we just sat back and enjoyed ourselves if you want to know how to propel spaceships began harry and mark you im not saying anything one way or the other about the existence of flying saucersthen you must forget magnetism you must go straight to gravitythats the basic force of the universe after all but its going to be a tricky force to handle and if you dont believe me just listen to what happened only last year to a scientist down in australia i shouldnt really tell you this i suppose because im not sure of its security classification but if theres any trouble ill swear that i never said a word the aussies as you may know have always been pretty hot on scientific research and they had one team working on fast reactorsthose housebroken atomic bombs which are so much more compact than the old uranium piles the head of the group was a bright but rather impetuous young nuclear physicist ill call dr cavor that of course wasnt his real name but its a very appropriate one youll all recollect im sure the scientist cavor in wells first men in the moon and the wonderful gravityscreening material cavorite he discovered im afraid dear old wells didnt go into the question of cavorite very thoroughly as he put it it was opaque to gravity just as a sheet of metal is opaque to light anything placed above a horizontal sheet of cavorite therefore became weightless and floated up into space well it isnt as simple as that weight represents energyan enormous amount of itwhich cant just be destroyed without any fuss youd have to put a terrific amount of work into even a small object in order to make it weightless antigravity screens of the cavorite type therefore are quite impossibletheyre in the same class as perpetual motion three of my friends have made perpetual motion machines began our unwanted visitor rather stuffily harry didnt let him get any further he just steamed on and ignored the interruption now our australian dr cavor wasnt searching for antigravity or anything like it in pure science you can be pretty sure that nothing fundamental is ever discovered by anyone whos actually looking for itthats half the fun of the game dr cavor was interested in producing atomic power what he found was antigravity and it was quite some time before he realised that was what hed discovered what happened i gather was this the reactor was of a novel and rather daring design and there was quite a possibility that it might blow up when the last pieces of fissile material were inserted so it was assembled by remote control in one of australias numerous convenient deserts all the final operations being observed through tv sets well there was no explosionwhich would have caused a nasty radioactive mess and wasted a lot of money but wouldnt have damaged anything except a lot of reputations what actually happened was much more unexpected and much more difficult to explain when the last piece of enriched uranium was inserted the control rods pulled out and the reactor brought up to criticallyeverything went dead the meters in the remote control room two miles from the reactor all dropped back to zero the tv screen went blank cavor and his colleagues waited for the bang but there wasnt one they looked at each other for a moment with many wild surmises then without a word they climbed up out of the buried control chamber the reactor building was completely unchanged it sat out there in the desert a commonplace cube of brick holding a million pounds worth of fissile material and several years of careful design and development cavor wasted no tune he grabbed the jeep switched on a portable geiger counter and hurried off to see what had happened he recovered consciousness in hospital a couple of hours later there was little wrong with him apart from a bad headache which was nothing to the one his experiment was going to give him during the next few days it seemed that when he got to within twenty feet of the reactor his jeep had hit something with a terrific crash cavor had got tangled in the steering wheel and had a nice collection of bruises the geiger counter oddly enough was quite undamaged and was still clucking away quietly to itself detecting no more than the normal cosmicray background seen from a distance it had looked a perfectly normal sort of accident that might have been caused by the jeep going into a rut but cavor hadnt been driving all that fast luckily for him and anyway there was no rut at the scene of the crash what the jeep had run into was something quite impossible it was an invisible wall apparently the lower rim of a hemispherical dome which entirely surrounded the reactor stones thrown up in the air slid back to the ground along the surface of this dome and it also extended underground as far as digging could be carried out it seemed as if the reactor was at the exact center of an impenetrable spherical shell of course this was marvellous news and cavor was out of bed in no time scattering nurses in all directions he had no idea what had happened but it was a lot more exciting than the humdrum piece of nuclear engineering that had started the whole business by now youre probably all wondering what the devil a sphere of forceas you sciencefiction writers would call ithas to do with antigravity so ill jump several days and give you the answers that cavor and his team discovered only after much hard work and the consumption of many gallons of that potent australian beer the reactor when it had been energised had somehow produced an antigravity field all the matter inside a twentyfootradius sphere had been made weightless and the enormous amount of energy needed to do this had been extracted in some utterly mysterious manner from the uranium in the pile calculations showed that the amount of energy in the reactor was just sufficient to do the job presumably the sphere of force would have been larger still if there had been more ergs available in the powersource i can hear someone just waiting to ask a question so anticipate them why didnt this weightless sphere of earth and air float up into space well the earth was held together by its cohesion anyway so there was no reason why it should go wandering off as for the air that was forced to stay inside the zone of zerogravity for a most surprising and subtle reason which leads me to the crux of this whole peculiar business better fasten your seatbelts for the next bit weve got a bumpy passage ahead those of you who know something about potential theory wont have any trouble and ill do my best to make it as easy as i can for the rest people who talk glibly about antigravity seldom stop to consider its implications so lets look at a few fundamentals as ive already said weight implies energylots of it that energy is entirely due to earths gravity field you remove an objects weight thats precisely equivalent to taking it clear outside earths gravity and any rocket engineer will tell you how much energy that requires harry turned to me and said theres an analogy id like to borrow from one of your books arthur that puts across the point im trying to make you knowcomparing the fight against earths gravity to climbing out of a deep pit youre welcome i said i pinched it from doc richardson anyway oh replied harry i thought it was too good to be original well here we go if you hang on to this really very simple idea youll be o k to take an object clear away from the earth requires as much work as lifting it four thousand miles against the steady drag of normal gravity now the matter inside cavors zone of force was still on the earths surface but it was weightless from the energy point of view therefore it was outside the earths gravity field it was inaccessible as if it was on top of a four thousand mile high mountain cavor could stand outside the antigravity zone and look into it from a point a few inches away to cross those few inches he would have to do as much work as if he climbed everest seven hundred times it wasnt surprising that the jeep stopped in a hurry no material object had stopped it but from the point of view of dynamics it had run smack into a cliff four thousand miles high i can see some blank looks that are not entirely due to the lateness of the hour never mind if you dont get all this just take my word for it it wont spoil your appreciation of what followsat least i hope not cavor had realised at once that he had made one of the most important discoveries of the age though it was some time before he worked out just what was going on the final clue to the antigravitational nature of the field came when they shot a rifle bullet into it and observed the trajectory with a highspeed camera ingenious dont you think the next problem was to experiment with the fields generator and to find just what had happened inside the reactor when it had been switched on this was a problem indeed the reactor was there in plain sight twenty feet away but to reach it would require slightly more energy than going to the moon cavor was not disheartened by this nor by the inexplicable failure of the reactor to respond to any of its remote controls he theorised that it had been completely drained i of energy if one can use a rather misleading term and that little if any power was needed to maintain the antigravity field once it had been set up this was one of the many things that could only be determined by examination on the spot so by hook or by crook dr cavor would have to go there his first idea was to use an electricallydriven trolley supplied with power through cables which it dragged bend it as it advanced into the field a hundred horsepower generator running continuously for seventeen hours would supply enough energy to take a man of average weight on the perilous twentyfoot journey a velocity of slightly over a foot an hour did not seem much boast about until you remembered that advancing one foot into the antigravity field was equivalent to a two hundred mile vertical climb the theory was sound but hi practice the electric trolley wouldnt work it started to push its way into the field but began to skid after it had traversed half an inch the reason was obvious when one started to think about it though the power was there the traction wasnt no wheeled vehicle could climb a gradient of two hundred miles per foot this minor setback did not discourage dr cavor the answer he realised at once was to produce the traction at a point outside the field when you wanted to lift a load vertically you didnt use a cart you used a jack or an hydraulic ram the result of this argument was one of the oddest vehicles ever built a small but comfortable cage containing sufficient provisions to last a man for several days was mounted at the end of a twentyfootlong horizontal girder the whole device was supported off the ground by balloon tires and the theory was that the cage could be pushed right into the center of the field by a machine which would remain outside its influence after some thought it was decided that the best primemover would be the common or garden bulldozer a test was made with some rabbits in the passenger compartmentand i cant help thinking that there was an interesting psychological point here the experimenters were trying to get it both ways as scientists theyd be pleased if their subjects got back alive and as australians theyd be just as happy if they got back dead but perhaps im being a little too fanciful the bulldozer chugged away hour after hour forcing the weight of the girder and its insignificant payload up the enormous gradient it was an uncanny sightall this energy being expended to move a couple of rabbits twenty feet across a perfectly horizontal plain the subjects of the experiment could be observed throughout the operation they seemed to be perfectly happy and quite unaware of their historic role the passenger compartment reached the centre of the field was held there for an hour and then the girder was slowly backed out again the rabbits were alive in good health and to nobodys particular surprise there were now six of them dr cavor naturally insisted on being the first human being to venture into a zerogravity field he loaded up the compartment with torsion balances radiation detectors and periscopes so that he could look into the reactor when he finally got to it then he gave the signal the bulldozer started chugging and the strange journey began there was naturally telephone communications from the passenger compartment to the outside world ordinary sound waves couldnt cross the barrier for reasons which were still a little obscure but radio and telephone both worked without difficulty cavor kept up a running commentary as he was edged forward into the field describing his own reactions and relaying instrument readings to his colleagues the first thing that happened to him though he had expected it was nevertheless rather unsettling during the first few inches of his advance as he moved through the fringe of the field the direction of the vertical seemed to swing around up was no longer toward the sky it was now in the direction of the reactor hut to cavor it felt as if he was being pushed up the face of a vertical cliff with the reactor twenty feet above him for the first time his eyes and his ordinary human senses told him the same story as his scientific training he could see that the centre of the field was gravitywise higher than the place from which he had come however imagination still boggled at the thought of all the energy it would need to climb that innocentlooking twenty feet and the hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel that must be burned to get him there there was nothing else of interest to report on the journey itself and at last twenty hours after he had started cavor arrived at his destination the wall of the reactor hut was right beside him though to him it seemed not a wall but an unsupported floor sticking out at right angles from the cliff up which he had risen the entrance was just above his head like a trapdoor through which he would have to climb this would present no great difficulty for dr cavor was an energetic young man extremely eager to find just how he had created this miracle slightly too eager in fact for as he tried to work his way into the door he slipped and fell off the platform that had carried him there that was the last anyone ever saw of himbut it wasnt the last they heard of him oh dear no he made a very big noise indeed youll see why when you consider the situation in which this unfortunate scientist now found himself hundreds of kilowatthours of energy had been pushed into himenough to lift him to the moon and beyond all that work had been needed to take him to a point of zero gravitational potential as soon as he lost his means of support that energy began to reappear to get back to our earlier and very picturesque analogythe poor doctor had slipped off the edge of the fourthousandmilehigh mountain he had ascended he fell back the twenty feet that had taken almost a day to climb ah what a fall was there my countrymen it was precisely equivalent in terms of energy to a free drop from the remotest stars down to the surface of the earth and you all know how much velocity an object acquires hi that fall its the same velocity thats needed to get it there hi the first placethe famous velocity of escape seven miles a second or twentyfive thousand miles an hour thats what dr cavor was doing by the time he got back to his starting point or to be more accurate thats the speed he involuntarily tried to reach as soon as he passed mach or however airresistance began to have its little say dr cavors funeral pyre was the finest and indeed the only meteor display ever to take place entirely at sea level im sorry that this story hasnt got a happy ending in fact it hasnt got an ending at all because that sphere of zero gravitational potential is still sitting there in the australian desert apparently doing nothing at all but in fact producing everincreasing amounts of frustration in scientific and official circles i dont see how the authorities can hope to keep it secret much longer sometimes i think how odd it is that the worlds tallest mountain is in australiaand that though its four thousand miles high the airliners often fly right over it without knowing its there you will hardly be surprised to hear that h purvis finished his narration at this point even he could hardly take it much further and noone wanted him to we were all including his most tenacious critics lost in admiring awe i have since detected six fallacies of a fundamental nature in his description of dr cavors frankensteinian fate but at the time they never even occurred to me what had earned our undying gratitude however was the fact that at some slight sacrifice of truth he had managed to keep flying saucers from invading the white hart it was almost closing time and too late for our visitor to make a counter attack that is why the sequel seems a little unfair a month later someone brought a very odd publication to one of our meetings it was nicely printed and laid out with professional skill the misuse of which was sad to behold the thing was called flying saucer revelationsand there on the front page was a full and detailed account of the story purvis had told us it was printed absolutely straightand what was much worse than that from poor harrys point of view was that it was attributed to him by name since then he has had letters on the subject most of them from california called him a liar believed him absolutely im afraid hes never quite got over it and i sometimes think hes going to spend the rest of his life trying to stop people believing the one story he never expected to be taken seriously there may be a moral here for the life of me i cant find it sleeping beauty it was one of those halfhearted discussions that is liable to get going in the white hart when noone can think of anything better to argue about we were trying to recall the most extraordinary names wed ever encountered and i had just contributed obediah polkinghorn when inevitablyharry purvis got into the act its easy enough to dig up odd names he said reprimanding us for our levity but have you ever stopped to consider a much more fundamental pointthe effects of those names on their owners sometimes you know such a thing can warp a mans entire life that is what happened to young sigmund snoring oh no groaned charles willis one of harrys most implacable critics i dont believe it do you imagine said harry indignantly that id invent a name like that as a matter of fact sigmunds family name was something jewish from central europe it began with sch and went on for quite a while in that vein snoring was just an anglicised precis of it however all this is by the way i wish people wouldnt make me waste time on such details charlie who is the most promising author i know started to make vaguely protesting noises but someone publicspiritedly diverted him with a glass of beer sigmund continued harry bore his burden bravely enough until he reached manhood there is little doubt however that his name preyed upon his mind and finally produced what you might call a psychosomatic result if sigmund had been born of any other parents i am sure that he would not have become a sterterous and incessant snorer in fact as well asalmostin name well there are worse tragedies in life sigmunds family had a fair amount of money and a soundproofed bedroom protected the remainder of the household from sleepless nights as is usually the case sigmund was quite unaware of his own nocturnal symphonies and could never really understand what all the fuss was about it was not until he got married that he was compelled to take his afflictionif you can call it that for it only inflicted itself on other peopleas seriously as it deserved there is nothing unusual in a young bride returning from her honeymoon in a somewhat distracted condition but poor rachel snoring had been through a uniquely shattering experience she was redeyed with lack of sleep and any attempt to get sympathy from her friends only made them dissolve into peals of laughter so it was not surprising that she gave sigmund an ultimatum unless he did something about bis snoring the marriage was off now this was a very serious matter both for sigmund and his family they were fairly welltodo but by no means richunlike granduncle reuben who had died last year leaving a rather complicated will he had taken quite a fancy to sigmund and had left a considerable sum of money in trust for him which he would receive when he was thirty unfortunately granduncle reuben was very oldfashioned and straitlaced and did not altogether trust the modern generation one of the conditions of the bequest was that sigmund should not be divorced or separated before the designated date if he was the money would go to found an orphanage in tel aviv it was a difficult situation and there is no way of guessing how it would have resolved itself had not someone suggested that sigmund ought to go and see uncle hymie sigmund was not at all keen on this but desperate predicaments demanded desperate remedies so he went uncle hymie i should explain was a very distinguished professor of physiology and a fellow of the royal society with a whole string of papers to his credit he was also at the moment somewhat short of money owing to a quarrel with the trustees of his college and had been compelled to stop work on some of his pet research projects to add to his annoyance the physics department had just been given half a million pounds for a new synchrotron so he was in no pleasant mood when his unhappy nephew called upon him trying to ignore the allpervading smell of disinfectant and livestock sigmund followed the lab steward along rows of incomprehensible equipment and past cages of mice and guineapigs frequently averting his eyes the revolting coloured diagrams which occupied so much wallspace he found his uncle sitting at a bench drinking tea from a beaker and absentmindedly nibbling sandwiches help yourself he said ungraciously roast hamster delicious one of the litter we used for some cancer tests whats the trouble pleading lack of appetite sigmund told his distinguished uncle his tale of woe the professor listened without much sympathy dont know what you got married for he said at last complete waste of time uncle hymie was known to possess strong views on this subject having had five children but no wives still we might be able to do something how much money have you got why asked sigmund somewhat taken aback the professor waved his arms around the lab costs a lot to run all this he said but i thought the university oh yesbut any special work will have to be under the counter as it were i cant use college funds for it well how much will you need to get started uncle hymie mentioned a sum which was rather smaller than sigmund had feared but his satisfaction did not last for long the scientist it soon transpired was fully acquainted with granduncle reubens will sigmund would have to draw up a contract promising him a share of the loot when in five years tune the money became his the present payment was merely an advance even so i dont promise anything but ill see what can be done said uncle hymie examining the cheque carefully come and see me in a month that was all that sigmund could get out of him for the professor was then distracted by a highly decorative research student in a sweater which appeared to have been sprayed on her they started discussing the domestic affairs of the labs rats hi such terms that sigmund who was easily embarrassed had to beat a hasty retreat now i dont really think that uncle hymie would have taken sigmunds money unless he was fairly sure he could deliver the goods he must therefore have been quite near the completion of his work when the university had slashed his funds certainly he could never have produced in a mere four weeks whatever complex mixture of chemicals it was that he injected into his hopeful nephews arm a month after receiving the cash the experiment was carried out at the professors own home late one evening sigmund was not too surprised to find the lady research student in attendance what will this stuff do he asked it will stop you snoringi hope answered uncle hymie now heres a nice comfortable seat and a pile of magazines to read irma and i will take turns keeping an eye on you in case there are any sidereactions sidereactions said sigmund anxiously rubbing his arm dont worryjust take it easy in a couple of hours well know if it works so sigmund waited for sleep to come while the two scientists fussed around him taking readings of bloodpressure pulse temperature and generally making sigmund feel like a chronic invalid when midnight arrived he was not at all sleepy but the professor and his assistant were almost dead on then feet sigmund realised that they had been working long hours on his behalf and felt a gratitude which was quite touching during the short period while it lasted midnight came and passed irma folded up and the professor laid her none too gently on the couch youre quite sure you dont feel tired yet he yawned at sigmund not a bit its very odd im usually fast asleep by this time you feel perfectly all right never felt better there was another vast yawn from the professor he muttered something like should have taken some of it myself then subsided into an armchair give us a shout he said sleepily if you feel anything unusual no point hi us staying up any longer a moment later sigmund still somewhat mystified was the only conscious person in the room he read a dozen copies of punch stamped not to be removed from the common room until it was a m he polished off all the saturday evening posts by a small bundle of new yorkers kept him busy until when he had a stroke of luck an exclusive diet of caviar soon grows monotonous and sigmund was delighted to discover a limp and muchthumbed volume entitled the blonde was willing this engaged his full attention until dawn when uncle hymie gave a convulsive start shot out of his chair woke irma with a welldirected slap and then turned his full attention towards sigmund well my boy he said with a hearty cheerfulness that at once alerted sigmunds suspicions ive done what you wanted you passed the night without snoring didnt you sigmund put down the willing blonde who was now in a situation where her cooperation or lack of it would make no difference at all i didnt snore he admitted but i didnt sleep either you still feel perfectly wide awake yesi dont understand it at all uncle hymie and irma exchanged triumphant glances youve made history sigmund said the professor youre the first man to be able to do without sleep and so the news was broken to the astonished and not yet indignant guineapig i know continued harry purvis not altogether accurately that many of you would like the scientific details of uncle hymies discovery but i dont know them and if i did they would be too technical to give here ill merely point out since i see some expressions which a less trusting man might describe as sceptical that there is nothing really startling about such a development sleep after all is a highly variable factor look at edison who managed on two or three hours a day right up to the end of his life its true that men cant go without sleep indefinitelybut some animals can so it clearly isnt a fundamental part of metabolism what animals can go without sleep asked somebody not so much in disbelief as out of pure curiosity wellerof coursethe fish that live out in deep water beyond the continental shelf if they ever fell asleep theyd be snapped up by other fish or theyd lose their trim and sink to the bottom so theyve got to keep awake all of their lives it took some time continued harry for sigmund to realise what an astonishing thing had been done to him an enthusiastic commentary from his uncle enlarging upon all the glorious possibilities that had been opened up for him now that he had been freed from the tyranny of sleep made it difficult to concentrate on the problem but presently he was able to raise the question that had been worrying him how long will this last he enquired the professor and irma looked at each other then uncle hymie coughed a little nervously and replied were not quite sure yet thats one thing weve got to find out its perfectly possible that the effect will be permanent you mean that ill never be able to sleep again not never be able to never want to however i could probably work out some way of reversing the process if youre really anxious cost a lot of money though sigmund left hastily promising to keep in touch and to report his progress every day his brain was still in a turmoil but first he had to find his wife and to convince her that he would never snore again she was quite willing to believe him and they had a touching reunion but in the small hours of next morning it got very dull lying there with noone to talk to and presently sigmund tiptoed away from his sleeping wife for the first time the full reality of his position was beginning to dawn upon him what on earth was he going to do with the extra eight hours a day that had descended upon him as an unwanted gift you might think that sigmund had a wonderfulindeed an unprecedentedopportunity for leading a fuller life by acquiring that culture and knowledge which we all feel wed likeif only we had the time to do something about it he could read every one of the great classics that are just names to most people he could study art music or philosophy and fill his mind with all the finest treasures of the human intellect in fact a good many of you are probably envying him right now well it didnt work out that way the fact of the matter is that even the highest grade mind needs some relaxation and cannot devote itself to serious pursuits indefinitely it was true that sigmund had no further need of sleep but he needed entertainment to occupy him during the long empty hours of darkness civilisation he soon discovered was not designed to fit the requirements of a man who couldnt sleep he might have been better off in paris or new york but in london practically everything closed down at p m only a few coffeebars were still open at midnight and by a m well the less said about any establishments still operating the better at first when the weather was good he occupied his time going for long walks but after several encounters with inquisitive and sceptical policemen he gave this up so he took to the car and drove all over london during the small hours discovering all sorts of odd places in never knew existed he soon had a nodding acquaintance with many nightwatchmen covent garden porters and milkmen as well as fleet street journalists and printers who had to work while the rest of the world slept but as sigmund was not the sort of person who took a great interest in his fellow human beings this amusement soon palled and he was thrown back upon his own limited resources his wife as might be expected was not at all happy about bis nocturnal wanderings he had told her the whole story and though she had found it hard to believe she was forced to accept the evidence of her own eyes but having done so it seemed that she would prefer a husband who snored and stayed at home to one who tiptoed away around midnight and was not always back by breakfast this upset sigmund greatly he had spent or promised a good deal of money and taken a considerable personal risk to cure himself of his malaise and was she grateful no she just wanted an itemised account of the time he spent when he should have been sleeping but wasnt it was most unfair and showed a lack of trust which he found very disheartening slowly the secret spread through a wider circle though the snorings managed to keep it inside the family uncle lorenz who was in the diamond business suggested that sigmund take up a second job as it seemed a pity to waste all that additional working time he produced a list of oneman occupations which could be carried on equally easily by day or night but sigmund thanked bun kindly and said he saw no reason why he should pay two lots of income tax by the end of six weeks of twentyfourhour days sigmund had had enough he felt he couldnt read another book go to another nightclub or listen to another gramophone record his great gift which many foolish men would have paid a fortune to possess had become an intolerable burden there was nothing to do but to go and see uncle hymie again the professor had been expecting him and there was no need to threaten legal proceedings to appeal to the solidarity of the snorings or to make pointed remarks about breach of contract all right all right grumbled the scientist i dont believe in casting pearls before swine i knew youd want the antidote sooner or later and because im a generous man itll only cost you fifty guineas but dont blame me if you snore worse than ever ill take that risk said sigmund as far as he and rachel were concerned it had come to separate rooms anyway by this time he averted his gaze as the professors assistant filled a terrifyingly large hypodermic with uncle hymies latest brew before he had absorbed half of it he had fallen asleep for once uncle hymie looked quite disconcerted i didnt expect it to act that fast he said well lets get him to bedwe cant have him lying around the lab by next morning sigmund was still fast asleep and showed no reactions to any stimuli his breathing was imperceptible he seemed to be in a trance rather than a slumber and the professor was getting a little alarmed his worry did not last for long however a few hours later an angry guineapig bit him on the ringer bloodpoisoning set in and the editor of nature was just able to get the obituary notice into the current issue before it went to press sigmund slept through all this excitement and was still blissfully unconscious when the family got back from the golders green crematorium and assembled for a council of war de mortuis nil nisi bonum but it was obvious that the late professor hymie had made another unfortunate mistake and noone knew how to set about unravelling it cousin meyer who ran a furniture store in the mile end road offered to take charge of sigmund if he could use him on display in his shop window to demonstrate the luxury of the beds he stocked however it was felt that this would be too undignified and the family vetoed the scheme but it gave them ideas by now they were getting a little fed up with sigmund this flying from one extreme to another was really too much so why not take the easy way out and as one wit expressed it let sleeping sigmunds lie there was no point in calling in another expensive expert who might only make matters worse it cost nothing to feed sigmund he required only a modicum of medical attention and while he was sleeping there was certainly no danger of him breaking the terms of granduncle reubens will when this argument was rather tactfully put to rachel she quite saw the strength of it the policy demanded required a certain amount of patience but the ultimate reward would be considerable the more rachel examined it the more she liked the idea the thought of being a wealthy nearwidow appealed to her it had such interesting and novel possibilities and to tell the truth she had had quite enough of sigmund to last her for the five years until he came into his inheritance in due course that time arrived and sigmund became a semidemimillionaire however he still slept soundly and hi all those five years he had never snored once he looked so peaceful lying there that it seemed a pity to wake him up even if anyone knew exactly how to set about it rachel felt strongly that illadvised tampering might have unfortunate consequences and the family after assuring itself that she could only get at the interest on sigmunds fortune and not at the capital was inclined to agree with her and that was several years ago when i last heard of him sigmund was still peacefully sleeping while rachel was having a perfectly wonderful time on the riviera she is quite a shrewd woman as you may have guessed and i think she realises how convenient it might be to have a youthful husband in cold storage for her old age there are times i must admit when i think its rather a pity that uncle hymie never had a chance of revealing his remarkable discoveries to the world but sigmund proved that our civilisation isnt yet ripe for such changes and i hope im not around when some other physiologist starts the whole thing all over again harry looked at the clock good lord he exclaimed id no idea it was so latei feel half asleep he picked up his briefcase stifled a yawn and smiled benignly at us happy dreams everybody he said the defenestration of ermintrude inch and now i have a short sad duty to perform one of the many mysteries about harry purviswho was so informative in every other directionwas the existence or otherwise of a mrs purvis it was true that he wore no wedding ring but that means little nowadays almost as little as any hotel proprietor will tell you as does the reverse in a number of his tales harry had shown distinct evidence of some hostility towards what a polish friend of mine whose command of english did not match his gallantry always referred to as ladies of the female sex and it was by a curious coincidence that the very last story he ever told us first indicated and then proved conclusively harrys marital status i do not know who brought up the word defenestration which is not after all one of the most commonly used abstract nouns in the language it was probably one of the alarmingly erudite younger members of the white hart clientele some of them are just out of college and so make us oldtimers feel very callow and ignorant but from the word the discussion naturally passed to the deed had any of us ever been defenestrated did we know anyone who had yes said harry it happened to a verbose lady i once knew she was called ermintrude and was married to osbert inch a sound engineer at the b b c osbert spent all his working hours listening to other people talking and most of his free time listening to ermintrude unfortunately he couldnt switch her off at the turn of a knob and so he very seldom had a chance of getting a word in edgeways there are some women who appear sincerely unaware of the fact that they cannot stop talking and are most surprised when anyone accuses them of monopolising the conversation ermintrude would start as soon as she woke up change gear so that she could hear herself speak above the eight oclock news and continue unabated until osbert thankfully left for work a couple of years of this had almost reduced him to a nervous wreck but one morning when his wife was handicapped by a long overdue attack of laryngitis he made a spirited protest against her vocal monopoly to his incredulous disbelief she flatly refused to accept the charge it appeared that to ermintrude time ceased to exist when she was talkingbut she became extremely restive when anyone else held the stage as soon as she had recovered her voice she told osbert how unfair it was of him to make such an unfounded accusation and the argument would have been very acrimoniousif it had been possible to have an argument with ermintrude at all this made osbert an angry and also a desperate man but he was an ingenious one too and it occurred to him that he could produce irrefutable evidence that ermintrude talked a hundred words for every syllable he was able to utter i mentioned that he was a sound engineer and his room was fitted up with hifi set tape recorder and the usual electronic tools of his trade some of which the b b c had unwittingly supplied it did not take him very long to construct a piece of equipment which one might call a selective word counter if you know anything about audio engineering youll appreciate how it could be done with suitable niters and dividing circuitsand if you dont youll have to take it for granted what the apparatus did was simply this a microphone picked up every word spoken in the inch apartment osberts deeper tones went one way and registered on a counter marked his and ermintrudes higher frequencies went the other direction and ended up on the counter marked hers within an hour of switching on the score was as follows his hers as the numbers flickered across the counter dials ermintrude became more and more thoughtful and at the same time more and more silent osbert on the other hand drinking the heady wine of victory began to make the most of his advantage and became quite talkative by the time he had left for work the counters had reflected the changing status in the household his l hers just to show who was now the boss osbert left the apparatus switched on he had always wondered if ermintrude talked to herself as a purely automatic reflex even when there was noone around to hear what she was saying he had by the way thoughtfully taken the precaution of putting a lock on the counter so that his wife couldnt turn it off while he was out he was a little disappointed to find that the figures were quite unaltered when he came home that evening but thereafter the score soon started to mount again it became a kind of gamethough a deadly serious one with each of the protagonists keeping one eye on the machine whenever either of them said a word ermintrude was clearly discomfited ever and again she would suffer a verbal relapse and increase her score by a couple of hundred before she brought herself to a halt by a supreme effort of selfcontrol osbert who still had such a lead that he could afford to be garrulous amused himself by making occasional sardonic comments which were well worth the expenditure of a fewscore points although a measure of equality had been restored in the inch household the word counter had if anything increased the state of dissension presently ermintrude who had a certain natural intelligence which some people might have called craftiness made an appeal to her husbands better nature she pointed out that neither of them was really behaving naturally while every word was being monitored and counted osbert had unfairly let her get ahead and was now being taciturn in a way that he would never have been had he not got that warning score continuously before his eyes though osbert gagged at the sheer effrontery of this charge he had to admit that the objection did contain an element of truth the test would be fairer and more conclusive if neither of them could see the accumulating scoreif indeed they forgot all about the presence of the machine and so behaved perfectly naturally or at least as naturally as they could in the circumstances after much argument they came to a compromise very sportingly in his opinion osbert reset the dials to zero and sealed up the counter windows so that noone could take a peek at the scores they agreed to break the wax sealson which they had both impressed their fingerprintsat the end of the week and to abide by the decision concealing the microphone under a table osbert moved the counter equipment itself into his little workshop so that the livingroom now bore no sign of the implacable electronic watchdog that was controlling the destiny of the inches thereafter things slowly returned to normal ermintrude became as talkative as ever but now osbert didnt mind in the least because he knew that every word she uttered was being patiently noted to be used as evidence against her at the end of the week his triumph would be complete he could afford to allow himself the luxury of a couple of hundred words a day knowing that ermintrude used up this allowance in five minutes the breaking of the seals was performed ceremonially at the end of an unusually talkative day when ermintrude had repeated verbatim three telephone conversations of excruciating banality which it seemed had occupied most of her afternoon osbert had merely smiled and said yes dear at ten minute intervals meanwhile trying to imagine what excuse his wife would put forward when confronted by the damning evidence tales from the white hart imagine therefore his feelings when the seals were removed to disclose the weeks total his hers osbert stared at the incredible figures with stunned disbelief something had gone wrongbut where there must he decided have been a fault in the apparatus it was annoying very annoying for he knew perfectly well that ermintrude would never let him live it down even if he proved conclusively that the counter had gone haywire ermintrude was still crowing victoriously when osbert pushed her out of the room and started to dismantle his errant equipment he was halfway through the job when he noticed something in his wastepaper basket which he was sure he hadnt put there it was a closed loop of tape a couple of feet long and he was quite unable to account for its presence as he had not used the taperecorder for several days he picked it up and as he did so suspicion exploded into certainty he glanced at the recorder the switches he was quite sure were not as he had left them ermintrude was crafty but she was also careless osbert had often complained that she never did a job properly and here was the final proof his den was littered with old tapes carrying unerased test passages he had recorded it had been no trouble at all for ermintrude to locate one snip off a few words stick the ends together switch to playback and leave the machine running hour after hour in front of the microphone osbert was furious with himself for not having thought of so simple a ruse if the tape had been strong enough he would probably have strangled ermintrude with it whether he tried to do anything of the sort is still uncertain all we know is that she went out of the apartment window and of course it could have been an accidentbut there was no way of asking her as the inches lived four storeys up i know that defenestration is usually deliberate and the coroner had some pointed words to say on the subject but nobody could prove that osbert pushed her and the whole thing soon blew over about a year later he married a charming little deafanddumb girl and theyre one of the happiest couples i know there was a long pause when harry had finished whether out of disbelief or out of respect for the late mrs inch it would be hard to say but before anyone could make a suitable comment the door was thrown open and a formidable blonde advanced into the private bar of the white hart it is seldom indeed that life arranges its climaxes as neatly as this harry purvis turned very pale and tried in vain to hide himself in the crowd he was instantly spotted and pinned down beneath a barrage of invective so this we heard with interest is where youve been giving your wednesday evening lectures on quantum mechanics i should have checked up with the university years ago harry purvis youre a liar and i dont mind if everybody knows it and as for your friendsshe gave us all a scathing lookits a long time since ive seen such a scruffy lot of tipplers hey just a minute protested drew from the other side of the counter she quelled him with a glance then turned upon poor harry again come along she said youre going home no you neednt finish that drink im sure youve already had more than enough obediently harry purvis picked up his briefcase and coat very well ermintrude he said meekly i will not bore you with the long and still unsettled argument as to whether mrs purvis really was called ermintrude or whether harry was so dazed that he automatically applied the name to her we all have our theories about that as indeed we have about everything concerning harry all that matters now is the sad and indisputable fact that noone has ever seen him since that evening it is just possible that he doesnt know where we meet nowadays for a few months later the white hart was taken over by a new management and we all followed drew lock stock and barrelparticularly barrelto his new establishment our weekly sessions now take place at the sphere and for a long time many of us used to look up hopefully when the door opened to see if harry had managed to escape and find his way back to us it is indeed partly in the hope that he will see this book and hence discover our new location that i have gathered these tales together even those who never believed a word you spoke miss you harry if you have to defenestrate ermintrude to regain your freedom do it on a wednesday evening between six and eleven and therell be forty people in the sphere wholl provide you with an alibi but get back somehow things have never been quite the same since you went about arthur c clarke in a recent issue holiday magazine acclaimed arthur c clarke as the colossus of science fictionand with good reason he has already completed a body of works both in fiction and nonfiction which has clearly established his reputation as a careful scientist and a superbly gifted writer of imaginative literature the exploration of space his nonfiction book on the coming age of interplanetary flight was a bookofthemonth club choice the atlantic monthly praised it as an exceptionally lucid job of scientific exposition for the layman his novel childhoods end a breathtaking speculation on the future evolution of man was hailed by the new york times as a first rate tour de force that is well worth the attention of every thoughtful citizen in this age of anxiety a fellow of the royal astronomical society and former chairman of the british interplanetary society arthur c clarice brings the discipline and the intellectual horizons of science to the service of a truly original and powerful imagination the result is fiction of the future with an unusual relevance for our times mr clarkes interest in science began early when i was less than ten years old he writes i built a small telescope from a cardboard tube and a couple of lenses and spent many of my nights mapping the moon until i knew my way around it a good deal better than around my native somerset the sciencefiction virus attacked me when i was fourteen and saw my first copies of amazing stories and astounding for years i collected every issue i could lay my hands upon i can still recall the thrill of receiving an entire cratefulof wonder stories which id purchased for five cents apiece when i was around fifteen i started writing short pieces for the school magazine and eventually became its assistant editor on turning up these articles recently i was depressed to see how little improvement there had been in the interim moving to london i encountered the british sciencefiction world as well as the embryo british interplanetary society was treasurer of the b i s edited wrote for and duplicated countless sciencefiction fan mags and sold my first articles on space flight the war and the r a f introduced me to radar the experience i gained running the first groundcontrolled approach equipment has been reflected in a number of my stories and has given me an insight into the scientific mind with the help of a friendly member of parliament i obtained our equivalent of a g i scholarship to kings college london and passed out two years later with a first class honors b sc in physics and pure and applied math meanwhile i had started selling stories to the sciencefiction magazines in the united states i continued writing fiction and nonfiction after id left college and became assistant editor of physics abstractsa very interesting job that kept me in touch with scientific progress threw this up after two years when my sparetime income began to exceed my salary in my first book was publisheda technical work called interplanetary flight which was so successful despite its specialized nature that i was asked to do a second book for the general public this was the exploration of space in the mids however my career took a new direction when i was badly bitten by the skindiving virus in i joined my partner mike wilson on the great barrier reef of australia with results reported in the coast of coral later expeditions took us to ceylon where we have now made our home mikes discovery of the first treasure ship ever found in the indian ocean resulted in the book and tv movie the treasure of the great reef and plunged our lives into a confusion from which we have not yet extricated ourselves at the moment i am approaching my fortieth book and would probably have reached it by now if not for a threeyear detour with stanley kubrick writing the novel and screenplay of a space odyssey having long ago abandoned hope of catching up with isaac asimovs output i have now restricted myself to a couple of minor ambitions i intend to go to the moon when the tourist service starts and i hope to go to mars arthur c clarke
