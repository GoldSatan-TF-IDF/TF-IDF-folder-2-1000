prologue bobby could see the earth complete and serene within its cage of silver tight fingers of green and blue pushed into the new deserts of asia and the north american midwest artificial reefs glimmered in the caribbean pale blue against the deeper ocean great wispy machines labored over the poles to repair the atmosphere the air was clear as glass for now mankind drew its energy from the core of earth itself and bobby knew that if he chose with a mere effort of will he could look back into time he could watch cities bloom on earths patient sur face to dwindle and vanish like rusty dew he could see species shrivel and devolve like leaves curling into their buds he could watch the slow dance of the continents as earth gathered its primordial heat back into its iron heart the present was a glimmering expanding bubble of life and awareness with the past locked within trapped unmoving like an insect in amber for a long time on this rich growing earth embed ded in knowledge an enhanced humankind had been at peace a peace unimaginable when he was born and all of this had derived from me ambition of one mana venal flawed man a man who had never even understood where his dreams would lead how remarkable he thought bobby looked into his past and into his heart the goldfish bowl we know how cruel the truth soften is and we wonder whether delusion is not more consoling henri poincare the casimir engine a little after dawn vitaly keldysh climbed stiffly into his car engaged the smartdrive and let the car sweep him away from the rundown hotel the streets of leninsk were empty the road surface cracked many windows boarded up he remembered how this place had been at its peak in the s per haps a bustling science city with a population of tens of thousands with schools cinemas a swimming pool a sports stadium cafes restaurants and hotels even its own tv station still as he passed me main gateway to me north of the city there was me old blue sign with its white point ing arrow to baikonur still proclaiming that ancient deceptive name and still here at the empty heart of asia russian engineers built spaceships and fired mem into the sky but he reflected sadly not for much longer the sun rose at last and banished the stars all but one he saw the brightest of all it moved with a lei surely but unnatural speed across the southern sky it was the ruin of me international space station never completed abandoned in after the crash of an ag ing space shuttle but still the station drifted around the earth an unwelcome guest at a party long over the landscape beyond the city was barren he passed a camel standing patiently at the side of me road a wiz ened woman beside it dressed in rags it was a scene he arthur c clarke and stephen baxter might have encountered any time in the last thousand years he thought as if all the great changes political and technical and social that had swept across this land had been for nothing which was perhaps the reality but in the gathering sunlight of this spring dawn the steppe was green and littered with bright yellow flowers he wound down his window and tried to detect the meadow fragrance he remembered so well but his nose ruined by a lifetime of tobacco let him down he felt a stab of sadness as he always did at this time of year the grass and flowers would soon be gone the steppe spring was brief as tragically brief as life itself he reached the range it was a place of steel towers pointing to the sky of enormous concrete mounds the cosmodromefar vaster than its western competitorscovered thousands of square kilometers of this empty land much of it was abandoned now of course and the great gantries were rusting slowlyin the dry air or else had been pulled down for scrapwith or without the consent of the au thorities but this morning there was much activity around one pad he could see technicians in their protective suits and orange hats scurrying around the great gantry like faithful at the feet of some immense god a voice floated across the steppe from a speaker tower gotovnosty dyesyat minut ten minutes and counting the walk from the car to the viewing stand short as it was tired him greatly he tried to ignore the ham mering of his recalcitrant heart the prickling of sweat over his neck and brow his gasping breathlessness the stiff pain that plagued his arm and neck as he took his place those already here greeted him there were the corpulent complacent men and women who in this new russia moved seamlessly between le gitimate authority and murky underworld and there were young technicians like all of the new generations the light of other days ratfaced with the hunger that had plagued his country since the fall of the soviet union he accepted their greetings but was happy to sink into isolated anonymity the men and women of this hard future cared nothing for him and his memories of a better past and nor did they care much for what was about to happen here all their gossip was of events far away of ffiram patterson and his wormholes his promise to make the earth itself as transparent as glass it was very obvious to vitaly that he was die oldest person here the last survivor of the old days perhaps that thought gave him a certain sour pleasure it was in fact almost exactly seventy years since the launch of the first molniyalightningin it might have been seventy days so vivid were the events in vitalys mind when the young army of scientists rocket engineers technicians laborers cooks carpenters and masons had come to this unpromising steppe and living in huts and tents alternately baking and freezing armed with little but their dedication and korolevs ge niushad built and launched mankinds first spaceships the design of the molniya satellites had been utterly ingenious korolevs great boosters were incapable of launching a satellite to geosynchronous orbit that high radius where the station would hover above a fixed point on earths surface so korolev launched his satellites on elliptical eighthour trajectories with such orbits care fully chosen three molniyas could provide coverage for most of the soviet union for decades the ussr and then russia had maintained constellations of molniyas in their eccentric orbits providing the great sprawling country with essential social and economic unity vitaly regarded the molniya comsats as korolevs greatest achievement outshining even the designers ac complishments in launching robots and humans into space touching mars and venus evenso nearly beating the americans to the moon arthur c clarke and stephen baxter but now perhaps the need for those marvelous birds was dying at last the great launch tower rolled back and the last power umbilicals fell away writhing slowly like fat black snakes the slim form of the booster itself was revealed a needle shape with the baroque fluting typical of ko rolevs antique marvelous utterly reliable designs al though the sun was now high in the sky the rocket was bathed in brilliant artificial light wreathed in vapor breathed by the mass of cryogenic fuels in its tanks tri ova odin zashiganiye ignition as kate manzoni approached the ourworid campus she wondered if she had contrived to be a little more than fashionably justlateenough for this spectacular event so brightly was the washington state sky painted by hiram pattersons light show small planes crisscrossed the sky maintaining a layer of dust on which the lasers painted virtual images of a turning earth every few seconds the globe turned transparent to reveal the familiar ourworid corporate logo embedded in its core it was all utterly tacky of course and it only served to obscure the real beauty of the tall clear night sky she opaqued the cars roof and found afterimages drifting across her vision a drone hovered outside the car it was another earth globe slowly spinning and when it spoke its voice was smooth utterly synthetic devoid of emotion this way ms manzoni just a moment she whispered search engine mirror an image of herself crystallized in the middle of her field of vision disconcertingly overlaying the spinning drone she checked her dress front and back turned on the programmable tattoos that adorned her shoulders the light of other days and tucked stray wisps of hair back where they should be the selfimage synthesized from feeds from the cars cameras and relayed to her retinal implants was a little grainy and prone to break up into blocky pixels if she moved too quickly but that was a limitation of her oldfashioned senseorgan implant technology she was prepared to accept better she suffer a little fuzziness than let some cackhanded cnsaugment surgeon open up her skull when she was ready she dismissed the image and clambered out of the car as gracefully as she could man age in her ludicrously tight and impractical dress ourworids campus turned out to be a carpet of neat grass quadrangles separating threestory office buildings fat topheavy boxes of blue glass held up by skinny little beams of reinforced concrete it was ugly and quaint s corporate chic the bottom story of each building was an open car lot in one of which her car had parked itself she joined a river of people that flowed into the cam pus cafeteria drones bobbing over their heads the cafeteria was a showpiece a spectacular multi level glass cylinder built around a chunk of bona fide graffitiladen berlin wall there was bizarrely a stream running right through the middle of the hall with little stone bridges spanning it tonight perhaps a thousand guests milled across the glassy floor groups of them coalescing and dispersing a cloud of conversation bub bling around them heads turned toward her some in recognition and somemale and female alikewith frankly lustful cal culation she picked out face after face repeated shocks of rec ognition startling her there were presidents dictators royalty powers in industry and finance and the usual scattering of celebrities from movies and music and the other arts she didnt spot president juarez herself but several of her cabinet were here hiram had gathered arthur c clarke and stephen baxter quite a crowd for his latest spectacle she conceded of course she knew she wasnt here herself solely for her glittering journalistic talent or conversational skills but for her own combination of beauty and the minor celebrity that had followed her exposure of the worm wood discovery but that was an angle shed been happy to exploit herself ever since her big break drones floated overhead bearing canapes and drinks she accepted a cocktail some of the drones carried im ages from one or another of hirams channels the im ages were mostly ignored in me excitement even the most spectacularhere was one for example bearing the image of a space rocket on the point of being launched evidently from some dusty steppe in asia but she couldnt deny that the cumulative effect of all mis technology was impressive as if reinforcing hirams famous boast that ourworlds mission was to inform a planet she gravitated toward one of the larger knots of peo ple nearby trying to see who or what was the center of attention she made out a slim young man with dark hair a walrus mustache and round glasses wearing a rather absurd pantomimesoldier uniform of bright lime green with scariet piping he seemed to be holding a brass musical instrument perhaps a euphonium she rec ognized him of course and as soon as she did so she lost interest just a virtual she began to survey the crowd around him observing their childlike fascination with this simulacrum of a longdead saintly celebrity one older man was regarding her a little too closely his eyes were odd an unnaturally pale gray she won dered if he had possession of the new breed of retinal implants mat were rumoredby operating at millimeter wavelengths at which textiles were transparent and with a little subtle image enhancementto enable the wearer to see through clothes he took a tentative step toward her and orthotic aids his invisible walking machine whirred stiffly the light of other days kate turned away hes only a virtual im afraid our young ser geant over there that is like his three companions who are likewise scattered around the room even my fathers grasp doesnt yet extend to resurrecting the dead but of course you knew that the voice in her ear had made her jump she turned and found herself looking into the face of a young man perhaps twentyfive jetblack hair a proud roman nose a chin with a cleft to die for his mixed ancestry told in the pale brown of his skin the heavy black brows over startling cloudy blue eyes but his gaze roamed rest lessly even in these first few seconds of meeting her as if he had trouble maintaining eye contact he said youre staring at me she came out fighting well you startled me any how i know who you are this was bobby patterson hiram s only son and heirand a notorious sexual pred ator she wondered how many other unaccompanied women this man had targeted tonight and i know you ms maqzoni or can i call you kate you may as well call your father hiram as every one does though ive never met him do you want to i could arrange it im sure you could he studied her a little more closely now evidently enjoying the gentle verbal duel you know i could have guessed you were a journalista writer anyhow the way you were watching the people reacting to the virtual rather than the virtual itself i saw your pieces on the wormwood of course you made quite a splash not as much as the real thing will when it hits the pacific on may ad he smiled and his teeth were like rows of pearls you intrigue me kate manzoni he said youre ac cessing the search engine right now arent you youre asking it about me arthur c clarke and stephen baxter no she was annoyed by the suggestion im a journalist i dont need a memory crutch i do evidently i remembered your face your story but not your name are you offended she bristled why should i be as a matter of fact as a matter of fact i smell a little sexual chemistry in the air am i right there was a heavy arm around her shoulder a pow erful scent of cheap cologne it was ffiram patterson himself one of the most famous people on the planet bobby grinned and gently pushed his fathers arm away dad youre embarrassing me again h bugger that lifes too short isnt it hirams accent bore strong traces of his origins the long nasal vowels of norfolk england he was very like his son but darker bald with a fringe of wiry black hair around his head his eyes were intense blue over that prominent family nose and he grinned easily showing teeth stained by nicotine he looked energetic younger than his late sixties ms manzoni im a great admirer of your work and may i say you look terrific which is why im here no doubt he laughed pleased well that too but i did want to be sure there was one intelligent person in among the airhead politicos and prettypretties who crowd out these events somebody who would be able to record this moment of history im flattered no youre not hiram said bluntly youre being ironic youve heard the buzz about what im going to say tonight you probably even generated some of it yourself you think im a megalomaniac nutcase i dont think id say that what i see is a man with a new gadget hiram do you really believe a gadget can change the world but gadgets do you know once it was the wheel agriculture ironmakinginventions that took thousands the light of other days of years to spread around the planet but now it takes a generation or less think about the car the television when i was a kid computers were giant walkin ward robes served by a priesthood with punch cards now we all spend half our lives plugged into softscreens and mv gadget is going to top them all well youll have to decide for yourself he studied kate enjoy tonight if this young waster hasnt invited you already come to dinner and well show you more as much as you want to see i mean it talk to one of the drones now do excuse me hiram squeezed her shoulders briefly then began to make his way through the crowd smiling and waving and gladhanding as he went kate took a deep breath i feel as if a bomb just went off bobby laughed he does have that effect by the way what i was going to ask you anyhow before the old fool jumped in come have dinner and maybe we can have a little fun gel to know each o er better as his patter continued she tuned him out and fo cused on what she knew about hiram patterson and ourworld hiram pattersonborn hirdamani patelhad dragged himself out of impoverished origins in the fen country of eastern england a land which had now disappeared beneath the encroaching north sea he had made his first fortune by using japanese cloning technologies to manufacture ingredients for traditional medicines once made from the bodies of tigerswhiskers paws claws even bonesand exporting them to chinese communi ties around the world that had gained him notoriety brickbats for using advanced technology to serve such primitive needs praise for reducing the pressure on the remaining populations of tigers in india china russia and indonesia not that there were any tigers left now anyhow arthur c clarke and stephen baxter after that hiram had diversified he had developed the worlds first successful softscreen a flexible image system based on polymer pixels capable of emitting mul ticolored light with the success of the softscreen hiram began to grow seriously rich soon his corporation ourworid had become a powerhouse in advanced tech nologies broadcasting news sport and entertainment but britain was declining as part of unified europe deprived of tools of macroeconomic policy like control of exchange and interest rates and yet unsheltered by the imperfectly integrated greater economythe british government was unable to arrest a sharp economic col lapse at last in social unrest and climate collapse forced britain out of the european union and the united kingdom fell apart scotland going its own separate way through all this hiram had struggled to maintain ourworids fortunes then in england with wales ceded northern ireland to eire packed off the royals to australia where they were still welcomeand had become the fiftysecond state of the united states of america with the benefit of labor mobility interregional financial transfers and other protective features of the truly unified american economy england thrived but it had to thrive without hiram as a us citizen hiram had quickly taken the op portunity to relocate to the outskirts of seattle wash ington and had delighted in establishing a new corporate headquarters here at what used to be the microsoft cam pus hiram liked to boast that he would become the bill gates of the twentyfirst century and indeed his cor porate and personal power had in the richer soil of the american economy grown exponentially still kate knew he was only one of a number of powerful players in a crowded and competitive market she was here tonight becauseso went the buzz and as he had just hintedhiram was to reveal something new something that would change all that the light of other days bobby patterson by contrast had grown up enveloped by hiram s power educated at eton cambridge and harvard he had taken various positions within his fathers companies and enjoyed the spectacular life of an international play boy and the worlds most eligible bachelor as far as kate knew he had never once demonstrated any spark of initiative of his own nor any desire to escape his fathers embracebetter yet to supplant him kate gazed at his perfect face this is a bird who is happy with his gilded cage she thought a spoilt rich kid but she felt herself flush under his gaze and despised her biology she hadnt spoken for some seconds bobby was still waiting for her to respond to his dinner invitation ill think about it bobby he seemed puzzledas if hed never received such a hesitant response before is there a problem if you want i can ladies and gentlemen every head turned kate was relieved hiram had mounted a stage at one end of the cafeteria behind him a giant softscreen showed a blownup im age of his head and shoulders he was smiling over them all like some beneficent god and drones drifted around his head bearing jewellike images of the multiple ourworid channels may i say first of all thank you all for coming to witness this moment of history and for your patience now the show is about to begin the dandylike virtual in the lime green soldier suit materialized on the stage beside hiram his granny glasses glinting in the lights he was joined by three others in pink blue and scarlet each carrying a musical instrumentan oboe a trumpet a piccolo there was scattered applause the four took an easy bow and stepped lightly to an area at the back of the stage where arthur c clarke and stephen baxter a drum kit and three electric guitars were waiting for them hiram said easily this imagery is being broadcast to us here in seattle from a station near brisbane aus traliabounced off various comsats with a time delay of a few seconds i dont mind telling you these boys have made a mountain of money in the last couple of yearstheir new song let me love you was number one around the world for four weeks over christmas and all the profit from that went to charity new song kate murmured cynically bobby leaned closer you dont like the vfabs oh come on she said the originals broke up sixtyfive years ago two of them died before i was bom their guitars and drums are so clunky and old fashioned compared to the new airware bands where the music emerges from the performers dance and any how all these new songs are just expertsystem extrap olated garbage all part of ourwhat do you call it in your polem icsour cultural decay he said gently hell yes she said but before his easy grace she felt a little embarrassed by her sourness hiram was still talking not just a stunt i was bom in during the summer of love of course some say the sixties were a cultural revolution that led nowhere perhaps thats truedirectly but it and its music of love and hope played a great part in shaping me and others of my generation bobby caught kates eye he mimed vomiting with a splayed hand and she had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing and at the height of that summer on june a global television show was mounted to demon strate the power of the nascent communications net work behind hiram the vfab drummer counted out a beat and the group started playing a dirgelike parody of the marseillaise that gave way to finely sung three the light of other days part harmony this was britains contribution hiram called over the music a song about love sung to two hundred million people around the world that show was called our world yes thats right thats where i got the name from i know its a little corny but as soon as i saw the tapes of that event at ten years old i knew what i wanted to do with my life corny yes thought kate but undeniably effective the audience was gazing spellbound at hirams giant im age as the music of a summer seven decades gone re verberated around the cafeteria and now said hiram with a showmans nourish i believe i have achieved my lifes goal id suggest hold ing on to somethingeven someone elses hand the floor turned transparent suddenly suspended over empty space kate felt herself stagger her eyes deceived despite the solidity of the floor beneath her feet there yas a gale of nervous laughter a few screams the gentle tinkle of dropped glass kate was surprised to find she had grabbed on to bobbys arm she could feel a knot of muscle there he had covered her hand with his apparently without cal culation she let her hand stay where it was for now she seemed to be hovering over a starry sky as if this cafeteria had been transported into space but these stars arrayed against a black sky were gathered and harnessed into a cubical lattice linked by a subtle tracery of multicolored light looking into the lattice the im ages receding with distance kate felt as if she were staring down an infinitely long tunnel with the music still playing around himso artfully subtly different from the original recordinghiram said you arent looking up into the sky into space arthur c clarke and stephen baxter instead you are looking down into the deepest structure of matter this is a crystal of diamond the white points you see are carbon atoms the links are the valence forces that join them i want to emphasize that what you are going to see though enhanced is not a simulation with modem technologyscanning tunneling microscopes for instancewe can build up images of matter even at this most fundamental of levels everything you see is real nowcome further holographic images rose to fill the room as if the cafeteria and all its occupants were sinking into the lat tice and shrinking the while carbon atoms swelled over kates head like pale gray balloons there were tantaliz ing hints of structure in their interior and all around her space sparkled points of light winked into existence only to be snuffed out immediately it was quite extraor dinarily beautiful like swimming through a firefly cloud youre looking at space said hiram empty space this is the stuff that fills the universe but now we are seeing space at a resolution far finer than the limits of the human eye a level at which individual elec trons are visibleand at this level quantum effects be come important empty space is actually full full of fluctuating energy fields and these fields manifest them selves as particles photons electronpositron pairs quarks they flash into a brief existence bankrolled by borrowed massenergy then disappear as the law of conservation of energy reasserts itself we humans see space and energy and matter from far above like an astronaut flying over an ocean we are too high to see the waves the flecks of foam they carry but they are there and we havent reached the end of our journey yet hang on to your drinks folks the scale exploded again kate found herself flying into the glassy onionshell interior of one of the carbon atoms there was a hard shining lump at its very center the light of other days a cluster of misshapen spheres was it the nucleus and were those inner spheres protons and neutrons as the nucleus flew at her she heard people cry out still clutching bobbys arm she tried not to flinch as she hurtled into one of the nucleons and then there was no shape here no form no definite light no color beyond a bloodred crimson and yet there was motion a slow insidious endless writhing punctuated by bubbles which rose and burst it was like the slow boiling of some foul thick liquid hiram said weve reached what the physicists call the planck level we are twenty order of magnitudes deeper than the virtualparticle level we saw earlier and at this level we cant even be sure about the structure of space itself topology and geometry break down and space and time become untangled at this most fundamental of levels there was no se quence to time no order to space the unification of spacetime was ripped apart by the forces of quantum gravity and space became a seething probabilistic froth laced by wormholes yes wormholes hiram said what were seeing here are the mouths of wormhotes spontaneously form ing threaded with electric fields space is what keeps everything from being in the same place right but at this level space is grainy and we cant trust it to do its job anymore and so a wormhole mouth can connect any point in this small region of spacetime to any other pointanywhere downtown seattle or brisbane aus tralia or a planet of alpha centauri its as if spacetime bridges are spontaneously popping into and out of ex istence his huge face smiled down at them reassuring dont understand this any more than you do the image said trust me my technical people will be on hand later to give you background briefings in as much depth as you can handle whats more important is what we intend to do with arthur cciarke and stephen baxter all this simply put we are going to reach into this quan tum foam and pluck out the wormhole we want a worm hole connecting our laboratory here in seattle with an identical facility in brisbane australia and when we have it stabilized that wormhole will form a link down which we can send signalsbeating light itself and this ladies and gentlemen is the basis of a new communications revolution no more expensive satel lites sandblasted by micrometeorites and orbitdecaying out of the sky no more frustrating time delay no more horrific chargesthe world our world will be truly linked at last as the virtuals kept playing there was a hubbub of conversation even heckling questions impossible wormholes are unstable everyone knows that in falling radiation makes wormholes collapse immedi ately you cant possibly hirams giant face loomed over the seething quantum foam he snapped his fingers the quantum foam dis appeared to be replaced by a single artifact hanging in the darkness below their feet there was a soft sigh kate saw a gathering of glowing light pointsatoms the lights made up a geodesic sphere closed over itself slowly turning and within she saw there was another sphere turning in the opposite senseand within that another sphere and another down to the limits of vision it was like some piece of clockwork an orrery of atoms but the whole structure pulsed with a pale blue light and she sensed a gathering of great energies it was she admitted truly beautiful hiram said this is called a casimir engine it is perhaps the most exquisitely constructed machine ever built by man a machine over which we have labored for yearsand yet it is less than a few hundred atomic di ameters wide you can see the shells are constructed of atomsin fact carbon atoms the structure is related to the natural the light of other days stable structures called buckyballs carbon you make the shells by zapping graphite with laser beams weve loaded the engine with electric charge using cages called penning trapselectromagnetic fields the structure is held together by powerful magnetic fields the various shells are maintained at their closest just a few electrons diameters apart and in those finest of gaps a miracle happens kate tiring of hirams wordy boasting quickly con sulted the search engine she learned that the casimir effect was related to me virtual particles she had seen sparkling into and out of existence in the narrow gap between the atomic shells because of resonance effects only certain types of particles would be permitted to ex ist and so those gaps were emptier than empty space and therefore less energetic this negativeenergy effect could give rise among other things to antigravity the structures various levels were starting to spin more rapidly small clocks appeared around the engines image counting patiently down from ten to nine eight seven the sense of energy gathering was palpable the concentration of energy in the casimir gaps is increasing hiram said were going to inject casinur effect negative energy into the wormholes of the quan tum foam the antigravity effects will stabilize and enlarge the wormholes we calculate that me probability of finding a worm hole connecting seattle to brisbane to acceptable ac curacy is one in ten million so it will take us some ten million attempts to locate the wormhole we want but this is atomic machinery and it works bloody fast even a hundred million attempts should take less than a sec ond and the beauty of it is down at the quantum level links to any place we want already exist all we have to do is find them the virtuals music was swelling to its concluding chorus kate stared as me frankenstein machine beneath arthur c clarke and stephen baxter her feet spun madly glowing palpably with energy and the clocks finished their count there was a dazzling flash some people cried out when kate could see again the atomic machine still spinning was no longer alone a silvery bead perfectly spherical hovered alongside it a wormhole mouth and the music had changed the vfabs had reached the chantlike chorus of their song but the music was distorted by a much coarser chanting that preceded the highquality sound by a few seconds aside from the music the room was utterly silent hiram gasped as if he had been holding his breath thats it he said the new signal you hear is me same performance but now piped here through the wormholewith no significant time delay we did it tonight for the first time in history humanity is sending a signal through a stable wormhole bobby leaned to kate and said wryly the first time apart from all the test runs really of course you dont think he was going to leave this to chance did you my father is a showman but you cant begrudge the man his moment of glory the giant display showed hiram was grinning la dies and gentlemennever forget what youve seen to night this is the start of the true communications revolution the applause started slowly scattered but rapidly ris ing to a thunderous climax kate found it impossible not to join in i wonder where this will lead she thought surely the possibilities of this new technologybased after all on the manip ulation of space and time themselveswould not prove limited to simple data transfer she sensed that nothing would be the same ever again kates eye was caught by a splinter of light dazzling somewhere over her head one of the drones was carry ing an image of the rocket ship shed noticed before it the light of other days was climbing into its patch of bluegray central asian sky utterly silently it looked strangely oldfashioned an image drifting up from the past rather than the future nobody else was watching it and it held little interest for her she turned away greenred flame billowed into curving channels of steel and concrete the light pulsed across the steppe toward vitaly it was bright dazzlingly so and it banished the dim floods that still lit up the booster stack even the brilliance of the steppe sun and even before the ship had left the ground the roar reached him a thunder that shook his chest ignoring the mounting pain in his arm and shoulder the numbness of his hands and feet vitaly stood opened his cracked lips and added his voice to that divine bel low he always had been a sentimental old fool at such moments but there was much agitation around him the people here the rathungry illtrained technicians and the fat corrupt managers alike were turning away from the launch they were huddling around radio sets and palm top televisions jewellike softscreens showing baffling images from america vitaly did not know the details and did not care to know but it was clear enough that hiram patterson had succeeded in his promise or threat even as it lifted from the ground his beautiful bird this last molniya was already obsolete vitaly stood straight determined to watch it as long as he could until that poini of light at the tip of the great smoke pillar melted into space but now me pain in his arm and chest reached a climax as if some bony hand was clutching there he gasped still he tried to stay on his feet but now there was a new light rising all around him even brighter than the rocket light that bathed the kazakhstan steppe and he could stand no longer the mindseye as kate was driven into the grounds it struck her as a typical seattle setting green hills that lapped right down to the ocean framed under a gray lowering au tumn sky but hirams mansiona giant geodesic dome all windowslooked as if it had just landed on the hillside one of the ugliest most gaudy buildings kate had ever seen on arrival she handed her coat to a drone her identity was scannednot just a reading of her implants but also probably patternmatching to identify her face even a nonintrusive dna sequencing all done in seconds then she was ushered inside by hirams robot servants hiram was working she wasnt surprised the six months since the launch of his wormhole datapipe tech nology had been his busiest and ourworlds most suc cessful ever according to the analysts but hed be back in time for dinner said the drone so she was taken to bobby the room was large the temperature neutral the walls as smooth and featureless as an eggshell the light was low the sound anechoic deadened the only furniture was a number of reclined blackleather couches beside each of the couches was a small table with a water spigot and a stand for intravenous feeds the light of other days and here was bobby patterson presumably one of the richest most powerful young men on the planet lying alone on a couch in the dark eyes open but unfocused limbs limp there was a metal band around his temples she sat on a couch beside bobby and studied him she could see that he was breathing slowly and the intravenous feed hed fitted to a socket in his arm was gently supplying his neglected body he was dressed in loose black shirt and shorts his body revealed where the loose clothing lay against his skin was a slab of muscle but that didnt tell much about his lifestyle such body sculpting could now be achieved easily through hormone treatments and electri cal stimulation he could even do that while he was lying here she thought like a coma victim lying in a hospital bed there was a trace of drool at the comer of his parted lips she wiped the drool away with a forefinger and gently pushed the mouth closed thank you she turned startled bobbysanother bobby identi cally dressed to the firstwas standing beside her grin ning irritated she threw a punch at his stomach her fist of course passed straight through him he didnt flinch you can see me then he said i see you you have retinal and cochlear implants yes this room is designed to produce virtuals compatible with all recent generations of cnsaugment technology of course to me youre sitting on the back of a mean looking phytosaur a what a triassic crocodile which is beginning to notice youre there welcome ms manzoni kate yes im glad you took up my our dinner invitation arthur c clarke and stephen baxter although i didnt expect it would take you six months to respond she shrugged hircim gets even richer really isnt much of a story unun which implies youve now heard something new of course he was right kate said nothing or he went on perhaps you finally succumbed to my charming smile perhaps i would if your mouth wasnt laced with drool bobby looked down at his own unconscious form vanity we should care how we look even when were exploring a virtual world he frowned of course if youre right its something for my marketing people to think about your marketing people sure he picked up a metal headband from a couch near him a virtual copy of the object separated from the real thing which remained on the couch this is the mindseye ourworlds newest vr technology do you want to try it not really he studied her youre hardly a vr virgin kate your sensory implants tare pretty much the minimum required to get around in the modern world have you ever tried getting through seatac airport without vr capabilities he laughed actually im generally escorted through i suppose you think its all part of a giant corporate conspiracy of course it is the technological invasion of our homes and cars and workplaces long ago reached satu ration point now they are coming for our bodies how angry you are he held up the headband it was an oddly recursive moment she thought absently a virtual copy of bobby holding a virtual copy of a virtual generator but this is different try it take a trip with me the light of other days she hesitatedbut then feeling she was being churl ish she agreed she was a guest here after all but she turned down his offer of an intravenous feed well just take a look around and come back out before our bodies fall apart agreed agreed he said pick a couch just fit the headset over your temples like this carefully he raised the virtual set over his head his face intent was undeniably beautiful she thought he looked like christ with the crown of thoms she lay down on a couch nearby and lifted a mindseye headband onto her own head it had warmth and elasticity and when she pulled it down past her hair it seemed to nestle into place her scalp under the band prickled ouch bobby was sitting on his couch infusers dont worry about it most of the input is via transcranial mag netic stimulation when weve rebooted you wont feel a thing as he settled she could see his two bodies of flesh and pixels briefly overlaid the room went dark for a heartbeat two she could see hear nothing her sense dt her body faded away as if her brain were being scooped out of her skull with an intangible thud she felt herself fall once more into her body but now she was standing in some kind of mud light and heat burst over her blue green brown she was on a riverbank up to her ankles in thick black gumbo the sky was a washedout blue she was at the edge of a forest a lush riot of ferns pines and giant conifers whose thick dark foliage blocked out much of the light the heat and humidity were stifling she could feel sweat soak through her shirt and trousers plastering her fringe to her forehead the nearby river was broad languid brown with mud arthur c clarke and stephen baxter she climbed a little deeper into the forest seeking firmer ground the vegetation was very thick leaves and shoots slapped at her face and arms there were insects everywhere including giant blue dragonflies and the jungle was alive with noise chirping growling cawing the sense of reality was startling the authenticity far beyond any vr shed experienced before impressive isnt it bobby was standing beside her he was wearing khaki shorts and shirt and a broad hat safari style there was an oldfashionedlooking rifle slung from his shoulder where are we i mean when arc we this is arizona the late triassic some two hundred million years ago more like africa yes this period gave us me painted desert strata we have giant horsetails ferns cycads club mosses but this is a drab world in some ways the evolution of the flowers is still far in the future makes you think doesnt it she propped her foot on a log and tried to scrape the gumbo off her legs with her hands the heat was deeply uncomfortable and her growing thirst was sharp her bare arm was covered by a myriad sweat globules which glimmered authentically so hot they felt as if they were about to boil bobby pointed upward look it was a bird flapping inelegantly between the branches of a tree no it was too big and ungainly for a bird besides it lacked feathers perhaps it was some kind of flying reptile it moved with a purple leathery rusde and kate shuddered admit it he said youre impressed she moved her arms and legs around bent this way and that my body sense is strong i can feel my limbs sense up and down if i tilt but i assume im still lying in my couch drooling like you were yes the proprioception features of the miodseye are very striking you arent even sweating well prob the light of other days ably not sometimes theres a little leakage this is fourthgeneration vr technology counting forward from crude glassesandgloves then senseorgan implants like yoursand cortical implants which allowed a di rect interface between external systems and the human central nervous system barbaric she snapped perhaps he said gently which brings me to the mindseye the headbands produce magnetic fields which can stimulate precise areas of the brain all with out the need for physical intervention but it isnt just the redundancy of implants thats exciting he said smoothly its the precision and scope of the simulation we can achieve right now for ex ample a fisheye map of the scene is being painted di rectly onto your visual cortex we stimulate the amygdala and the insula in the temporal lobe to give you a sense of smell thats essential for the authenticity of the experience scents seem to go straight to the brains limbic system the seat of the emotions thats why scents arc always so evocative you know we even de liver mild jolts of pain by lighting up the anterior cin gulate cortexthe center not of pain itself but of the conscious awareness of pain actually we do a lot of work with the limbic system to ensure everything you see packs an emotional punch then theres proprioception body sense which is very complex involving sensory inputs from the skin muscles and tendons visual and motion information from the brain balance data from the inner ear it took a lot of brain mapping to get that right but now we can make you fall fly turn somersaults all without leaving your couch and we can make you see wonders like this you know this stuff well youre proud of it arent you of course i am its my development he blinked and she became aware that it was the first time hed arthur c clarke and stephen baxter looked directly at her for some minutes even here in this mockedup triassic jungle he made her feel vaguely uneasyeven though she was on some level undoubt edly attracted to him bobbyin what sense is this yours did you initiate it did you fund it im my fathers son its his corporation im working within but i oversee the mindseye research i fieldtest the products fieldtest you mean you come down here and play huntthedinosaur i wouldnt call it playing he said mildly let me show you he stood briskly and pushed on deeper into the jungle she struggled to follow she had no machete and the branches and thorns were soon cutting through her thin clothes and into her flesh it suing but not too much of course not it wasnt real just some damn adventure game she plunged after bobby fuming inwardly about decadent technology and excess wealth they reached the edge of a clearing an area of fallen charred trees within which small green shoots were struggling to emerge perhaps this had been cleared by lightning bobby held out an arm keeping her back at the edge of the forest look an animal was grubbing with snout and paws among the dead charred wood fragments it must have been two meters long with a wolflike head and protruding canine teeth despite its lupine appearance it was grunting like a pig a cynodont whispered bobby a protomammal our ancestor no the true mammals have already branched off the cynodonts are an evolutionary dead end shit now there was a loud crashing from the undergrowth on the far side of the clearing it was a jurassic park dinosaur at least two meters tall it came bounding out the light of other days of the forest on massive hind legs huge jaws agape scales glittering the cynodont seemed to freeze eyes fixed on the predator the dino leapt on he back of the cynodont which was flattened under the weight of its assailant the two of them rolled crushing the young trees growing here the cynodont squealing she shrank back into the jungle clutching bobbys arm she felt the shaking of the ground the power of the encounter impressive she conceded the camosaur finished up on top holding down its prey with the weight of its body it bent to the proto mammals neck and with a single snap bit through it the cynodont was still struggling but white bones showed in its rippedopen neck and blood gushed and when the camosaur burst the stomach of its prey there was a stink of rotten meat that almost made kate retch almost but not quite of course not just as if she looked closely there was a smooth fakeness to the spurt ing blood of the protomammal a glistening brightness to the dinos scales every vr was like this gaudy but limited even the stench and noise modeled for user com fort all of it as harmlessand therefore as meaning lessas a themepark ride i think thats a dilophosaur murmured bobby fantastic thats why i love this period its a kind of junction of life everything overlaps here the old with the new our ancestors and the first dinosaurs yes said kate recovering but it isnt real he tapped his skull its like all fiction you have to suspend your disbelief but its just some magnetic field tickling my lower brain this isnt even the genuine triassic for gods sake just some academics bad guessworkwith a little color thrown in for the virtual tourist arthur c clarke and stephen baxter he was smiling at her youre always so angry your point is she stared at his empty blue eyes up to now he had set the agenda if you want to get any further she told herself if you want to get any closer to what you came for youll have to challenge him bobby right now youre lying in a darkened room none of this counts you sound as if youre sony for me he seemed curious your whole life seems to be like this for all your talk of vr projects and corporate responsibilities you dont have any real control over anything do you the world you live in is as unreal as any virtual simulation think about it you were actually alone before i showed up he pondered that perhaps but you did show up he shouldered his rifle come on time for dinner with dad he cocked an eyebrow maybe youll stick around even when youve got whatever it is you want out of us bobby but he had already lifted his hands to his headband dinner was difficult the three of them sat beneath the domed apex of hirams mansion stars and a gaunt crescent moon showed between gaps in the racing clouds the sky could not have been more spectacularbut it struck her that thanks to hirams wonnhote datapipes the sky was soon going to get a lot more dull as the last of the low orbit comsats were allowed to fall back into the atmo sphere the food was finely prepared as shed expected and served by silent drone robots but the courses were fairly plain seafood dishes of the type she could have enjoyed in any of a dozen restaurants in seattle the wine a straightforward californian chardonnay there wasnt a the light of other days trace here of hirams own complex origins no original ity or expression of personality of any kind and meanwhile hirams focus on her was intense and unrelenting he peppered her with questions and supple mentaries about her background her family her career over and again she found herself saying more than she should his hostility under a veneer of politeness was un mistakable he knows what im up to she realized bobby sat quietly eating little though his discon certing habit of avoiding eye contact lingered he seemed more aware of her than before she sensed attraction that wasnt so difficult to readbut also a certain fas cination maybe shed somehow punctured that compla cent slick hide of his as shed hoped to or more likely she conceded he was simply puzzled by his own reac tions to her or maybe this was all just fantasy on her part and she ought to keep from meddling in other peoples heads a habit she so strongly condemned in others s t dont get it hiram was saying now how can it have taken until to find the wormwood an object four hundred kilometers across i know its out beyond uranus but still its extremely dark and slow moving said kate it is apparently a comet but much bigger than any comet known we dont know where it came from perhaps there is a cloud of such objects out there somewhere beyond neptune and nobody was especially looking that way any how even spaceguard concentrates on nearearth space me objects which are likely to hit us in the near future the wormwood was found by a network of skygazing amateurs umm said hiram and now its on its way here yes in five hundred years bobby waved a strong manicured hand but thats so far ahead there must be contingency plans arthur c clarke and stephen baxter what contingency plans bobby the wormwood is a giant we dont know any way to push the damn thing away even in principle and when that rock falls there will be nowhere to hide we dont know any way bobby said dryly i mean the astronomers the way you were talking id almost imagined you discovered it yourself he was needling her responding to her earlier probing its so easy to mix up ones own achievement with that of the people one relies on isnt it hiram was cackling i can tell you kids are getting on just fine if you care enough to argue and you of course ms manzoni think the people have a right to know that the world is going to end in five hundred years dont you bobby said and youve no concern for the conse quencesthe suicides the leap in abortion rates the abandonment of various environmentconservation pro jects i brought the bad news she said tensely i didnt bring the wormwood look if we arent informed we cant act for better or ill we cant take responsibility for ourselvesin whatever time we have left not that our options are promising probably the best we can do is send a handful of people off to somewhere safer the moon or mars or an asteroid even that isnt guaranteed to save the species unless we can establish a breeding population and she said heavily those who do es cape will no doubt be those who govern us and their offspring unless we shake off our electronic anaesthe sia hiram pushed his chair back and roared with laughter electronic anaesthesia how true that is as long as im selling the anaesthetics of course he looked at her directly i like you ms manzoni liar thank you the light of other days why are you here there was a long silence you invited me six months and seven days ago why now are you working for my rivals no she bristled at that im a freelance he nodded nevertheless there is something you want here a story of course the wormwood is already receding into your past and you need fresh triumphs a new scoop thats what people like you live on dont you ms manzoni but what can it be nothing per sonal surely there is little about me that is not in the public record she said carefully oh i dare say there arc a few items she took a breath the truth is i beard you have a new project a new wormhole application far beyond the simple datapipes which you came here grubbing for facts said hiram come on hiram the whole world is getting wired up with your wonnholes if i could scoop the rest but you know nothing she bridled ill show you what f know you were bom hirdamani patei before you were born your fa thers family was forced to flee uganda ethnic cleans ing right hiram glared this is public knowledge in uganda my father was a bank manager in norfolk he drove buses as nobody would recognize his qualifications you werent happy in england kate bulldozed on you found yourself unable to overcome barriers of race and class so you left for america you dumped your given name adopted an anglicized version you have become known as something of a role model for asians in america and yet you cut yourself off from your eth nic origins each of your wives has been a wasp bobby looked startled wives dad family is everything to you kate said evenly com pelling their attention youre trying to establish a dy nasty it seems through bobby here perhaps its because arthur c clarke and stephen baxter you abandoned your own family your own father back in england ah hiram clapped his hands forcing a smile i wondered how long it would be before papa sigmund joined us at the table so that is your story hiram pat terson is building ourworld because he is guilty about his father bobby was frowning kate what new project are you talking about was it possible bobby really didnt know she held hirams gaze relishing her sudden power significant enough for him to summon your brother back from france brother significant enough for him to take on billybob meeks as an investment partner meeks the founder of reveladonland have you heard of that bobby the latest mindsapping moneydrinking perversion of reli gion to afflictamericas wretched population of the gul lible this is irrelevant hiram snapped yes im work ing with meeks ill work with anybody if people want to buy my vr gear so they can see jesus and his tap dancing apostles ill sell it to them who am i to judge we arent all as sanctimonious as you ms manzoni we dont all have that luxury but bobby was staring at hiram my brothert kate was startled and ran the conversation through her head again bobby you didnt know any of this did you not just about the project but hirams other wife his other child she looked at hiram shocked how could anybody keep a secret like that hirams mouth pursed and his glare at kate was full of loathing a brother bobby just a halfbrother kate said clinically his name is david she pro nounced it the french way dahveed his mother was french hes thirtytwoseven years older than you bobby hes a physicist hes doing well hes been de theught of other days scribed as the hawking of his generation oh and hes catholic devout apparently bobby seemednot angryeven more baffled he said to hiram why didnt you tell me hiram said you didnt need to know and the new project whatever it is why didnt you tell me about that hiram stood up your company has been charming ms manzoni the drones will show you out she stood you cant stop me printing what i know print what you please you dont have anything im portant and she knew he was right she walked to the door her euphoria dissipating quickly i blew it she told herself i meant to ingratiate myself with hiram instead i had to have my fun and make him into an enemy she looked back bobby was still seated he was look ing at her those strange churchwindow eyes open wide ill see you again she thought maybe this wasnt over yet the door began to close her last glimpse was of hiram covering his sons hand withhis own tenderly the wormworks hiram was waiting for david curzon in the arrivals hall at seatac hiram was simply overwhelming he immediately grabbed davids shoulders and pulled him close david could smell powerful cologne synthtobacco a lingering trace of spices hiram was nearing seventy but didnt show it no doubt thanks to antiaging treatments and subtle cosmetic sculpting he was tall and darkwhere david taking after his mother was more stocky blond leaning to plump and here was that voice david hadnt heard since he was five years old the faceblue eyes strong nose that had loomed over him like a giant moon my boy its been too long come on weve got a hell of a lot to catch up on david had spent most of the flight from england com posing himself for this encounter you are thirtytwo years old he told himself you have a tenured position at oxford your papers and your popular book on the exotic mathematics of quantum physics have been ex tremely well received this man may be your father but he abandoned you and has no hold over you you are an adult now you have your faith you have nothing to fear but hiram as he surely intended had broken through all davids defenses in the first five seconds of their the light of other days encounter david bewildered allowed himself to be led away hiram took his son straight to his research facilitythe wormworks as he called itout to the north of seattle itself the drive in a smartdrive rolls was fast and scary controlled by positioning satellites and intelligent incar software the vehicles flowed along the freeways at more than kilometers an hour mere centimeters between their bumpers it was all much more aggressive than david was used to in europe but the city what he saw of it struck him as quite european a place of fine wellpreserved houses with expansive views of hills and sea the more modern de velopments integrated reasonably gracefully with the overall feel of the place the downtown area seemed to be bustling as the christmas buying season descended once more he remembered little of the place but childhood frag ments the small boat hiram vsed to run out of the sound trips above the snow line hi winter hed been back to america many times before of course theoret ical physics was an international discipline but hed never returned to seattlenot since the day his mother had so memorably bundled him up and stormed out of hiram s home hiram talked continually peppering his son with questions so you feel settled in england well you know about the climate problems but even icebound oxford is a fine place to live especially since they abolished private cars inside the ring road and those stuckup british toffs dont pick on you for that french accent father i am french thats my identity but not your citizenship hiram slapped his sons arthur c clarke and stephen baxter thigh youre an american dont forget that he glanced at david more warily and are you still prac ticing david smiled you mean am i stil a catholic yes father hiram grunted that bloody mother of yours biggest mistake i ever made was shackling myself to her without taking account of her religion and now shes passed the god virus on to you david felt his nostrils flare your language is offen sive yes im sorry so england is a good place to be a catholic nowadays since they disestablished the church england has acquired one of the healthiest catholic communities in the world hiram grunted you dont often hear the words healthy and catholic in the same sentence were here they had reached a broad parking lot the car pulled over david climbed out after his father they were close to the ocean here and david was immediately immersed in chill saltladen air the lot fringed a large open building crudely con structed of concrete and corrugated metal like an aircraft hangar there was a giant corrugated door at one end partly open and robot trucks were hauling cartons into the building from a stack outside hiram led his son to a small humansized door cut in one wall it was dwarfed by the scale of the structure welcome to the center of the universe hiram looked abashed suddenly look i dragged you out here with out thinking i know youre just off your flight if you need a break a shower hiram seemed full of genuine concern for his welfare and david couldnt resist a smile maybe coffee a little later show me your new toy the space within was cold cavernous as they walked the light of other days across the dusty concrete floor their footsteps echoed the roof was ribbed and strip lights dangled every where filling the vast volume with a cold pervasive gray light there was a sense of hush of calm david was reminded more of a cathedral than a technological facility at the center of the building a stack of equipment towered above the handful of technicians working here david was a theoretician not an experimentalist but he recognized the paraphernalia of a highenergy experi mental rig there were subatomicparticle detectors arrays of crystal blocks stacked high and deepand boxes of control electronics piled up like white bricks dwarfed by the detector array itself but each itself the size of a mobile home the technicians werent typical of a highenergy phys ics establishment however on average they seemed quite oldperhaps around sixty given how hard it was to estimate ages these days he raised this with hiram yeah ourworld makes ft policy of hiring older workers anyhow theyre conscientious generally as smart as they ever were thanks to the brain chemicals they give us now and grateful for a job and in this case most of the people here are victims of the ssc cancellation the sscthe superconducting super collider a multibilliondollar particleaccelerator project that would have been built under a cornfield in texas had it not been canned by congress in the s hiram said a whole generation of american particle physicists was hit by that decision they survived they found jobs in industry and wall street and so forth most of them never got over their disappointment however but the ssc would have been a mistake the linear accelerator technology that came along a few years later was far more effective and cheaper and besides most arthur c clarke and stephen baxter fundamental results in particle physics since or so have come from studies of highenergy cosmological events it doesnt matter not to these people the ssc might have been a mistake but it would have been their mistake when i traced these guys and offered them a chance to come work in cuttingedge highenergy phys ics again they jumped at the chance he eyed his son you know youre a smart boy david im not a boy you had the kind of education i could never even have dreamed of but theres a lot i could teach you even so like how to handle people he waved a hand at the technicians look at these guys theyre working for a promise for dreams of their youth aspiration self fulfillment if you can find some way to tap into that you can get people to work like pit ponies and for pen nies david followed him frowning they reached a guardrail and one grayhaired tech nicianwith a curt somewhat awed nod at hiram handed them hard hats david fitted his gingerly to his head david leaned over the rail he could smell machine oil insulation cleaning solvents from here he could see that the detector array actually extended some distance below the ground surface at the center of the pit was a tight knot of machinery dark and unfamiliar a puff of vapor like wispy steam billowed from the core of the machinery cryogenics perhaps there was a whirr somewhere above david looked up to see a beam crane in action a long steel beam that extended over the de tector array with a grabbing arm at the end hiram murmured most of this stuff is just detectors of one kind or another so we can figure out what is going onparticularly when something goes wrong he pointed at the knot of machinery at the core of the the light of other days array that is the business end a cluster of supercon ducting magnets hence the cryogenics yes we make our big electromagnetic fields in there the fields we use to build our buckyball casimir engines there was pride in his voicejustifiable thought david this was the very site where we opened up that first wormhole back in the spring im getting a plaque put up you know one of those historic markers call me immodest now were using this place to push the technology further as far and as fast as we can david turned to hiram why have you brought me out here just the question i was going to ask the third voice utterly unexpected clearly startled hiram a figure stepped out of the shadows of the detector stack and came to stand beside hiram for a moment davids heart pumped for it might have been hirams twinor his premature ghost but at second glance da vid could detect differences the second man was considerably younger less bulky perhaps a little taller and his hair was still thick and glossy black but those ice blue eyes so unusual given an asian descent were undoubtedly hirams i know you david said from tabloid tv david forced a smile youre bobby and you must be david the halfbrother i didnt know i had until i had to learn it from a journalist bobby was clearly angry but his selfcontrol was icy david realized he had landed in the middle of a com plicated family rowworse it was his family hiram looked from one to the other of his sons he sighed david maybe its time i bought you that cof fee arthur c clarke and stephen baxter the coffee was among the worst david had ever tasted but the technician who served the three of them hovered at the table until david took his first sip this is seattle david reminded himself here quality coffee has been a fetish among the social classes who man installations like this for a generation he forced a smile marvel ous he said the tech went away beaming the facilitys cafeteria was tucked into the comer of the countinghouse me computing center where data from the various experiments run here were analyzed the counting house itself characteristic of hirams cost conscious operations was minimal just a temporary of fice module with a plastic tile floor fluorescent ceiling panels woodeffect plastic workstation partitions it was jammed with computer terminals softscreens oscillo scopes and other electronic equipment cables and light fiber ducts snaked everywhere bundles of them taped to the walls and floor and ceiling there was a complex smell of electricalequipment ozone of stale coffee and sweat the cafeteria itself had turned out to be a dismal shack with plastic tables and vending machines all maintained by a battered drone robot hiram and his two sons sat around a table arms folded avoiding each others eyes hiram dug into a pocket and produced a handkerchief sized softscreen smoothed it flat he said ill get to the point on replay cairo david watched the screen he saw through a suc cession of brief scenes some kind of medical emergency unfolding in sundrenched cairo egypt stretcher bearers carrying bodies from buildings a hospital crowded with corpses and despairing relatives and ha rassed medical staff mothers clutching the inert bodies of infants screaming dear god god seems to have been looking the other way hiram said grimly this happened this morning an the light of other days other water war one of egypts neighbors dumped a toxin in the nile first estimates are two thousand dead ten thousand ill many more deaths expected now he tapped the little screen look at the pic ture quality some of these images are from handheld cams some from drones all taken within ten minutes of the first reported outbreak by a local news agency and heres the problem hiram touched the comer of the image with his fingernail it bore a logo eno the earth news online network one of hirams bitterest rivals in the newsgathering field hiram said we tried to strike a deal with the local agency but eno scooped us he looked at his sons this happens all the time in fact the bigger i get the more sharp little critters like eno snap at my heels i keep camera crews and stringers all around the world at considerable expense i have local agents on every street comer across the planet but we cant be everywhere and if we arent there it can take hours days even to get a crew in place in the twentyfourhour news business believe me beyig a minute late is fatal david frowned i dont understand youre talking about competitive advantage people are dying here right in front of your eyes people die all the time said hiram harshly people die in wars over resources like in cairo here or over fine religious or ethnic differences or because some bloody typhoon or flood or drought hits them as the cli mate goes crazy or they just plain die i cant change that if i dont show it somebody else will im not here to argue morality what im concerned about is the fu ture of my business and right now im losing out and thats why i need you both of you bobby said bluntly first tell us about our mothers david held his breath hiram gulped his coffee he said slowly all right but there really isnt much to tell evedavids motherwas my first wife arthur c clarke and stephen baxter and your first fortune david said dryly hiram shrugged we used eves inheritance as seed com money to start the business its important that you understand david i never ripped off your mother in the early days we were partners we had a kind of long range business plan i remember we wrote it out on the back of a menu at our wedding reception we hit every bloody one of those targets and more we mul tiplied your mothers fortune tenfold and we had you but you had an affair and your marriage broke up david said hiram eyed david how judgmental you are just like your mother just tell us dad bobby pressed hiram nodded yes i had an affair with your mother bobby heather she was called i never meant it to be this way david my relationship wim eve had been failing for a long time that damn religion of hers so you threw her out she tried to throw me out wanted us to come to a settlement to be civilized about it in the end she ran out on metaking you with her david leaned forward but you cut her out of your business interests a business you had built on her money hiram shrugged i told you i wanted a settlement she wanted it all we couldnt compromise his eyes hardened i wasnt about to give up everything id built up not on the whim of some religioncrazed nut even if she was my wife your mother when she lost her all ornothing suit she went to france wim you and dis appeared off the face of the earth or tried to he smiled it wasnt hard to track you down hiram reached for his arm twit david pulled back david you never knew it but ive been there for you i found ways to umm help you out without your mother knowing i the light of other days wouldnt go so far as to say you owe everything you have to me but david felt anger blaze what makes you think i wanted your help bobby said wheres your mother now david tried to calm down she died cancer it could have been easier for her we couldnt afford she wouldnt let me help her hiram said even at the end she pushed me away david said what do you expect you took every thing she had from her hiram shook his head she took something more im portant from me you and so bobby said coldly you focused your am bition on me hiram shrugged what can i say bobby i gave you everythingeverything id have given both of you i prepared you as best i could preparedt david laughed bemused what kind of word is that hiram thumped the table if joe kennedy can do it why not hiram patterson dont you see boys theres no limit to what we can achieve if we work to gether you are talking about politics david eyed bobbys sleek puzzled face is that what you intend for bobby perhaps the presidency itself he laughed you are exactly as i imagined you father and hows that arrogant manipulative hiram was growing angry and you are just as i expected as pompous and pious as your mother bobby was staring at his father bemused david stood perhaps we have said enough hirams anger dissipated immediately no wait im sorry youre right i didnt drag you all the way over here to fight with you sit down and hear me out please arthur c clarke and stephen baxter david remained on his feet what do you want of me hiram sat back and studied him i want you to build a bigger wormhole for me how much bigger hiram took a breath big enough to look through there was a long silence david sat down shaking his head thats impossible i know but let me tell you anyhow hiram got up and walked around the cluttered cafeteria gesturing as he talked animated excited suppose i could immediately open up a wormhole from my news room in seattle direct to this story event in cairoand suppose that wormhole was wide enough to transmit pic tures from the event could feed images from anywhere in the world straight into the network with virtually no delay right think about it i could fire my stringers and remote crews reducing my costs to a fraction i could even set up some kind of automated search facility con tinually keeping watch through shortlived wormholes waiting for the next story to break wherever and when ever theres really no limit bobby smiled weakly dad theyd never scoop you again bloody right hiram turned to david thats the dream now tell me why its impossible david frowned its hard to know where to start right now you can establish metastable datapipes be tween two fixed points thats a considerable achieve ment in itself but you need a massive piece of machinery at each end to anchor each wormhole mouth correct now you want to open up a stable wormhole mouth at the remote end at your news storys location without the benefit of any kind of anchor correct well thats the first thing thats impossible as im sure your technical people have been telling you so they have what else the light of other days you want to use these wormholes to transmit visible light photons now quantumfoam wormholes come in at the planckwheeler length which is tentominus thirtyfive meters youve managed to expand them up through twenty orders of magnitude to make them big enough to pass gammaray photons very high fre quency very short wavelength yeah we use the gamma rays to carry digitized data streams which but the wavelength of your gamma rays is around a million times smaller than visiblelight wavelengths the mouths of your secondgeneration wormholes would have to be around a micron across at least david eyed his father i take it youve had your engineers trying to achieve exactly that and it doesnt work hiram sighed weve actually managed to pump in enough casimir energy to rip open wormholes that wide but you get some kind of feedback effect which causes me damn things to collapse david nodded they call it wheeler instability wormholes arent naturally stable a wormhole mouths gravity pulls in photons accelerates them to high energy and that energized radiation bombards the throat and causes it to pinch off its the effect you have to counter with casimireffect negative energy to keep open even the smallest wormholes hiram walked to the window of the little cafeteria beyond david could see the hulking form of the detec tor complex at the heart of the facility i have some good minds here but these people are experimentalists all they can do is trap and measure what happens when it all goes wrong what we need is to beef up the theory to go beyond the state of the art which is where you come in he turned david i want you to take a sab batical from oxford and come work with me on this hiram put his arm around davids shoulders his flesh was strong and warm its pressure overpowering think of how this could turn out maybe youll pick up the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter nobel prize in physics while simultaneously ill eat up eno and those other yapping dogs who run at my heels father and son together sons what do you think david was aware of bobbys eyes on him i guess hiram clapped his hands together i knew youd say yes i havent yet okay okay but you will i sense it you know its just terrific when longterm plans pay off david felt cold what longterm plans talking fast and eagerly hiram said if you were going to work in physics i was keen for you to stay in europe i researched the field you majored in mathe maticscorrect then you took your doctorate in a de partment of applied math and theoretical physics at cambridge yes hawkings department thats a typical european route as a result youre well versed in uptodate math its a difference of cul ture americans have led the world in practical physics but they use math that dates back to world war two so if youre looking for a theoretical breakthrough dont ask anyone trained in america and here i am said david coldly with my con venient european education bobby said slowly dad are you telling us you ar ranged things so that david got a european physics ed ucation just on the off chance that hed be useful to you and all without his knowledge hiram stood straight not just useful to me more useful to himself more useful to the world more liable to achieve success he looked from one to the other of his sons and placed his hands on their heads as if bless ing them everything ive done has been in your best interest dont you see that yet david looked into bobbys eyes bobbys gaze slid away his expression unreadable wormwood extracted from wormwood when mountains melt by katherine manwni published by shiva press new york also available as internet floater dataset we face great challenges as a species if we are to survive the next few centuries it has become clear that the effects of climate change will be much worse than imagined a few decades ago indeed predictions of those effects from say the s now look foolishly optimistic we know now that the rapid warming of the last couple of centuries has caused a series of meta stable natural systems around the planet to flip to new states from beneath the thawing permafrost of siberia billions of tonnes of methane and other greenhouse gases are already being released warming ocean waters are destabilizing more huge methane reservoirs around the continental shelves northern europe is entering a period of extreme cold because of the shutdown of the gulf stream new atmospheric modespermanent storms seem to be emerging over the oceans and the great landmasses the death of the tropical forests is dumping vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere the slow melting of the west antarctic ice sheet seems to be releasing pressure on an ar chipelago of sunken islands beneath and volcanic activity is likely which will in turn lead to a cata strophic additional melting of the sheet the rise in i arthur c clarke and stephen baxter sea levels is now forecast to be much higher than was imagined a few decades ago and so on all of these changes are interlinked it may be that the spell of climatic stability which the earth has enjoyed for thousands of yearsa stability which allowed human civilization to emerge in the first placeis now coming to an end perhaps be cause of our own actions the worst case is that we are heading for some irreversible climatic break down for example a runaway greenhouse which would kill us all but all these problems pale in comparison to what will befall us if the body now known as the wormwood should impact the earthalthough it is a chill coincidence that the russian for worm wood is chemobyl much of the speculation about the wormwood and its likely consequence has been sadly misinformed indeed complacent let me reiterate some basic facts here fact the wormwood is not an asteroid the astronomers think the wormwood might once have been a moon of neptune or uranus or perhaps it was locked in a stable point in neptunes orbit and was then perturbed somehow but per turbed it was and now it is on a fivehundredyear collision course with earth fact the wormwoods impact will not be com parable to the chicxulub impact which caused the extinction of the dinosaurs that impact was sufficient to cause mass death and to alterdrastically and for all timethe course of evolution of life on earth but it was caused by an impactor some ten kilometers across the wormwood is forty times as large and its mass the light of other days ј is therefore some sixty thousand times as great fact the wormwood will not simply cause a mass extinction event like chicxulub it will be much worse than that the heat pulse will sterilize the land to a depth of fifty meters life might survive but only by be ing buried deep in caves we know no way even in principle by which a human community could ride out the impact it may be that viable popula tions could be established on other worlds in orbit on mars or the moon but even in five centuries only a small fraction of the worlds current popu lation could be sheltered offworld thus earth cannot be evacuated when the wormwood arrives almost everybody will die fact the wormwood cannot be deflected with foreseeable technology it is possible we could turn aside small bodiesa few kilometers across typical of the population of nearearth asteroidswith such means as emplaced nuclear charges or thermonuclear rockets the chal lenge of deflecting the wormwood is many orders of magnitude greater thought experiments on moving such bodies have proposed for example using a series of gravitational assistsnot available in this caseor using advanced technology such as nanotech von neumann machines to dismantle and disperse the body but such technologies are far be yond our current capabilities two years after i exposed the conspiracy to con ceal from the general public the existence of the wormwood attention is already moving onand we have yet to start work on the great project of our survival indeed the wormwood itself is already having advance effects it is a cruel irony that just as for the first time in our history we were beginning to manage our future responsibly and jointly the pros arthur c clarke and stephen baxter pect of wormwood day seems to render such ef forts meaningless already weve seen the abandonment of various voluntary wasteemission guidelines the closure of nature reserves an up graded search for sources of nonrenewable fuels an extinction pulse among endangered species if the house is to be demolished tomorrow anyhow peo ple seem to feel we may as well bum the furniture today none of our problems arc insolublenot even the wormwood but it seems clear that to prevail we humans will have to act with a smartness and selflessness that has so far eluded us during our long and tangled history still my hope centers on humanity and ingenu ity it is significant i believe that the wormwood was discoverednot by the professionals who werent looking mat waybut by a network of am ateur sky watchers who set up robot telescopes in their backyards and used shareware routines to scan optical detector images for changing glimmers of light and refused to accept the cloak of secrecy our government tried to lay over them it is in groups like thisearnest intelligent cooperative stubborn refusing to submit to impulses toward su icide or hedonism or selfishness seeking new so lutions to challenge the complacency of the professionalsthat our best and brightest hope of surviving the future may lie virtual heaven l obby was late arriving at revelationland kate was still waiting in the car lot for him as the swarms of aging adherents started pressing through the gates of bil lybob meeks giant cathedral of concrete and glass this cathedral had once been a football stadium i they were forced to sit near the back of one of the stands their view impeded by pillars sellers of hot dogs pea h nuts soft drinks and recreational drugs were working the ji crowd and muzak played over the pa jerusalem she f recognized based on blakes great poem about me leg is endary visit of christ to britain now the anthem of the new postunited kingdom england a the entire floor of the stadium was mirrored making it a floor of blue sky littered with fat december clouds i at the center there was a gigantic throne covered in t stones glimmering green and blueprobably impure s quartz she thought water sprayed through the air and arc lamps created a rainbow which arched spectacularly more lamps hovered in the air before the throne held aloft by drone robots and smaller thrones circled bearing elders old men and women dressed in white with golden crowns on their skinny heads and there were beasts the size of tipper trucks prowl ing around the field they were grotesque every part of their bodies covered with blinking eyes one of them opened giant wings and flew eaglelike a few meters the beasts roared at the crowd their calls amplified arthur c clarke and stephen baxter by a booming pa the crowd got to its feet and cheered as if celebrating a touchdown bobby was oddly nervous he was wearing a tight fitting onepiece suit of bright scarlet with a color morphing kerchief draped around his neck he was a gorgeous twentyfirstcentury dandy she thought as out of place in the drab elderly multitude around him as a diamond in a childs seashore pebble collection she touched his hand are you okay i didnt realize theyd all be so old he was right of course the gathering congregation was a powerful illustration of the silvering of america many of the crowd in fact had cognitiveenhancer studs clearly visible at the backs of their necks there to com bat the onset of agerelated diseases like alzheimers by stimulating the production of neurotransmitters and cell adhesion molecules go to any church in the country and youll see the same thing bobby sadly people are attracted to reli gion when they approach death and now there are more old peopleand with the wormwood coming we all feel the brush of that dark shadow perhaps billybob is just surfing a demographic wave anyhow these people wont bite maybe not but they smell cant you tell she laughed one should never put on ones best trousers to go out to battle for freedom and truth huh henrik ibsen now a man stood up on the big central throne he was short fat and his face shone with sweat his am plified voice boomed out welcome to revelationland do you know why youre here his finger stabbed do you do you listen to me now on the lords day i was in the spirit and i heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet which said write on a scroll what you see and he held up a glittering scroll kate leaned toward bobby meet billybob meeks the light of other days prepossessing isnt he clap along protective colora tion whats going on kate evidently youve never read the book of revelation the bibles deranged punch line she pointed seven hovering lamps twentyfour thrones around the big one revelation is riddled with magic numbersthree seven twelve and its description of the end of things is very literal although at least billybob uses the traditional versions not the modem editions which have been re written to show how the wormwood date of was there in the text all along she sighed the astron omers who discovered the wormwood didnt do any body any favors by calling it that chapter eight verse ten the third angel sounded his trumpet and a great star blazing like a torch fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waterthe name of the star is wormwood i dont understand why you invited me here today in fact i dont know how you got a message through to me after my father threw you out hiram isnt yet omnipotent bohby she said not even over you and as to whylook up a drone robot hovered over their heads labeled with a stark simple word grains it dipped into the crowd in response to the summons of members of the congre gation bobby said grains the mind accelerator yes billybobs specialty do you know blake to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour the pitch is that if you take grains your perception of time will speed up subjec tively youll be able to think more thoughts have more experiences in the same external time a longer life available exclusively from billybob meeks bobby nodded but whats wrong with that bobby look around old people are frightened of arthur c clarke and stephen baxter death that makes them vulnerable to this kind of scam what scam isnt it true that grains actually works after a fashion the brains internal clock actually runs more slowly for older people and thats the mech anism billybob is screwing around with and the problem is the side effects what grains does is to stimulate the production of dopamine the brains main chemical mes senger trying to make an old mans brain run as fast as a childs which is a bad thing he said uncertainly right she frowned baffled by the question not for the first time she had the feeling that there was something miss ing about bobby of course its a bad thing it is ma levolent braintinkering bobby dopamine is involved in a lot of fundamental brain functions if dopamine levels are too low you can suffer tremors an inability to start voluntary movementparkinsonsdisease for instance all the way to catatonia too much dopamine and you can suffer from agitation obsessivecompulsive disor ders uncontrolled speech and movement addictiveness euphoria billybobs congregationi should say his vic timsarent going to achieve eternity in their last hour billybob is cynically burning out their brains some of the doctors are putting two and two to gether but nobody has been able to prove anything what i really need is evidence from his own labs that billybob knows exactly what he is doing along with proof of his other scams such as such as embezzling millions of bucks from insurance companies by selling them phony lists of church mem bers such as pocketing a large donation from the anti defamation league hes still hustling even though hes come a long way from banknotebaptisms she glanced at bobby never heard of that you palm a bill during a baptism that way the blessing of god gets diverted to the money rather than the kiddie then you send the the light of other days note out into circulation and its supposed to return to you with interest and to make especially sure it works of course you hand the money over to your preacher word is billybob picked up that endearing habit in colombia where he was working as a drug run ner bobby looked shocked you dont have any proof of that not yet she said grimly but ill get it how thats what want to talk to you about he looked mildly stunned she said sorry im lecturing you arent i a little i do that when im angry kate you are angry a lot i feel entitled ive been on this guys trail for months a drone robot floated over their heads bearing sets of virtual glassesandgloves these glassesandgloves have been devised by revelationland inc in conjunc tion with ourworld corporation for the full experience of revelationland your credit card or personal account will be billed automatically per online minute these glassesandgloves kate reached up and snagged two sets show time bobby shook his head i have implants i dont need biliybob has his own special way of disabling rival technologies she lifted the glasses to her head arc you ready i guess she felt a moist sensation around her eye sockets as the glasses extruded membranes to make a lighttight junction with her flesh it felt like cold wet mouths suck ing at her face she was instantly suspended in darkness and silence now bobby materialized beside her floating in space arthur c clarke and stephen baxter holding her hand his giassesandgloves were of course invisible and soon her vision cleared further people were hov ering all around them off as far as she could see like a cloud of dust motes they were all dressed in white robes and holding big gaudy palm leaveseven bobby to and herself she found and they were shining in the s light that streamed from the object that hung before them it was a cube huge perfect shining sunbright utterly dwarfing the flock of hovering people wow bobby said again revelation chapter twentyone she murmured f welcome to the new jerusalem she tried to throw away her palm leaf but another simply appeared in her hand just remember she said the only real thing here is the steady flow of money out of your pockets and into billybobs together they fell toward the light f the wall before her was punctured by windows and a line of three arched doorways she could see a light within shining even more brightly than the exterior of the building scaled against the buildings dimensions the walls looked as thin as paper and still they fell toward the cube until it loomed before them gigantic like some immense ocean liner bobby said how big is this thing she murmured saint john tells us it is a cube twelve thousand stadia to each side and twelve thousand stadia is about two thousand kilometers bobby this city of god is the size of a small moon its going to take a long time to fall in and well be charged for every second of course in that case i wish id had a hot dog you know my father mentions you a tot the light of other days hes angry at me hiram is umm mercurial i think on some level he found you stimulating i suppose i should be nattered he liked the phrase you used electronic anaesthesia i have to admit i didnt fully understand she frowned at him as together they drifted toward the pale gray light you really have led a sheltered life havent you bobby most of what you call braintinkering is beneficial surely like alzheimer studs he eyed her maybe im not as out of it as you think i am a couple of years ago i opened a hospital wing endowed by ourworld they were helping obsessivecompulsive sufferers by cutting out a destructive feedback loop between two areas of the brain the caudate nucleus and the amygdala she smiled remarkable how weve all become experts in brain anatomy im not saying its all harmful but there is a compulsion to tinker addictions are nullified by changes to the brains reward circuitry people prone to rage are pacified by having parts of their amygdala essential to emotionburned out workaholics gam blers even people habitually in debt are diagnosed and cured even aggression has been linked to a disorder of the cortex whats so terrible about all of that these quacks these reprogramming doctors dont understand the machine they are tinkering with its like trying to figure out the functions of a piece of software by burning out the chips of the computer its running on there are always side effects why do you think it was so easy for billybob to find a football stadium to take over because organized spectator sport has been declining since the players no longer fought hard enough he smiled that doesnt seem too serious then consider this the quality and quantity of orig arthur c clarke and stephen baxter inal scientific research has been plummeting for two de cades by curing fringe autistics the doctors have removed the capacity of our brightest people to apply themselves to tough disciplines and the area of the brain linked to depression the subgenual cortex is also associated with creativitythe perception of meaning most critics agree that me arts have gone into a reverse why do you think your fathers virtual rock bands are so popular seventy years after the originals were at their peak but whats the alternative if not for reprogranumng the world would be a violent and savage place she squeezed his hand it may not be evident to you in your gilded cage but the world out there still is vio lent and savage what we need is a machine that will let us see the other guys point of view if we cant achieve that than all the reprogramming in the world is futile he said wryly you really are an angry person arent your angry at charlatans like billybob at latterday phrenologists and lobotomizers and nazi doctors who are screwing with our heads maybe even threatening the future of the species while the world comes to pieces around us of course im angry arent you he returned her gaze puzzled i guess i have to mink about it hey were accelerating the holy city loomed before her the wall was like a great upended plain with the doors shining rectangular craters before her the swarms of people were plunging in separating streams toward the great arched doors as if being drawn into maelstroms bobby and kate swooped toward the central door kate felt an exhilarating headlong rush as the door arch opened wide before herbut there was no genuine sense of motion here if she thought about it she could still feel her body sitting quietly in its stiff backed stadium seat the light of other days but still it was some ride in a heartbeat they had flown through the doorway a glowing tunnel of graywhite light and they were skim ming over a surface of shining gold kate glanced around seeking walls that must be hun dreds of kilometers away but there was unexpected art istry here the air was mistythere were even clouds above her scattered thinly reflecting the shining golden floorand she couldnt see beyond a few kilometers of the golden plain and then she looked up and saw the shining walls of the city rising out of the layer of atmosphere that clung to the floor the plains and straight line edges merged into a distant square unexpectedly clear far above the air it was a ceiling over the atmosphere wow she said its the box the moon came in bobbys hand around hers was warm and soft admit it youre impressed billybob is still a crook but an artful crook now gravity was taking hold the people around them were descending like so many human snowflakes and kate fell with them she could see a river bright blue that cut across the golden plain beneath its banks were lined with dense green forest there were people every where she realized scattered over the riverbank and the clear areas beyond and near the buildings and thousands more were falling out of the sky all around her surely there were more here than could have been present in the sports stadium no doubt many of them were virtual projections details seemed to crystallize as she fell trees and peo ple and even dapples of light on the water of the river at last the tallest trees were stretching up around her with a blur of motion she settled easily to the ground when she looked into the sky she saw a blizzard of arthur c clarke and stephen baxter people in their snowwhite robes falling easily without apparent fear there was gold everywhere underfoot on the walls of the nearest buildings she studied the faces nearest her they seemed excited happy anticipating but the gold filled the air with a yellow light that made the peo ple look as if they were suffering from some mineral deficiency and no doubt those happyclappy expres sions were virtual fakes painted on bemused faces bobby walked over to a tree she noticed that his bare feet disappeared a centimeter or two into the grass sur face bobby said the trees have got more than one kind of fruit look apples oranges limes on each side of the river stood the tree of life bear ing twelve crops of fruit yielding its fruit every month and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations im impressed by the attention to detail dont be she bent down to touch the ground she could feel no grass blades no dew no earth only a slick plastic smoothness billybob is a showman she said but hes a cheap showman she straightened up this isnt even a true religion billybob has marketeers and business analysts working for him not nuns he is preaching a gospel of prosperity hat its okay to be greedy and grasping talk to your brother about it this is a commodity fetishism directly descended from bil lybobs banknotebaptism scam you sound as if you care about religion believe me i dont she said vehemently the hu man race could get along fine without it but my beef is with billybob and his kind i brought you here to show you how powerful he is bobby we need to stop him so how am i supposed to help she stepped a little closer to him i know what your father is trying to build an extension of his datapipe technology a remote viewer he said nothing the light of other days i dont expect you to confirm or deny that and im not going to tell you how i know about it what i want you to think about is what we could achieve with such a technology he frowned instant access to news stories wherever they break she waved that away much more than that think about it if you could open up a wormhole to anywhere then there would be no more barriers no walls you could see anybody at any time and crooks like billy bob would have nowhere to hide his frown deepened youre talking about spying she laughed oh come on bobbyeach of us is under surveillance the whole time anyhow youve been a celebrity since the age of twentyone you must know how it feels to be watched its not the same she took his arm if billybob has nothing to hide hes nothing to fear she said look at it that way sometimes you sound like my father he said neu trally she fell silent disquieted they walked forward with the throng now they were nearing a great throne with seven dancing globes and twentyfour smaller attendant thrones a scaledup ver sion of the realworld display billybob had mounted out in the stadium and before the great central throne stood billybob meeks but this wasnt the fat sweating man she had seen out on the sports field this billybob was taller younger thinner far better looking like a young charlton heston although he must have been at least a kilometer from where she stood he towered over the congregation and he seemed to be growing he leaned down hands on hips his voice like shaped thunder the city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it for the glory of god gives it light and the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter lamb is its lamp still billybob grew his arms like tree trunks his face a looming disc that was already above the lower clouds kate could see people fleeing from beneath his giant feet like ants and billybob pointed a mighty finger directly at her immense gray eyes glaring the angry furrows on his brow like martian channels nothing impure will ever come in to it nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful but only those whose names are written in the lambs book of life is your name in that book is it are you worthy kate screamed suddenly overwhelmed and she was picked up by an invisible hand and dragged into the shining air there was a sucking sensation at her eyes and ears light noise the mundane stink of hot dogs flooded over her bobby was kneeling before her she could see the marks the glasses had made around his eyes he got to you didnt he billybob does have a way of punching his message home she gasped still disoriented on row after row of the old sports stadiums battered seats people were rocking and moaning tears leaking from the black eye seals of the glasses in one area paramedics were working on unconscious people perhaps victims of faints epilepsy even heart attacks kate speculated she had had to sign various release forms when applying for their tickets and she didnt imagine the safety of his parishioners was a high priority for billybob meeks curiously she studied bobby who seemed unpertur bed but what about you he shrugged ive played more interesting adventure games he looked up at the muddy december sky katei know youre just using me as a way to get to the light of other days my father but i like you even so and maybe tweaking hirams nose would be good for my soul what do you think she held her breath she said i think mats about the most human thing ive ever heard you say then lets do it she forced a smile shed got what she wanted but the world around her still seemed unreal com pared to the vividness of those final moments inside bil lybobs mind she had no doubt thatif the rumors about the ca pability hiram was constructing were remotely accurate and if she could get access to itshe would be able to destroy billybob meeks it would be a great scoop a personal triumph but she knew mat some part of her no matter how far down she buried it would always regret doing so some part of her would always long to be allowed to return to that glowing city of gold with walls that stretched halfway to the moon where shining smiling people were waiting to welcome her billybob had broken through his shock tactics had gotten even to her and that of course was the whole point why billybob must be stopped yes she said lets do it the billiondollar pearl david with hiram and bobby sat before a giant softscreen spread across the wormworks counting house wall the screen imagereturned by a fiber optic camera that had been snaked into the heart of the wormworks superconductingmagnet nestwas noth ing but darkness marred by an occasional stray pixel a prickle of color and light a digital counter in a comer display worked its way down toward zero hiram paced impatiently around the cramped clut tered countinghouse davids assistant technicians cow ered from him avoiding his eyes hiram snapped how do you know the bloody wormhole is even open david suppressed a smile you dont need to whis per he pointed to the comer display beside the count down clock was a small numerical caption a sequence of prime numbers scrolling upward from two to thirty one over and over thats the test signal sent through the wormhole by the brisbane crew at the normal gammaray wavelengths so we know we managed to find and stabilize a wormhole mouthwithout a remote anchorand the australians have been able to locate it during his three months work here david had quickly discovered a way to use modulations of exoticmatter pulses to battle the wormholes inherent instability turning that into practical and repeatable engineering of course had been immensely difficultbut in the end the light of other days successful our placement of the remote mouth isnt so precise yet im afraid our australian colleagues have to chase our wormhole mouths through the dust out there chasing fizzers over the gibbers as they put it but still now we can open up a wormhole to anywhere what we dont know yet is whether were going to be able to expand the holes up to visiblelight dimensions bobby was leaning easily against a table legs crossed looking fit and relaxed as if hed just come off a tennis courtas perhaps he had mused david i think we ought to give david a lot of credit dad after all he has solved half the problem already yes hiram said but i dont see anything but gamma rays squirted in by some brokennosed aussie unless we can find a way to expand these bloody things were wasting my money and i cant stomach all this waiting why just one test run a day because said david evenly we have to analyze me results from each test strip down the casimir gear reset the control equipment and detectors we have to understand each failure before we can go ahead toward success that is he added silently before i can extricate myself from mis complex family entanglement and re turn to the comparative calm of oxford funding battles ferocious academic rivalry and all bobby asked what exactly is it were looking for what will a wormhole mouth look like i can answer that one hiram said still pacing i grew up with enough bad popscience shows a worm hole is a shortcut through a fourth dimension you have to cut a chunk out of our threedimensional space and join it onto another such chunk over in brisbane bobby raised an eyebrow at david david said carefully its a tittle more complicated but hes more right than wrong a wormhole mouth is a sphere floating freely in space a threedimensional excision if we succeed with the expansion for the first time well be able to see our wormhole mournwith a arthur c clarke and stephen baxter hand lens anyhow the countdown clock was down to a single digit david said heads up everybody here we go the ripples of conversation in the room died away and everyone turned to the digital clock the count reached zero and nothing happened there were events of course the track counter racked up a respectable score showing heavy and en ergetic particles passing through the detector array the debris of an exploded wormhole the arrays pixel ele ments each firing individually as a particle passed through them could later be used to trace the paths of debris fragments in three dimensionspaths which could then be reconstructed and analyzed lots of data lots of good science but the big wall softscreen remained blank no signal david suppressed a sigh he opened up the logbook and entered details of the run in his round neat hand around him his technicians began equipment diagnostics hiram looked into davids face at the empty screen at the technicians is that it did it work bobby touched his fathers shoulder even i can tell it didnt dad he pointed to the primenumber test se quence it had frozen on thirteen unlucky thirteen murmured bobby is he right david did you screw up again this wasnt a failure just another test you dont understand science father now when we run the anal ysis and learn from this jesus christ on a bike i should have left you rotting in bloody oxford call me when you have something hiram shaking his head stalked from the room when he left the feeling of relief in the room was palpable the technicianssilverhaired particle physi cists all many of them older than hiram some of them with distinguished careers beyond ourworldstarted to file out the light of other days when theyd gone david sat before a softscreen to begin his own followup work he brought up his favored desktop metaphor it was like a window into a cluttered study with books and documents piled in untidy heaps on the floor and shelves and tables and with complex particledecay models hanging like mobiles from the ceiling when he looked around the room the point at the focus of his attention expanded opening out more detail the rest of the room blurring to a background wash he could pick up doc uments and models with a fingertip rummaging until he found what he wanted exactly where hed left it last time first he had to check for detector pixel faults he be gan passing the vertex detector traces into the analog signal bus and pulled out a blowup overview of various detector slabs there were always random failures of pixels when some especially powerful particle hit a de tector element but though some of the detectors had suffered enough radiation damage to require replace ment there was nothing serious for now humming immersed in the work he prepared to move on your user interface is a mess david startled turned bobby was still here still lean ing in fact against his table sorry david said i didnt mean to turn my back how odd that he hadnt even noticed his brothers con tinued presence bobby said now most people use the search en gine which is irritatingly slow prone to misunderstanding and which anyhow masks a victorianera hierarchical datastorage system filing cabinets bobby im too dumb for the search engine im just an unevolved ape who likes to use his hands and eyes to find things this may look a mess but i know exactly where everything is arthur c clarke and stephen baxter but still you could study this particletrack stuff a lot better as a virtual let me set up a trial of my latest mindseye prototype for you we can reach more areas of the brain switch more quickly and all without the need for trepanning bobby smiled all right david said id appreciate that bobbys gaze roamed around the room in that absent disconcerting way of his is it true what you told dadthat this isnt a failure but just another step i can understand hirams impatience after all hes paying for all of this and hes working under commercial pressure bobby said already some of his competitors are claim ing to have datapipes of comparable quality to hirams it surely wont be long before one of them comes up with the idea of a remote viewerindependently if no bodys leaked it already but commercial pressure is irrelevant david said testily a study like this has to proceed at its own pace bobby i dont know how much you know about phys ics assume nothing once you have a wormhole whats so difficult about expanding it its not as if were building a bigger and better car were trying to push spacetime into a form it wouldnt naturally adopt lookwormholes are intrinsically un stable you know that to keep them open at all we have to thread them with exotic matter antigravity yes but the tension in the throat of a wormhole is gigantic were constantly balancing one huge pressure against another david balled his fists and pressed them against each other hard as long as they are balanced fine but the smallest perturbation and you lose every thing he let one fist slide over the other breaking the equilibrium hed established and that fundamental in stability grows worse with size what were attempting the light of other days is to monitor conditions inside the wormhole and adjust the pumping of exotic matterenergy to compensate for fluctuations he pressed his fists against each other again this time as he jiggled the left back and forth he compensated with movements of his right so his knuck les stayed pressed together i get it bobby said as if youre threading the worm hole with software or with a smart worm david smiled yes its very processorintensive and so far the instabilities have been too rapid and catastrophic to deal with look at this he reached to his desktop and with the touch of a fingertip he pulled up a fresh view of a particle cascade it had a strong purple trunkthe color showing heavy ionizationwith clusters of red jets wide and narrow some straight others curved he tapped a key and the spray rotated in three dimensions the software suppressed foreground elements to allow details of the jets inner structure to become visible the central spray was surrounded by numbers showing en ergy momentum and charge readings were looking at a highenergy complex event here bobby all this exotic garbage spews out before the wormhole disap pears completely he sighed its like trying to figure out how to fix a car by blowing it up and combing through the debris bobby i was honest with father every trial is an exploration of another comer of what we call parameter space as we try different ways of making our wormhole viewers wide and stable there are no wasted trials every time we proceed we learn something in fact many of my tests are negativei actually design them to fail a single test which proves some piece of theory wrong is more valuable than a hundred tests showing that idea might be true eventually well get there or else well prove hirams dream is impossible with presentday technology science demands patience arthur c clarke and stephen baxter david smiled yes it always has but for some it is hard to remain patient in the face of the black meteor which approaches us all the wormwood but thats centuries off but scientists are hardly alone in being affected by the knowledge of its existence there is an impulse to hurry to gather as much data and formulate new theo ries to leam as much as possible in the time that is left because we no longer are sure there will be anybody to build on our work as weve always assumed in the past and so people take shortcuts the peer review process is under pressure now a red alert light started flashing high on the countinghouse wall and technicians began to drift back into the room bobby looked at david quizzically youre setting up to run again you told dad you only ran one trial a day david winked a little white lie i find it useful to have a way to get rid of him bobby laughed it turned out there was time to fetch coffee before the new run began they walked together to the cafeteria bobby is lingering david thought as if he wants to be involved he sensed a need here a need he didnt understandperhaps even envy was that possible it was a wickedly delicious thought perhaps bobby patterson fabulously rich this latterday dandy envies mehis earnest dronelike brother or perhaps thats just sibling rivalry on my part walking back he sought to make conversation so were you a grad student bobby sure but at hbs hbs oh harvard business school yes i took some business studies as part of my first de gree david said he grimaced the courses were in tended to equip us for the modem world all those the light of other days twobytwo matrices the fads for this theory or that for one management guru or another well business analysis isnt rocket science as we used to say bobby murmured evenly but nobody at harvard was a dummy i won my place there on merit and the competition there was ferocious im sure it was david was puzzled by bobbys flat tone of voice his lack of fire he probed gently i have the impression you feelunderestimated bobby shrugged perhaps the vr division of ourworld is a billionbuck business in its own right if i fail dads made it clear hes not going to bail me out but even kate thinks im some kind of placeholder bobby grinned im enjoying trying to convince her otherwise david frowned kate ah the girl reporter hiram had tried to exclude from his sons life without success it seemed interesting do you want me to keep quiet what about kate the reporter there isnt really anything o keep quiet about perhaps but father doesnt approve of her have you told him youre still seeing her no and this may be the only thing in your young life david thought which hiram doesnt know about well lets keep it that way david felt pleased to have estab lished this small bond between them now the countdown clock neared its conclusion once more the wallmounted softscreen showed an inky dark ness broken only by random pixel flashes and with the numeric monitor in the comer dully repeating its test list of primes david watched with amusement as bobbys lips silently formed the count numbers three two one and then bobbys mouth hung open in shock a flick ering light playing on his face david swiveled his gaze to the softscreen this time there was an image a disc of light it was arthur c clarke and stephen baxter a bizarre dreamy construct of boxes and strip lights and cables distorted almost beyond recognition as if seen through some grotesque fisheye lens david found he was holding his breath as roe image stayed stable for two seconds three he deliberately sucked in air bobby asked what are we seeing the wonnhole mouth or rather the light its pulling in from its surroundings here me wormworks look you can see the electronics stack but the strong gravity of the mouth is dragging in light from me three dimensional space all around it the image is being dis torted like gravitational tensing he looked at bobby in surprise exactly that he checked the monitors were already passing our pre vious best now the distortion of the image became stronger as the shapes of equipment and light fixtures were smeared to circles surrounding me views central point some of the colors seemed to be dopplershiiting now a green support strut starting to look blue the fluorescents glare taking on a tinge of violet were pushing deeper into the wormhole david whispered dont give up on me now the image fragmented further its elements crumbling and multiplying in a repeating pattern around the disc shaped image it was a threedimensional kaleidoscope david thought formed by multiple images of the labs illumination he glanced at counter readouts which told him that much of the energy of the light falling into the wormhole had been shifted to the ultraviolet and beyond and the energized radiation was pounding the curved walls of this spacetime tunnel but the wormhole was holding they were far past the point where all previous ex periments had collapsed now the disc image began to shrink as the light fall the light of other days ing from three dimensions onto the wormhole mouth was compressed by the wormholes throat into a narrow ing pipe the scrambled shrinking puddle of light reached a peak of distortion and then the quality of light changed the multiple image structure became simpler expanding seeming to unscramble itself and david began to pick out elements of a new visual field a smear of blue that might be sky a pale white that could be an instrument box he said call hiram bobby said what are we looking at just call father bobby hiram arrived at a run an hour later it better be worth it i broke up an investors meeting david wordlessly handed him a slab of leadglass crystal the size and shape of a pack of cards hiram turned the slab over inspecting it the upper surface of the slab was ground into a mag nifying lens and when hiramjooked into it he saw miniaturized electronics photomultiplier light detectors for receiving signals a lightemitting diode capable of emitting flashes for testing a small power supply min iature electromagnets and at the geometric center of the slab there was a tiny perfect sphere just at the limit of visibility it looked silvery reflective like a pearl but the quality of light it returned wasnt quite the hard gray of the countinghouses fluorescents hiram turned to david what am i looking at david nodded at the big wall softscreen it showed a round blur of light blue and brown a face came looming into the image a human face a man somewhere in his forties perhaps the image was heavily distortedit was exactly as if he had pushed his face into a fisheye lensbut david could make out a knot of curly black hair leathery sunbeaten skin white teeth in a broad smile arthur c clarke and stephen baxter its walter hiram said wondering our brisbane station head he moved closer to ehe softscreen hes saying something his lips are moving he stood there mouth moving in sympathy see you i see you my god behind walter other aussie technicians could be seen now heavily distorted shadows applauding in silence david grinned and submitted to hirams whoops and bear hugs all the while keeping his eye on the lead glass slab containing the wormhole mouth that billion dollar pearl the wormcam it was am at the heart of the deserted wormworks in a bubble of softscreen light kate and bobby sat side by side bobby was working through a simple questionandanswer setup session on the softscreen they were expecting a long night behind them there was a heap of hastily gathered gear coffee flasks and blankets and foam mattresses there was a creak kate jumped and grabbed bobbys arm bobby kept working at the program take it easy just a little thermal contraction i told you i made sure all the surveillance systems have a blind spot right here right now im not doubting it its just that im not used to creeping around in the dark like this i thought you were the tough reporter yes but what i do is generally legal generallyt believe it or not but this he waved a hand toward the hulking mysterious machinery out in the dark isnt even sur veillance equipment its just an experimental high energy physics rig theres nothing like it in the world how can there be any legislation to cover its use thats specious bobby no judge on the planet would buy that argument specious or not im telling you to calm down im arthur c clarke and stephen baxter trying to concentrate mission control here could be a little more userfriendly david doesnt even use voice activation maybe all physicists are so conservativeor all catholics she studied him as he worked steadily at the program he looked as alive as shed ever seen him for once fully engaged in the moment and yet he seemed completely unperturbed by any moral doubt he really was a com plex personor rather she thought sadly incomplete his finger hovered over a start button on the soft screen ready shall i do it were recording he tapped the softscreen everything that comes through that wormhole will be trapped right here okay three two one he hit the key the screen turned black from the greater darkness around her she heard a deep bass hum as the giant machinery of the worm works came on line huge forces gathering to rip a hole in spacetime she thought she could smell ozone feel a prickle of electricity but maybe that was imagination setting up this operation had been simplicity itself while bobby had worked to obtain clandestine access to the wonnworks equipment kate had made her way to billybobs mansion a gaudy baroque palace set in woodland on the fringe of the mount rainier national park shed taken sufficient photographs to construct a crude external map of the site and had made global positioning system readings at various reference points thatand the information billybob had boastfully given away to style magazines about the lavish interior layouthad been sufficient for her to construct a de tailed internal map of the building complete with a grid of gps references now if all went well those references would be suf ficient to establish a wormhole link between billybobs inner sanctum and this mockedup listening post the light of other days the softscreen lit up kate leaned forward the image was heavily distorted a circular smear of light orange and brown and yellow as if she were look ing through a silvered tunnel there was a sense of movement patches of light coming and going across the image but she could make out no detail i cant see a damn thing she said querulously bobby tapped at the softscreen patience now i have to cut in the deconvolution routines the what the wormhole mouth isnt a camera lens remember its a little sphere on which light falls from all around in three dimensions and that global image is pretty much smeared out by its passage through the wormhole itself but we can use software routines to unscramble all that its kind of interesting the software is based on programs the astronomers use to factor out atmo spheric distortion twinkling and blurring and refraction when they study the stars the image abruptly cleared and kate gasped they saw a massive desk with a globelamp hovering above there were papers and softscreens scattered over the desktop behind the desk was an empty chair ca sually pushed back on the walls there were performance graphs and bar charts what looked like accounting state ments there was luxury here the wallpaper looked like handmade english stuff probably the most expensive in tfie world and on the floor casually thrown there there was a pair of rhino hides gaping mouths and glassy eyes staring horns proud even in death and there was a simple animated display a total counting steadily upward it was labeled converts hu man souls being counted like a fastfood chains sushi burger sales the image was far from perfect it was dark grainy sometimes unstable given to freezing or breaking up into clouds of pixels but still arthur c clarke and stephen baxter i cant believe it kate breathed its working its as if all the walls in the world just turned to glass wel come to the goldfish bowl bobby worked his softscreen making the recon structed image pan around i thought rhinos were ex tinct they are now billybob was involved in a consor tium which bought out the last breeding pair from a pri vate zoo in france the geneticists had been trying to get hold of the rhinos to store genetic material maybe eggs and sperm and even zygotes in the hope of restor ing the species in the future but billybob got there first and so he owns the last rhino skins there will ever be it was good business if you look at it that way these skins command unbelievably high prices now but illegal yes but nobody is likely to have the guts to pursue a prosecution against someone as powerful as billybob after all come wormwood day all the rhinos will be extinct anyhow what difference does it make can you zoom with this thing metaphorically can magnify and enhance selec tively can we see those papers on the desk with a fingernail bobby marked out zoom boxes and the softwares focus progressively moved in on the litter of papers on the desktop the wormhole mouth seemed to be positioned about a meter from the ground some two meters from the deskkate wondered if it would be visible a tiny reflective bead hovering in the airso the papers were foreshortened by perspective and be sides they hadnt been laid out for convenient reading some of them were lying facedown or were obscured by others still bobby was able to pick out sectionshe inverted the images and corrected for perspective distor tion cleaned them up with intelligentsoftware enhance ment routinesenough for kate to get a sense of what much of the material was about the light of other days it was mostly routine corporate stuffchilling evi dence of billybobs industrialscale mining of gullible americansbut nothing illegal she had bobby scan on rooting hastily through the scattered material and then at last she hit pay dirt hold it she said enhance well well it was a report technical closely printed replete with figures on the adverse effects of dopamine stimulation in elderly subjects thats it she breathed the smoking gun she got up and started to pace the room unable to con tain her restless energy what an asshole once a drug dealer always a drug dealer if we can get an image of billybob himself reading that better yet signing it off bobby we need to find him bobby sighed and sat back then ask david i can swivel and zoom but right now i dont know how to make this wormcam pan wormcam kate grinned dad works his marketeers even harder than his en gineers look kate its threethirty in the morning lets be patient i have security jockout here until noon tomorrow surely we can catch billybob in his office before then if not we can try again another day yes she nodded tense youre right its just im used to working fast he smiled before some other hot joumo muscles in on your scoop it happens hey bobby reached out and cupped her chin in his hands his dark face was all but invisible in the cavern ous gloom of the wormworks but his touch was warm dry confident you dont have to worry just mink of it right now nobody else on the planet nobody has access to wormcam technology theres no way bil lybob can detect what were up to or anyone else can beat you to the punch whats a few hours her breathing was shallow her heart pumping she seemed to sense him before her in the dark at a level arthur c clarke and stephen baxter deeper than sight or scent or even touch as if some deep core inside her was responding to the warm bulk of his body she reached up covered his hand and kissed it youre right we have to wait but im burning energy anyhow so lets do something constructive with it he seemed to hesitate as if trying to puzzle out her meaning well kate she told herself you arent like the other girls hes met in his gilded life maybe he needs a little help she put her free hand around his neck pulled him toward her and felt his mouth on hers her tongue hot and inquisitive pushed into his mouth and ran along a ridge of perfect lower teeth his lips responded eagerly at first he was tender even loving but as passion built she became aware of a change in his posture his manner as she responded to his unspoken commands she was aware that she was letting him take control andeven as he brought her to a deep climax with expert ease she felt he was distracted lost in the mysteries of his own strange wounded mind engaged with the physical act and not with her he knows how to make love she thought maybe bet ter than anybody i know but he doesnt know how to love what a cliche that was but it was true and ter ribly sad and even as his body closed on hers her fingers digging into the hair at the back of his neck found some thing round and hard under his covering of hair about the size of a nickel metallic and cold it was a brain stud in the springmorning silence of the wormworks david sat in the glow of his softscreen the light of other days he was looking down at the top of his own head from a height of two or three meters it wasnt a comfortable sight he looked overweight and there was a small bald spot at his crown he hadnt noticed before a little pink coin in among his uncombed mass of hair he raised his hand to find the bald spot the image in the screen raised its hand too like a puppet slaved to his actions he waved childishly and looked up but of course there was nothing to see no sign of the tiny rip on spacetime which transmitted these images he tapped at the screen and the viewpoint swiveled looking straight ahead another tap hesitantly and it began to move forward through the wormworks dark halls at first a little jerkily then more smoothly huge machines looming and rather sinister floated past him like blocky clouds eventually he supposed commercial versions of this wormhole camera would come with more intuitive con trols a joystick perhaps levers and knobs to swivel the viewpoint this way and that but this simple configura tion of touch controls on his screen was enough to let him control the viewpoint allowing him to concentrate on the image itself and of course a corner of his mind reminded him in actuality the viewpoint wasnt moving at all rather the casimir engines were creating and collapsing a series of wormholes planck lengths apart strung out in a line the way he wanted to move the images returned by suc cessive holes arrived sufficiently closely to give him the illusion of movement but none of that was important for now he told him self sternly for now he only wanted to play with a determined slap at the screen he turned the viewpoint and made it fly straight at the wormworks corrugated iron wall he couldnt help but wince as that barrier flew at him there was an instant of darkness arthur c clarke and stephen baxter and then he was through and immersed suddenly in dazzling sunlight he slowed he viewpoint and dropped it to around eye level he was in the grounds which surrounded the wormworks grass streams cute little bridges the sun was low casting long crisp shadows and there was a trace of dew that glimmered on the grass he let his viewpoint glide forwardat first at walking pace then a little faster the grass swept beneath him and hirams replanted trees blurred past side by side the sense of speed was exhilarating he still hadnt mastered the controls and from time to time his viewpoint would plunge clumsily through a tree or a rock moments of darkness tinged deep brown or gray but he was getting the hang of it and the sense of speed and freedom and clarity was sinking it was like being ten years old again he thought senses fresh and sharp a body so full of energy he was light as a feather he came to the plants drive he raised the viewpoint through two or three meters swept down the drive and found the freeway he flew higher and skimmed far above the road gazing down at the streams of gleaming beetlelike cars below the traffic flow still gathering for the rush hour to come was dense and fastmoving he could see patterns in me flow knots of density that gathered and cleared as the invisible web of software controls optimized the stream of smartdriven cars suddenly impatient he rose up further so that the roadway became a gray ribbon snaking over the land car windscreens sparkling like a string of diamonds he could see the city laid out before him now the suburbs were a neat rectangular grid laid over the hills mistblurred to gray the tall buildings of downtown thrust upward a compact fist of concrete and glass and steel he rose higher still swooped through a thin layer of cloud to a brighter sunshine beyond and then turned the light of other days again to see the oceans glimmerstained far from land by the ominous dark of yet another incoming storm system the horizons curve became apparent as land and sea folded over on themselves and earth became a planet david suppressed the urge to whoop he always had wanted to fly like superman this he thought is going to sell like hot cakes a crescent moon hung low and gaunt in the blue sky david swiveled the viewpoint until his field of view was centered on that sliver of bony light behind him he could hear a commotion raised voices running feet perhaps it was a security breach some where in the wormworks it was none of his concern with determination he drove the viewpoint forward the morning blue deepened to violet already he could see the first stars they slept for a while when kate stirred she felt cold she raised her wrist and her tattoo lit up six in the morning in his sleep bobby had moved away from her leaving her uncov ered she pulled at the blanket they were sharing cov ering her exposed torso the wormworks windowless was as dark and cav ernous as when they had arrived she could see that the wormcam image of billybobs study was still as it had been the desk and rhino skins and the papers every thing since they had set up the wormcam link had been recorded with a flicker of excitement she realized she might already have enough material to nail meeks for good youre awake she turned her head there was bobbys face eyes wide open resting on a foldedup blanket he stroked her cheek with the back of one finger i think youve been crying he said arthur c clarke and stephen baxter that startled her she resisted the temptation to brush his hand away to hide her face he sighed you found the implant so now youve screwed a wirehead isnt that your prejudice you dont like implants maybe you think only criminals and the mentally deficient should undergo brainfunction modi fication who put it there my father i mean it was his initiative when i was a small boy you remember i was three or four years old yes i remember and i remember understanding why he was doing it not the technical detail of course but the fact that he loved me and wanted the best for me he smiled self deprecating im not quite as perfect as i look i was somewhat hyperactive and also slightly dyslexic the implant fixed those things she reachedbehind him and explored the profile of his implant trying not to make it obvious she made sure her own wrist tattoo passed over the metai surface she forced a smile you ought to upgrade your hard ware he shrugged it works well enough if youll let me bring in some microelectronic anal ysis gear i could run a study of it what would be the point she took a breath so we can find out what it does i told you what it does you told me what hiram told you he propped himself up on his elbows and stared at her what are you implying yes what kate are you just sour because he shows no signs of falling in love with youas obviously you are falling for this complex flawed man you seem to havegaps for instance dont you ever wonder about your mother no he said am i supposed to the light of other days its not a question of being supposed to bobby its just what most people dowithout being prompted and you think this has something to do with my implantlook i trust my father i know that every thing hes done has been for my best interest all right she leaned over to kiss him its not my business we wont talk about it again at least she thought with a guilty frisson not until i get an analysis of the data i already collected from your head studwithout your knowledge or your permis sion she snuggled closer to him and draped an arm over his chest protectively maybe its me who has the gaps in her soul she thought with shocking suddenness torchlight burst over them kate hastily grabbed the blanket to her chest feeling absurdly exposed and vulnerable the torchlight in her eyes was dazzling masking the group of people beyond there were two three people they wore dark uniforms and there was hirams unmistakable bulk his hands on his hips glaring at her you cant hide from me hiram said easily he ges tured at the wormcam image shut that bloody thing off the image turned to mush as the wormhole link to billybobs office was shut down ms manzoni just by breaking in here youve broken a whole hatful of laws not to mention attempting to violate the privacy of billybob meeks the police are already on their way i doubt if ill be able to get you imprisonedthough ill have a bloody good trybut i can ensure youll never work in your field again kate kept up her defiant glower but she felt her re solve crumble she knew hiram had the power to do just that bobby was lying back relaxed she dug an elbow in his ribs i dont understand you bobby hes spying on you doesnt that bother you hiram stood over her why should it bother him arthur c clarke and stephen baxter through the dazzle she could see sweat gleaming on his bare scalp his only sign of anger im his father what bothers me is you ms maazoni its obvious to me youre poisoning my sons mind just like he stopped himself kate glared back like who hiram his mother but bobbys hand was on her arm back off dad kate he was bound to figure this out sometime look both of you lets find a winwin solution to this isnt that what you always told me dad he said impul sively dont throw kate out give her a job here at ourworld hiram and kate spoke simultaneously are you matf bobby thats absurd if you think id work for this creep bobby held his hands up dad think about it to exploit the technology youre going to need the best in vestigative journalists you can find right even with the wormcam you cant dig out a story without leads hiram snorted youre telling me she is the best bobby raised his eyebrows shes here dad she found out about the wormcam itself she even started to use it and as for you kate bobby it will be a cold day in hell you know about the wormcam hiram cant let you go with that knowledge sodont go come work here youll have an edge on every other damn reporter on the planet he looked from one to the other hiram and kate glared at each other kate said id insist on finishing my investigation into billybob meeks i dont care what links you have with him ffiram the man is a sham potentially mur derous and a drug runner and hiram laughed youre laying down conditions bobby said dad please just think about it for me hiram loomed over kate his face savage perhaps i have to accept this but you will not take my son away the light of other days from me i hope you understand that he straightened up and kate found herself shivering by the way hiram said to bobby you were right about what that i love you that you should trust me that everything i have done to you has been for the best kate gasped you heard him say that but of course he had hiram had probably heard everything hirams eyes were on bobby you do believe me dont you dont you scoops from ourworld international news hour june kate manzoni the real possibility revealed exclusively here of armed conflict between scotland and england and therefore of course involving the united states as a wholeis the most significant development in what is becoming the central story of our unfolding century the battle for water the figures are stark less than one percent of the worlds water supply is suitable and accessible for human use as cities expand and less land is left available for farming the demand for water is increasing sharply in parts of asia the mideast and africa the available surface water is already hilly used and groundwater levels have been falling for decades back at the turn of the century ten percent of the worlds population did not have enough water to drink now that figure has tripledand it is ex pected to reach a startling seventy percent by we have become used to seeing bloody conflicts over waterfor example in china and over the waters of the nile the euphrates the ganges and the amazonplaces where the diminishing re source has to be shared or where one neighbor is perceived rightly or wrongly as having more water than it requires in this country there have been the light of other days calls in congress for the administration to put more pressure on the canadian and quebecois govern ments to release more water to the us particularly the desertifying midwest nevertheless the idea that such conflicts could come to the developed western worldjust to re peat our exclusive revelation that an armed incur sion into scotland to secure water supplies has been seriously considered by the english state govern mentcomes as a shock angel mckie it is night and nothing is stir ring this small island set like a jewel in the philip pine sea is only a half kilometer across and yet until yesterday more than a thousand people lived here crammed into ramshackle dwellings which covered these lowlands as far as the hightide line of the sea even yesterday children played along the beach you can see hera now nothing is left not even the bodies of the children remain hurricane antonythe latest to be spun off the apparently permanent el nino storm which contin ues to wreak havoc around the pacific rim touched here only briefly but it was long enough to destroy everything these people had built up over generations the sun has yet to rise on this devastation not even the rescue crews have arrived yet these pic tures are brought to you exclusively by an our world remote newsgathering unit once again on the scene of breaking news ahead of the rest we will return to these scenes when the first aid helicopters arrivethey are due from the mainland any minute nowand in the meantime we can take you to an underwater view of the coral reef here this was the last remnant of a great community of arthur c clarke and stephen baxter reefs which lined the tanon strait and the southern negros most of it long destroyed by dynamite fish ing now this last survivor preserved for a gener ation by devoted experts has been devastated willoughby cott now we can see that goal again as we ride on staedlers shoulder with ourworids exclusive asthesportsmanseesit feature you can see the line of defenders ahead of stae dier pushing forward as he approaches expecting him to make a pass which would leave cramer off side but staedler instead heads away from the wing into deeper midfield beats one defender then a secondthe goalkeeper doesnt know which threat to counter staedler or cramerand here you can see the gap staedler spotted opening up at the near post and he puts on a burst of acceleration and shoots and now thanks to ourworids exclusive infield imaging technology we are riding with the ball as it arcs into that top comer and the beijing crowd is ecstatic simon alcala coming up later we bring you more exclusive behindthescenes pictures of russian tsarina irums visit to a top johannesburg boutiqueand what was madonnas daughter having done to her nose in mis exclusive los an geles cosmeticsurgery clinic ourworid paparazzi we take you into me lives of the famouswhether they like it or not but first heres a general assembly wed like to see more of lunchtime yesterday un secretary general halliweu took a break from unescos world hydrology initiative conference in cuba the light of other days halliweu thought this rooftop garden was secure and she was right well almost right the roof is covered by a oneway mirrorit allows in the suns soothing rays but keeps out prying eyes that is everyones eyes but ours lets go on down through the roof nowyes through the roofand there she is certainly a sight for sore eyes as she enjoys the filtered caribbean sunlight au naturel despite the mirrored roof hal liweu is cautiousyou can see here she is covering up as a light plane passes overheadbut she should have known she cant hide from ourworid as you can see mr gravity has been kind to our secgen halliwell is as much a knockout as when she shimmied across the stages of the world all of forty years ago but the question isis she still all the original hatliwell or has she accepted a little help the agent when the fbi caught up with hiram kate felt a rush of relief she had been happy enough to be scooping the worldbut she had been doing that anyhow with or without wormcams and shed become increasingly un comfortable with the idea mat such a powerful technol ogy should be exclusively in the hands of a sleazy megalomaniac capitalist like hiram patterson as it happened she was in hirams office the day it all came to a head but it didnt turn out the way she expected kate paced back and forth she was arguing with hiram as usual for gods sake hiram how trivial do you want to get hiram leaned back in his fakeleather chair and gazed out of the window at downtown seattle considering his reply once kate knew this had been the presidential suite of one of the citys better hotels though the big picture window remained hiram had retained none of the grand trimmings of this room whatever his faults hiram pat terson was not pretentious the room was now a regular working office the only furniture the big conference ta ble and its set of upright chairs a coffee spigot and a the light of other days water fountain there was a rumor that hiram kept a bed here rolled up in a compartment built into the walls and yet there was a lack of a human touch kate thought there wasnt even a single image of a family memberhis two sons for instance but maybe he doesnt need images kate thought sourly maybe his sons themselves are trophy enough so hiram said slowly now youre appointing yourself my bloody conscience ms manzoni oh come on hiram its not a question of conscience look you have a technological monopoly which is the envy of every other newsgathering organization on the planet cant you see how youre wasting it gossip about russian royalty and candidcamera shows and on thefield shots of soccer games i didnt come into mis business to photograph the tits of the un secretary general those tits as you put it he said dryly attracted a billion people my prime concern is beating the com petition and im doing that t but youre turning yourself into the ultimate papa razzo is that the limit of your vision you have such powerto do good he smiled good what does good have to do with it i have to give people what they want manzoni if i dont some other bastard will anyway i dont see what youre complaining about i ran your piece on england invading scotland that was genuine hardcore news but you trivialized it by wrapping it up in tabloid gar bage just as you trivialize the whole waterwar issue look the un hydrology convention has been a joke tt dont need another lecture on the issues of the day manzoni you know youre so pompous but you un derstand so little dont you get it people dont want to know about the issues because of you and your damn wormwood people understand that the issues just dont matter it doesnt matter how we pump water around the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter planet or any of the rest of it because the wormwood is going to scrape it all away anyhow all people want is entertainment distraction and thats the limit of your ambition he shrugged what else is there to do she snorted her disgust you know your monopoly wont last forever theres a lot of speculation in the industry and the media about how youre achieving all your scoops it cant be long before somebody figures it out and repeats your research i have patents oh sure that will protect you if you keep this up youll have nothing left to hand on to bobby his eyes narrowed dont you talk about my son you know every day i regret bringing you in here man zoni youve brought in some good stories but you have no sense of balance no sense at all balance is that what you call it using the wormcam for nothing more than celebrity beaver shots a soft bell tone sounded hiram lifted his head to the air i said i wasnt to be interrupted the search engines inoffensive tones sounded from the air im afraid i have an override mr patterson what kind of override theres a michael mavens here to see you you too ms manzoni mavens i dont know any hes from the fbi mr patterson the federal bu reau of i know what the fbi is hiram thumped his desk frustrated one bloody thing after another at last kate thought hiram glared at her just watch what you say to this arsehole she frowned this governmentappointed law enforcement arsehole from the fbi you mean even you answer to the law hiram ill say what i think best the ught of other days he clenched a fist seemed ready to say more then just shook his head he stalked to his picture window and the blue light of the sky filtered through the tinted glass evoked highlights from his bald pate bloody hell he said bloody bloody hell michael mavens fbi special agent wore the standard issue charcoalgray suit collarless shirt and shoelace tie he was blond whiplash thin and he looked as if he had played a lot of squash no doubt at some ultracompetitive fbi academy he seemed remarkably young to kate no more than mid to late twenties and he was nervous dragging awkwardly at the chair hiram offered him rumbling with his briefcase as he opened it and dug out a soft screen kate glanced at hiram she saw calculation in his broad dark face hiram had spotted this agents surpris ing discomfort too after showing them his badge alavens said im glad to find you both here mr patterson ms manzoni im investigating an apparent security breach hiram went on the attack what authorization do you nave mavens hesitated mr patterson im hoping we can all be a little more constructive than that constructive hiram snapped what kind of an swer is hat are you acting without authorization he reached for a telephone icon in his desktop mavens said calmly i know your secret hirams hand hovered over the glowing symbol then withdrew mavens smiled search engine security cover fbi level three four authorization mavens m k confirm please after a few seconds me search engine reported back cover in place special agent mavens arthur c clarke and stephen baxter mavens nodded we can speak openly kate sat down opposite mavens intrigued puzzled nervous mavens spread his softscreen flat on the desktop it showed a picture of a big whitecapped military heli copter mavens said do you recognize this hiram leaned closer its a sikorsky i think actually a vhd said mavens its marine one said kate the presidents heli copter mavens eyed her thats right as im sure you both know the president and her husband have spent the last couple of days in cuba at the un hydrology conference theyve been using marine one out there yesterday during a short flight a brief and private conversation took place between president juarez and english prime minister huxtable he tapped the screen and it re vealed a blocky schematic of the helicopters interior the sikorsky is a big bird for such an antique but it is packed with communication gear it has only ten seats five are taken up by secret service agents a doctor and military and personal aides to the president hiram seemed intrigued i guess one of those aides has the football mavens looked pained we dont use a football anymore mr patterson on this occasion the other pas sengers in addition to president juarez herself were mr juarez the chief of staff prime minister huxtable and an english security agent all of these peopleand the pilotshave the high est possible security clearances which in the case of the agents and other staff are checked daily mr huxtable of course despite his oldstyle title holds an office equivalent to a state governor marine one itself is swept several times a day despite your virtual melodramas about spies and double agents mr patterson modem antisurveillance measures are pretty foolproof and be sides the president and mr huxtable were isolated in the light of other days side a security curtain even within the sikorsky we dont know of any way those various levels of security can be breached he turned his pale brown eyes on kate and yet apparently they were your news report was accurate ms manzoni juarez and huxtable did hold a conversation about the possi bility of a military solution to englands dispute with scotland over water supplies but we have testimony from mr huxtable that his speculation about invading scotland iswasprivate and personal the notion is his he hadnt committed it to paper or electronic store or discussed it with any bodynot his cabinet not even his partner his con versation with president juarez was actually the first time hed articulated the idea out loud to gauge the ex tent of the presidents support for such a proposal if formulated and at the time you broke the story neither the prime minister nor the president had discussed this with anybody else he glared at kate ms manzoni you see the situation the only possible source for your story is the juarezhuxtabte conversationitself hiram stood beside kate shes not going to reveal her sources to a goon like you mavens rubbed his face and sat back i have to tell you sir that bugging the prez is going to land you with a list of federal charges as long as your arm an inter agency team is investigating this matter and the presi dent is pretty angry herself ourworid could be shut down and you ms manzoni will be lucky to evade jail youll have to prove it first hiram blustered i can testify that no ourworid operative has been anywhere near marine one to plant a bug or to do anything else this interagency investigation team you run mavens coughed i dont run it im part of it in fact the bureau chief himself hirams mouth dropped open and does he know arthur c clarke and stephen baxter youre here no then what are you trying to do here mavens set me up orblackmail is that it mavens looked increasingly uncomfortable but he sat still kate touched hirams arm i think wed better hear him out hiram hiram shook her away he turned to the window hands caged behind his back his shoulders working with anger kate leaned toward mavens you said you knew hirams secret what did you mean and michael mavens started talking about worm holes the map he produced from his briefcase and spread over the table was handdrawn on unheaded paper ev idently kate thought mavens was straying into specu lations he hadnt wanted to share with his fbi colleagues oreven commit to the dubious security of a softscreen he said this is a map of the route marine one took yesterday over the suburbs of havana ive marked time points with these crosses you can see that when the key juarezhuxtable onboard conversation took placeit only lasted a couple of minutesthe chopper was here hiram frowned and tapped a hatched box highlighted on the map right under the sikorskys position at the start of the conversation and whats this mavens grinned its yours mr patterson that is an ourworld datapipe terminal a wormhole mouth link ing to your centra facility here in seattle i believe the datapipe terminal under marine one is the mechanism you used to get your information from the story hirams eyes narrowed kate listened but with growing abstraction as ma vens speculateda little wildlyabout directional mi crophones and the amplifying effects of the gravitational fields of wormhole mouths his theory as it emerged the ltght of other days was that hiram must be using the fixed datapipe anchors to perform his bugging it was obvious that mavens had stumbled on some aspects of the truth but didnt yet have it ail bull said hiram evenly there are holes in your theory i could fly a a through such as kate said gently ourworlds ability to get cameras to places where there is no datapipe worm hole terminal like those hurricanestruck philippine is lands or secretarygeneral halliwells cleavage hiram glared at kate wamingly shut up mavens looked confused but dogged mr patterson im no physicist i havent yet figured out all the details but im convinced that just as your wormhole technol ogy is your competitive advantage in data transmission so it must be in your newsgathering operations oh come on hiram she said he has most of it hiram growled damn it manzoni i told you i wanted plausible deniability at every stage mavens looked inquiringly at kate she said he means cover for the existence of the wormcams mavens smiled wormcams i can guess what that means i knew it kate went on but deniability wasnt always possi ble and not in this case you knew it hiram before you approved the story it was just too good a lead to pass on i think you should tell him what he wants to know hiram glared at her why the hell should i because said mavens think i can help you mavens stared wideeyed at davids first wormhole mouth already a museum piece the spacetime pearl still embedded in its glass block and you dont need an chors you can plant a wormcam eye anywhere watch anything and you can pick up sound too arthur c clarke and stephen baxter not yet hiram said but the search engine is a pretty good lipreader and we have human experts to back it up now special agent tell me how you can help me reluctantly mavens set the glass block down on the table as ms manzoni deduced the rest of my team is only a couple of steps behind me there will probably be a raid on your facilities tomorrow kate frowned then surely you shouldnt be here tipping us off no i shouldnt mavens said seriously look mr patterson ms manzoni ill be frank im arrogant enough to believe that on this issue i can see a little more clearly than my superiors which is why im step ping over the mark your wormcam technologyeven what i was able to deduce about it for myselfis fan tastically powerful and it could do an immense amount of good bringing criminals to justice counterespionage surveillance if it was in the right hands hiram said heavily if it was in the right hands and that means yours the bureaus not just us but in the public domain yes i cant agree with your reporting of the juarezhuxtable con versation but your exposure of the fraudulent science behind the galveston desalination project for example was a masterful piece of journalism by uncovering that particular scam alone you saved the public purse billions of dollars id like to see responsible newsgathering of that kind continue but i am a servant of the people and the peopleweneed the technology too mr pat terson to invade citizens privacy kate asked mavens shook his head any technology is open to abuse there would have to be controls butyou may not believe it ms manzonion the whole we civil ser vants are pretty clean and we need all the help we can get these are in the light of other days creasingly difficult timesas you must know ms man zoni the wormwood yes he frowned looking troubled people seem reluctant to take responsibility for themselves let alone for others their community a rise in crime is being matched by a rise in apathy about it presumably this h will only grow worse as the years go by as the worm wood grows closer hiram seemed intrigued but what difference does it make if the wormwood is going to cream us all any how when i was a kid in england we grew up believ ing that when the nuclear war broke out wed have just four minutes warning we used to talk about it what would you do with your four minutes id have got blind drunk and we have centuries said mavens not just minutes we have a duty to keep society functioning as best we can as long as possible what else can we do and sir meanwhileas has been true for decadesthis country has more enemies than any nation in the world national l security may have a higher priority over issues of indi s vidual rights tell us what youre proposing kate said mavens took a deep breath t want to try to set up a deal mr patterson this is your technology youre en titled to profit from it id propose that youd keep the patents and industry monopoly but youd license your technology to the government to be used in the public interest under suitably drafted legislation hiram snapped you have no authority to offer such a deal mavens shrugged of course not but this is obvi ously a sensible compromise a winwin for all con cernedincluding the people of this country i think i could sell it to my immediate superior and then kate smiled you really have risked everything for this havent you its that important arthur c clarke and stephen baxter yes maam i believe it is hiram shook his head wondering you bloody kids and your sentimental idealism mavens was watching him so what do you say mr patterson you want to help me sell this or will you wait for the raid tomorrow kate said theyll be grateful hiram in public any how maybe marine one will come collect you from the helipad on your lawn so the prez can pin a medal on your chest this is a step closer to the center of power for me and my sons hiram said yes and id maintain my commercial monopoly yes sir abruptly hiram grinned his mood immediately switched as he accepted this defeat and started to revise his plans lets do it special agent he reached across the table and shook mavens hand so the secrecy was over the power the wormcam had granted hiram would be counterbalanced kate felt an immense relief but then hiram turned to kate and glared this was your

contained representa tives from the food and drug administration the fbi cia the federal communications commis sion the internal revenue service and the national institutes of health the power of the technology has quickly become apparent however and within six months before completion of the formal pilot wormcam capabilities are being rolled out to all the major pillars of our intelligence enterprise that is the federal bureau of investigation the central intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the national security agency and the na tional reconnaissance office arthur c clarke and stephen baxter what does the wormcam mean for us the wormcama surveillance technology which cant be tapped or jammedcuts through the surveillance and encryption arms race we have been waging since conservatively the s essentially the wormcam bridges directly across space to its subject and is capable of providing images of un questionable authenticityimages for example which could be reproduced in the courtroom by comparison no photographic image however rele vant has been admissible as evidence in a us court of law since such has been the ease of doctoring such images domestically wormcams have been used for customs and immigration food and drug testing and inspection verification of applications to federal positions and a variety of other purposes as re gards criminal justice though the drafting of a legal framework regarding privacy rights to cover the wormcams use in criminal investigations remains pending fbi and police teams have already been able to score a number of spectacular successes for example uncovering the plans of lone anarchist subiru f incidentally claiming to be a second generation clone of twentiethcentury musician mi chael jackson

of a third mats around seven percent the balance of me deterrence equation was tipped toward ineffectiveness now though full fig ures from the trial period arc not yet in we can already say that apprehension rates will be un proved by orders of magnitude ladies and gentle men it may be that we arc approaching an age when for the first time in human history it can the light of other days c truly be said that crime does not pay now regarding external affairs in the gath ering and analysis of foreign intelligence cost billion but much of this intelligence was of little value our collection systems were electronic suc tion systems picking up much chaff along with the wheat and in an age in which the threats we face in general emanating from rogue states or terrorist cellsare precisiontargeted it has long been ap parent that our intelligence needs to be precision targeted also merely mapping an enemys military capability for instance tells us nothing of his stra tegic thinking and still less of his intentions but many of our opponents are as sophisticated in technology as we are and it has proven difficult or impossible to penetrate with conventional elec tronic means to the heart of their operations the solution to this has been a renewed reliance on hu minthuman intelligence the use of human spies but these of course are difficult to place notori ously unreliable and highly vulnerable but now we have the wormcam a wormcam essentially enables us to locate a remote camera anywhere without the need for physical interven tion wormcam intelligencewonnint as the in siders are already calling itis proving so valuable that wormcam posts have been set up to monitor most of the worlds political leaders friendly and otherwise the leaders of sundry religious and fa natic groups many of the worlds larger corpora tions and so on wormcam technology is intimate and personal we can watch an opponent in the most private of acts if necessary the potential for exposure of il licit activities even blackmail if we choose is ob vious but more important is the picture we are now able to build up of an enemys intentions the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter wormcam gives us information on an opponents contactsfor instance weapons suppliersand we can assess knowledge factors like his religious views culture level of education and training his sources of information the media outlets he uses ladies and gentlemen in the past the geography of the physical battlefield was our crucial intelli gence target with the wormcam the geography of our enemys mind is opened up before i move on to some specific early suc cesses of ae wormcam teams i want to touch on the future the present technology offers us a wormcam which is capable of highresolution visualspectrum imaging our scientists are working with the ourworld people to upgrade this technology to al low the capture of nonvisualspectrum datapar ticularly infrared for nightdme workingand sound by making the wormcam viewpoint sensi tive to physical byproducts of sound waves so reducing our present reliance on lipreading fur thermore we aim to make the remote viewpoints fully mobile so we cto shadow a target in motion wormcam viewpoints arc in principle detecta ble and federalourworld tiger teams are investi gating hypothetical anticams ways in which an enemy might detect and perhaps blind a wormcam this might conceivably be done for instance by injecting highenergy particles into a viewpoint causing the wormhole to implode but we dont be lieve that this will be a serious obstacle remember a wormcam placement is not a oneoff event lost on detection rather we can place as many worm cam viewpoints as we like in a given location whether they are detected or not and besides at present us agencies have a monopoly on mis technology our opponents know we have achieved a remarkable upgrade in our the light of other days intelligencegathering capabilities but they dont even know how we are doing it far from devel oping capabilities to obstruct a wormcam they dont yet know what they are looking for but of course our edge in wormcam technol ogy cannot last forever nor can the technology re main covert we must begin to plan for a transformed future in which the wormcam is pub lic knowledge and our own centers of power and command are as open to our opponents as theirs have become to us from ourworld international news hour january kate manzoni m an eerie rerun of the watergate scandal of sixty years ago white house staff reporting to president maria juarez have been publicly accused of bur gling the campaign headquarters of the republican party thought to be juarezs main opponents at the upcoming presidential election of the republicans have claimed that revelations made by juarezs peopleconcerning possible rulebreaking campaignfunding links between the gop and various highprofile businesspeople could only be based on information gathered by illegal means such as a wiretap or a burglary the white house in response have challenged the republicans to produce hard evidence of such an intrusion which the gop has so far failed to do the brain stud as kate watched john collins flew into moscow air port at the airport collins met a younger man the search engine quickly patternrecognized him as andrei popov popov a russian national had links to armed insur gency groups operating in all five countries bordering the aral seakazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan kate was getting closer with a growing sense of exhilaration she flew the wormcam viewpoint alongside collins and popov as they traveled across moscowby bus by subway in cars and by foot even through a snowstorm she glimpsed the kremlin and the old ugly kgb building as if this was some virtual tourist adventure but the poverty of the place was striking despite his choice of profession collins was an archetypal ameri can abroad kate saw his mounting frustration with mo bile phone dropouts his amazement at seeing subway ticket vendors using abacuses to compute change his disgust at the filth he encountered in public toilets his disbelieving impatience when he tried to call up the search engine and received no reply she felt a profound relief when collins reached a small suburban moscow airport and boarded a light plane and she was able to initiate the system she thought of as the autopilot the light of other days here in the gloom of the wormworks sitting before a softscreen she was flying the viewpoint using a joy stick and some intelligent supporting software ingenious though the system was ghosting a persons movements through a foreign city was intense unforgiving work a single slip of concentration could unravel hours of labor but wormcam tracking technology had advanced to the point where she could hook the remote viewpoint to various electronic signaturesfor instance of collins aircraft so now her wormcam viewpoint hovered all but invisible in the airplane cabinstill at colhns shoulderas the plane lofted into me deepening russian twilight tracking her quarry without her intervention it ought to get easier the wormworks teens were working on ways of having a viewpoint track an indi vidual person without the need for human guidance all that for the future she pushed back her chair stood up and stretched she was more tired than shed realized she couldnt remember when shed last taken a break absently she scanned the continuing wormcam im ages night was falling over central asia and through the planes small windows she could see how the land scape was scarred swaths of it brown wasteland still uninhabitable four decades after the fall of the soviet union with its ugly contempt for the landscape and its people there was a hand on her shoulder strong thumbs mas saging a knot of muscles there she was startled but the touch was familiar and she couldnt help but relax into it bobby kissed the crown of her head i knew id find you here do you know what time it is she glanced at a clock on the softscreen late af ternoon he laughed yes moscow time but this is seattle washington western hemisphere and on this side of the planet its just after am you worked through the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter night again i have the feeling youre avoiding me she said testily bobby you dont understand im tracking this guy its a twentyfourhour job collins is a cia operative who seems to be opening up lines of communication between our government and various shadowy insurrectionists in the aral sea area theres something going on out there the administration doesnt want to tell us about but bobby said with mock solemnity the wormcam sees all he was wearing casual ski country gear bright colorful thermaladaptive very ex pensive in the warmth of this corner of the wormworks she could see how its artificial pores had opened up revealing a faint brown sheen of tanned flesh he leaned toward the softscreen studied the image and her scrib bled notes how long will collins flight take hard to say hours he straightened up then take some time off your target is stuck in that plane until it lands or crashes and the wormcam can happily track him by itself and be sides hes asleep but hes with popov if he wakes up then the recording systems will pick up whatever he says and does come on give yourself a break and me but i dont want to be with you bobby she thought because there are things id rather not discuss and yet and yet she was still drawn to him despite what she now knew about him youre getting too complicated kate too introverted a break from this cold lifeless place will indeed do you good making an effort to smile she took his hand it was a fine still day a welcome interval between the storm systems that now habitually battered the pacific coast the light of other days cradling beakers of latte they walked through the gar den areas hiram had built around his wormworks there were low earthworks ponds bridges over streams and unfeasibly large and old trees all of it imported and installed in typical hiram fashion thought kate at great expense and with little discrimination or taste but the sky was a clear brilliant blue the winter sun actually delivered a little heat to her face and the two of them were leaving a trail of dark footsteps in the thick silver layer of lingering dew they found a bench it was temperaturesmart and had heated itself sufficiently to dry off the dew they sat down sipping coffee i still think youve been hiding from me bobby said mildly she saw that his retinal implants had polar ized in the sunlight turning silvery insectile its the wormcam isnt it all the ethical implications you find so disturbing with an eagerness that shamed her she jumped on that lead of course its disturbing a technology of such power but you were there when we came to our agreement with the fbi an agreement that put the wormcam in the hands of the people oh bobby the people dont even know the damn thing exists let alone that government agencies are using it against them look at all the tax defaulters that sud denly got caught the parents cheating on child support the brady law checks on gun buyers the serial sex of fenders but thats all for the good isnt it what are you sayingthat you dont trust the government this isnt the twentieth century she grunted remember what jefferson said every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone the people themselves therefore are its only safe depositories and what about the repub arthur c clarke and stephen baxter lican burglary how can that be in the peoples inter est you cant know for sure that the white house used the wormcam for that how else kate shook her head i wanted hiram to let me dig into that he threw me off the case im mediately weve made a faustian bargain bobby those guys in the administration and the government agencies arent necessarily crooks but theyre only hu man and by giving them such a powerful and secret weaponbobby i wouldnt trust myself with such power the republican spying incident is just the start of the orwellian nightmare were about to endure and as for hiramhave you any idea how hiram treats his employees here at ourworld job applicants go through screening all the way to a dna sequence he profiles all his employees by searching credit data bases police records even federal records he already had a hundred ways to measure productivity and perfor mance and check up on his people now he has the wormcam hiram can keep us under surveillance twentyfour hours a day if he chooses and theres not a damn thing any of us can do about it there have been a whole string of court cases that establish that employ ees dont have constitutional protection against intrusive surveillance by their bosses but he needs all that to keep the people working bobby said dryly since you broke the wormwood ab senteeism has rocketed and the use of alcohol and other drugs at work and this has nothing to do with the wormwood she said severely this is a question of basic rights bobby dont you get it ourworld is a vision of the future for all of usif monsters like hiram get to keep the wormcam and thats why its important the technol ogy is disseminated as far and as fast as possible rec iprocity at least wed be able to watch them watching us she searched his insectile silvery gaze the light of other days he said evenly thanks for the lecture and is that why youre dumping me she looked away its nothing to do with the wormcam is it he leaned forward challenging her theres something you dont want to tell me youve been this way for days weeks even what is it kate dont be afraid of hurting me you wont probably not she thought and that poor dear bobby is the whole trouble she turned to face him bobby the stud the implant hiram put in your head when you were a boy yes i found out what its for what its really for the moment stretched and she felt the sunlight prickle on her face laden with uv even so early in the i vear i tell me he said quietly the search engines specialist putines had explained it all to her succinctly it was a classic piece of early twentyfirstcentury neurobiological mindtinkering and it had nothing to do with any dyslexia or hyperactivity as hiram had claimed first hiram had suppressed the neural stimulation of areas in the temporal lobe of bobbys brain that were related to feelings of spiritual transcendence and mysti cal presence and his doctors tinkered with parts of the caudate region trying to ensure that bobby did not suffer from symptoms relating to obsessivecompulsive disor der which led some people to a need for excessive se curity order predictability and rituala need in some circumstances satisfied by the membership of religious communities hiram had evidently intended to shield bobby from the religious impulses that had so distracted his brother bobbys world was to be mundane earthy bereft of the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter transcendent and the numinous and he wouldnt even know what he was missing it was kate thought sourly a godectomy hirams implant also tinkered with the elaborate in terplay of hormones neurotransmitters and brain regions which were stimulated when bobby made love for ex ample the implant suppressed the opiatelike hormone oxytocin produced by me hypothalamus which flooded the brain during orgasm producing the warm floating bonding feelings that followed such acts thanks to a series of highprofile liaisonswhich hiram had discreetly set up and encouraged and even publicizedbobby had become something of a sexual athlete and he derived great physical pleasure from the act itself but his father had made him incapable of loveand so hiram seemed to have planned free of loyalties to anyone but his father there was more for instance a link to the deep por tion of bobbys brain called the amygdala may have been an attempt to control his propensity for anger a mysterious manipulation of bobbys orbitofrontal cor tex might even have been a bid to reduce his free will and so on hiram had reacted to his disappointment with david by making bobby a perfect son that is perfectly suited to hirams goals but by doing this hiram had robbed his son of much that made him human until kate manzoni found the switch in his head she took bobby back to the small apartment shed rented in downtown seattle there they made love for the first time in weeks afterward bobby lay in her arms hot his skin moist under hers where they touched as close as he could be yet still remote it was like trying to love a stranger but at least now she understood why she reached up and touched the back of his head the hard edges of the implant under his skin youre sure you want to do this the light of other days he hesitated what troubles me is that i dont know how ill be feeling afterwards will i still be me she whispered in his ear youll feel alive youll feel human he held his breath then said so quietly she could barely make it out do it she turned her head search engine yes kate turn it off and for bobby still warm with the afterglow of or gasm it was as if the woman in his arms had suddenly turned threedimensional solid and whole had come to life everything he could see feel smellthe warm ash scent of her hair the exquisite line of her cheek where the low light caught it the seamless smoothness of her bellyit was all just as it had been before but it was as if he had reached through that surface texture into the warmth of kate herself he saw her eyes watchful full of concernconcern for him he realized with a fresh jolt he wasnt alone anymore and before now he hadnt even known he had been he wanted to immerse himself in her oceanic warmth she touched his cheek he could see that her fingers came away wet and now he could feel the great shuddering sobs that racked his body an uncontrollable storm of weeping love and pain coursed through him exquisite hot un bearable spacetime the inner chaos didnt subside he tried to distract himself he resumed activities he had relished before but even the most extravagant virtual adventure seemed shallow obviously artificial predictable unengaging he seemed to need people even though he shied away from those close to himhe was a moth fearing the candle flame he thought unable to bear the brightness of the emotions involved so he accepted invitations he wouldnt otherwise have considered talked to people he had never needed before work helped with its constant and routine demands for his attention its relentless logic of meetings and schedules and resource allocation and it was a busy time the new mindseye vr headbands were moving out of the testing labs and ap proaching production status his teams of technicians had suddenly resolved a last technical glitch a ten dency for the headbands to cause synaesthesia in their users a muddling of the sensory inputs caused by cross talk between the brains centers it was a cause for long celebration they knew that ibms renowned watson research lab had been working on exactly the same prob lem whoever cracked the synaesthesia issue first would be the first to reach the market and would have a clear competitive edge for a long time to come it now looked as if ourworld had won that particular race the light of other days so work was absorbing but he couldnt work twenty four hours a day and he couldnt sleep the rest of the time away and when he was awake his mind un leashed for the first time was rampaging out of control as his cars smartdrove him to the wormworks he cowered in fear from the highspeed traffic an unre markable tabloid news itemabout vicious killings and rapes in the burgeoning aral sea water warmoved him to harsh tears a puget sound sunset glimpsed through a broken layer of fluffy black clouds filled him with awe simply at being alive when he met his father fear loathing love admira tion tore at himall overlying a deeper unbreakable bond but he could face hiram kate was different the surging need he feltto cherish her possess her some how consume herwas completely overwhelming in her company he became inarticulate as out of control of his mind as much as his body somehow she knew how he was feeling and quietly she left him alone he knew she would be there for him when he was ready to face her ahd resume their rela tionship but at least with hiram and kate he could figure out why he felt the way he did trace a causal relationship put tentative labels to the violent emotions that rocked him the worst of all were the mood swings he seemed to suffer without discernible cause he would wake up crying without reason or in the middle of a mundane day he would find himself filled with an indescribable joy as if everything suddenly made sense his life before seemed remote textureless like a flat colorless pencil sketch now he was immersed in a new world of color and texture and light and feeling where the simplest thingsthe curl of an early spring leaf the glimmer of sunlight on water the smooth curve of arthur c clarke and stephen baxter kates cheekcould be suffused by a beauty he had never known existed and bobbythe fragile ego that rode on the surface of this dark inner oceanwould have to leam to live with the new complex baffling person he had suddenly become that was why he had come to seek out his brother he took great comfort from davids stolid patient presence this bearlike figure with his bushy blond hair hunched over his softscreens immersed in his work satisfied with its logic and internal consistency scrib bling notes with a surprising delicacy davids person ality was as massive and solid as his body beside him bobby felt evanescent a wisp yet subtly calmed one unseasonably cold afternoon they sat cradling cof fees waiting for the results of another routine trial run a new wormhote plucked out of the quantum foam ex tending further than any had before i can understand a theorist wanting to study the limits of the wormhole technology bobby said pushing the envelope as far as you can but we made the big break through already surely whats important now is the ap plication of course david said mildly in fact the applica tion is everything hiram has a goal of turning wormhole generation from a highenergy physics stunt affordable only by governments and large corporations into some thing much smaller easily manufactured miniaturized like computers bobby said exactly it wasnt until miniaturization and the de velopment of the pc that computers were able to saturate the world finding new applications creating new mar ketstransforming our lives in fact hiram knows we wont keep our monopoly forever sooner or later somebody else is going to come up with an independent wormcam design maybe a better one the light of other days and miniaturization and cost reduction are sure to fol low and the future for ourworld said bobby is surely to be the market leader all those little wormhole gen erators thats hirams strategy david said he has a vi sion of the wormcam replacing every other data gathering instrument cameras microphones science sensors even medical probes although i cant say im looking forward to a wormhole endoscopy but i told you i studied a little business myself bobby massproduced wormcams will be a commod ity and we will be able to compete only on price but i believe that with our technical lead hiram can open up much greater opportunities for himself with differentia tion by coming up with applications which nobody else in the market can offer and thats what im interested in exploring he grinned at least thats what i tell hiram his money is being spent on down here bobby studied him trying to focus on his brother on hiram the wormcam tryinglo understand you just want to know dont you thats the bottom line for you david nodded i suppose so most science is just grunt work repetitive slog endless testing and check ing and because false hypotheses have to be pruned away much of the work is actually more destructive than constructive but occasionallyonly a few times prob ably in the luckiest lifethere is a moment of tran scendence transcendence not everybody will put it like that but its how it feels to me and it doesnt matter that there might be nobody to read your papers in five hundred years time id rather that wasnt true perhaps it wont be but the revelation itself is the thing bobby it always was arthur c clarke and stephen baxter on the screen behind him there was a starburst of pixels and a low belllike tone sounded david sighed but nol today it seems bobby peered over his brothers shoulder at the screen across which numbers were scrolling another instability its like the early days of the wormholes david tapped at a keyboard setting up another trial well we are being a little more ambitious our wormcams can already reach every part of the earth crossing distances of a few thousand kilometers what im attempting now is to extract and stabilize wormholes which span significant intervals in minkowski space timein fact tens of lightminutes bobby held up his hands you already lost me a lightminute is the distance light travels in a minute right yes for example the planet saturn is around a bil lion and a half kilometers away and that is about eighty lightminutes and we want to see satum of course we do wouldnt it be wonderful to have a wormcam that could explore deep space no more ailing probes no more missions lasting years but the difficulty is that wormholes spanning such large intervals are extremely rare in the quantum foams probabilistic froth and stabilizing them presents challenges an order of magnitude more difficult than before but its not im possible why intervals not distances physicist jargon sorry an interval is like a distance but in spacetime which is space plus time its really just pythagoras theorem he took a yellow legal note pad and began to scribble suppose you go downtown and walk a few blocks east a few blocks north then you can figure the distance you traveled like this he held up the pad squared squared squared the light of other days you walked around a rightangled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of i know that much but we physicists think about space and time as a single entity with time as a fourth coordinate in addi tion to the three of space he wrote on his pad once more squared squared squared this is called the metric for a minkowski spacetime and how can you talk about a separation in time in the same breath as a separation in spaced you measure time in minutes but space in kilometers david nodded approvingly good question you have to use units in which time and space are made equiva lent he studied bobby evidently searching for under standing lets just say that if you measure time in minutes and space in lightminutes it works out fine but theres something else fishy here why is this a minus sign rather than a plus david rubbed his fleshy nose a map of spacetime doesnt work quite like a map of downtown seattle the metric is designed so that the path of a photona par ticle traveling at the speed of lightis a null interval the interval is zero because the space and time terms cancel out this is relativity something to do with time dilation and rulers contracting and yes david patted bobbys shoulder exactly that this metric is invariant under the lorentz transformation never mind the point is bobby this is the kind of equation i have to use when i work in a relativistic uni verse and certainly if im trying to build a wormhole that reaches out to saturn and beyond bobby mused over the simple handwritten equation arthur c clarke and stephen baxter with his own emotional whirlwind still churning around him he felt a cold logic coursing through him numbers and equations and images evolving as if he was suffer ing from some kind of intellectual synaesthesia he said slowly david youre telling me that distances in space and time arc somehow equivalent right your worm holes span intervals of spacetime rather than simply dis tances and that means that if you do succeed in stabilizing a wormhole big enough to reach saturn across eighty lightminutes yes then it could reach across eighty minutes i mean across time he stared at david am i being really dumb david sat in silence for long seconds good god he said slowly i didnt even consider the possibility ive been configuring the wormhole to span a spacelike interval without even thinking about it feverishly he began to tap at his softscreen i can reconfigure it from right here if i restrict the spacelike interval to a couple of meters then the rest of the worm hole span is forced to become timelike what would mat mean david a buzzer rang painfully loudly and the search en gine spoke hiram would like to see you bobby bobby glanced at david flooded with sudden absurd fear david nodded curtly already absorbed in the new di rection of his work ill call you later bobby this could be significant very significant there was no reason to stay bobby walked away into the darkness of the wormworks hiram paced around his downtown office visibly angry fists clenched kate was sitting at hirams big confer ence table looking small cowed bobby hesitated at the door for a few breaths physi the light of other days cally unable to force himself into the room so strong were the emotions churning here but kate was looking at himforcing a smile in fact he walked into the room he reached the security of a seat on the opposite side of the table from kate bobby quailed unable to speak hiram glared at him you let me down you little shit kate snapped for christs sake hiram you keep out of this hiram thumped the tabletop and a softscreen in the plastic surface lit up before bobby it started to run fragments of a news story im ages of bobby a younger hiram a girlpretty timid looking dressed in colorless drab outdated fashions and a picture of the same woman two decades later intelligent tired handsome the earth news online logo was imprinted on each image they found her bobby hiram said thanks to you because you couldnt keep your bloody mouth shut could you found who your mother kate was working the softscreen before her scrolling j quickly through the information heather mays is that her name she married again she has a daughteryou have a halfsister bobby hirams voice was a snarl keep out of this you manipulative bitch without you none of this would have happened bobby striving for control said none of whatt your implant would have stayed doing what it was doing keeping you steady and happy christ i wish somebody had put a thing like that in my head when i was your age would have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble and you wouldnt have shot off your mouth in front of dan schirra schirra from eno except he didnt call tiimself that when he met you arthur c clarke and stephen baxter last week what did he do get you drunk and maudlin blubbing about your evil father your longlost mother i remember bobby said he calls himself mervyn mervyn costa ive known him a long time of course you have hes been cultivating you on behalf of eno to get to me you didnt know who he was but you kept your reservebefore when you had the implant to help you keep a clear head and now this ifs open season on hiram patterson and its all your bloody fault manzoni kate was still scrolling through the news piece and its hyperlinks didnt screw and dump this woman two decades ago she tapped at her soflscreen and an area of the table before hiram lit up schirra has corrobo rative evidence look bobby looked over his fathers shoulder the screen showed hiram sitting at a tablethis table bobby re alized with ajolt this roomand he was working his way through a mound of papers amending and signing the image was grainy unsteady but clear enough hiram came to a particular document shook his head as if in disgust and hastily signed it turning it facedown on a pile to his right after that the image reran in slomo and the view point zoomed in on the document after some focusing and image enhancement it was possible to read some of the text you see kate said hiram they caught you sign ing an update of the payoff agreement you made with heather more than twenty years ago hiram looked at bobby almost pleading it was over long ago we came to a settlement i helped her develop her career she makes documentary features shes been successful she was a brood mare bobby kate said coldly hes kept up his payments to keep her quiet and to make sure she never tried to get near to you hiram prowled around the room hammering at the the light of other days walls glaring at the ceiling i have this suite swept three times a day how did they get those images those in competent arseholes in building security have screwed up again come on hiram kate said evenly evidently en joying herself think about it theres no way eno could bug your headquarters any more than you could bug theirs but i wouldnt need to bug them hiram said slowly i have the wormcam oh well done kate grinned you figured it out eno must have a wormcam as well its the only way they could have achieved this scoop you lost your monop oly hiram and the first thing they did with their wormcam was turn it on you she threw back her head and laughed out loud my god bobby said what a disaster oh garbage she snapped come on bobby pretty soon the whole world will know the wormcam exists it wont be possible to keep a lid on it any longer it has to be a good thing if the wormcam is prized out of the hands of this sick duopoly the federal government and hiram patterson for gods sake hiram said coldly if earth news have wormcam technology its obvious who gave it to them kate looked puzzled are you implying that who else im a journalist kate flared im no spy the hell with you hiram its obvious what happened eno just figured out that you must have found a way to adapt your wormholes as remote viewers with that basic in sight they duplicated your researches it wouldnt be hard most of the information is in the public domain hiram your hold on the wormcam was always fragile it only took one person to figure it out independently but hiram didnt seem to be hearing her i forgave you took you in you took my money you betrayed arthur c clarke and stephen baxter my trust you damaged my sons mind and poisoned him against me kate stood and faced hiram if you really believe that youre more twisted than i thought you were the search engine called softly excuse me hiram michael mavens is here asking to see you special agent mavens of tell him to wait im afraid that isnt an option hiram and i have a call from david he says its urgent bobby looked from one face to the other frightened bewildered as his life came to pieces around him mavens took a seat and opened a briefcase hiram snapped what do you want mavens i didnt expect to see you again i thought the deal we signed was comprehensive i thought so too mr patterson mavens looked gen uinely disappointed but the problem is you didnt stick to it ourworld as a corporation one employee specifically and tha s why im here when i heard this case had turned up i asked if i could become involved i suppose i have a special interest hiram said heavily what case mavens picked up what looked like a charge sheet from his briefcase the bottom line is that a charge of tradesecret misappropriation under the economic espionage act has been brought against ourworld by ibm specifically by the director of their thomas j wat son research laboratory mr patterson we believe the wormcam has been used to gain illegal access to ibm proprietary research results something called a synaesthesi asuppression software suite associated with virtualreality technology he looked up does that make sense hiram looked at bobby bobby sat transfixed overwhelmed by conflicting the light of other days emotions with no real idea how he should react what he should say kate said you have a suspect dont you special agent the fbi man eyed her steadily sadly i think you already know the answer to that question ms manzoni kate appeared confused bobby snapped you mean kate thats ridiculous hiram thumped a fist into a palm i knew it i knew she was trouble but i didnt think shed go this far mavens sighed im afraid theres a very clear evi dentiary trail leading to you ms manzoni kate flared if its there it was planted mavens said youll be placed under arrest i hope there wont be any trouble if youll sit quietly the search engine will read you your rights kate looked startled as a voiceinaudible to the rest of tfiembegan to sound in her ears hiram was at bobbys side take it easy son well get through mis shit together what were you trying to do manzoni find another wav to get to bobby is that what it was all about hirams face was a grim mask empty of emotion there was no trace of anger pity reliefor triumph and the door was flung open david stood there grin ning his bearlike bulk filling the frame he held a rolled up softscreen in one hand i did it he said by god i did it whats happening here mavens said doctor curzon it may be better if it doesnt matter whatever youre doing it doesnt matter not compared to this he spread his softscreen on the tabletop as soon as i got it i came straight here look at this the softscreen showed what looked superficially like a rainbow reduced to black and white and gray uneven bands of light that arced distorted across a black back ground of course its somewhat grainy david said but arthur c clarke and stephen baxter still this picture is equivalent to the quality of images returned by nasas first flyby probes back in the s thats saturn mavens said wondering the planet saturn yes were looking at the rings david grinned i established a wormcam viewpoint all of a billion and a half kilometers away quite a thing isnt it if you look closely you can even see a couple of the moons here in the plane of the rings hiram laughed out loud and hugged davids bulk my god thats bloody terrific yes yes it is but thats not important not any more not important are you kidding feverishly david began to tap at his softscreen the image of saturns rings dissolved i can reconfigure it from here its as easy as that it was bobby who gave me the clue i just hadnt thought out of the box as he did if i restrict the spacelike interval to a couple of meters then the rest of the wonnhole span becomes timelike bobby leaned forward to see the screen now showed an equally grainy image of a much more mun dane scene bobby recognized it immediately it was da vids work cubicle in the wormworks david was sitting mere his back to the viewpoint and bobby was standing at his side looking over his shoulder as easily as that david said again his voice small awed of course well have to run repeatable trials properly timed hiram said thats just the wormworks so what you dont understand this new wormhole has the same umm length as the other the one that reached to saturn yes but instead of spanning eighty lightminutes mavens finished it for him i get it this wonnhole spans eighty minutes the light of other days yes david said eighty minutes into the past look father youre seeing me and bobby just before you summoned him away hirams mouth had dropped open bobby felt as if the world was swimming around him changing configuring into some strange unknowable pattern as if another chip in his head had been switched off he looked at kate who seemed diminished terri fied lost in shock but hiram his troubles dismissed grasped the impli cations immediately he glared into the air i wonder how many of them are watching us right now mavens said who in the future dont you see if hes right this is a turning point in history this moment right here and right now the invention of this this past viewer probably the air around us is fizzing with wormcam viewpoints sent back by future historians biographers hagiographers he lifted up his head and bared his teeth are you watching me are you do you remember my name im hiram patterson hah see what i did you arse holes and in the corridors of the future innumerable watchers met his challenging gaze the eyes of god history is indeed little more than a chronicle of the crimes follies and misfortunes of mankind edward gibbon walls of glass kate was in remand waiting for her trial it was tak ing a while to come to court as it was a complex caseand hirams lawyers had argued in confidence through the fbi that her trial should be delayed anyhow while the new pastviewing capabilities of wormcam technology stabilized in fact such had been the wide publicity surrounding kates case that the ruling was being taken as a prece dent even before its pastviewing possibilities were widely understood the wormqam was expected to have an immediate impact on almost all contested criminal cases many major trials had been delayed or paused awaiting new evidence and in general only minor and uncontested cases were being processed through the courts for a long dme to come whatever the outcome of the case kate wouldnt be going anywhere so bobby decided to go find his mother heather mays lived in a place called thomas city close to the utaharizona state line bobby flew into cedar city and drove from there at thomas he stopped the car a few blocks short of heathers home and walked a police car silently cruised by and a beefy male cop peered out at bobby the cops face was a broad hostile moon scarred by the pits of multiple basalcell carci arthur c clarke and stephen baxter nomas but his glare softened with recognition bobby could read his lips good day mr pcttterson as the car moved on bobby felt a shiver of self consciousness the wormcam had made hiram me most famous person on the planet and in the allseeing public eye bobby stood right at his side he knew in fact that as he approached his mothers home a hundred wormcam viewpoints must hover at his shoulder even now gazing into his face at this dif ficult moment invisible emotional vampires he tried not to think about it the only possible de fense against the wormcam he walked on through the heart of the little town outofseason april snow was falling on the roofs and gardens of clapboard houses that might have been pre served for a hundred years he passed a small pond where children were skating round and round in tight circles laughing loudly even under the pale wintry sun the children wore sunglasses and silvery reflective smears of sunblock thomas was a settled peaceful anonymous place one of hundreds like it he supposed here in the huge empty heart of america it was a place that three months ago he would have regarded as deadly dull if hed ever found himself here he probably would have hightailed it for vegas as soon as possible and yet now he found himself wondering how it would have been to grow up here as he watched the cop car pass slowly along the street he noticed a strange flurry of petty lawbreaking following in its wake a man emerging from a sushi burger store crumpled the paper his food had been wrapped in and dropped it to the floor right under the cops noses at a crossing an elderly woman jaywalked glaring challengingly through the cops windscreen and so on the cops watched tolerantly and as soon as the car had passed the people done with thumbing their the light of other days noses at the authorities resumed their apparently lawful lives this was a widespread phenomenon there had been a surprisingly wideranging if muted rebellion against the new regime of invisible wormcam overseers the idea of the authorities having such immense powers of oversight did not it seemed sit well with the instincts of many americans and there had been rises in petty crime rates all over the country otherwise lawabiding people seemed suddenly struck by a desire to perform small illegal actslittering jaywalkingas if to prove they were stili free despite the authorities assumed scrutiny and local cops were learning to be tolerant of this it was just a token of liberties defended but bobby supposed it was healthy he reached the main street animated images on tab loid vending machines urged him to download their lat est news for just ten dollars a shot he eyed the seductive headlines there was some serious news local national and internationalit seemed that the town was getting over an outbreak of cholera related to stress on the water supply and was having some trouble assimi lating its quota of sealevelrise relocates from galveston islandbut the serious stuff was mostly swamped by tabloid trivia a local member of congress had been forced out of office by a wormcam exposure of sexual peccadilloes she had been caught pressuring a highschool football hero sent to washington as a reward for his sporting achievements into another form of athletics but the boy had been over the age of consent as far as bobby was concerned the representatives main crime in this dawning age of the wormcam was stupidity well she wasnt the only one it was said that twenty percent of members of congress and almost a third of the senate had announced they would not be seeking reelection or would retire early or had just resigned arthur c clarke and stephen baxter outright some commentators estimated that fully half of all americas elected officials might be forced out of office before the wormcam became embedded m the national and individual consciousness some said this was a good thingthat people were being frightened into decency others pointed out that most humans had moments they would prefer not to share with the rest of mankind perhaps in a couple of electoral cycles the only survivors among those in office or prepared to run for office would be the pathologically dull with no personal lives to speak of at all no doubt the truth as usual would be somewhere between the extremes there was still some coverage of last weeks big story the attempt by unscrupulous white house aides to discredit a potential opponent of president juarez at the next election campaign they had wormcammed him sitting on the john with his trousers down his ankles picking his nose and extracting fluff from his navel but this had rebounded on the voyeurs and had done no damage to governor beauchamp at all after all everybody had to use the john and probably nobody no matter how obscure did so now without wondering if there was a wormcam viewpoint looking down or worse up at her even bobby had taken to using the lavatory in the dark it wasnt easy even with the new easyuse touch textured plumbing that was rapidly becoming common place and he sometimes wondered if there was anybody in the developed world who still had sex with the lights on he doubted that even the supermarkettabloid vendors would persist with such paparazzi exposure as the shock value wore off it was telling that these images which would have been shockingly revealing just a few months ago now blared multicolored in the middle of the after noon from stands in the main street of this mormon com the light of other days munity unregarded by almost everyone young and old children and churchgoers alike it seemed to bobby that the wormcam was forcing the human race to shed a few taboos to grow up a little he walked on the mayses home was easy to find before this oth erwise nondescript house in a nondescript residential street here in the middle of classic smalltown america he found the decadesold symbol of fame or notoriety a dozen or so news crews gathered before the white painted picket fence that bordered the garden instant access wormcam technology or not it was going to take a long time before the newswatching public was weaned off the interpretative presence of a reporter interposing herself before some breaking news story bobbys arrival of course was a news event in itself now the journalists came running toward him drone cameras bobbing above them like angular metallic bal loons snapping questions bobby this way please bobby bobby is it true this is the first time you ve seen your mother since you were three years old is it true your father doesn i want you here or was that scene in the ourworld boardroom just a setup for the wormcams bobby bobby bobby smiled as evenly as he could manage the reporters didnt try to follow him as he opened the small gate and walked through the fence after all there was no need no doubt a thousand wormcam viewpoints were trailing him even now he knew there was no point asking for respect for his privacy there was no choice it seemed but to endure but he felt that unseen gaze like a tangible pressure on the back of his neck and the eeriest thought of all was that among this clustering invisible crowd there might be watchers from the unimaginable future peering back along the tunnels of time to this moment what if he himself a future bobby was among them arthur c clarke and stephen baxter but he must live the rest of his life despite this as sumed scrutiny he rapped on the door and waited with gathering nervousness no wonncam he supposed could watch the way his heart was pumping but surety the watching millions could see the set of his jaw the drops of per spiration he could feel on his brow despite the cold the door opened it had taken some persuading for bobby to get hiram to give his blessing to this meeting hiram had been seated alone at his big mahogany effect desk before a mound of papers and softscreens he sat hunched over defensively he had developed a habit of glancing around nicking his gaze through the air searching for wonncam viewpoints like a mouse in fear of a predator i want to see her bobby had said heather mays my mother i want to go meet her hiram looked as exhausted and uncertain as at any time bobby could remember it would be a mistake what good would it do you bobby hesitated i dont know i dont know how it feels to have a mother she isnt your mother not in any real sense she doesnt know you and you dont know her i feel as if i do i see her on every tabloid show then you know she has a new family a new life that has nothing to do with you hiram eyed him and you know about the suicide bobby frowned her husband he committed suicide because of the media intru sion all because your girlfriend gave away the wonncam to the sleaziest journalistic reptiles on the planet shes responsible dad yes yes i know we had this argument already the light of other days hiram got out of his chair walked to the window and massaged the back of his neck christ im tired look bobby any time you feel like coming back to work i could bloody well use some help i dont think im ready right now everythings gone to hell since the wonncam was released all the extra security is a pain in the arse bobby knew that was true reaction to the existence of the womicam almost all of it hostile had come from a whole spectrum of protest groupsfrom venerable campaigners like the privacy rights clearinghouse all the way to attempted attacks on this corporate hq the wormworks and even hirams home an awful lot of people on both sides of the law felt they had been hurt by the wonncams relentless exposure of the truth many of them seemed to need somebody to blame for their travailsand who better than hiram were losing a lot of good people bobby many of them havent the guts to stick with me now ive become public enemy number one the man who destroyed pri vacy i cant say i blame themsts not their fight and even those whove stayed around cant keep their hands off the wormcams the illicit use has been incredible and you can guess what for spying on their neighbors on their wives their workmates weve had endless rows fistfights and one attempted shooting as people find out what their friends really think of them what they do to them behind their backs and now you can see into the past its impossible to hide its addictive and i suppose its a taster of what we have to expect when the pastview wonncam gets out to the general public were going to ship millions of units thats for sure but for now its a pain in the arse ive had to ban illicit use and lock down the terminals he eyed his son look theres a lot to do and the world isnt going to wait until your precious soul is healed arthur c clarke and stephen baxter i thought business is going welleven though we lost the monopoly on the wormcam were still ahead of the game hirams voice was getting stronger his phrasing more fluent bobby no ticed he was speaking to the invisible audience he as sumed was watching him even now now we can disclose the existence of the wormcam there is a whole host of new applications we can roll out videophones for instance a directline wormhole pair between sender and receiver we can see a topend market opening up immediately with massmarket models to follow of course that will have an impact on the datapipe busi ness but there will still be a need for tracking and iden tification technology but thats not where my problems lie bobby we have an agm next week i have to face my shareholders they arent going to give you a rough ride the fin ancials are superb its not that he glanced around the room warily how can i put this before the wormcam business was a closed game nobody knew my cardsmy com petitors my employees even my investors and share holders if i wanted it that way and that gave me a lot of leverage for bluff counterbluff lying never that hiram said firmly as bobby knew he had to its a question of posture i could minimize my weaknesses advertise my strengths surprise the com petition with a new strategy whatever but now the rules have changed now the game is more like chessand i cut my teeth playing poker nowfor a priceany shareholder or competitor or regulator come to that can check up on any aspect of my operation they can see all my cards even before i play them and its not a comfortable feeling you can do the same to your competitors bobby said ive read plenty of articles which say that the new openbook management will be a good thing if youre the light of other days open to inspection even by your employees youre ac countable and its more likely valid criticism is going to reach you and youll make fewer mistakes the economists argued that openness brought many benefits to business without any one party holding a monopoly of information there was a better chance of closing a given deal with information on true costs available to everybody only a reasonable level of profit taking was acceptable better information flows led to more perfect competition monopolies and cartels and other manipulators of the market were finding it impos sible to sustain their activities with open and account able cash flows criminals and terrorists werent able to squirrel away unrecorded cash and so on jesus hiram growled when i hear guff like that i wish i sold management textbooks id be making a killing right now he waved his hand at the downtown buildings beyond the window but out there its no businessschool discussion group its like what happened to the copyright laws with the advent of the internet youremember that no youre too young the global information infrastruc turethe thing that was supposed to replace the berne copyright conventioncollapsed back in the nought noughts suddenly the internet was awash with unedited garbage every damn publishing house was forced out of business and all the authors went back to being com puter programmers all because suddenly somebody was giving away for free the stuff they used to sell to earn a crust now were going through the same thing all over again you have a powerful technology which is leading to an information revolution a new openness but that conflicts with the interests of the people who originated or added value to that information in the first place i can only make a profit on what ourworld creates and that largely derives from ownership of ideas but laws arthur c clarke and stephen baxter of intellectual ownership are soon going to become unenforceable dad its the same for everybody hiram snorted maybe but not everybody is going to prosper there are revolutions and power struggles going on in every boardroom in this city i knowive watched most of them just as they have watched mine what im telling you is that im in a whole new world here and i need you with me dad i have to get my head straight forget heather im trying to warn you that youll get hurt bobby shook his head if you were me wouldnt you want to meet her wouldnt you be curious no he said bluntly i never went back to uganda to find my fathers family i never regretted it not once what good would it have done i had my own life to build the pas is the past it doesnt do any bloody good to examine it too closely he looked into the air chal lengingly and all you leeches who are working on more exposes of hiram patterson can write that down too bobby stood up well if it hurts too much i can just turn the switch you put in my head cant i hiram looked mournful just dont forget where your true family is son a girl stood at the door slim no taller than his shoulder dressed in a harsh electric blue shift with a glaring pink lincoln design she scowled at bobby i know who you are he said youre mary heathers daughter by her second marriage another halfsibling hed only just found out about she looked younger than her fifteen years her hair was cut brutally short and a softtattoo morphed on her cheek she was pretty with high cheekbones and warm eyes but her face was pursed into a frown that looked habitual the light of other days he forced a smile your mother is expecting you i know she looked past him at the clutch of reporters youd better come in he wondered if he should say something about her father express sympathy but he couldnt find the words and her face was hard and blank and the moment passed he stepped past her into the house he was in a nar row hallway cluttered with winter shoes and coats he glimpsed a warmlooking kitchen a lounge with big softscreens draped over the walls what looked like a home study mary poked his arm watch this she stepped for ward faced the reporters and lifted her shift up over her head she was wearing panties but her small breasts were bare she pulled the shift down and slammed shut the door he could see spots of color on her cheeks anger embarrassment why did you do that they look at me the whole time anyway and she turned on her heel and ran upstairs her shoes clattering on bare wooden boards leaving him stranded in the hall way sorry about that she isnt adjusting too well and here at last was heather walking slowly up the hallway to him she was smaller than he had expected she looked slim even wiry if a little roundshouldered her face might once have shared marys elfin lookbut now those cheekbones were prominent under sunaged skin and her brown eyes sunk deep in pools of wrinkles were tired her hair streaked with gray was pulled back into a tight bob she was looking up at him quizzically are you okay bobby for a few heartbeats didnt trust himself to speak yes im just not sure what to call you arthur c clarke and stephen baxter she smiled how about heather this is compli cated enough already and without warning she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around his chest he had tried to rehearse for this moment tried to imagine how he would handle the storm of emotion he had expected but now the moment was here what he felt was empty and all the while he was aware achingly aware of a million eyes on him on every gesture and expression he made she pulled away from him i havent seen you since you were five years old and it has to be like this well i think weve put on enough of a show she led him into the room he had tentatively identified as a study on a worktable there was a giant softscreen of the finely grained type employed by artists and graphic designers the walls were covered with lists images of people places scraps of yellow paper covered with spidery incomprehensible writing there were scripts and reference books open on every surface in cluding the floor heather brusquely picked a mass of papers up off a swivel chair and dumped it on the floor he accepted the implicit invitation by sitting down she smiled at him when you were a little boy you liked tea i did youd drink nothing else not even soda soyoud like some he made to refuse but she had probably bought some specially and this is your mother asshole sure he said thanks she went to the kitchen returned with a steaming mug of what proved to be jasmine tea she leaned close to give it to him you cant fool me she whispered but thanks for indulging me awkward silence he sipped his tea the light of other days he indicated the big softscreen the nest of paper youre a filmmaker right she sighed i used to be documentaries i regard myself as an investigative journalist she smiled i won awards you should be proud not that anybody cares about that side of my life anymore compared to the fact that i once slept with the great hiram patterson he said youre still working even though even though my life has turned to shit im trying to what else should i do i dont want to be defined by hiram not that its easy everything has changed so fast the wormcam what else nobody wants thoughtthrough pieces anymore and drama has been completely wiped out were all fascinated by this new power we have to watch each other so theres no work in anything but docu soaps following real people going through their real liveswith their consent and approval of course ironic considering my own position dont you think look she brought up an image on the softscreen a smiling young woman in uniform anna petersen fresh out of the navy college at annapolis he smiled anna from annapolis you can see why she was chosen we have rotating teams to track anna twentyfour hours a day well fol low her career through her first postings her triumphs and disasters her loves and losses the word is shes to be sent with the task force to the aral sea waterwar flashpoints so were expecting some good material of course the navy knows were tracking anna she looked up into the empty air dont you guys so maybe it isnt a surprise she got an assignment like that and no doubt well be getting plenty of momfriendly feelgood wartime footage youre cynical well i hope not but it isnt easy the wormcam is making a mess of my career oh for now there is a arthur c clarke and stephen baxter demand for interpretationanalysts editors commen tators but even that is going to disappear when the great unwashed masses out there can point their own wormcams at whoever they want you think thats going to happen she snorted oh of course it is weve been here before with personal computers its just a question of how fast driven by competitive pressure and social forces the wormcams are going to get cheaper and more powerful and more widely available until every body has one and perhapsbobby thought uneasily thinking of davids timeviewing experimentsmore powerful than you know tell me about you and hiram she smiled looking tired are you sure you want that here on planet candid camera please what did hiram say to you about me slowly stumbling occasionally he repeated hirams account she nodded then thats what happened and she held his gaze for long seconds listen to me im more than an appendage of hiram some son of annex to your life and so is mary were people bobby did you know i lost a child mary a little brother no hiram didnt tell me im sure he didnt because it had nothing to do with him thank god nobody can watch that not yet bobby thought darkly i want you to understand this bobby she looked into the air i want everyone to understand my life is being destroyed piece by piece by being watched when i lost my boy i hid i locked the doors closed the curtains even hid under the bed at least there were moments when i could be private not now now its as if every wall of my house has been turned into a one way mirror can you imagine how that feels the light of other days i think so he said gently in a few days the attention focus is going to move on to bum somebody else but ill never know when some obsessive somewhere in the world will be peering into my bedroom still curious even years from now and even if the wormcam disappeared tomorrow it could never bring desmond back look its been bad enough for me but at least i know this is all because of something did long ago my husband and daughter had nothing to do with it and yet theyve been subject to the same pitiless stare and desmond im sorry she dropped her gaze her tea cup was trembling with a delicate china rattle in its saucer im sorry too i didnt agree to see you to make you feel bad dont worry i felt bad already and i brought the audience ive been selfish she smiled with an effort they were here anyway she waved her hand through the air around her head i sometimes imagine i can disperse the watchers like nap ping away insects but i dontsuppose it does any good im glad you came whatever the circumstances would you like some more tea she had brown eyes it was only as he endured the long drive back to cedar city that that simple point struck him he called search engine basic genetics dominant and recessive genes for example blue eyes are reces sive brown dominant so if a father has blue eyes and a mother brown the children should have brown eyes its not quite as simple as that bobby if the mothers chromosomes carry a blueeyes gene then some of the children will have blue eyes too blueblue from the father bluebrown from the mother four combinations arthur c clarke and stephen baxter yes so one in four of the children will be blue eyed umm i have blue eyes he thought heather has brown the search engine was smart enough to interpolate his real question i dont have information on heathers genetic ancestry bobby if you like i can find out never mind thank you he settled back in his seat no doubt it was a stupid question heather must have blue eyes in her family background no doubt the car sped through the huge gathering night light years hiram stalked around davids small room silhouet ted by picturewindow seattle nighttime skyline he picked up a paper at random a faded photocopy and read its title lorentzian wormholes from the gravi tationally squeezed vacuum more brainbusting the ory david sat on his sofa irritated and disturbed by his fathers unannounced visit he understood hirams need for company to bum off his adrenaline to escape the intensely scrutinized goldfish bowl his life had become he just wished it didnt have fo be in his space hiram do you want a drink a coffee or a glass of wine would be fine not french david went to the refrigerator i keep a chardonnay a few of the califomian vineyards are almost accepta ble he brought the glasses back to the sofa so hiram said lorentzian wormholes david leaned back in the sofa and scratched his head to tell the truth were nearing a dead end casimir technology seems to have inherent limitations the bal ance of the capacitors two superconducting plates a balance between the casimir forces and electrical repul sion is unstable and easily lost and the electric charges we have to carry are so large there are frequent violent discharges to the surroundings three people have been killed in wormcam operations already hiram as you know from the insurance suits the next generation of arthur c clarke and stephen baxter wormcam is going to require something more robust and if we had that we could build much smaller cheaper wormcam facilities and propagate the tech nology a lot further and is there a way well perhaps casinur injectors are a rather clunky nineteenthcentury way of making negative energy but it turns out that such regions can occur naturally if space is sufficiently strongly distorted quantum vacuum and other fluctuations can be amplified until well this is a subtle quantum effect its called a squeezed vacuum the trouble is the best theory we have says you need a quantum black note to give you a strong enough gravity field and so and so youre looking for a better theory hirani riffled through the papers stared at davids handwritten notes the equations linked by looping arrows he glared around the room and not a softscreen in sight do you get out much ever or do you smartdrive to and from work your head in some dusty paper or other from the moment you got here you had your franco american head stuck up your broad and welcoming backside and thats where it has remained david bristled is mat a problem for you hiram you know how much i rely on your work but i cant help feel that youre missing the point here the point the point about what the wormcam whats really significant about the cam is what its doing out there he gestured at the window seattle hiram laughed everywhere and this is before the pastviewing stuff really starts to make an impact he seemed to come to a decision he put his glass down listen come take a trip with me tomorrow where the boeing plant he gave david a card it bore a smartdrive bar code ten oclock the light of other days all right but hiram stood up i regard myself as responsible for completing your education son ill show you what a difference the wormcam is making bobby brought mary his halfsister to kates aban doned cubicle in the wormworks mary walked around the desk touching the blank softscreen lying there the surrounding acoustic parti tions it was all clinically neat spotless blank this is it her personal stuff has been cleared away the cops took some items work stuff the rest we parceled up for her family and since then the forensics people have been crawling all over its like a skull the scavengers have licked clean he grimaced nice image im right arent i yes but but he thought there was still some ineffable kate ness about this anonymous desk t lis chair as if in the months she had spent here she had somehow impressed herself on this dull piece of spacedme he wondered how long this feeling would take to fade away mary was staring at him this is upsetting you isnt it youre perceptive and frank to a fault she grinned showing diamondspresumably fake studding her front teeth im fifteen years old thats my job is it true wormcams can look into the past where did you hear that well is it yes show her to me who kate manzoni i never met her show her to me you have wormcams here dont you arthur c clarke and stephen baxter of course this is the wbrmworks everyone knows you can see the past with a wormcam and you do know how to work them or are you scared like you were scared of coming here up if i may say so yours come on irritated now he led her to the cage elevator which would take them to davids workstation a couple of lev els below david wasnt here today the supervising tech wel comed bobby and offered him help bobby made sure the rig was online and declined further assistance he sat at the swivel chair before davids desk and began to set up the run his fingers fumbling with the unfamiliar manual keys glowing in the softscreen mary had pulled up a stool beside him that interface is disgusting this david must be some kind of retro freak you ought to be more respectful hes my half brother she snorted why should i be respectful just because old man hiram couldnt keep from emptying his sack anyhow what does david do all day david is working on a new generation of worm cams its something called squeezedvacuum technol ogy here he picked out a couple of references from davids desk and showed them to her she flicked through the closeprinted pages of equations the dream is that soon well be able to open up wormholes without needing a factory full of superconducting mag nets much cheaper and smaller but they will still be in the hands of the government and the big corporations right the big softscreen fixed to the partition in front of them lit up with a fizz of pixels he could hear the whine of the generators powering the big clumsy casimir in jectors in the pit below smell the sharp ozone tang of powerful electric fields as the machinery gathered its the light of other days huge energies he felt as always a surge of excitement anticipation and mary was to bobbys relief silenced at least temporarily the static snowstorm cleared and an imagea little blocky but immediately recognizablefilled up the softscreen they were looking down over kates cubicle a couple of floors above them here at the wormworks but what they saw now was no cleanedout husk now the cubicle was livedin a softscreen was slewed at an angle across the desk and data scrolled across it unremarked while a frame in one comer bore what looked like a news broadcast a talking head with miniature graphics there were more signs of work in progress a cutoff soda can adapted as a pencil holder pens and pencils scattered over the desk with big yellow legal pads a couple of hardcopy newspapers folded over and propped up but what was more revealingand heartbreaking was the kipple the personal stuff and litter that defined this as kates space and no other the steaming coffee in a thermaware cup scrunched up food wrappers a propup calendar an ugly angular sstyle digital clock a souvenir portraitbobby and kate against the exotic background of revelationlandtacked ironically to one partition the chair was pushed back from the desk and was still rotating slowly we missed her by seconds he thought mary was staring intently at the image mouth open fascinated by this window into the pastas everybody was the first time we were just there its so different its incredible and now kate walked from offstage into the im age as bobby had known she would she was wearing a simple practical smock and a lick of hair was draped over her forehead catching her eyes she was frowning arthur c clarke and stephen baxter concentrating her fingers on the keyboard even before she had sat down he found it hard to speak i know the boeing vr facility turned out to be a chamber fitted with row upon row of open steel cagesperhaps a hun dred of them david speculated beyond glass walls whitecoated engineers moved among brightly lit banks of computer equipment the cages were gimbaled to move in three dimen sions and each of them contained a skeletal suit of rubber and steel fitted with sensors and manipulators david was strapped tightly into one of these and he had to fight feelings of claustrophobia as his limbs were pinned in place he waved away the genital attachment which was absurdly huge like a vacuum flask i dont think ill be needing that on this trip a female tech held a helmet up before his head it was a hollowedout mass of electronics before it de scended he looked for hiram his father was in a cage at the other end of a row a few ranks ahead of him you seem a long way away hiram raised a gloved hand flexed his fingers it wont make a difference once were immersed his voice echoed in the cavernous hall what do you think of the facility pretty impressive huh he winked david thought of the mindseye bobbys simple headband apparatusa few hundred grams of metal which by interfacing directly to the central nervous sys tem could replace all this totaltouchenclosure boeing gadgetry once more it seemed hiram had a winner he let the tech drop the helmet over his head and he was suspended in darkness which cleared slowly murkily he saw hirams face hovering before him it was illuminated by a soft red light the light of other days first impressions hiram snapped he stepped back revealing a landscape david glanced around water a sloping gravelly ground a red sky when he moved his head too rapidly me image crumbled winking into pixels and he could feel the helmets heavy movement the horizon curved quite sharply as if he were view ing it from some great altitude and on mat horizon there were low eroded hills whose shoulders reflected in the water the air seemed thin and he felt cold he said first impressions a beach at sunset but thats no sun i ever saw the sun was a ball of red light fading to a yellow orange at its center it was sitting on the sharp mistfree horizon and was flattened to a lens shape presumably by refraction but it was immense much bigger than the sun of earth a redglowing dome covering perhaps a tenth of the sky perhaps it was a giant he mused a bloated aging star the sky was deeper than a sunset sky too intense crimson overhead scarlet around that hulking sun black beyond but even around the sun the stars shonein fact he realized he could make out glimmering stars through the diffuse limb of the sun itself just to the right of the sun was a compact constellation that was hauntingly familiar that w shape was surely cassiopeia one of the most easily recognizable star fig uresbut there was an extra star to the left of the pat tern turning the constellation into a crude zigzag he took a step forward the gravel crunched con vincingly and he could feel sharp stones beneath his feetthough he wondered if the pressure points on his soles matched what he saw on the ground he walked the few paces to the waters edge ice glinted on the rocks and there were miniature floes ex tending out into the water a meter or so the water was flat almost still heaving with a soft languid slow mo arthur c clarke and stephen baxter tion he bent and inspected a pebble it was hard black heavily worn basalt underneath there was a glint of a crystalline depositsalt perhaps some bright star be hind him brought out yellowwhite highlights on the stone even casting a shadow he straightened up and hurled the rock out over the water it flew long but slowlow gravityeventually hitting the water with a feeble splash fat ripples spread in languid circles around the impact point hiram was standing beside him he was wearing a simple engineers jumpsuit with the boeing roundel on the back figured out where you are yet its a scene from a sciencefiction novel i once read an endoftheworld vision no hiram said not science fiction not a game this is real at least the scenery is a wormcam view yeah with a lot of vr enhancement and interpo lation so that the scene responds convincingly if you try to interact with itfor instance when you picked up that stone i take it were not in the solar system anymore could i breathe the air no its mostly carbon dioxide hiram pointed to the rounded hills theres still some volcanism here but this is a small planet i can see the way the ho rizon bends and the gravity is low that stone i threw so why hasnt this small planet lost all its internal heat like the moonah the star he pointed to the glowing hull on the horizon we must be close enough for the tides to keep the core of this little world molten like lo orbiting jupiter in fact that must mean the star isnt the giant i thought it was its a dwarf and were close to itclose enough for liquid water to persist if that lake or sea over there is water oh yes though i wouldnt recommend drinking it yes were on a small planet orbiting a red dwarf star the year here is only about nine of our days the light of other days is there life the scientists studying this place have found none nor any relics from the past a shame hiram bent and picked up another basalt pebble it cast two shadows on his palm one gray and diffuse from the fat red star ahead of them and another fainter but sharper from the light source behind them what light source david turned there was a double star in the sky brighter than any star or planet seen from earth yet still reduced to pinpricks of light by distance the points of light hurt his eyes and he lifted his hand to shield his face its beautiful he said he turned again and looked up at the constellation he had tentatively identified as cassiopeia that bright ad ditional star tagged onto its end i know where we are the bright stars behind us are the alpha centauri binary pair the nearest bright stars to our sun some four light years away about four point three im told and so this must be a plantet of proxima centauri the nearest star of all somebody has run a wormcam as far as proxima centauri across four light years its incredible well done i told you youre out of touch this is the cutting edge of wormcam technology this power of course the constellations arent changed much four light years is small change on the interstellar scale but that bright intruder up in cassiopeia is sol our sun david stared at the sun just a point of pale yellow light bright but not exceptionally soand yet that spark of light was the source of all life on earth and the sun the earth and all the planets and every place any human had ever visited might have been eclipsed by a grain of sand arthur c clarke and stephen baxter shes pretty mary said bobby didnt reply it really is a window into the past its not so magical bobby said every time you watch a movie youre looking into the past come on she whispered all you can see is what some camera operator or editor chooses to show you and mostly even on a news show the people youre watching know the camera is there now with this you can look at anybody any time anywhere whether a camera is present or not youve watched this scene be fore havent you ive had to why because this is when shes supposed to have com mitted her crime stealing virtualreality secrets from ibm she doesnt look li e shes committing any crime to me that annoyed him what do you expect her to do put on a black mask sorry its okay i know this is difficult why would she do it i know she was working for hiram but she didnt exactly love him oh she loved you he looked away the fbi case is that she wanted to get some credit in hirams eyes then hiram might ac cept her relationship with me that was her motive says the fbi so this at some point she was going to tell him what she had done and you dont believe it mary you dont know kate that just isnt her agenda he smiled believe me if she wants me shell just take me whatever hiram feels but there is evidence against her the techs have crawled all over the equip ment she used they restored deleted files which showed that data about ibm test runs had been present in the memory she used mary gestured at the screen but we can look into the past who cares about computer traces has anybody the light of other days actually seen her open up a big fat file with an ibm logo no but that doesnt prove anything not in the eyes of the prosecution anyway kate knew about the wormcam perhaps she even guessed that it would eventually have pastviewing capabilities and she could be monitored retrospectively so she covered herself mary snorted again shed have to be a devious ge nius to pull off something like that you havent met kate he repeated dryly and anyhow all this is circumstantial is that the right word yes if not for the wormcam shed be out of there by now but she hasnt even come to trial yet the supreme court is working on a new legal framework governing ad missibility of wormcam evidence and meanwhile a lot of casesincluding kateshave been put on hold with an impulsive stab he cleared the screen doesnt this trouble you mary asked now the way they are using the wormcams theyt big corporations watching each other the fbi watching us all i believe kate is innocent but some body here surely spied on ibmwith a wormcam with the certainty of youth she said either everybody should have wormcams or nobody should he said maybe youre right but it isnt going to happen but the stuff you showed me the next generation the squeezedvacuum approach youll have to find somebody else to argue with they sat in silence for a time then she said if had a time viewer id use it all the time but i wouldnt use it to look at shitty stuff over and over id look at nice stuff why dont you look back a bit further to some time when you were happy with her arthur c clarke and stephen baxter somehow that hadnt occurred to him and he re coiled she said well why not because its gone in the past whats the point of looking back if the present is shitty and the future is worse the past is all youve got he frowned her face so like her mothers was pale composed her frank blue eyes steady youre missing your father of course im missing him she said with a spark of anger maybe its different on whatever planet you come from now her look softened i would like to see him just for a while i shouldnt have brought her here he thought maybe later he said gently come on the weathers fine lets go to the sound have you ever been sailing it took him long minutes of persuasion to make her come away and later after a call from david he learned that some of the references and handwritten notes on squeezedvacuum wormholes had gone missing from davids workstation actually it was disney hiram said matteroffact standing there in proxima light in partnership with boeing theyve installed a giant wormcam facility in the old vehicle assembly building at cape canaveral once they assembled moon rockets there now they send spy cameras to the stars quite something isnt it of course they mostly rent out their virtual facility to the scientists but the boeing management let the staff play here during their lunch breaks already theyre peering at every bloody planet and moon in the solar system without leaving the airconditioned warmth of their labs the light of other days and disney is cashing in the moon and mars seem likely to turn into theme parks for virtual wormcam travelers im told the apollo and viking sites are par ticularly popular though the old soviet lunokhods are a competing attraction and david thought no doubt ourworld has a piece of the action hiram smiled youre very quiet david david explored his emotions wonder he supposed but laced with dismay he picked up a handful of rocks lei them fall their slow lowg bounce wasnt quite au thentic this is real i must have read a hundred fic tional dramas a thousand speculative studies about missions to proxima and now here we are it is the dream of a million years to stand here and see this its probably a dream rich enough finally to kill off space flight pity but thats all this is a dream were still in that chilly hangar on the outskirts of seattle by showing us the destination without requiring of us the enervating journey the wormcam will turn us into a planet of couch potatoes you dont think youre being alittle excitable no i do not hiram before the wormcam we de duced the existence of this planet of proxima from min ute displacements of the stars trajectory we calculated what its surface conditions must be like we pored over spectroscopic analyses of its smudged light to see if we could deduce what it was made of we strove to build new generations of telescopes which would give us some map of its surface we even dreamed of building ships which might come here now we have the wormcam and we dont need to deduce anymore to strive to think isnt that a good thing no david snapped it is like a child turning to the answers at the back of an exercise book the point you see is not the answers themselves but the mental de velopment we enjoy through striving for those answers arthur c clarke and stephen baxter the wormcam is going to overwhelm a whole range of sciencesplanetology geology astronomy for gener ations to come our scientists will merely count and clas sify like an eighteenthcentury butterfly collector science will become taxonomy hiram said slyly you forgot history history tom were the one who found out that a wormcam that can reach across four lightyears could just as easily reach four years into the past our grasp in time is puny compared to space but it will surely develop and then all hells going to break loose think about it right now we can reach back days weeks months we can spy on our wives watch our selves on the john the coppers can track and watch crim inals in the act facing your own past self is hard enough but this is nothing personal trivia when we can reach back years youre talking about opening up history and what a can of worms that is going to be some people out there are preparing the ground al ready you must have heard of the days a jesuit project on the orders of the vatican to complete a com prehensive firsthand history of the development of the churchall the way back to christ himself hiram grimaced much of that wont make pretty viewing but the pope is smart better the church should do this first than somebody else even so its going to make chris tianity fall apart like a sandcastle and the other religions will follow are you sure hell yes hirams eyes gleamed in red light didnt bobby expose revelationland as a fraud dreamed up by a criminal actually david thought though bobby helped that was kate manzonis triumph hiram christ was no bil lybob meeks are you sure do you think you could bear to find out could your church bear it the light of other days perhaps not david thought but we must fer vently hope so hiram had been right to drag him out of his monkish academic ceil he realized to see ail this it was wrong of him to hide away to work on the wormcam with no sense of its wider implications he made a resolution to immerse himself in the cams application as well as its theory hiram looked up at the hull of the sun i think its getting colder sometimes it snows here come on he began to work the invisible abort buttons on his helmet david peered up at the splinter of light that was distant sol and imagined his soul returning home flying from this desolate beach up to that primal warmth confabulation bobby found the interview room in the bowels of this aging courthouse deeply depressing the dingy walls looked as if they hadnt been painted since the turn of the century and even then only in governmentissue pale green and it was in this room that kates privacy was to be flayed piece by piece kate and her attorneyan unsmiling overweight womansat on hard plastic chairs behind a scuffed wooden table on which sat an array of recording de vices bobby himself was perched on a hard bench at the back of the room there at kates request the only witness to this strange tableau dive manning the psychologist appointed by the court to kates case was standing at the front of the room tapping at a softscreen fixed to the wall wormcam images dimly lit and suffering a little fish eye distortion flickered as manning sought his starting point at last he found the place he wanted it was a frozen image of kate with a man they were standing in a cluttered living room evidendy in the middle of a heated row screaming at each other manningtall thin bald fiftyishtook off his wire spectacles and tapped the frame against his teeth a man nerism bobby was already finding gratingly irritating the spectacles themselves an antiquated affectation what is human memory manning asked he gazed at the light of other days the air as he spoke as if lecturing an invisible audi enceas perhaps he was it certainly is not a passive recording mechanism like a digital disc or a tape it is more like a storytelling machine sensory information is broken down into shards of perception which are broken down again to be stored as memory fragments and at night as the body rests these fragments are brought out from storage reassembled and replayed each run through etches them deeper into the brains neural struc ture and each time a memory is rehearsed or recalled it is elaborated we may add a little lose a little tinker with the logic fill in sections that have faded perhaps even conflate disparate events in extreme cases we refer to this as confabulation the brain creates and recreates the past producing in the end a version of events that may bear little resem blance to what actually occurred to first order i believe its true to say mat everything i remember is false bobby thought a note of awe entered mannings voice this frightens you kate said wondering id be a fool not to be frightened were all complex flawed creatures kate stumbling around in the dark perhaps our minds little transient bubbles of conscious ness adrift in this overwhelmingly hostile universe need an inflated sense of their own importance of the logic of the universe in order to summon up the will to sur vive but now the wormcam without pity will never again let us evade the truth he was silent for a mo ment then smiled at her perhaps we will al be driven mad by truth or perhaps stripped of illusion at last we will all become sane and i will be out of a job what do you think kate wearing a drab black onepiece sat with her hands tucked between her thighs her shoulders hunched i think you should get on with your showandtell manning sighed and replaced his glasses he tapped arthur c clarke and stephen baxter the screens comer and the fragment of kates van ished life began to play itself out onscreen kate hurled something at the guy he ducked it splashed against the wall what was that a peach as i recall kate said it was a kumquat a little overripe good choice manning murmured you need to work on your aim however asshole youre still seeing her arent you whats it to do with you its got everything to do with me you piece of shit why you think im going to put up with this i dont know the man on the screen was called kingsley bobby had teamed he and kate had been lovers for several years and had lived with each other for threeup to this point the moment at which kate had finally thrown him out watching was difficult for bobby he felt he was par ticipating in voyeurism of this younger different woman who hadnt at the time even known he existed events of which shed told him nothing and like most wormcamrecorded slices of life it was hard to follow the conversation illogical meandering and repetitive the words designed to express their users emotions rather than to progress the encounter in any rational way a century and more of scripted tv and cinema had been poor training for the reality of the wormcam but mis reallife drama was typical of life messy unstruc tured confusing the participants groping like people in a darkened room toward an understanding of what was happening to them how they were feeling the action shifted from the living room to a cata strophically untidy bedroom now kingsley was cram ming clothes into a leather bag and kate was grabbing the light of other days more of his stuff and throwing it out of the room all the time they maintained a screaming dialogue at last kingsley stormed out of the apartment kate slammed the door shut behind him she stood rigid for a moment staring at the closed door before burying her face in her hands manning reached over and tapped the screen the image froze on a closeup of kates face hidden by her hands tears visibly leaking between her fingers her hair a tangle around her forehead the whole surrounded by a faint fisheyedistortion halo manning said i believe this incident is the key to your story kate the story of your life of who you are the real kate bleak and subdued stared at her younger self woodenly i was framed she said evenly over the ibm espionage it was subtle beyond the reach even of the wormcam but its nevertheless true and mats what we should be focusing on not this bar room psychoanalysis manning drew back thats as may be but eviden tiary issues are beyond my competence the judge has asked me to come up with a framework for your state of mind at the time of the crime itself motive and intent a deeper truth than even the wormcam can offer us and he said with a trace of steel lets remind our selves that you dont have any choice but to cooperate but that doesnt alter my opinion she said what opinion that like every shrink ive ever met you are one inhuman asshole the attorney touched kates arm but kate shook her off mannings eyes glittered hard behind his spectacles bobby realized manning was going to enjoy exerting power over this willful woman manning turned to his softscreen and ran through the brief breakup scene again let me recall what you told me about this period in your life youd been living with kingsley roman for some three years when you decided arthur cclarke and stephen baxter to try for a baby you suffered a late miscarriage im sure you enjoyed watching that kate said bleakly please manning said pained you seem to have decided with kingsley that you would try again we never decided that we didnt discuss it in that way manning blinked owlishly at a notepad but you did february is the clearest example can show you if you like he looked up at her over his glasses dont be alarmed if your memory differs from the wormcam record its common in fact id go so far as to say its normal confabulation remember shall i go on despite your stated decision you dont conceive in fact you return to the regular use of contraceptives so that conception is impossible anyhow six months after the miscarriage kingsley begins his affair with a col league at his place of work a woman called jodie mor ris and a few months after that he is careless enough to let you find out about it he studied her again do you remember what you told me about that kate said reluctantly i told you the truth i think kingsley decided on some level that the baby was my fault and so he started looking around and besides after the miscarriage work was starting to take off for me the wormwood i think kingsley was jealous and so he started to seek the attention he craved from somebody else something like that when i found out i threw him out he claims he left then hes a lying asshole but we just saw the incident manning said gently i didnt see any evidence of clear decisionmaking of unilateral action by either of you it doesnt matter what the wormcam shows i know what is true the light of other days manning nodded im not denying that youre telling us the troth as you see it kate he smiled at her owl ish looming you arent lying that isnt the problem at all dont you see kate gazed at her caged hands they took a break bobby wasnt allowed to be with her kates treatment was one of many experiments being run as the politicians legal experts pressure groups and concerned citizens worked feverishly to find a way to accommodate the wormcams eerie historical reach still not widely known to the publicinto something resembling the existing due process of the law and even more challenging into natural justice in essence it had suddenly become radically easier to establish physical truth the conduct of court cases seemed likely to be trans formed radically trials would surely become much less adversarial fairer much less dependent on the demeanor of a suspect in court or the quality of her representatives when the wormcam was available at federal state and county levels some commentators were anticipating sav ings of billions of dollars annually there would be shorter trials more plea bargains more civil settlements and major trials in future would perhaps focus on what remained beyond the bare facts motive and in tenthence the assignment of a psychologist like man ning to kates case meanwhile as wormcamanned law enforcers went to diligent work over unresolved cases a huge logjam of new cases was heading for the courts some con gressmen had proposed that to maximize the clearup rate a general amnesty should be declared for crimes of lesser severity committed up to the last full calendar year before the wormcams inventionan amnesty that is in return for waiving of fifth amendment protection in arthur c clarke and stephen baxter the relevant case in fact evidence gathering was made so much more powerful thanks to die wormcam that fifth amendment rights had become moot anyhow but this was proving highly contentious most americans did not appear to feel comfortable with losing fifth pro tection challenges to privacy were even more contentious made so by the fact that even now there was no accepted definition of privacy rights even within america privacy was not mentioned in the constitution the fourth amendment to the bill of rights spoke of a right against intrusion by the statebut it left a great deal of room for maneuver by those in authority who wished to investigate citizens and besides offered citizens virtually no protection against other bodies such as corporations or the press or even other citizens from a welter of scattershot laws at state and federal levels as well as a mass of cases in common law to provide precedent a certain common acceptance of the meaning of privacy had slowly emerged for instance a right to be let alone to be free from unreasonable interference from outside forces but all of this was challenged by the wormcam legal safeguards surrounding wormcam use were be ing promoted by lawenforcement and investigation agencies like the fbi and the police as a compensating balance to the loss of privacy and other rights for ex ample wormcam records intended for legal purposes would have to be collected in controlled circumstances probably by trained observers and notarized formally that wasnt likely to prove a problem as any wormcam observation could always be repeated as many times as required simply by setting up a new wormhole link to the incident in question there were even suggestions that people should be prepared to submit to a form of documented life this would effectively grant the authorities legal access to any incident in an individuals past without the need for the light of other days formal procedures in advanceand it would also be a strong shield against false accusation and identity theft but despite protests from campaigners against the ero sion of rights everybody seemed to accept that as far as its use in criminal investigation and prosecution was concerned the wormcam was here to stay it was sim ply too powerful to ignore some philosophers argued that this was no bad thing after all humans had evolved to live in small groups in which everybody knew everybody else and strangers were rarely encountered it was only recently in evolu tionary terms that people had been forced to live in larger communities like cities crammed together with friends and strangers alike the wormcam was bringing a return to older ways of living of thinking about other people and interacting with them but that was little comfort for those who feared that their perceived need for curtilagea defined space within which they could achieve solitude anonymity reserve and intimacy with loved onesmight no longer be met and now as the wormcam s historyview facilities deepened even the past was no refuge many people had been hurt in one way or another by the revelation of the truth many of them blamed not the truth or themselves but the wormcam and those who had inflicted it on the world hiram himself remained the most obvious target at first bobby suspected he had almost enjoyed his notoriety any celebrity was good for business but the hail of threats and assassination and sabotage attempts had worn him down there were even libel actions as people claimed hiram must somehow be fabricating what the wormcam was showing about themselves their loved ones their enemies or their heroes hiram had taken to living in the light his west coast mansion was drenched in light from floods powered by multiple generators he even slept in brilliant illumina arthur c clarke and stephen baxter tion no security system was foolproof but at least hiram could ensure that anybody who got through would be visible to the wormcams of the future so hiram lived skewered by pitiless light alone scrutinized loathed the gruesome procedure resumed manning consulted his notebook let me set out some of the facts incontrovertible historical truths all properly observed and notarized first kingsleys affair with ms morris wasnt his first in his time with you he had a short apparently unsatisfactory fling with an other woman beginning a month after he met you and another six months later no in all he seems to have had six consummated rela tionships with other women before you challenged him over jodie he smiled if its any consolation hes also cheated on other partners before and since he seems to be something of a serial adulterer this is ridiculous id have known but youre also human i can show you incidents where evidence of kingsleys unfaithfulness was clearly available to you yet you turned aside rationalizing it away without even being aware of what you were doing confabulation she said coldly ive told you how it was kingsley started to cheat on me because the miscarriage screwed up our relationship ah the miscarriage the great causal event in your life but im afraid it wasnt like that at all kingsleys behavior patterns were well established long before he met you and were barely altered by the miscarriage in cident youve also said that you believe the miscarriage gave you a spur to working harder at developing your own career yes thats obvious the light of other days this is a little more difficult to establish but again i can demonstrate to you that the upward trajectory of your career began some months before the miscarriage again you were doing it anyhow the miscarriage didnt really change anything he studied her kate youve constructed a kind of story around the miscarriage youve wanted to believe that it was significant beyond itself the miscarriage was a horrible trial for you to endure but it actually changed very little i sense you dont believe me she said nothing manning steepled his fingers and put them to his chin i think youve been both right and wrong about your self i think that the miscarriage you suffered did change your life but not in the rather superficial way you think it did it didnt make you work harder or cause cracks in your relationship with kingsley but the loss of your child did wound you deeply and i think youre now driven by a fear that it might happen again a fear please believe im not judging you im merely try ing to explain your compensatory activity is your work perhaps this deeper fear has driven you to greater achievement greater success but youve also become obsessive it has only been your work that has distracted you from what you see as a terrible darkness at the cen ter of your being and so youre driven to ever greater lengths right and thats why i used hirams wormholes to spy on his competitors she shook her head how much do they pay you for this stuff doctor manning paced slowly before his softscreen kate youre one of the first human beings to endure this umm this truth shockbut you wont be the last we are all going to have to learn to live without the com forting lies we whisper to ourselves in the darkness of our minds im capable of forming relationships even long arthur c clarke and stephen baxter lasting stable ones how does that square with your por trait of me as a shock trauma victim manning frowned as if puzzled by the question you mean mr patterson but theres no contradiction there he walked over to bobby and with a murmured apol ogy studied him in many ways bobby patterson is one of the most childlike adults i have ever encountered he is therefore an exact fit for the umm the child shaped hole at the center of your personality he turned to kate you see she stared at him her color high the water war heather sat at her home softscreen she entered fresh search parameters country uzbekistan town nukus she wasnt surprised to see an attractive turquoise blockout appear before her nukus was after all a war zone but that wouldnt stop heather for long she had found reason in her time to find ways past censoring software before and having access to a wormcam of her own was a powerful motivation smiling she went to work whenafter much public pressurethe first enterpris ing companies started offering wormcam access to pri vate citizens via the internet heather mays was quick to subscribe she could even work from home from a straightfor ward menu she selected a location to view this could be anywhere in the world specified by geographical co ordinates or postal address as precisely as she could nar row it down the mediating software would convert her request to latitudelongitude coordinates and would of fer her further options the idea was to narrow her se lection down until she had reached a specification of a roomsized volume somewhere on or near the surface arthur c clarke and stephen baxter of the earth where a wormhole mouth would be estab lished there was also a randomizing feature if she had no preference for instance if she wanted to view some re mote picturepostcard coral atoll but didnt care which she could evenat additional costselect intermediate views so for example she could view a street and select a house to call at when shed made her choice a wormhole would be opened up between the suppliers central server location and the site of her choice images from the wormcam would then be sent direct to her home terminal she could even guide the viewpoint within a limited volume the wormcams commercial interface made it feel like a toy and every image was indelibly marked by intrusive ourworld logos and ads but heather knew that intrinsically the wormcam was much more pow erful than it appeared in this first public incarnation when shedfirst mastered the system she was inor dinately pleased and called mary to come see look she said pointing the cam image was of a nondescript house in evening summer sunlight the image frame was plastered with annoying ad logos thats the house where i was bom in boise idaho in that very room in fact mary shrugged are you going to give me a turn sure in fact i got it for you in part your homework assignments yeah yeah listen this isnt a toy abruptly the screen filled up with a soothingcolor biockout mary frowned whats wrong oh i get it it comes with a nanny filter so were still only seeing what they will allow us to see the idea was that the wormcams couldnt be used voyeuristically to spy on people in their homes or other private places or to breach corporate confidentiality or to view government buildings military establishments the light of other days police stations and other sensitive places the nanny software was also supposed to monitor patterns of usage and in case of morbid or excessive behavior to break the service and offer counseling either by expert system or a human agent and for now only the remoteviewing facilities of the wormcam had been made available pastviewing was considered by a whole slew of experts to be much too dangerous to be put in the hands of the publicin fact it was argued it would be dangerous even to make the existence of the pastviewer facility widely known but of course all this cottonwool wrapping would only be as effective as the ingenuity of the human de signers behind it and already fueled by internet rumor and industry leaks and speculation clamor was rising for much wider public access to the wormcams full power to the pastviewers themselves heather sensed that this new technology was by its very nature going to be difficult to contain but that wasnt something she was about to share with her fifteenyearold daughter heather cleared down the wormhole and prepared to start a new search i need to work go you can play later one hour only with a look of contempt mary walked out and heather returned her attention to uzbekistan anna petersen usnheroine of a by wormcam docusoaphad been heavily involved in the usled un intervention in the water war raging in the aral sea area a precision war was being fought by the allies against the principal aggressor uzbekistan an aggres sion which had threatened western interests in oil and sulphur deposits and various mineral production sites including a major copper source bright and technical anna had mostly worked on command control and com munications operations arthur c clarke and stephen baxter wonncam technology was changing the nature of warfare as it had much else wormcams had already largely replaced the complex of surveillance technol ogysatellites monitoring aircraft and landbased sta tionswhich had governed battlefields for decades if there had been eyes capable of seeing every major target in uzbekistan would have sparkled with evanescent wormhole mouths precisionguided bombs cruise mis siles and other weapons many of them no larger than birds had rained down on uzbek airdefense centers military command and control facilities on bunkers con cealing troops and tanks on hydroelectric plants and nat ural gas pipelines and on targets in the cities such as samarkand andizhan namangan and the capital tash kent the precision was unprecedentedand for the first time in such operations success could be verified of course for now the allied troops had the upper hand in wonncam deployment but future wars would have to be fought under the assumption that both sides had perfect and uptodate information on the strategy resources and deployment of the other heather supposed it was too much to hope that such a change in the nature of war might lead to its cessation altogether but at least it was giving the warriors pause for thought and might lead to less meaningless waste anyhow this warannas war the cold battle of in formation and technologywas the war which the american public had witnessed partly thanks to the wonncam viewpoint heather herself had operated fly ing alongside petersens shapely shoulder as she moved from one clinical bloodless scenario to another but there had been rumorsmostly circulating in the comers of the internet that still remained uncontrolled of another more primitive war proceeding on the ground as troops went in to secure the gains made by the air strikes then a report had been released by an english news the light of other days channel of a prison camp in the field where un cap tives including americans were being held by the uz beks there were also rumors that female prisoners including allied troops had been taken to rape camps and forced brothels deeper in the countryside revealing all of this clearly served the purposes of the governments behind the antiuzbek alliance the juarez administrations spin doctors werent above highlight ing the distressing idea of wholesome anna from iowa in the hands of swarthy uzbek molesters to heather this was evidence of a dirty groundlevel conflict far removed from the clean video game in which anna petersen had colluded heathers hackles had risen at the idea that she might be playing a part in some vast propaganda machine but when she sought permission from her employer earth news online to seek out the truth of the war she was refused access to the corporate wonncam facility would be withdrawn if she attempted it while she was in the hiramsexwife spotlight she had to keep her head down but then the glaring focus publicattention moved on from the maysesand she was able to afford her own wonncam access she quit from eno took a new bill paying job on a wonncam biography of abraham lin coln and went to work it took her a couple of days to find what she was looking for she followed uzbek prisoners being loaded onto an open un truck and driven away through the rain they passed through the town of nukus controlled by allied troops and on into the country beyond here she found the allied troops had established a prison camp of their own it was an abandoned ironmining complex the pris oners were held in metal cages stacked up in an ore arthur c clarke and stephen baxter loader just a meter high the prisoners were unable to straighten their legs or backs they were held without sanitation adequate food exercise or access to the red cross or its muslim equivalent merhamet filth dripped from cages above through the grates to those below she estimated there must be at least a thousand men here they were given only a cup of weak soup a day hepatitis was epidemic and other diseases were spread ing every other day prisoners were selected apparently at random and taken out for heatings three or four soldiers would surround each prisoner and would beat him with iron bars wooden twobyfours truncheons after a time the beating would stop any prisoner who could walk would be thrown back for further treatment and the beating continued they would be carried back to their cages by other prisoners that was the general pattern there were some partic ular incidents inflicted on the prisoners almost in a spirit of experimentation by the guards a prisoner was not allowed to defecate a prisoner was forced to eat sand another was forced to swallow his own feces six people died while heather monitored the camp the deaths were as a result of the bearings exposure or disease occasionally a prisoner would be shot for ex ample when attempting to escape or fight back one pris oner was actually released apparently to take the news of the determination of these bluehelmeted troops to his comrades heather noticed that the guards were careful to use only captured weaponry as if they were determined to leave no unambiguous trace of their activities evidently she thought the power of the wormcam had not yet impinged on the imaginations of these soldiers they werent yet used to the idea that they could be watched any place any time even retrospectively from the future it was almost impossible to watch these bloody deeds the light of other days which would have been invisible to the public anyhow only a few months before this would be dynamite up the ass of president juarez who in heathers opinion had already proven herself to be the worst sleazebag to pollute the white house since the turn of the century which was saying somethingand not to mention as the first female president a major embarrassment to half the population and maybeheather allowed herself to hopethe mass consciousness would stir once more when people saw war as it truly was in all its bloody glory as they had briefly glimpsed it when vietnam had become the first television war and before the commanders had rees tablished control over media coverage she even cradled hopes that the approach of the wormwood would change the way people felt about each other if everything was to end just a handful of generations away what did ancient enmities matter and was the purpose of the remaining time the remaining days of human existence to inflict pain and suffering on others there would still be just wars surely but it would no longer be possible to dehumanize and demonize an opponentnot when anybody could tap a softscreen and see for themselves the citizens of whichever nation was considered the enemyand there could be no more warmongering lies about the capability intent and re solve of an opponent if the culture of secrecy was fi nally broken no government would get away with acts like this ever again or maybe she was just being an idealist she pressed on determined motivated but no matter how hard she tried to be objective she found these scenes unbearably harrowing the sight of naked wretched men writhing in agony at the feet of bluehelmet soldiers with clean hard american faces arthur c clarke and stephen baxter she took a break she slept a while bathed then pre pared herself a meal she knew she wasnt the only citizen putting the new facilities to use like this all around the country shed heard truth squads were forming up using wormcam and internet some of the squads were no more than neighborhood watch schemes but one organization called copwatch was disseminat ing instructions on how to shadow police at work in order to provide a fair witness to a cops every activ ity already it was said this new accountability was having a marked effect on the quality of policing thug gish and corrupt officersthankfully rare anyhow were being exposed almost immediately consumer groups had suddenly gained power and were daily exposing scams and con artists in most states detailed breakdowns of campaign finance infor mation were being posted in some cases for the first time there was a lot of focus on the pentagons more obscure activities and its dark budget and so on heather relished the idea of concerned private citi zens armed with wormcam and suspicion clustering around the corrupt and criminal like white blood cells in her mind there was a simple causal chain lying behind fundamental liberties increased openness ensured ac countability which in turn maintained freedom and now a technological miracleor accidentseemed to be delivering the most profound tool for open disclosure imaginable into the hands of private citizens jefferson and franklin would probably have loved it even if it would have meant the sacrifice of their own privacy there was noise in her study a muffled giggling heather barefoot crept to the halfopen door mary and a friend were sitting at heathers desk look at that jerk mary was saying his hand keeps supping off the end heather recognized the friend sasha from the class the light of other days above marys at high school was known among the lo cal parents mafia as a bad influence the air was thick with the smoke from a spliffpresumably one of heathers own store the wormcam image was of a teenage boy heather recognized him too as one of the boys from school jack jacques he was in his bedroom his pants were around his ankles and before a softscreen with more enthusiasm than competence he was masturbating she said quietly congratulations so you hacked your way through the nanny both mary and sasha jumped startled sasha waved fatilely at the cloud of marijuana smoke mary turned back to the screen why not you did i did it for a valid reason so its all right for you but not for me youre such a hypocrite mom sasha stood up im out of here yes you are heather snapped after her retreating back mary is this you spying on your neighbors like some sleazy voyeur v what else is there to do adnnt it mom youre getting a little moist yourself get out of here marys laugh turned to a theatric sneer and she walked out heather shaken sat before the screen and studied the boy the softscreen he was staring at showed an other wormcam view there was a girl in the image naked also masturbating but smiling mouthing words at the boy heather wondered how many more watchers this cou ple had maybe they hadnt thought of that a wormcam couldnt be tapped but it was difficult to remember that the wormcam meant global access for everybodyany body could be watching these kids at play she was prepared to bet that in these first months arthur c clarke and stephen baxter ninetynine percent of wonncam use would be for this kind of crude voyeurism maybe it was like the sudden accessibility of pom made possible by the internet at home without the need to enter some sleazy store everybody always wanted to be a voyeur anyhowso the argument wentand now we can do it without risk of being caught at least that was how it felt the truth was that any body could be watching the watchers too just as any body could have watched mary and sasha two cute teenage girls getting pteasurably homy and maybe there was even a community who might derive some pleasure from watching her a dryasa stick middleaged woman gazing analytically at this foolish stuff maybe some of the commentators said it was the chance of voyeurism that was driving the early sales of this home wonncam access and even its technological developmentjust as pom providers had pushed the early development of internet facilities heather would have liked to believe her fellow humans were a little deeper than that but maybe once again she was just being an idealist and after all not all the voyeurism was for titillation every day there were news lines about people who had for one reason or another spied on those close to them and discovered secrets and betrayals and creeping foul ness causing a rush of divorces domestic violence su icides minor wars between friends spouses siblings children and their parents a lot of crap to be worked out of a lot of relationships she supposed before everybody grew up a little and got used to the idea of glasswall openness she noticed that the boy had a spectacular cassini spaceprobe image of saturns rings on his bedroom wall of course he was ignoring it he was much more inter ested in his dick heather remembered how her own mothergod nearly fifty years backwould tell her of the kind of future she had grown up with in more ex the light of other days pansive optimistic years by the year her mother used to say nuclearpowered spacecraft would be plying between the colonized planets bearing water and pre cious minerals mined from asteroids perhaps the first interstellar probe would already have been launched and so on perhaps teenagers in that world might have been dis tracted from each others body partsat least some of the timeby the spectacle of the explorers in marss valles marineris or mercurys great caloris basin or the shifting ice fields of europa but she thought in our world were still stuck here on earth and even the future seems to end in a black hurtling wall of rock and all we want to do is spy on each other she shut down the wormhole link and added new se curity protocols to her terminal it wouldnt keep mary out forever but it would slow her down a little that doneexhausted depressedshe returned to work the debunk machine david and heather sat before a flickering softscreen their faces illuminated by the harsh sunlight of a day long gone he was a private a soldier of the first maryland infantry he was one of a line which stretched into the distance muskets raised a drumbeat was audible steady and ominous they hadnt yet learned his name his face was begrimed smeared by sweat his uniform filthy rainstained and heavily patched he was becom ing visibly more nervous as he approached the front smoke covered the lines in the distance but already david and heather could hear the crackle of small arms the booming of cannon their soldier passed a field hospital now tents set up at the center of a muddy field there were rows of un moving bodies uncovered lying outside the nearest tent andsomehow more horrifica pile of severed arms and legs some still bearing scraps of cloth two men were feeding the limbs into a brazier the cries of the wounded within the tents were scratchy remote agoniz ing the soldier dug into his jacket and produced a pack of playing cards battered and bound up with string and a photograph david working the wormcam controls froze the im age and zoomed in on the little photograph much the light of other days thumbed its image a crude blackandwhite graininess its a woman he said slowly and that looks like a donkey and oh heather was smiling hes afraid he thinks he might not live through the day he doesnt want that stuff sent home with his personal effects david resumed the sequence the soldier dropped his possessions into the mud and ground them in with his heel heather said listen whats he singing david adjusted the volume and frequency filters the privates accent was remarkably broad but the words were recognizable into the ward of the clean white washed halls where the dead slept and the dying lay wounded by bayonets sabers and balls somebodys darling was borne one day a mounted officer came by behind the line his black sweating horse visibly nervous close up dress there close up his accent was stiff alien to davids ear there was an explosion flying earth the bodies of soldiers seemed simply to burst into large bloody frag ments david recoiled it had been a shell suddenly star tlingly quickly war was here the noise level rose abruptly there was cheering swearing a rattle of riflemuskets and pistols the pri vate raised his musket fired rapidly and dug another cartridge from his belt he bit into it exposing the pow der and ball and particles of black powder clung to his lips heather murmured they say the powder tasted like pepper another shell landed near the wheel of an artillery piece a horse close to the gun seemed to explode bloody scraps flying a man walking alongside fell and he looked down in apparent surprise at the stump which now terminated his leg all around the private now there was horror smoke arthur c clarke and stephen baxter fire mutilated bodies many men littered on the ground writhing but he seemed to be growing more calm he continued to advance david said i dont understand hes in the middle of a mass slaughter wouldnt it be rational to retreat to hide heather said he may not even understand what the war is about soldiers often dont right now hes re sponsible for himself his destiny is in his own hands perhaps he feels relief that the moment has come and he has his reputation esteem from his buddies its a form of madness david said of course it is they didnt hear the musket ball coming it passed through one eye socket and out the back of the privates head taking a palmsized chunk of skull with it david could see matter within red and gray the private stood there a few seconds more still bear ing his weaponbut his body was shaking his legs con vulsing then he fell in a heap another soldier dropped his musket and got to his knees beside him he lifted the privates head gently and seemed to be trying to tuck his brain back into his shattered skull david tapped his control the softscreen went blank he ripped his headphones from his ears for a moment he sat still letting the images and sounds of the gruesome civil war battlefield fade from his head to be replaced by the composed scientific calm of the wormworks the subdued murmur of the researchers in rows of similar cubicles all around them people toiled at dim wormcam images tapping at softscreens listening to the mutter of ancient voices in headphones making notes on yellow legal pads most had gained admittance by submitting research proposals which were screened by a committee david had established and then the light of other days selected by lottery others had been brought in as guests of hirams like heather and her daughter they were journalists researchers academics seeking to resolve historical disputes and specialinterest typesincluding a few conspiracy theoristswith points to prove somewhere somebody was softly whistling a nursery rhyme the melody made an odd counterpoint to the horrors still rattling around davids headbut he knew the significance immediately one of the more enthusi astic researchers here had been determined to uncover the simple tune said to have formed the basis of edward elgars enigma variations many candidates had been proposed from negro spirituals and forgotten musichall hits to twinkle twinkle little star now though it sounded as if the researcher had uncovered the truth and david let his mind supply the words to the gentle melody mary had a little lamb the researchers had been drawn here because our world was still far ahead of the competition in the power of its wormcam technology the depth of the past acces sible to modem scrutiny was increasing all the time some researchers had already reached as far back as three cen turies but for nowfor better or worsethe use of the powerful pastviewer wormcams remained tightly con trolled offered only in facilities like this where its users were screened and prioritized and monitored their results edited carefully and given interpretative glosses before public release but david knew that no matter how far back he looked whatever he witnessed however the images were analyzed and discussed the fifteen minutes of the war between the states he had just endured would stay with him forever heather touched his arm you dont have a very strong stomach do you weve only scratched the sur face of this warbarely begun to study the past but it is a vast banal butchery of course isnt it always in fact the civil war was arthur c clarke and stephen baxter one of the first truly modem wars more than six hun dred thousand dead nearly half a million wounded in a country whose population was only thirty million its as if today we lost five million it was a peculiarly american triumph for such a young country to stage such a vast conflict but it was just heather was working on the civil war period as part of her research for the first wbrmcamcompiled truebio of abraham lincoln funded by an historical association will that be your conclusion after all the war led to the eradication of slavery in the united states but that wasnt what the war was about were about to lose our romantic illusions about itto confront the truth that the braver historians have faced all along the war was a clash of economic interests north against south the slaves were an economic asset worth billions of dollars and it was a bloody affair erupting out of a classridden unequal society troops from gettysburg were sent to new york to put down antidraft riots lin coln jailed around thirty thousand political prisoners without trial david whistled you think lincolns reputation can survive our seeing all that he began to set up a new run she shrugged lincoln remains an impressive figure even though he wasnt gay that jolted david what are you sure she smiled not even bi from the neighboring cubicle he could hear a faint sound of highpitched screaming heather smiled at him tiredly mary shes watching the beatles again the beatles heather listened for a moment the top ten club in hamburg april probably legendary perform ances where the beatles are thought to have played bet ter than they ever did again never filmed and so of the light of other days course never seen again until now mary is working her way through the performances night after night of them umm how are things between you she glanced at the partition spoke in a subdued whis per im worried that our relationship is heading for a fullscale breakdown david i dont know what she does half the time where she goes who she meets all i get is her anger it was only the bribe of using an ourworld wormcam that brought her here today aside from the beatles i dont even know what shes using it for he hesitated im somewhat dubious about the ethics of what im offering butwould you like me to find out she frowned and pushed greying hair out of her eyes can you do that ill talk to her the softscreen image stabilized the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here lincolns audiencein their stiff top hats and black coats almost all of them malelooked unutterably alien david thought and lincoln himself towered above them so tall and spare he seemed almost gro tesque his voice an irritatingly high nasal whine and yet and yet he said his words still have the power to move yes heather said i think lincoln will survive the truebio process he was complex ambiguous never straightforward he told audiences what they wanted to hearsometimes proabolition sometimes not he cer tainly wasnt the abe of the legend old abe honest abe father abe but he was living in difficult times he came through a hellish war by turning it into a cru sade if not for abe who knows if the nation could have survived arthur c clarkeand stephen baxter and he wasnt gay nope what about the joshua speed diary a clever forgery put together after lincolns death by the ring of confederate sympathizers who were be hind his assassination alt designed to blacken his char acter even after theyd taken his life abraham lincolns sexuality had come under scrutiny following the discovery of a diary supposedly written by joshua speed a merchant in springfield illinois with whom lincoln as a young impoverished lawyer had lodged for some years although both speed and lincoln had later marriedand in fact both had reputations as womanizersrumors had developed that they had lived as gay lovers in the difficult opening years of the twentyfirst cen tury lincoln had been reborn as a figure of toleration and broad appealpink lincoln a divided hero for a divided age at easter the th anniversary of lincolns assassination this had climaxed in an openair celebration around the lincoln memorial in washington dc for a single night the great stone figure had been bathed in gaudy pink spotlights i have notarized wormcam records to prove it heather said now ive had expert systems fastforward through lincolns every sexual encounter theres not a single trace of gay or bi behavior in there but speed he and lincoln shared a bed those years in illinois but that wasnt uncommon back thenlincoln couldnt afford a bed of his own david scratched his head this he said is going to annoy everybody she said you know were going to have to get used to this no more heroes no more fairy tales successful leaders are pragmatic almost every choice they make is between bad options the wisest of them like lincoln the light of other days pick out the least worst consistently and thats about all you can ask of them david nodded perhaps but you americans are lucky that you are already running out of history we europeans have thousands more years left to witness they fell silent and gazed at the stiff images of lin coln and his audience the tinny voices the rustle of applause from men long dead hindsight after six months kates case was still held up bobby put in calls every few days to see fbi special agent michael mavens mavens steadfastly re fused to see him then abruptly to bobbys surprise mavens invited bobby to come out to fbi headquarters in washington dc bobby hastily arranged a flight he found mavens in his office a small anonymous box windowless and stuffy mavens was sitting behind his littered deskfeet propped up on a pile of file boxes jacket off tie loosewatching a news show on a small softscreen he waved bobby silent the piece was about the extension of the scope of citizens truth squad activities to the murkier comers of the past now thatin response to a powerful and im mediate clamorpastviewing wormcam facilities had at last been made available for private use in the midst of poring over each others grubby past in between staring at their own younger selves in awe or amazement or shame people had been turning the wormcams unforgiving gaze on the rich and powerful there had been a whole new spate of resignations from public office and prominent organizations and corpora tions as various past crimes were disinterred a whole series of old outrages were being turned over the coals the light of other days of the old scandal of the tobacco companies knowledge of indeed manipulation of the addictive and toxic ef fects of their products were being raked once more the involvement and profitmaking of the worlds larger companies in nazi germanymany of them still oper ating some of them americanhad been even more extensive than imagined the justification that de nazification had been left incomplete in order to assist economic recovery after the war looked at this remove dubious most computer manufacturers had indeed made inadequate provisions to shield their customers when microwavefrequency microchips had come on the mar ket in the first decade of the century leading to a rash of cancers bobby said so much for the scare predictions of how we ordinary folk wouldnt be mature enough to handle a technology as powerful as the past viewer all this seems pretty responsible to me mavens grunted maybe although were all using wormcams for the sleazy stuff too at least these cru sading citizen types arent just beating up on the gov ernment i always thought the bigcorporations were a bigger threat to freedom than anything we were likely to do in fact we in government were the ones holding them in check bobby smiled weourworldwere caught by the microwave row the compensation claims are still being assessed everybodys apologizing to everybody else what a world bobby i got to tell you i still dont think we can achieve much progress on ms manzonis case but we can talk about it if you like mavens looked ex hausted his eyes blackrimmed as if he hadnt been sleeping if theres no progress why am i here mavens looked unhappy uncomfortable somehow out of place he had lost the brave youthful certainty bobby remembered about him because i have time on arthur c clarke and stephen baxter my hands all of a sudden im not suspended in case youre thinking that call it a sabbatical one of my old cases has been under review he eyed bobby and what i want you to see what your wormcam is really doing to us just one rime one example you remember the wilson murder wilson new york city a couple of years ago a young teen ager from bangladeshhed been orphaned by the floods in i remember the un placement agency found this particular re locate called mian sharif an adoptive home in new york a middleaged childless couple whod taken one adopted kid beforea girl barbaraand brought her up successfully apparently the story looked simple mian is killed at home mu tilated before and after death apparently raped the fa ther was the prime suspect he grimaced family members always are i worked on the case the forensics were ambiguous and wilsons mind maps showed no particular propen sity to violence sexual or otherwise but we had enough to convict the man philip george wilson was executed by lethal injection on november but now because of the demand on wormcam time for new and unresolved cases the review of closed cases like wilson has been a low priority but now the public have gotten online to the wormcams they are looking for themselves and they are starting to agitate for some old cases to be reopened friends family even the convicted themselves and now the wilson case yeah mavens smiled thinly maybe you can un derstand how im feeling you see before the wormcam i could never be sure what the truth is in the light of other days any given case no witness is a hundred percent reliable the perps know how to lie through forensics i couldnt know what happened unless i was there wilson was the first convicted criminal to be exe cuted because of my work i knew id done the best i could to establish the truth but now years after the event ive been able to see wilsons alleged crime for the first time and i found out the truth about the man i sent to the needle are you sure you ought to show me it will be in the public domain soon enough ma vens twisted the softscreen around so bobby could see and began to dial up a recording the screen cleared to show a bedroom there was a wide bed a wardrobe and cupboards animated posters of rock and sports stars and movie icons on the wall a boy lay facedown on the bed slim dressed in tshirt and jeans he was propped up on his elbows over books and a primarycolor softscreen sucking a pencil he was dark his hair a rich black mass bobby said thats mian yeah bright kid lived quietlyworked hard hes doing his homework shakespeare as it happens aged thirteen though i guess he looks a little younger well he wont get any older tell me if you want to stop this bobby nodded curtly resolved to see this through this was a test he thought a test of his new humanity the door opened outward admitting a burly middle aged man here comes the father philip george wil son wilson was carrying a soda bottle he opened it and set it down on a bedside table the boy looked around and said a few words mavens said we know what they said what are you working on what time does mom get home blah blah nothing consequential just an ordinary exchange wilson ruffled the boys hair and left the room mian smoothed back his hair and went back to work arthur c clarke and stephen baxter mavens froze the image the boy turned to a statue his image flickering slightly let me tell you what we thought happened nextas we reconstructed it back in wilson comes back into the room he makes some kind of pass at the boy the boy rebuffs him so wilson attacks him maybe the boy fights back if so he didnt do wilson any damage wilson has a knifewhich in cidentally we dont find he cuts and rips at the kids clothes he mutilates him after he kills the boy by cutting his throat he may have performed sex on the body or he may have masturbated we find flecks of wilsons semen on the body and then cradling the body covered in blood he yells at the search engine youre kidding mavens shrugged people act in strange ways the facts are that there was no way in or out of the apartment save for locked windows and doors none of which were forced the hallway security cams showed nothing we had no suspects save for wilson and a lot of evidence against him he never denied what he did i think maybe he believed himself that he really had done it even though he had no memory of it our experts were split we have psychoanalysts who say wilsons knowledge of his appalling act was too much for his ego to bear so he repressed it came oul of the episode returned to something like normal then we have cynics who say hes lying that he knew exactly what he was doing when he realized he couldnt get away with the crime he feigned mental problems to se cure a softer sentence and we have neurologists who say he probably suffers from a form of epilepsy bobby prompted but now we have the truth yes now the truth mavens tapped the softscreen and the recording resumed there was an airconditioning grille in the corner of the bedroom it popped open the boy mian got to his the light of other days feet quickly looking startled and backed into a corner he didnt call out at this point mavens said softly if he had now a figure crawled out through the open grille it was a girl dressed in a tightfitting spandex ski suit she looked sixteen might have been older she was holding a knife mavens froze the image again bobby frowned who the hell is that the wilsons first adopted daughter shes called barbarayou remember i mentioned her here she was eighteen years old and shed been living away from home a couple of years but she still had the security code to get into the building yeah she came in disguise then she got into the air ducts big fat ones in a building that age and thats how she got into the apartment we used the cam to track her back a couple of years deeper into the past turns out her relationship with her father was a little more complex than anyone had known they got on fine when she lived at home after she left for college she had a couple of bad experiences she wanted to come home the parents talked it over but encouraged her to stay away to become indepen dent maybe they were wrong to do that maybe they were right but they meant well she came home anyway one night when the mother was away she crawled in bed with her sleeping father and performed oral sex on him she was the initiator but he didnt stop her afterward he was full of guilt the boy mian was asleep in the next room so they had a row no wilson was distressed ashamed but tried to re main sensible he sent her back to college talking about putting this behind them its a oneoff maybe he really arthur c clarke and stephen baxter thought dme would heal the wounds well he was wrong what he didnt understand was barbaras jealousy shed become convinced that mian had displaced her in her parents affections and that was the reason she was shut out kept away from home right so she tries to seduce the father to find an other way back not exactly mavens hit the softscreen and the lit tle drama began to unfold once more mian recognizing his adoptive sister got over his shock and stepped forward but with startling speed barbara closed on him she elbowed him in the throat leaving him clutching his neck gasping smart said mavens professionally now he cant call out barbara pushed the boy onto his back and straddled him she grabbed his hands held them over his head and began to slash at his clothes she doesnt look strong enough to do that bobby said it isnt strength that counts its determination mian couldnt believe even now this girl a giri he thought of as his sister was going to do him real harm would you now the boys chest was bare barbara reached down with the knife bobby snapped enough mavens hit a button and the softscreen cleared to bobbys profound relief mavens said the rest is detail when mian was dead she propped him against the door and called for her father wilson came running when he opened the door his sons warm body fell into his arms and he called the search engine but wilsons semen she stored it after that night she blew him in a cute the light of other days tittle cryoflask she liberated from a medical lab shed been planning this even as far back as that he shrugged it all worked out revenge the destruction of the father who had spurned her as she saw it it all worked at least until the wormcam came along and so and so the wrong man was convicted executed mavens tapped the screen and brought up a fresh image it was of a womanfortyish blond she was sitting in some dingy office her face was crumpled with grief this is mae wilson mavens said philips wife mother to the two adopted children shed had to come to terms with the death of the boy what she thought of as her husbands dreadful crime shed even reconciled with barbara found comfort with her nowat this mo mentshe had to face a much more dreadful truth bobby felt uncomfortable confronted by this horror this naked grief but mavens froze the image right here he murmured thats where we tore her heart in two and its my responsibility you did your best no i could have done better the girl barbara had an alibi but with hindsight its an alibi i could have taken apart there were other small things discrepancies in the timing the distribution of the biood but i didnt see any of that he looked at bobby his eyes bright i didnt see the truth thats what your wormcam is its a truth machine bobby shook his head no its a hindsight machine it has to be right to bring the truth to light mavens said i still believe that of course i do but sometimes the truth hurts beyond belief like poor mae wilson here and you know what the truth didnt help her it didnt bring mian back or her husband all it did was take her daughter away too were all going to go through this one way or an arthur c clarke and stephen baxter other being forced to confront every mistake we ever made maybe mavens said softly he smiled and ran his finger along the edge of his desk heres what the wormcam has done for me my job isnt an intellectual exercise anymore sheriock holmes puzzles now sit here every day and i get to watch the determination the savagery thethe calculation were animals bobby beasts under these neat suits of clothing he shook his head still smiling and he ran his finger along the desk back and forth back and forth time as the availability and power of the wormcam ex tended relentlessly so invisible eyes fell like snow flakes through human history deeper and deeper into time princeton new jersey usa april ad his good humor in those last hours struck his visi tors he talked with perfect calm and joked about his doctors and in general seemedo

his office at the institute should not be preserved as he left it and that his home should not become a shrine and so on doctor dean looked in on him for the last time at eleven pm and found him sleeping peacefully but a little after midnight his nursemrs alberta roszelnoticed a change in his breathing she called for help and with the help of another nurse cranked up the head of the bed he was muttering and mrs roszel came close to hear even as the finest mind since newton began at last to unravel final thoughts floated to the surface of his consciousness perhaps he regretted the great physics arthur c clarke and stephen baxter unification project he had left unfinished perhaps he wondered if his pacifism had after all been the right courseif he had been correct to encourage roosevelt to enter the nuclear age perhaps simply he regretted how he had always put science first even over those who loved him but it was too late for all that his life so vivid and complex in youth and middle age was now reducing as all lives must to a single thread of utter simplicity mrs roszel bent close to hear his soft voice but his words were in german the language of his youth and she did

incidents in human his tory are screwups it seems just as almost all the great passions are no more than crude and manip ulative tumblings and worse than that the truth generally turns out to be boring the lack of pattern and logic in the over whelming almost unrecognizable true history that is now being revealed is proving so difficult and wearying for all but the most ardent scholar that

they must have an exis tence independent of the human mind which had con ceived them pierre de fermat never wrote out the proof of what would become known as his last theorem but that brief marginalia

surprisea welcome onewhen she was asked to perform the first provenance check on one of the museums most famous paintings even if the result was less welcome at first the search had been simple in fact confined to the walls of the louvre itself before a blur of visitors attended by generations of curators the fine old lady sat the light of other days in semidarknesa behind her panes of protective glass silently watching time unravel the years before the transfer to the louvre were more complex bemice glimpsed a series of fine houses generations of elegance and power punctuated by intervals of war and social unrest and poverty much of this back as deep as the seventeenth century confirmed the paintings doc umented record thenin the early years of that century more than a hundred years after the paintings supposed composi tioncame the first surprise bemice watched stunned as a scrawny hungrylooking young painter stood before two sidebyside copies of the famous imageand timereversed with brushstroke after brushstroke elim inated the copy that had passed down the centuries to the care of the louvre briefly she detoured to track forward in time follow ing the fate of the older original from which the lou vres copyjust a copy a replicahad been made that original was to last littlemore than two centuries she saw before being lost in a massive house fire in revolutionary france wonncam studies had exposed many of the worlds bestknown works of art as forgeries and copiesmore than seventy percent of pretwentiethcentury paintings and a smaller proportion of sculptures smaller presum ably only because of the effort required to make copies history was a dangerous destructive corridor through which very little of value survived unscathed but still there had been no indication that this paint ing of all of them had been a fake although at least a dozen replicas had been known to circulate at various times and places the louvre had a continuous record of ownership since the artist had laid down his brush and there was besides evidence of changes to the composi tion under the top layer of paint an indication more of an original assayed and reworked than a copy arthur c clarke and stephen baxter but then bemice reflected composition techniques and records could be faked too bewildered she returned down the decades to that dingy room the ingenious forging painter and she be gan to follow the original he had copied deeper into the past more decades nickered by more transfers of owner ship all of it an uninteresting blur around the changeless painting itself at last she approached the start of the sixteenth cen tury and was nearing his studio in florence even now copies were being made by the masters own students but all of the copies were

of the paintings design it was to be the ideal portrait he declared grandly the features and symbolic overtones of its sub ject synthesized into a perfect unity and with a sweep ing flowing style to

commentators call them snowmen who prove never to have existed at all what is becoming more interesting than the myths them selves has been the study of how the myths were constructed from sparse or unpromising facts indeed sometimes from no factsin a kind of mute conspiracy of longing very rarely under any bodys conscious control we must wonder where this will lead us just as the human memory is not a passive recorder but a tool in the construction of the self so history has never been a simple record of the past but a means of shaping peoples but just as each human will now have to learn arthur c clarke and stephen baxter to construct a personality in the glare of pitiless wormcam inspection so communities will have to come to terms with the strippedbare truth of their own pastand find new ways to express their com mon values and history if they are to survive the future and me sooner we get on with it the better similaun glacier alps april bc it was an elemental world black rock blue sky hard white ice this was one of me highest passes in the alps the man alone moved through this lethal environment with utter confidence but marcus knew the man he watched was already approaching the place where slumped over a boulder and with his neolithic tool kit stacked neatly at his side he would meet his death at firstas he had explored the possibilities of the wormcam here at the institute of alpine studies at the university of innsbruckmarcus pinch had feared that the wormcam would destroy archaeology and replace it with something more resembling butterfly hunting the crude observation of the truth perhaps by untrained eyes there would be no more schliemanns no more troys no more patient unraveling of the past from shards and traces but as it turned out there was still a role for the ac cumulated wisdom of archaeology as the best intellec tual reconstruction available of the true past there was just too much to seeand the wormcam horizon ex panded all the time for the time being the role of the wormcam was be to supplement conventional archae ological techniques to provide key pieces of evidence to resolve disputes to reinforce or overthrow hypothe ses as a more correct consensual narrative of the past slowly emerged and in this case for marcus the truth that would be revealedhere now by the bluewhiteblack images re the light of other days layed through time and space to his softscreenwould provide answers to the most compelling questions in his own professional career this man this hunter had been dug out of the ice fiftythree centuries after he died the smears of blood tissue starch hair and fragments of feather on his tools and clothing had enabled the scientists marcus included to reconstruct much of his life modem researchers had even whimsically given him a name otzi the ice man his two arrows were of particular interest to marcus in fact they had served as the basis of marcuss doc torate both the arrows were broken and marcus had been able to demonstrate that before he died the hunter had been trying to dismantle the arrows intent on mak ing one good arrow out of the two broken ones by fitting the better arrowhead into the good shaft it was such painstaking detective work as this that had drawn marcus into archaeology marcus saw no limit to the reach of such techniques perhaps in some sense every event left some mark on the universe a mark that could one day be decoded by sufficiently ingenious in struments in a sense the wormcam was the crystalli zation of the unspoken intuition of every archaeologist that the past is a country real out there somewhere which can be explored fingertip by fingertip but a new book of truth was opening for the cam could answer questions left untouched by traditional ar chaeology no matter how powerful the techniques even about this man otzi who had become the best known human of all those who had lived throughout prehistory what had never been answeredwhat was impossible to answer from the fragments recoveredwas why the ice man had died perhaps he was fleeing warfare or pursuing a love affair perhaps he was a criminal fleeing the rough justice of his time marcus had intuited that all these explanations were parochial projections of a modern world on a more aus arthur c clarke and stephen baxter tere past but he longed along with the rest of the world to know the truth but now the world had forgotten otzi with his skin clothes and tools of flint and copper the mystery of his lonely death now in a world where any figure from the past could be made to come to vibrant life otzi was no longer a novelty nor even particularly interesting no body cared to leam how after all he had died nobody save marcus so marcus had sat in the chill gloom of this university facility struggling through that alpine pass at otzis shoulder until the truth had be come apparent otzi was a highstatus alpine hunter his copper axe head and bearskin hat were marks of hunting prowess and prestige and his goal on this fatal expedition had been the most elusive quarry of all the only alpine an imal which retires to high rocky areas at night the ibex but otzi was oldat fortysix he had already reached an advanced age for a man of his period he was plagued by arthritis and afflicted today by an intestinal infection which had given him chronic diarrhea perhaps he had grown weaker slower than he knewor cared to admit he had followed his quarry ever deeper into the cold heights of the mountains he had made his simple camp in this pass intending to repair the arrowheads he had broken continue his pursuit the next day he had taken a final meal of salted goat flesh and dried plums but the night had turned crystal clear and the wind had howled through the pass drawing otzis life heat with it it was a sad lonely death and marcus watching thought there was a moment when otzi tried to rise as if aware of his terrible mistake as if he knew he was dying but he could not rise and marcus could not reach through the wormcam to help him and so otzi would lie alone entombed in his ice for five thousand years the light of other days marcus shut down the wormcam and once more otzi was at peace patefield testimony many nationsnot just amer icaare facing grave internal dialogues about the new truths revealed about the past truths in many cases barely reported if at all in conventional his tories in france for example there has been much soulsearching about the unexpectedly wide nature of collaboration with the nazi regime during the german occupation of the second world war re assuring myths about the significance of the war time resistance have been severely damagednot least by the new revelations about david moulin a revered

yugoslavia and so on most of these past horrors were well known be fore the wormcam of course and many honest and conscientious histories were written but still the endless dismal banality of it all the human re ality of so much cruelty and pain and waste re mains utterly dismaying and stronger emotions than dismay have been stirred ethnic and religious disputes centuries old have been the trigger for many past conflicts so it has been this time we have seen interpersonal anger riots interethnic struggles even coups and minor wars and much of the anger is still directed at ourworld the messenger who has delivered so much dismal truth but it could have been worse as it turns outwhile there has been much anger expressed at ancient wrongs some never even ex posed beforeby and large each community has become too aware of its own crimes against its own people and others to seek atonement for those of others no nation is without sin none seems pre pared to cast the first stone and almost every sur viving major institutionbe it nation corporation churchfinds itself forced to apologize for crimes committed in its name in the past but there is a deeper shock to be confronted the wormcam after all does not deliver its his tory lessons in the form of verbal summaries or neat animated maps nor does it have much to say of glory or honor rather it simply shows us human beings one at a timevery often starving or suf fering or dying at the hands of others greatness no longer matters we see now that the light of other days each human being who dies is the center of a uni verse a unique spark of hope and despair hate and love going alone into the greater darkness it is as if the wormcam has brought a new democracy to the viewing of history as lincoln might have re marked the history emerging from all this intent wormcam inspection will be a new story of man kind a story of the people by the people for the people now what matters most is my storyor my lovers or my parents or my ancestors who died the most mundane meaningless of deaths in the mud of stalingrad or passchendaele or gettysburg or simply in some unforgiving field broken by a life of drudgery empowered by the wormcam as sisted by such great genealogical record centers as the mormons we have all discovered our ances tors there are those who argue that this is dangerous and destabilizing after all the spate of divorces and suicides which followed the wonncams first gift of openness has now been followed by a fresh wave as we have become able to spy on our part ners not just in the real time of the present but in the past as far back as we care to look and every past misdeed open or hidden is made available for scrutiny every old wound reopened but this is a process of adjustment which the strongest relation ships will survive and anyhow such compara tively trivial consequences of the wormcam are surely insignificant compared to the great gift of deeper historical truth which for the first time is being made available to us so i do not endorse the doomsayers i say trust the people give us the tools and we will finish the job there is a growing clamortragically impossi ble to satisfyto find a way some way any way arthur c clarke and stephen baxter to change the past to help the suffering longdead even to redeem them but the past is immutable only the future is there to be shaped with all the difficulties and dangers we are priv ileged to be alive at such a time there will surely never again be a dme when the light of truth and understanding spreads with such overwhelming ra pidity into the darkness of the past never again a time when the mass consciousness of mankind is transformed so dramatically the new generations bom in the omnipresent shadow of the wormcam will grow up with a very different view of their species and its past for better or worse middle east c bc miriam was a tutor of accounting expert systems cer tainly no professional historian but like almost every body else she knew she had gotten hold of wormcam time as soon as it had become available and started to research her own passions and in miriams case that passion focused on a single man a man whose story had been her lifelong inspiration but the closer the wormcam brought miriam to her subject the more maddeningly he seemed to dissolve the very act of observing was destroying him as if he was obeying some unwelcome form of historical uncer tainty principle yet she persisted at last having spent long hours searching for him in the harsh confusing sunlight of those ancient deserts she began to consult the professional historians who had gone before her into these wastes of time and piece by piece she confirmed for herself what they had deduced the career of the man himselfshorn of its super natural elementswas a fairly crude conflation of the biographies of several leaders of that era as the nation of israel had coalesced from groups of palestinian ref the light of other days ugees fleeing the collapse of canaanite citystates the rest was invention or theft that business for instance of being concealed in a wicker basket and floated down the nile in order to save him from murder as a firstborn israelite that was no more than a conflation of older legends from mesopo tamia and egyptabout the god horns for example none of which was based on fact either and hed never been an egyptian prince that fragment seemed to come from the story of a syrian called bay who had served as egypts chief treasurer and had made it to pharaoh as ramosekhayemnetjeru but what is truth after all as preserved by the myth he had been a complex human inspiring man he was marked by im perfection he had stammered and often fell out with the very people he led he even argued with god but his triumph over those imperfections had been an inspira tion over three thousand years to many people includ ing miriam herselfnamed for his beloved sisterwho had had to overcome the obstacles set in her own life by her cerebral palsy he was irresistible as vividly real as any personage from true history and miriam knew he would live on into the future and given that did it matter that moses never truly existed it was a new obsession bobby saw as millions of figures from historyrenowned and otherwisecame briefly to life once more under the gaze of this first generation of wormcam witnesses absenteeism seemed to be reaching an alltime high as people abandoned their work their vocations even their loved ones to devote themselves to the endless fas cination of the wormcam it was as if the human race had become suddenly old content to hide away feeding on its memories arthur c clarke and stephen baxter and perhaps that was how it was bobby thought after all if the wormwood couldnt be turned away there was no future to speak of maybe the wormcam with its gift of the past was precisely what the human race required right now a bolthole and each of those witnesses was coming to under stand that one day she too would be no more than a thing of light and shadow embedded in time perhaps scrutinized in her turn from some unknowable future but to bobby it was not the mass of mankind that concerned him not the great currents of history and thought that were stirred but the breaking heart of his brother crisis of faith david had turned into a recluse it seemed to bobby he would come to the wormworks unannounced perform obscure experiments and return to his apart ment whereaccording to ourworld recordshe con tinued to make extensive use of wormcam technology pursuing his own obscure undeclared projects after three weeks bobby sought him out david met him at his door seemed on the point of refusing to let him in then he stood aside the apartment was cluttered books and softscreens everywhere a place where a manwas living alone hab its unmoderated by consideration of others what the hell happened to you david managed to smile the wormcam bobby what else heather said you assisted her with the lincoln proj ect yes that was what gave me the bug perhaps but now i have seen too much history i am a bad host would you like a drink some beer come on david talk to me david rubbed his blond scalp this is called a crisis of faith bobby i dont expect you to understand in fact bobby irritated did understand and he was disappointed with the mundanity of his brothers con dition every day wormcam addicts hooked on history beat on ourworlds corporate doors demanding ever arthur c clarke and stephen baxter more cam access but then david had isolated himself perhaps he didnt know how much a part of the human race he remained how common his addiction had be come but how to tell him bobby said carefully youre suffering history shock its afashionablecondition right now it will pass fashionable is it david glowered at him were all feeling the same he cast around for ex amples i watched the premiere of beethovens ninth the kamtnertor theater vienna did you see that the symphony performance had been profession ally recorded and rebroadcast by one of the media con glomerates but the ratings had been poor it was a mess the playing was lousy the choir discordant the shakespeare was even worse shakespeare you really have been locked away havent you it was the premiere of hamlet at the globe in the playing was amateurish the costumes ridiculous the crowd a drunken rabble the theater not much more than a thatched cesspit and the accents were so foreign the play had to be subtitled the deeper into the past we look the stranger it all seems a lot of people are finding the new history hard to accept ourworld is a scapegoat for their anger so i know thats true hiram has been hit by endless suits libel incitement to riot incitement to provoke racial ha tredfrom national and patriotic groups religious or ganizations families of debunked heroes even a few national governments thats aside from the physical threats of course it isnt helping that he is trying to copyright history david couldnt help but guffaw youre joking nope hes arguing that history is out there to be discovered like the human genome if you can patent pieces of that why not historyor at any rate those stretches of it ourworld cams have been first to reach the light of other days the fourteenth century is the current test case if that fails he has plans to copyright the snowmen like robin hood like many semimythical heroes of the past under the wormcams pitiless glare robin had simply melted away into legend and confabulation leaving not a trace of historical truth the legend had stemmed in fact from a series of fourteenthcentury english ballads bom out of a time of baronial rebellions and agrarian discontent which had culminated in the peasants revolt of david smiled i like that hiram always did like robin hood i think he fancies himself as a modem equivalenteven if hes deluding himself in fact he probably has more in common with king john how ironic if hiram came to own robin look davidmany people feel just as you do his tory is full of horror of forgotten people of slaves of people whose lives were stolen but we cant change the past all we can do is to move on resolving not to make the same mistakes again you mink so david snapped bitterly he stood and with brisk movements he opaqued the windows of his cluttered apartment shutting out the afternoon light then he sat beside bobby and unrolled a softscreen watch now and see if you still believe it is so easy with confident keystrokes he initiated a stored worm cam recording side by side the brothers sat bathed in the light of other days the small round battered sailing ship approached the shore two more ships could be seen on the horizon the sand was pure the water still and blue the sky huge people came out onto the beaches men and women naked dark handsome they seemed full of wonder some of the natives swam out to meet the approaching vessel arthur c clarkeand stephen baxter columbus bobby breathed yes these are the arawaks the natives of the ba hamas they were friendly they gave the europeans gifts parrots and balls of cotton and spears made of cane but they also had gold which they wore as or naments in their ears columbus immediately took some of the arawaks by force so that he could extract information about the gold and it developed from there the spaniards had armor and muskets and horses the arawaks had no iron no means of defending themselves from the euro peans weapons and discipline the arawaks were taken as slave labor on haiti for example mountains were stripped from top to bottom in the search for gold the arawaks died by the thousands roughly a third of the workers every six months soon mass suicides began using cassava poi son infants were killed to save them from the spaniards and so on there seem to have been about a quarter of a million arawaks on haiti when columbus arrived within a few years half of them were dead of murder mutilation or suicide and by after decades of fe rocious slave labor none of the original arawaks or their descendants were left on haiti it turned out there were no gold fields after all only bits of dust the arawaks garnered from streams for their pathetic deadly jewelery and that bobby was how our invasion of the amer icas began david watch he tapped the screen and brought up a new scene bobby saw blurred images of a city small cluttered crowded of white stone that glowed in the flat sunlight jerusalem david said now fifteen july full of jews and muslims the crusaders a military mission from western christendom had laid siege to the city for a month now their attack is reaching its peak the light of other days bobby watched bulky figures clambering over walls soldiers rushing to meet them but the defenders fell back and the knights advanced wielding their swords bobby saw incredibly a man beheaded with a single blow the crusaders fought their way to the temple area there the defending turks held out for a day at last wading in blood up to their anklesthe crusaders broke through and quickly slew the surviving defenders the knights and their followers swarmed through me city taking horses and mules gold and silver lamps and candelabras were stripped from the dome of the rock corpses were butchered for sometimes the cru saders found coins in the bellies of the dead and as the long day of pillage and butchery went on bobby saw christians tear strips of flesh from their fallen foe smoke and eat them all this in violent colorfilled glimpses the vermilion splash of bloody swords the frightened cries of horses the hard eyes of grimy halfstarved knights who sang psalms and hymns eerily even asthey swung their great swords but the fighting was oddly quiet there were no guns here no cannon the only weapons wielded by hu man muscles david murmured this was an utter disaster for our civilization it was an act of rape and it caused a schism between east and west that has never truly healed and it was all in the name of christ bobby thanks to the wormcam ive been privi leged to watch centuries of christian terrorism an orgy of cruelty and destruction that stretched from the cru sades to the sixteenthcentury plundering of mexico and beyond all of it driven by the religion of the popes my religionand the frenzy for money and property the capitalism of which my own father is such a prominent champion with their mail and bright crosses the crusaders were arthur c clarke and stephen baxter like magnificent animals rampaging in the sunlit dust the barbarism was astonishing but still david we knew this the crusades were well chron icled the historians have been able to pick out fact from propaganda long before the wormcam perhaps but were human bobby it is the cruet power of the wormcam to retrieve history from the dust of textbooks and make it live again accessible to our poor human senses and so we must experience it again as the blood spilled centuries back flows once more history is a river of blood bobby that is what the wormcam forces us to see history washes away lives like grains of sand down to the sea of darknessand every one of those lives is was as precious and vibrant as yours or mine and none of it not one drop of blood can be changed he eyed bobby you ready for more david david you arent the only one all of us share the horror you are sinking into selfindulgence if you sup pose that you alone are witnessing these scenes feeling this way but he had no way to say this david brought up another image bobby longed to leave to turn his head away but he knew he must face this if he was to help his brother once again life and blood fled across the screen in the midst of this his most difficult time david kept his promise to heather and sought out mary he had never regarded himself as particularly com petent in affairs of the human heart so in his humility and consumed by his own inner turmoilhe had spent a long time seeking a way to approach heathers diffi cult anguished daughter and the way he found in the end was technical through a piece of software in fact the light of other days he came to her workstation in the wormworks it was late and most of the other researchers had gone she sat in a pool of light colored by the nickering glow of the workstation softscreen surrounded by the greater brooding darkness of this dusty place of engineering and electronics when he arrived she hastily cleared down the screen but he glimpsed a sunny day a garden children running with an adult laughing before the darkness returned she glowered up at him sulkily she wore a baggy grubby tshirt bearing a brazen message santa claus is coming to town david admitted to himself he didnt understand the significance but he wasnt about to ask her about it she made it clear by her silence and posture that he wasnt welcome here but he wasnt about to be put off so easily he sat beside her ive been hearing good things about the tracking software youve been developing she looked at him sharply whos been telling you what ive been doing my mother i suppose no not your mother then who i dont suppose it matters you think im paranoid dont you too defensive too prickly he said evenly i havent made up my mind yet she actually smiled at that at least thats a fair an swer anyway how did you know about my software youre a wormcam user he said one of the con ditions of use of the wormworks is that any innovation you make to the equipment is the intellectual property of ourworld its in the agreement i had to sign on be half of your motherand you typical hiram patterson you mean good business it seems reasonable to me we all know this technology has a long way to go arthur c clarke and stephen baxter youre telling me the whole user interface sucks david and who better to come up with ways of putting that right than the users themselves the people who need to make it better now so you have spies people watching the past watchers we have a layer of metasoftware which monitors user customization assessing its functionality and qual ity if we see a good idea we may pick up on it and develop it best of all of course is to find something which is a bright idea and well developed she showed a nicker of interest even pride like mine it has potential youre a smart person mary with a bright future ahead of you buthow would you put ityou know diddlysquat about developing quality software it works doesnt it most of the time but i doubt that anybody but you could make an enhancement without rebuilding the whole thing from the ground up he sighed this isnt the s mary software development is a craft now i know i know we get all this at school you think my idea works though why dont you show me she reached for the softscreen he could see she was about to clear the settings set up a fresh wormcam run deliberately he put his hand over hers no show me what you were looking at when i sat down she glared at him so thats it my mother did send you didnt she and youre not interested in my track ing software at all i believe in the truth mary then start telling it he picked off the points on his fingers your mothers concerned about you it was my idea to come to you not hers i do think you ought to show me what the light of other days youre watching yes it serves as a pretext to talk to you but i am interested in your software innovation in its own right is there anything else if i refuse to go along with this will you throw me out of the wormworks i wouldnt do that compared to the equipment here the stuff you can access via the net sucks told you im not threatening you with that the moment stretched subtly she subsided in her seat and he knew he had won the round with a few keystrokes she restored the scene it was a small gardena yard really strips of sun baked grass separated by patches of gravel a few poorly tended flower beds the image was bright the sky blue the shadows long there were toys everywhere splashes of color some of them autonomously toiling back and forth on their programmed tasks and routines here came two children a boy and a girl aged maybe six and eight respectively they were laughing kicking a ball between them and they weve being chased by a man also laughing he grabbed the girl and whirled her high in the air so that she flew through shadows and light mary froze the scene a cliche she said right a childhood memory a summers afternoon long and perfect this is your father and your brotherand yourself her face twisted into a sour smile the scene is barely eight years old but two of the protagonists are dead already what do you think of that mary you wanted to see my software he nodded show me she tapped at the screen the viewpoint panned from side to side and stepped forward and back in time through a few seconds the girl was raised and lowered arthur cclarke and stephen baxter and raised again her hair tumbling this way and that as if this was a film being wound back and forth right now im using the standard workstation inter face the viewpoint is like a little camera floating in the air i can control its location in space and move it through time adjusting the position of the wonnhole mouth which is fine for some applications but if i want to scan more extended periods its a dragas you know she let the scene run on the father put down child mary mary focused the viewpoint on her fathers face and with taps of the softscreen tracked it jerkily as the father ran after his daughter across that vanished lawn i can follow the subject she said clinically but its difficult and tedious so ive been seeking a way to automate the tracking she tapped more virtual buttons i used patternrecognition routines to latch on to faces like mis the wbrmcam viewpoint swung down as if guided by some invisible cameraman and focused on her fa thers face the face stayed mere central to the image as he moved his head this way and that talking laugh ing shouting the background swung around him dis concertingly all automated david said yes i have subroutines to monitor my preferences and make the whole thing a little more professional more keystrokes and now the viewpoint pulled back a little the camera angles were more conventional sta bilized no longer slaved to that face the father was still the central protagonist but his context became more clear david nodded this is valuable mary this tied to interpretative software might even allow us to automate the compilation of historicfigure biographies at first draft anyhow youre to be commended she sighed thanks but you still think im a wacko the light of other days because im watching my father rather than john len non dont you he shrugged he said carefully everybody else is watching john lennon his life for better or worse is common property your lifethis golden afternoon is your own but im an obsessive like those nuts you find watching their own parents making love watching their own conception im no psychoanalyst he said gently your life has been hard nobody denies that you lost your brother your father but but what but youre surrounded by people who dont want you to be unhappy you have to believe that she sighed heavily you know when we were little tommy and imy mother had a habit of using other adults against us if i was bad shed point to something in the adult worlda car sounding its horn a kilometer away even a jet airplane screaming overheadand shed say that man heard vhat you said to your mother and hes showing you what he thinks about it it was terrifying i grew up with the impression that i was alone in a huge forest of adults all of whom watched over me judging me the whole time he smiled fulltime surveillance then you wont find it hard to get used to life with the wormcam you mean the damage has been done to me already im not sure thats a consolation and then she eyed him so davidwhat do you watch when you have the wormcam to yourself he went back to his apartment he slaved his own work station to marys back at the wormworks and ran through the recordings ourworld routinely made of every users utilization of its wormcams hed done enough he felt not to feel guilty over what arthur c clarke and stephen baxter he had to do next to fulfill his obligation to heather which was to spy on mary it didnt take him long to get to the heart of it she did after all view the same incident over and over it had been another bright afternoon of sun and play and family not long after the one hed watched with her here she was at age eight with her father and family hikingeasily at a sixyearolds pacethrough the rainier national park sunlight rock trees and then he came to it the cmx of marys life it lasted only seconds it wasnt as if theyd taken any risks they hadnt strayed from the marked path or attempted anything am bitious it had just been an accident tommy had been riding his fathers neck clinging to handfuls of thick black hair with his legs draped over his shoulders firmly grasped by his fathers broad hands mary had gone running past eager to chase what looked like the shadow of a deer tommy reached for her un balancing a little and the fathers grasp slippedjust a little but enough the impact itself was unspectacular a soft crack as that big skull hit a sharp volcanic rock the strange limp crumpling of the body just unfortunate even in the way he hit the ground so tethally nobodys fault that was all over in a heartbeat unfortunate com monplace nobodys faultsave he thought with un welcome anger the cosmic designer who chose to lodge something as precious as the soul of a sixyear old in a container so fragile the first time mary and now david like an unwel come ghost had watched this incident shed used a re markable wormcam viewpoint looking out through childmarys own eyes it was as if the viewpoint was lodged right at the center of her soul that mysterious place in her head where she resided surrounded by the soft machinery of her body mary saw me boy falling she reacted reached out the light of other days her arms took a pace toward him he seemed to fall slowly as if in a dream but she was too far away to reach him could do nothing to change what unfolded and now tracking marys usage david was forced to watch the same incident from the fathers point of view it was like looking down from a watchtower with childmary a blur below him the boy a thing of dark shadows around his head but the same events un folded with grisly inevitability the unbalancing the slip the boy falling his legs impeding him so that he fell upside down and descended headfirst toward the stony ground but what mary watched over and over obsessively was not the death itself but the moments before little tommy falling was only a meter from mary but that was too tar and no more than centimeters from his fa thers grasp a fraction of a seconds reaction time it might have been a kilometer hours of delay it would have made no difference and this david suspected was the real reason her father had committed his suicide not the publicity that suddenly surrounded him and hisfamilythough that couldnt have helped if he was anything like mary he must have seen immediately the implications of the wormcam for himselfjust like millions of others now exploring the capabilities of the wormcam and the darkness in their own hearts how could that bereaved father not watch this how could he not relive those terrible moments over and over how could he turn away from this child trapped within the machine as vivid as life and yet unable to grow a second older or to do anything the slightest bit different ever again and how could that father bear to live in a world in which the terrible clarity of the incident was available for him to replay any time he wished from any angle he choseand yet knowing he would never be able to change a single detail arthur c clarke and stephen baxter how indulgent he had beendavid himselfto sit and watch gmesome episodes from the history of the church incidents centuries removed from his own re ality after all columbus crimes hurt nobody now save perhaps the man himself david thought grimly how much greater had been the courage of mary a lonely flawed child as alone she faced the moment that had shaped her life for good or ill for this he realized is the core of the wonncam experience not timid spying or voyeurism not the view ing of some impossibly remote period of history but the chance to review the glowing incidents that make up my life but my eyes have not evolved to see such sights my heart has not evolved to cope with such repeated reve lations once time was called the great healer now the healing balm of distance has been torn away we have been granted the eyes of god he thought eyes which can see the immutable bloodstained past as if it were today but we are not god and the burning light of that history may destroy us anger coalesced immutability why should he accept such unfaimess maybe there was something he could do about that but first he would have to figure out what to say to heather the next time he called when more weeks had gone by bobby was shocked by davids deterioration david was wearing a baggy jumpsuit that looked as if it hadnt been changed for days his hair was mussed and he had shaved only carelessly the apartment was even more of a mess now the furniture littered with softscreens openedout books and journals yellow pads abandoned pens on the floor stacked around an overflowing garbage pail there were soiled paper plates and pizza boxes and microwave junkfood canons the light of other days but david seemed defensive perhaps apologetic its not what youre thinking wormcam addiction yes i may be an obsessive bobby but i think i pulled myself back from that then what i have been working a whiteboard had been set up against one wall it was covered with scarlet scrawl equations scraps of phrases in english and french connected by swirling arrows and loops bobby said carefully heather told me you dropped out of the days project the christ truebio yes i dropped out surely you understand why then what have you been doing here david david sighed i tried to touch the past bobby i tried and i failed whoa said bobby did i understand that right you tried to use a wormhole to affect the past is that what youre saying but your theory says thats impos sible doesnt it yes i tried anyway i ran some tests in the worm works i tried to send a signal back in time through a small wormhole to myself just across a few millisec onds but enough to prove the principle and david smiled wryly signals can travel forward in time through a wormhole thats how we view the past but when i tried to send a signal back in time there was feedback imagine a photon leaving my wormhole mouth a few seconds in the past it can fly to the fu ture mouth travel back in time and emerge from the past mouth at the precise moment it started its trip it overlies its earlier self and doubles the energy actually more than that because of doppler effects its a positive feedback loop the bit of radiation can travel through the wormhole over and over piling up energy extracted from the wormhole itself eventually it arthur c clarke and stephen baxter becomes so strong it destroys the wonnholea fraction of a second before it operates as a full time machine and so your test wormhole went bang david said dryly with more vigor than id antici pated it looks as if dear old hawking was right about chronology protection the laws of physics do not allow backwardsoperating time machines the past is a reta tivistic block universe the future is quantum uncertainty and the two are joined at the presentwhich i suppose is a quantum gravity interface i am sorry the tech nicalities do not matter the past you see is like an advancing ice sheet encroaching on the fluid future each event is frozen into its place in the crystal structure fixed forever what is important is that know better than anyone on the planet that the past is immutable unchangeable open to us to observe through the wormholes but fixed do you understand how thisfeelst bobby walked through the apartment stepping over mounds of paper and books fine youre suffering you use abstruse physics as therapy what about your family do you ever spare a thought for us david closed his eyes tell me please bobby took a breath well hirams gone into deeper hiding but hes planning to make even more money from weather forecastingvastly better predictions based on precise data centuries deep thanks to the wormcam he thinks it may even be possible to develop climate control systems given the new understanding we have of longterm climate shirts hiram is david sought the right word a phe nomenon is there no limit to his capitalistic imagina tion and the news of kate the jurys out i thought the evidence was circumstantial it is but to actually see her at her terminal at the time the crime was committed to see that she had the opportunityi think that swayed a lot of the jurors the light of other days what will you do if shes convicted i havent decided that was true the end of the trial was a black hole waiting to consume bobbys fu ture as unavoidable and as unwelcome as death so he did his best not to think about it i saw heather he said shes well in spite of everything shes published her lincoln truebio good piece of work and her pieces on the aral sea war were remarkable david eyed bobby you must be proud of herof your mother bobby thought that over i suppose i should be but im not sure how im supposed to feel about her you know i watched her with mary for all their friction theres a bond there its like a steel rope that connects them i dont feel anything like that its probably my fault you said you watched them past tense bobby faced him i guess you havent heard mary left home ah how disappointing they had one final fight about the way mary was using the wormcam heather is frantic with worry why doesnt she trace mary shes tried david snorted ridiculous how can any of us hide from the wormcam evidently there are ways look david isnt it time you rejoined the human race david caged his hands a big man deeply distressed but it is so unbearable he said this is surely why mary fled tried remember i tried to find a way to fix thingsto fix the broken past and i found that none of us has a choice about history not even god have experimental proof dont you see watching all that blood that rapine and plunder and murder if i could deflect one crusaders sword save the life of one ara wak child and so youre escaping into arid physics arthur c clarke and stephen baxter what would you suggest i do you cant fix the past but you can fix yourself sign up for the days ive told you ill help you ill be there do it david go find jesus bobby smiled i dare you after a long silence david returned his smile behold the man extracted from the introduction by david curzon to the days a preliminary commentary eds s p kozlov and g risha rome the international scholarly project known popularly as the days has reached the conclusion of its first phase i was one of a team of actually a little more than twelve thousand wonncam ob servers worldwide who were assigned to study the historical life and times of the man known to his contemporaries as yesho ben pantera and to later generations as jesus christ it is an honor to be asked to pen this introduction we have always known that when we meet jesus in the gospels we see him through the eyes of the evangelists for example matthew believed that the messiah would be born in bethlehem as appeared to be predicted by the old testament prophet mi cah and so he reports jesus as being bom in beth lehem though jesus the galilean was in fact naturally enoughbom in galilee we understand this we compensate for it but how many christians over the centuries have longed to meet jesus for themselves through the neutral medium of a cameraor better still face toface and how many would have believed that ours would be the first generation for which such a meeting would be possible but that is precisely what has happened arthur c clarke and stephen baxter each of we twelve thousand was assigned a sin gle day of the short life of jesus a day which we would observe with wormcam technologyin real time from midnight to midnight in this way a first draft true biography of jesus could rapidly be compiled this visual biography and attached reports are no more than a first draft a simple observation a layingout of the events of jesus tragically brief life there is much subsidiary research to be done for example even the identities of the fourteen apostles have yet to be determined and the fate of his brothers sisters wife and child are known only sketchily then will come the map ping of the blunt events of the central human story against the various accounts canonical and apoc ryphal which survived to tell us of jesus and his ministry and then of course the true debate will begin a debate into the meaning of jesus and his minis trya debate which may last as long as the human race itself this first encounter has not been easy but al ready the clear light of galilee has burned away many falsehoods david lay in his couch and tested its systems the vr apparatus itself the nursing agents which would manage the intravenous feeds and catheters turn his abandoned body to reduce the risk of bedsoreseven clean him if he desired as if he were a coma victim bobby sat before him in this quiet darkened room his face shining in complex softscreen light david felt absurd amid all this gear like an astronaut preparing for launch but that day of long ago embed ded in time like an insect in amber unchanging and brilliant was waiting for his inspection and he submit ted the light of other days david lifted the mindseye headset and settled it over his bead he felt the familiar squirming texture as die headset wrapped itself tightly around his temples he fought panic to think mat people subjected them selves to this for mere entertainment and light burst over him hard and brilliant he was born in nazareth a small and prosperous galilean hill town the birth was routinefor the time he was indeed born to a mary who had been a virgina temple virgin as his contemporaries knew him jesus christ was the illegitimate son of a roman legionary an iilyrian called pantera it was a relationship based on love not coer cioneven though mary had been betrothed at the time to joseph a prosperous master builder and widower but pantera was transferred from the dis trict when marys pregnancy became known it is to josephs credit that he took in mary and raised the boy as his own nevertheless jesus was not ashamed of his ori gin and would later style himself yesho ben pan tera that is jesus son of pantera that is the sum of the historical facts of jesus birth any deeper mystery lies beyond the reach of any wormcam there was no census no trek to bethlehem no stable no manger no cattle no wise men no shep herds no star all of thatdevised by the evan gelists to show how this boychild was a fulfilment of prophecywas no more than an invention the wormcam is stripping away many of our illusions about ourselves and our past there are those who argue that the wormcam is a mass ther apy tool which is enabling us to become more sane as a species perhaps but it is a hard heart which arthur c clarke and stephen baxter does not mourn the debunking of the christmas story he was standing on a beach he could feel the heat like a heavy moist blanket and sweat prickled on his forehead to his left there were hills folded in green and to his right a blue sea lapped softly on the horizon mist laden he could make out fishing boats brownblue shad ows as still and flat as cardboard cutouts on the northern shore of the sea perhaps five kilometers distant he could make out a town a clutter of brownwalled flatroofed buildings that must be capernaum he knew he could use the search engine to be there in an instant but it seemed more appropriate to walk he closed his eyes he could feel the warmth of the sun on his face hear the lapping of water smell grass and the sourness of fish the light here was so bright that it shone pink through his closed eyelids but in the comer of his eye within his eyelid glowed a small gold ourworld logo he set off the sharp coolness of the galilee water at his feet he had several brothers and sisters and also some halfsiblings from josephs previous mar riage one of his brothers james bore a remark able similarity to him and would go on to lead the church after jesus death jesus was apprenticed to his uncle joseph of ar imatheanot as a carpenter but a builder he spent much of his late youth and early manhood in the city of sepphoris five kilometers north of nazareth sepphoris was a major citythe largest in ju daea in fact apart from jerusalem and the capital of galilee there was a great deal of work for build ers masons and architects in the city at this time for sepphoris had been largely destroyed by a ro the light of other days man action against a jewish uprising in the year bc his time in sepphoris was significant for jesus por here jesus became cosmopolitan he was exposed to hellenic culture for example through greek theater andmost significantly to the pythagorean tradition of number and propor tion jesus even attached himself for a time to a jewish pythagorean group called the essenes this was in turn part of a much older tradition that spanned europeit had in fact reached as far as the druids of britain jesus became not a humble carpenter but a craftsman in a highly sophisticated and ancient tra dition josephs trade would lead the young jesus to travel extensively throughout the roman world jesus life was full he married the bible story of the marriage of cana with water turning into wine seems to have been embroidered from an in cident at jesus own wedding his wife died in childbirth he did not remarry but the child survived a daughter she disappeared in the con fusion surrounding the end of her fathers life the search for this daughter of jesus and any descen dants living today is one of the most active areas of wormcam research but jesus was restless at a precociously early age he began to formulate his own philosophy this could be regarded simplistically as based on a peculiar synthesis of mosaic with pythagorean lore christianity would grow out of this collision between eastern mysticism and western logic je sus saw himself metaphorically as a mean be tween god and mankindand the concept of the mean particularly the golden mean was of course me subject of much contemplation in the pythago rean tradition he was and would always remain a good jew arthur c clarke and stephen baxter but he did develop strong ideas about how the practice of his religion could be bettered he began to cultivate friendships among those his family deemed definitely unsuitable for a man of his station the poor criminals he even forged shadowy links with various groups of iestai would be insurrectionists he argued with his family and he left for ca pemaum where he would live with friends and during these years he began to practice miracles two men were walking toward him they were shorter than he was but stockily well mus cled each with thick black hair tied back behind his head their clothing was functional what looked like onepiece cotton shifts with deep wellused pockets they were walking at the edge of the sea careless as small waves broke over their feet they looked forty but were probably younger they were healthy well fed prosperous they were probably merchants he thought they were so immersed in their conversation they hadnt noticed him yet no he reminded himself they could not see da vidfor he hadnt been there on that longgone day when this sundrenched conversation had taken place they were all unaware that a man of their remote future would one day marvel at them a man with the ability to make this everyday moment come alive and run through again and again utterly changeless he flinched as the men collided softly with him the light seemed to dim and he no longer felt the stones sharpness beneath his feet but then they were past walking away from him their conversation not disturbed by so much as a word by his ghostly encounter and the vivid reality of the land scape was restored as smoothly as if he had adjusted the controls on some invisible softscreen he walked on toward capernaum the light of other days it jesus was able to cure mindmediated and pla cebo diseases such as back pains stuttering ulcers stress hay fever hysterical paralysis and blindness even false pregnancies some of the cures are re markable and very moving to witness but they were restricted to those whose belief in jesus was stronger than their belief in their illness and like every other healer before or since jesus was un able to cure deeper organic illnesses to his credit he never claimed he could his healing miracles naturally attracted a great following but what distinguished jesus from the many other hasidim of his day was the message he preached with his healing jesus believed that the messianic age promised by the prophets would comenot when the jews were militarily victorious but when they became pure of heart he believed that this inner purity was to be achieved not just through a life of outer virtue but through a submission to the terrible mercy of god and he believed that this mercy extended to the whole of israel to the untouchables the impure the outcasts and the sinners through his healing and exorcisms he demonstrated the reality of that love jesus was the golden mean between the divine and the human no wonder his appeal was electric he seemed able to make the most wretched sinner feel close to god but few in this occupied nation were sophisti cated enough to understand his message jesus grew impatient at the clamoring demands for him to reveal himself as the messiah and the iestai who were attracted to his charismatic presence be gan to see in him a convenient focal point for a rising against the hated romans trouble coalesced arthur c clarke and stephen baxter david wandered through the small boxy rooms like a ghost watching the people women servants and chil dren come and go the house was more impressive than he had expected it was built on the pattern of a roman villa with a cen tral open atrium and various rooms opening off it in the manner of a cloister the setting was very mediterra nean the light dense and bright the rooms open to the still air already so early in jesus ministry there was a per manent encampment outside the house walls the sick the lame wouldbe pilgrims a miniature tent city later a house church would be built on this site and then in the fifth century a byzantine church that would survive to davids own daytogether with the legend of those who had once lived here now there was noise outside the house the sound of running feetpeople calling he walked briskly outside most of the inhabitants of the tent citysome of them showing surprising alacritywere making their way to ward the glimmering sea which david glimpsed be tween the houses he followed the gathering crowd towering above the people around him and he tried to ignore the stink of unwashed humanity much of it ex trapolated by the controlling software with unwelcome authenticity the direct detection of scent through wormcams was still an unreliable business the crowd spread out as they reached the rudimentary harbor david made his way through the crush to the waters edge ignoring the temporary dimmings as gal ileans brushed past or through him in their eagerness there was a single boat on the still water it was per haps six meters long wooden its construction crude four men were patiently rowing toward the shore beside a stocky helmsman at the stem was a piledup fishing net another man was standing at the prow facing the people on the shore the light of other days david heard eager muttering he had been preaching from the boat at other sites along the shore he had a commanding voice which carried well across the water this yesho this jesus david struggled to see him more clearly but the light on the water was dazzling and so we must turn with reluctance to the true story of the passion jerusalemsophisticated chaotic built of the ra diantly bright white local stonewas crowded this passover with pilgrims come to eat the paschal lamb within the confines of the holy city as tra dition demanded and the city also contained a heavy presence of roman soldiers and this passover it was a place of tension there were many insurrectionist groups working here for example the zealots fierce opponents of rome and iscarii assassins who would customar ily work the large festival crowds into this historic crucible walked jesus and his followers jesus group ate their passover feast but there was no rehearsal of the eucharist no command ment by jesus to take bread and wine in memory of him as if they were fragments of his own body this rite is evidently an invention of the evangel ists that night jesus had much on his mind but not the invention of a new religion we know now that jesus had links to many of the sects and groups which operated at the fringe of his society but jesus intent was not insurrec tion jesus made his way to the place called gethsem anewhere olive trees still grow today some of them survivors from jesus own day jesus had worked to cleanse judaism of sectarianism he thought he would meet me au i arthur c clarke and stephen baxter thorities and leaders of various rebel groups here and seek a peaceful unity as ever jesus sought to be the golden mean a bridge between these groups in conflict but the humanity of jesus rime was no more rational than that of any other era he was met by a group of armed soldiers sent by the chief priests and the events thereafter unfolded with a deadly familiar logic the trial was no grand theological event all that mattered to the high priesta tired consci entious womdown old manwas to maintain public order he knew he had to protect his people from the romans savage reprisals by accepting the lesser evil of handing over this difficult anarchistic faith healer that done the high priest returned to his bed and an uncomfortable sleep pilate me roman procurator had to come out to meet priests who would not enter his praetorium for fear of being defiled pilate was a competent cruel man a representative of an occupying power centuries old yet he too hesitated it seems for fear of inciting worse violence by executing a popular leader we have now witnessed the fears and loathing and dreadful calculations which motivated the men facing each other that dark nightand each of them no doubt believed he was doing the right thing once his decision was made pilate acted with brutal efficiency of what followed we know the dreadful details too well it was not even a grand spectaclebut then the passion of christ is an event which has taken not two days but two thou sand years to unfold but mere is still much we do not know the mo ment of his death is oddly obscured wormcam the light of other days exploration there is limited some scientists have speculated that there is such a density of viewpoints in those key seconds that the fabric of spacetime itself is being damaged by wormhole intrusions and these viewpoints are presumably sent down by observers from our own futureor perhaps from a multiplicity of possible futures if what lies ahead of us is undetermined so we still have not heard his last words to his mother we still do not know ifbeaten dying be wilderedhe cried out to his god even now de spite all our technology we see him through a glass darkly at the center of the town there was a market square already crowded suppressing a shudder david forced himself to push through the people at the center of the crowd a soldier crudely uni formed was holding a woman by one arm she looked wretched her robe torn her hair matted and filthy her plump oncepretty face streaked by crying beside her were two men in fine clean religious garb perhaps they were priests or pharisees they were pointing to the woman gesticulating angrily and arguing with a figure before them whohidden by the crowdwas squatting in the dust david wondered if this incident had left any trace in the gospels perhaps this was the woman who had been i condemned for adultery and the pharisees were con fronting jesus with another of their trick questions try ing to expose his blasphemy the man in the dust had a phalanx of friends they were sturdylooking men perhaps fishermen gently but firmly they were keeping the crushing crowds away but stilldavid could see as he approached wraithiike some of the people were coming near reaching out a tentative hand to touch a robe even stroke a lock of hair i arthur c clarke and stephen baxter i do not think his deathhumiliated broken need remain the center of our obsession with jesus as it has been for two thousand years for me the zenith of his life as i have witnessed it is the mo ment when pilate produces him already tortured and bloody to be mocked by the soldiers sacrificed by his own people with everything he had intended apparently in ruins perhaps already feeling abandoned by god jesus should have been crushed and yet he stood straight a man immersed in his time defeated and yet unbeaten he is gandhi he is saint francis he is wilberforce he is elizabeth fry he is father damien among the lepers he is his own people and the dreadful suffering they would endure in the name of the religion founded in his name the major religions have all faced crises as their origins and tangled pasts had become open to scru tiny none of them have emerged unscathed some have collapsed altogether but religion is not simply about morality or the personalities of founders and practitioners it is about the numinous a higher di mension of our nature and there are still those who hunger for the transcendent the meaning of it all alreadycleansed reformed refoundedthe church is beginning to offer consolation to many people left bewildered by the demolition of privacy and historic certainty perhaps we have lost christ but we have found jesus and his example can still lead us into an unknown futureeven if that future holds only the wormwood and our religions only remaining role is to comfort us and yet history still holds surprises for us for one of the most peculiar yet stubborn legends about the life of jesus has against all expectation been bome out the light of other days the man in the dust was thin his hair severely pulled back prematurely greying at me temples his robe was stained with dust and trailed in the dirt his nose was prominent proud and roman his eyes black fierce in telligent he seemed angry and was drawing in the dust with one finger this silent brooding man had the measure of the pharisees without even the need to speak david stepped forward beneath his feet he could feel the dust of this capernaum marketplace he reached for ward to the hem of that robe but of course his fingers slid through the cloth and though the sun dimmed david felt nothing the man in the dust looked up and gazed directly into davids eyes david cried out the galilean light dissipated and the concerned face of bobby hovered before him as a young man following a wellestablished trade route with his uncle joseph of arimathea jesus visited the tin mine area of comwall with companions he traveled further inland as far as glastonburyat the time a significant port where he studied with the druids and helped de sign and build a small house on the future site of glastonbury abbey this visit is remembered after a fashion in scraps of local folklore we have lost so much the harsh glare of the wormcam has revealed so many of our fables to be things of shadows and whispers atlantis has evaporated like dew king arthur has stepped back into the shadows from which he never truly emerged and yet it is after all true as blake sang that those feet in ancient time did walk upon en glands mountains green the verdict n christmas week kates trial concluded i the courtroom was small paneled in oak and the stars and stripes hung limply at the back of the room the judge the attorneys and the court officers sat in grave splendor before rows of benches containing a few scattered spectators bobby officials from ourworid re porters tapping notes into softscreens the jury was an array of randomlooking citizenry though some of them were sporting the highly colored masks and smartshroud clothes that had become fash ionable in the last few months if bobby didnt look too carefully he could lose sight of a juror until she moved and then a face or lock of hair or fluttering hand would appear as if from nowhere and the rest of the jurors body would become dimly visible outlined by a patchy imperfect distortion of the background it was a sweet irony he thought that smartshrouds were another bright idea of hirams one new ourworid product sold at high profit to counteract the intrusive effects of another and there sitting alone in the dock was kate she was dressed in simple black her hair tied back her mouth set eyes empty cameras had been banned from the courtroom itself and there had been little of the usual media scrum at the courthouse entrance but everybody knew that restrain ing orders meant nothing now bobby imagined the air the light of other days around him speckled with hovering wormcam view points no doubt great swarms of them clustered on kates face and his own bobby knew that kate had conditioned herself never to forget me scrutiny of the wormcam not for a second she couldnt stop the invisible voyeurs gazing at her she said but she could deny mem me satisfaction of seeing how she hurt to bobby her frail lone figure repre sented more strength than the mighty legal process to which she was subject and me great rich corporation which had prosecuted her but even kate could not conceal her despair when her sentence was at last handed down dump her bobby hiram said he was pacing around his big conference desk storm rain lashed against the picture window filling the room with noise shes done you nothing but harm and now shes a convicted felon what more proof do you want come on bobby cut yourself loose you dont need her she believes you framed her well i dont care about that what do you believe thats what counts for me do you really think im so devious that id frame the lover of my sonno matter what i thought about her i dont know dad bobby said evenly he felt calm controlled hirams bluster obviously manipulative was unable to reach him i dont know what i believe any more why discuss it why dont you use the wormcam to go check up on me i dont intend to spy on you hiram stared at his son if youre trying to find my conscience youre going to have to dig deeper than that anyhow its only reprogramming hell they should lock her up and wipe the key reprogramming is nothing bobby shook his head not to kate shes fought arthur c clarke and stephen baxter against the methodology for years she has a real dread of it dad oh bull you were reprogrammed and it didnt hurt you i dont know if it did or not bobby stood now and faced his father he felt his own anger rising i felt different when the implant was turned off i was angry terrified confused i didnt even know how i was sup posed to feel you sound like her hiram shouted shes repro grammed you with her words and her pussy more than i ever could with a bit of silicon dont you see that ah christ the one good thing the bloody implant did do to you was make you too dumb to see whats hap pening to you he fell silent and averted his eyes bobby said coldly youd better tell me what you meant by that hiram turned anger impatience even something like guilt appearing to struggle for dominance within him think about it your brother is a brilliant physicist i dont use the word lightly he may be nominated for a nobel prize and as for me he raised his hands i built up all this from scratch no dummy could have achieved that but you are you saying thats because of the implant i knew there was a risk creativity is linked to de pression great achievement is often linked to an obses sive personality blah blah but you dont need bloody brains to become the president of the united states isnt that right isnt it and he reached for bobbys cheek as if to pinch it like a childs bobby flinched back i remember a hundred a thou sand times as a child when you said that to me i never knew what you meant before come on bobby you did it didnt you you set kate up you know shes innocent and youre prepared to let them screw the light of other days around with her brain just as you screwed around with mine hiram stood there for a moment then dropped his arms bugger it go back to her if you want bury your self in her quim in the end you always come running back you little shit ive got work to do and he sat at his desk tapped the surface to open up his softscreens and soon the glow of scrolling digits lit up his face as if bobby had ceased to exist after she was released bobby took her home as soon as they arrived she stalked around the apart ment closing curtains compulsively shutting out the bright noon sunlight trailing rooms of darkness she pulled off the clothes that she had worn since leaving the courtroom and consigned them to the gar bage he lay in bed listening to her shower in pitch darkness for long minutes then she slid beneath the duvet she was cold shivering in fact her hair not quite dry she had been showering in cold water he didnt question that he just held her until his warmth had per meated her at last she said in a whisper you need to buy thicker curtains darkness cant hide you from a wormcam i know that she said and i know that even now they are listening to every word we say but we dont have to make it easy for them i cant bear it hiram beat me bobby and now hes going to destroy me just as he thought hiram destroyed me he said at least your sentence isnt custodial at least we have each other she balled her fist and punched his chest hard enough to hurt thats the whole point dont you see you wont have me because by the time theyve finished there wont be a me anymore whatever i will have be come ill bedifferent arthur c clarke and stephen baxter he covered her fist with his hand until he felt her fingers uncurl its just reprogramming they said i must suffer from syndrome e spasms of overactivity in my orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal lobes excessive traffic from the cortex prevents emo tions rising to my consciousness and thats how i can commit a crime directed at the father of my lover with out conscience or remorse or selfdisgust kate and then im to be conditioned against the use of the wormcam convicted felons like me you see arent to be allowed access to the technology they will lay down false memory traces in my amygdala the seat of my emotions ill have a phobia unbeatable about even considering the use of a wormcam or viewing its re sults theres nothing to be afraid of she propped herself up on her elbows her shadowed face loomed before him her eye sockets smoothrimmed wells of darkness how can you defend them you of all people im not defending anybody anyhow i dont believe theres a them everybody involved has just been doing her job the fbi the courts and hiram he didnt try to answer he said all i want to do is hold you she sighed and laid her head down on his chest it felt heavy her cheek warm against his flesh he hesitated anyhow i know what the real problem is he could feel her frowning its me isnt it you dont want a switch in your head because thats what had when you found me you have a dread of becoming like me like i was on some level he forced it out on some level you despise me she pulled herself back from him all youre think the light of other days ing about is yourself but im the one whos about to have her brains removed by an icecream scoop she got out of bed walked out of the room and shut the door with cold control leaving him in darkness he slept awhile when he woke he went to find her the living room was still dark the curtains closed and lights off but he could tell she was here lights on light garish and bright flooded the room kate was sitting on a sofa fully dressed she was facing a table on which sat a bottle of some clear fluid and another bottle smaller barbiturates and alcohol both bottles were unopened their seals intact the liquor was an expensive absinthe she said i always did have good taste kate her eyes were watering in the light her pupils huge making her seem childlike funny isnt it i must have covered a dozen suicides more attempted i know there are quicker ways than this i could slit my wrists or even my neck i could even blow out my brains before they get screwed up this will be slower probably more pain ful but its easy you see you sip and swallow sip and swallow she laughed coldly you even get drunk in the process you dont want to do this no youre right i dont want to do it which is why i need you to help me for answer he picked up the liquor and hurled it across the room it smashed against a wall creating a spectacular expensive splash stain on the plaster there kate sighed thats not the only bottle in the world ill do it eventually id rather die than let them screw with my brain arthur c clarke and stephen baxter there must be another way ill go back to hiram and tell him tell him what that if he doesnt fess up im going to destroy myself hell laugh at you bobby he wants me destroyed one way or the other he paced the room growing desperate then lets get out of here she sighed they can watch us leave this room fol low us anywhere we could go to the moon and never be free the voice seemed to come out of thin air if you believe that you may as well give up now kate gasped bobby jumped and whirled it had been the voice of a woman or a girla familiar voice but the room seemed empty bobby said slowly mary bobby saw her face first floating in the air as she began to peel back a hood then as she started to move against the background me perfection of her smart shroud concealment began to break down and he could make out her outline a shadowed limb here a vague discolored blur where her torso must be the whole over laid by an odd eyedeceiving fisheye effect like the earliest wonncam images he noted absently that she seemed clean healthy even well fed how did you get in here she grinned if you come with me kate ill show you kate said slowly come with you where and why bobby asked why is obvious bobby mary said an echo of her adolescent prickle returning because as kate keeps saying if she doesnt get out of here the man is going to stir her brains with a spoon bobby said reasonably wherever she goes she can be traced right mary said heavily the wonncam but you havent been able to trace me since i left home three the light of other days months ago you didnt see me coming you didnt know i was in the apartment until i revealed myself look the wonncam is a terrific tool but it isnt a magic wand people are paralyzed by it theyve stopped thinking even if santa claus can see you what is he going to do by the time he arrives you can be long gone bobby frowned santa claus kate said slowly santa can see you all the time on christmas eve he can look back over the whole year and see if youve been naughty or nice mary grinned santa must have had the first wonncam of all right merry christmas i always thought that was a sinister myth kate said but you can only keep away from santa if you can see him coming mary smiled thats easy she raised her arm pulled back her smartshroud sleeve and revealed what looked like a fat wristwatch it was compact scuffed and had the look of something out of a home workshop the instruments face was a miniature softscreen it showed views of the corridor outside the street the el evators what must be neighboring apartments all empty murmured mary maybe some goon some where is listening to everything we say who cares by me time he gets here well be gone thats a wonncam kate said on her wrist some kind of pirate design i cant believe it said bobby compared to the giant accelerators in the wormworks and said mary alexander graham bell probably never thought a telephone could be made without a ca ble and so small it could be implanted in your wrist kates eyes nanowed a casimir injector could never be miniaturized that far this has to be squeezed vacuum technology the stuff david was working on bobby if it is bobby said heavily how did the technology arthur c clarke and stephen baxter development leak out of the wormworks he eyed mary does your mother know where you are typical mary snapped a couple of minutes ago kate was about to kill herself and now youre accusing me of industrial espionage and worrying about my re lationship with my mother my god kate said what kind of world is it going to be where every damn kid wears a wormcam on her wrist ill tell you a secret mary said we already do the details are on the internet there are home work shops churning them out all over the planet she grinned the djinn is out of the bottle look im here to help you there are no guarantees santa claus isnt all powerful but he has made it harder to hide all im offering you is a chance she stared at kate thats better than what youre facing now isnt it kate said why do you want to help me mary looked embarrassed because youre family more or less bobby said your mother is family too mary glared at him ill cut you a deal if itll make you feel better let me get you out of here let me save kates head from being sliced open in return ill call my mother deal kate and bobby exchanged a glance deal mary dug into her tunic and produced a swatch of cloth which she shook out smartshroud bobby said is there room for two in there mary was grinning i was hoping youd say that come on lets get out of here hirams security guards alerted by a routine wormcam monitor arrived ten minutes later the apartment brightly lit was empty the guards began to squabble over who would have to tell hiram and take the blame and then fell silent as they realized he was or would be watching anyhow three the light of other days oft in the stilly nighty ere slumbers chain has bound me fond memory brings the light of other days around me thomas mwre the floodlit stage rome ad holding heathers hand david was walking through the dense swarming heart of the city the night sky above layered with smog looked as orange as the clouds of titan even this late rome was crowded with sightseers many like heather were walking around with mindseye headbands or glassesandgloves four years after the first massmarket release of the wormcam it had become a fashionable and alluring pastime to become a time touristat many of the worlds ancient sites wandering through deep layers of past da vid had determined he must try the scuba tour of sunken venice before he left italy alluring yes and david understood why the past had become a comfortable and familiar place its exploration a safe synthetic adventure the perfect place to avert the eyes from the blank me teoric wall that terminated the future how ironic thought david that a world denied its future was sud denly granted its past and escape was tempting from a world where even the transformed present was a strange and disturbing place almost everybody now wore a wormcam of some kind generally the wristwatchsized miniaturized ver sion powered by squeezedvacuum technology the per sonal wormcam was a link to the rest of mankind to me glories and horrors of the pastand not least a arthur c clarke and stephen baxter useful gadget for looking around the next comer and everybody was reshaped by the wormcams re lentless glare people didnt even dress the way they used to some of the older people here in rentes crowded streets still wore clothing that would have been recognizable even fashionable a few years before some tourist types in fact walked around defiantly dressed in loud tshirts and shorts just as they had for decades one woman was wearing a shirt with a gaudy flashing message hey up there in the future get your grandmom out of here but many more people had covered up wearing seam less onepiece coveralls that buttoned high on the neck and with long sleeves and trouser legs dial terminated in sewnon gloves and boots there were even some ex amples of auovercover styles imported from the is lamic world shapeless smocks and tunics that trailed along the ground headpieces hiding all but the eyes which were uniformly staring and wary others had reacted quite differently here was a nudist couple two men hand in hand wearing slack middle aged bellies over shrunken genitalia with defiant pride but cautious or defiant the older folkamong whom david reluctantly counted himselfdisplayed a contin ual uncomfortable awareness of the wormcams un blinking gaze the young growing up with the wormcam were dif ferent many of the young went simply naked save for prac tical items like purses and sandals but they seemed to david to have none of the shyness or selfconsciousness of their elders as if they were making a choice about what to wear based simply on practicality or a desire to display personality rather than any modesty or taboo one group of youngsters wore masks mat showed pro the light of other days jections of the broad face of a young man girls and boys alike wore the face and it displayed a range of conditions and emotionsrainlashed sundrenched bearded and cleanshaven laughing and crying even sleepingthat seemed to have nothing to do with the activities of the wearers it was disconcerting to watch like seeing a group of clones wandering through the rome night these were romulus masks the latest fashion acces sory from ourworld romulus founder of the city had become quite a character for the young romans since the wormcam had proved he really existedeven if his brother and all that stuff about the wolf had proved mythical each mask was just a softscreen molded to the face with inbuilt wormcam feeds and it showed the face of romulus as he had been at the exact age to the minute of the wearer ourworld was targeting other parts of the world with regional variants of the same idea it was a terrific piece of marketing but david knew it would take him a lifetime to get used to the sight of the face of a young iron age male above a pair of pert bare breasts they passed through a small square a patch of unhealthylooking greenery surrounded by tall antique buildings on a bench here david noticed a young cou ple boy and girl both naked they were perhaps sixteen the girl was on the boys lap and they were kissing ardently the boys hand was urgently squeezing the girls small breast and her hand dug in between their bodies was wrapped around his erection david knew that some commentators dis missed all this as hedonism a mad dancing of the young before the onset of the fire it was a mindless youthful reflection of the awful despairing nihilist philosophies that had grown recently in response to the looming ex istence of the wormwood philosophies in which the universe was seen as little more than a giant fist intent arthur c clarke and stephen baxter on smashing flat all of life and beauty and thought over and over there never had been a way to survive die universes slow decline of course now the wormwood had made that cosmic terminus gruesomely real and there was nothing to do but dance and rut and cry such notions were dismally seductive but the expla nation for the ways of modem youth was surely simpler than that david thought it was surely another wormcam consequence the relentless disconcerting shedding of taboos in a world where all the walls had come down a handful of people had stopped to watch the couple one mannaked too perhaps in his twentieswas slowly masturbating technically that was still illegal but nobody was try ing to enforce such laws anymore after all that lonely man could go back to his hotel room and use his wormcam to zoom in on anybody he chose any time of the day or nightwhich was what people had been using the wormcam for since it was released and mov ies and magazines and such for a lot longer than that at least in this age of the wormcam there was no more hypocrisy but such incidents were already becoming rare new social norms were emerging the world seemed to david to be a little like a crowded restaurant yes you could listen in to what the man on the next table was saying to his wife but it was impolite if you indulged you would be ostracized and after all many people actually relished crowded public places the buzz the excitement the sense of belonging could override any desire for privacy as david watched the girl broke away smiling at her lover and she slid down his body smooth as a seal and took his erection in her mouth and david turned away face burning then lovemaking had been clumsy amateurish per haps overeager their two bodies though young were the light of other days not specially attractive specimens but then this was not art or even pornography this was human life in all its clumsy animal beauty david tried to imagine how it must be to be that boy here and now freed of taboos reveling in the power of his body and his lovers heather however saw none of mis wandering beside him eyes glinting she was still immersed in the deep pastand perhaps it was time he joined her there with a sense of reliefand a brief word to the search engine requesting guidancedavid donned his own mindseye and slid into another time he walked into daylight but this crowded street lined by great boxy multistory apartment blocks was dark hemmed in by the peculiar topography of the sitethe famous seven hillsromans already a mil lion strong had built up in many ways the city had a remarkably modern feel but this was not the twentyfirst century he was glimps ing this swarming vibrant capital on a bright italian summer afternoon just five yearsafter me cruel death of christ himself there were no motor vehicles of course and few animaldrawn carts or carriages the most com mon form of transport other man by foot was by hired litter or sedan chair even so the streets were so crowded that even foot traffic could circulate at little more than a crawl there was a crush of humanitycitizens soldiers paupers and slavesall around them david and heather towered over most of these people and besides walking on the modern ground surface they were hovering above the cobbled floor of the ancient city the poor and the slaves looked stunted some visibly ravaged by mal nourishment and disease even ratlike as they crowded around the public water fountains but many of the cit izenssome in brilliantwhite goldstitched togas ben efiting from generations of affluence funded by the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter expanding empirewere as tall and well fed as david and in suitable clothes would surely not have looked out of place in the streets of any city of the twentyfirst century but david could not get used to the way the swarming crowds simply pushed through him it was hard to accept that to these romans busily engaged with their own concerns he was no more than an insubstantial ghost he longed to be here to play a part they came now to a more open place this was the forum romanum a finely paved rectangular court sur rounded by grand twostory public buildings fronted by rows of narrow marble columns a line of triumphal columns each capped by goldleafed statues strode boldly down the center of the court and farther ahead beyond a clutter of characteristically roman redtiled sloping roofs he could see the curving bulk of the col osseum in one comer he noticed a group of citizens grandly dressedsenators perhapsarguing vehemently tap ping at tablets oblivious of the beauty and marvel around them they were proof that this city was no mu seum but very obviously the operational capital of a huge complex and wellrun empirethe washington of its dayand its very mundanity was exhilarating so dif ferent from the seamless shining depopulated recon structions of the old prewormcam museums movies and books but this imperial city already ancient had just a few centuries more to survive the great aqueducts would fall the public fountains fail and for a thousand years afterward the romans would be reduced to drawing their water by hand from the tiber there was a tap on his shoulder david turned startled a man stood there dressed in a drab charcoalgray suit and tie utterly out of place here he had shortcropped blond hair and he was hold ing up a badge and like david and heather he was the light of other days floating a few meters above the ground of imperial rome it was fbi special agent michael mavens you david said what do you want with us dont you think youve done enough damage to my family special agent i never intended any damage sir and now and now i need your help suppressing a sigh david lifted his hands to his mindseye headband he could feel the indefinable tin gle that came with the breaking of the equipments trans ceiver link to his cortex suddenly he was immersed in the hot roman night and around him the forum romanum was reduced great chunks of marble rubble littered the floor their surfaces brown decaying in tfae foul air of the city of the great buildings only a handful of columns and cross pieces survived poking out of the ground like exposed bones and sickly urbanpoisoned grass grew through cracks in the flags bizarrely amid the gaudy twentyfirstcentury tour ists graysuited mavens looked even more out of place than in ancient rome michael mavens turned and studied heather her eyes dilated widely sparkled with the unmistakable pearly glint of viewpoints cast by the miniature wormcam gen erators implanted in her retinas david took her hand she squeezed gently mavens caught davids eye he nodded understand ing but he pressed we need to talk sir its impor tant my brother yes very well will you accompany us back to our hotel it isnt far id appreciate it so david walked from the ruined forum romanum arthur c clarke and stephen baxter gently guiding heather around the fallen masonry heather turned her head like a camera stand still im mersed in the bright glories of a city long dead and spacetime distortion shone in her eyes they reached the hotel heather had barely spoken since the forum ro manum she allowed david to kiss her on the cheek before she went to her room there she lay down in the dark facing the ceiling her wormhole eyes sparkling david realized uneasily that he had absolutely no idea what she was looking at when he returned to his own room mavens was wait ing david prepared them drinks from the minibar a single malt for himself a bourbon for the agent mavens made small talk you know hiram patter sons reach is awesome in your bathroom just now i used a wormcam mirror to pick the spinach out of my teeth my wife has a wormhole nannycam at home my brother and his wife are using a wormcam monitor to keep track of their thirteenyearold daughter whos a little wild in their opinion and so on to think of it the miracle technology of the age and we use it in such trivial ways david said briskly as long as he continues to sell it hiram doesnt care what we do with it why dont you tell me why youve come so far to see me special agent mavens mavens dug into a pocket of his crumpled jacket and pulled out a thumbnailsized data disk he turned it like a coin and david saw hologram shimmers in its surface mavens placed the disk carefully on the small polished table beside his drink im looking for kate manzoni he said and bobby patterson and mary mays i drove them into hiding i want to bring them back help them rebuild their lives what can i do david asked sourly after all you the light of other days i have the resources of the fbi behind you not for this to tell the truth the agency has given up on the three of them i havent why you want to punish them some more not at all mavens said uncomfortably manzonis was the first highprofile case which hinged on wormcam evidence and we got it wrong he smiled looking tired ive been checking thats the wonderful thing about the wormcam isnt it its the worlds greatest secondguess machine you see its now possible to read many types of information through the wormcam particularly the contents of computer memories and storage devices i checked through the equipment kate manzoni was using at the time of her alleged crime and eventually i found that what manzoni claimed had been true all along which is that hiram patterson was responsible for the crime though it would be difficult to pin it on him even using the wormcam and he framed manzoni he shook his head i knew and admired kate manzonis journalism long before the case came up the way she exposed the wormwood coverup it wasnt your fault david said levelly you were only doing your job mavens said harshly its a job i screwed up not the first but those who were harmedbobby and kate have dropped out of sight and they arent the only ones hiding from the wormcam david said of course its changing everybody it was true in the new openness businesses boomed crime seemed to have dropped to an irreducible mini mum a rump driven by mental disorder politicians had cautiously found ways to operate in the new glass walled world with their every move open to scrutiny by a concerned and online citizenry now and in the future beyond the triviality of time tourism a new true history arthur c clarke and stephen baxter cleansed of myths and liesand no less wonderful for thatwas entering the consciousness of the species nations and religions and corporations seemed almost to have worked through their round of apologies to each other and to the people the surviving religions re founded and cleansed purged of corruption and greed were reemerging into the light andit seemed to da vidwere beginning to address their true mission which was humanitys search for the transcendent from the highest to the lowest even manners had changed people seemed to be becoming a little more tolerant of one another able to accept each others dif ferences and faultsbecause each person knew he or she was under scrutiny too mavens was saying you know its as if we have all been standing in spotlights on a darkened stage now the theater lights are up and we can see all the way to the wingslike it or not i guess youve heard of mas mutually assured surveillancea consequence of the fact that everybody carries a wormcam everybody is watching everybody else suddenly our nation is full of courteous wary watchful citizens but it can be harmful some people seem to be becoming surveillance obses sives unwilling to do anything that will mark them out as different from the norm its like living in a village dom inated by prying gossips but surely the wormcam has been on balance a force for good open skies for instance open skies had been president elsenhowers old dream of international transparency even before the wormcam there had been an implementation of some thing like that vision with aerial reconnaissance sur veillance satellites weapons inspectors but it was always limited inspectors could be thrown out missile silos camouflaged by tarpaulins but now said mavens in this wonderful wormcam world were watching them and we know they are watching us and nothing can be hidden arms the light of other days reduction treaties can be verified a number of armed conflicts have been frozen into impasse both sides knowing what the other is about to do not only that the citizens are watching as well all over the planet dictatorial and repressive regimes exposed to the light were crumbling though some totalitarian govern ments had sought to use the new technology as an in strument of oppression the flooding of those countries by the democracies with wonncams had re sulted in openness and accountability this was an ex tension of past work done by groups like the witness program who for decades had supplied video equipment to humanrights groups let truth do the fighting believe me mavens said the us is getting off lightly the worst scandal we suffered recently was the exposure of the wormwood bunkers a pathetic half hearted exercise a handful of hollowedout mountains and converted mines meant as a refuge for the rich and powerfulor at least their childrenon wormwood day the existence of such facilities had long been sus pected when they were exposed their futility as refuges was quickly demonstrated by the scientists and their builders mocked into harmlessness mavens said if you think about it mere was usually a tot more scandal than that to be exposed at any moment in the past were all getting cleaner there are some who argue that we may be on the brink of a true consensual world government at lasteven a utopia do you believe it mavens grinned sourly not for a second i have the feeling that wherever were going wherever the wormcam is taking us its somewhere much stranger perhaps david said i suppose weve lived through one of those perspectivechanging moments the last generation was the first to see the earth whole from space ours has been the first to see all of true history and the truth about ourselves you know should be able to deal with all this david forced a smile take arthur c clarke and stephen baxter it from a catholic special agent mavens i grew up encouraged to believe i was already under the scrutiny of a kind of wormcam but that cam was the all seeing eye of god we must learn to live without sub terfuge and shame yes its hard for ushard for me but thanks to the wormcam it seems to me everyone is becoming a little more sane and it was remarkable that all of this had flowed from the introduction of a gadget which hiram its driving force had thought was no more than a smarter tv cam era but now hiram in deep hiding was in the manner of such entrepreneurs all the way back to frankenstein in danger of being destroyed by his machine maybe in a generation or two this will leave us cleansed mavens said but not everybody can stand being exposed the suicide rate remains highyoud be surprised if you knew how high and there are many people like bobby disappearing off the registerspoll returns censuses some even dig traceable implants out of their arms we can see them of course but we cant give them a name he eyed david this is the kind of group we believe bobby and the others have joined they call themselves refugees and those are the kind of people we have to trace if we want to pick up bobby david frowned he has made his choice he may be happy hes on the run he has no choices right now if you find him youll find kate too and she will face her sentence mavens shook his head i can guarantee that wont happen i told you ive evidence shes innocent im already preparing material for a fresh appeal he picked up the data disk and tapped it on the table so he said you want to give your brother a lifeline what is it you want me to do we can track people with the wormcam simply by following them mavens said it isnt easy and its laborintensive but its possible but eyeballtracking the ught of other days can be fooled nor can a wormcam trace reliably be keyed to any external indicator even an implant im plants can be dug out transferred reprogrammed de stroyed so an fbi research lab has been working on a better method based on dna we believe it will be possible to begin from any analyzable organic fragmenta flake of skin or a nail clipping enough to record the dna fingerprint and then track back the fragment until it umm rejoins the individual in question and then using the dna key we can track the subject back and forward in time as far as we like this disk contains trace software what we need from you is to tie it to an operational wormcam you guys at ourworldyou specifically dr curzonare still ahead of the game with this stuff we think it might be possible ultimately to establish a global dnasequence databasechildren would be sequenced and registered as they are bomand use it as the basis of a general search procedure without re lying on holding a physical fragment and then david said slowly you will be able to sit in fbi headquarters and your wormhole spies will scour the planet until they find anyone you seekeven in complete darkness it will be the final death of pri vacy correct oh come on dr curzon mavens pressed what is privacy look around you already the kids are screwing in the street in another ten years youll have to explain what privacy used to mean these kids are different the sociologists say it you can see it they are growing up used to openness in the light and they talk to each other the whole time have you heard of the arenasgigantic ongoing discussions transmitted via wormcam links unmoderated international sometimes involving thousands and hardly anybody involved over the age of twentyfive theyre starting to figure things arthur c clarke and stephen baxter out for themselves with hardly any reference to the world we built by comparison were screwed up right david reluctantly found he agreed and it wouldnt stop here perhaps it was going to be necessary for the damaged elder generations including himself to clear their way off the stage taking with them their hangups and taboos before the young could inherit this new world which only they truly understood maybe mavens growled when david voiced that thought but i aint ready to quit just yet and in the meantime in the meantime i might find my brother mavens studied his glass look its nothing to do with me butheather is a wormhead isnt she a wormhead was the ultimate result of wormcam addiction since taking her retinal implants heather had spent her life in a virtual dream of course she was able to tune her wormcam eyes to view the presentor at least the very recent pastas if her eyes were still the organic original butdavid knew she barely ever chose to habitually she wandered through a world illuminated by the lost glow of the deep past sometimes she would walk with her own younger self even looking out through her own eyes reliving past events over and over david was sure she was with mary almost all the time the infant in her arms the little girl running to her unable and anyhow unwilling to change a single detail if heathers condition was nothing to do with mavens it was little enough to do with david perhaps his im pulse for protecting her had been his own brush with the seduction of the past there are some commentators david said slowly who say this is the future for all of us wormholes in our eyes our ears we will leam a new perception in which the layers of the past are as visible to us as the the light of other days present it will be a new way of thinking of living in the universe but for now for now mavens said gently heather needs help yes she took the loss of her daughter pretty hard then do something about it help me lookthis dna trace isnt just a bugging device mavens leaned forward think what else you could do with it disease eradication for instance you could track a spreading plague back through time along its vectors airborne or waterborne or whatever replacing what can be months of painstaking and dangerous detective work with a mo ment s glance the centers for disease control are al ready looking at that and what about history you could track an individual right back to the womb it wouldnt take much of an extension to the software to transfer the trace to the dna of either parent and to their parents be fore them you could follow family trees back into time and you could work the other way start with any histor ical character and trace all their living descendants youre a scientist david the wormcam has already turned science and history on their headsright think where you could go with this he held the disk out before him before davids face holding it between thumb and forefinger like david thought a communion host watching bobby her name was mac wilson her intent was clear like a piece of crystal that was true from the moment her adopted daughter barbara was convicted of the murder of her adopted son mian and sentenced to follow her fathermaes husband philto a room where she would be delivered a lethal injection the fact of it was that shed gotten used to the idea that her husband had been a monster who had abused and killed the boy in their care over the years shed learned to blame phil even learned to hate his shade and clinging to that found a little peace and she still had barbara out there somewhere a fragment left over from the wreck of her life proof that some good had come of it all but now because of the wormcam that wasnt an option anymore it hadnt been phil after allbut bar bara it just wasnt acceptable the monster hadnt been the one who had lied to her all these years but one she had nurtured grown made and she mae wasnt a victim of deception but somehow an agent of the whole disaster of course to expose barbara had been just of course it was true of course it was a great wrong that had been done to phil to all of them in his wrongful conviction a wrong now put right at least partially thanks to the wormcam the light of other days but it wasnt justice or truth or tightness that mae wanted nobody did why couldnt these people who so loved the wormcam see that all mae wanted was con solation her intent was clear from the start then it was to find somebody new to hate she could never hate barbara of course despite what shed done she was still barbara bound to mae as if by a steel cable so maes focus shifted as she deepened and devel oped her thinking at first she had fixed her attention on fbi agent ma vens the man who might have found the truth in the first place in the old prewormcam days but that wasnt appropriate of course he had been literally an agent dumbly pursuing his job with whatever technol ogy had been available to him the technology itself thenthe ubiquitous worm cam but to hate a mere piece of machinery was shal low unsatisfying she couldnt hate things she had to hate people hiram patterson of course he had blighted the human race with his monstrous truth machine for no purpose she could detect other than profit as if incidentally the machine had even destroyed the religion that had once brought her comfort hiram patterson it took david three days intensive work at the worm works to link the federal labs trace software to an op erational wormhole then he went to bobbys apartment he searched it until he found clinging to a cushion a single hair from bobbys head he had its dna sequenced at another of hirams facilities the first image bright and clear in his softscreen arthur c clarke and stephen baxter was of the hair itself lying unremarked on its cushion david began to track back in rime he had devised a way to make the viewpoint effectively fastrewind into the pastin reality a succession of fresh wormholes was being established back along the worldline of dna molecules from the hair he accelerated days and nights passing in a blur of gray still the hair and the cushion sat unchanging at he center of the image there was a flurry of motion he backed up reestablished the image and allowed it to run forward at normal pace the date was more than three years in the past he saw bobby kate mary they were standing talking earnestly mary was halfconcealed by a smartshroud they were preparing their disappearance he realized swiftly already by this point they had all three left the lives of david and heather the test was over the trace worked he could track forward approaching the present until he located bobby and the others but perhaps that was best left to spe cial agent mavens his test concluded he prepared to shut down the wormcamthen on a whim david arranged the wormcam image so that it centered on bobbys face as if an invisible camera had hovered there just before his eyes through the entirety of his young life and david began to scan back he kept the speed high as the crucial moments of bobbys recent life unraveled at the court with kate in he wormworks with david himself arguing with his father crying in kates arms braving the virtual citadel of billybob meeks david increased the pace of the rewind further still fixing on the face of his brother he saw bobby eat laugh sleep play make love the background the nick ering light of night and day became a blur an irrelevant frame to that face and expressions passed so rapidly the light of other days across the face that they too became smoothed out so that bobbys face looked permanently in repose his eyes halfclosed as if he was sleeping summer light came and went like tides and every so often with a sudden ness that startled david bobbys hairstyle would change from short to long natural dark to blond even at one point to a shavenhead crewcut and as the years unwound bobbys skin lost the lines he had acquired around his mouth and eyes and a youthful smoothness lapped over his bones impercep tibly at first and then more rapidly his deaging face softened and shrank as if simplifying those flickering halfopen eyes growing rounder and more innocent the shadows beyondof adults and huge unidentifiable placesmore formidable david froze the image a few days after bobbys birth the round formless face of a baby stared out at him blue eyes wide and empty as windows but behind him david did not see the maternity hospital scene he had expected bobby was in a place of harsh fluorescents gleaming walls elaborate equip ment expensive testing gear and greencoated techni cians it looked like a laboratory of some kind tentatively david ran the image forward somebody was holding the infant bobby in the air gloved hands under the childs armpits with practiced ease david swiveled the viewpoint expecting to see a younger heather or even hiram he saw neither the smiling face before him looming like the moon was of a middleaged man greying stdn wrinkled and brown distinctively japanese it was a face david knew and suddenly he under stood the circumstances of bobbys birth and many other things beside he stared at the image a long while considering what to do arthur c clarke and stephen baxter mae knew better maybe than anybody alive that it wasnt necessary to injure somebody physically to hurt him she hadnt been directly involved in the horrific crime which had destroyed her family she hadnt even been in the city at the time hadnt seen so much as a blood stain but now everybody else was dead and she was the one who must carry all the hurt on her own for the rest of her life so to get to hiram to make him suffer as she did she had to hurt the one hiram loved the most it didnt take much study of hiram the most public man on the planet to figure out who that was bobby patterson his golden son and of course it must be done in such a way that hiram would know he was responsible ultimatelyjust as mae had been that was the way to make the hurt deepest of all slowly in the dark hollows of her mind she drew up her plans she was careful she had no intention of following her husband and daughter to the cell with the needle she knew that as soon as the crime was committed the authorities would use the wonncam to scan back through her life looking for evidence that shed planned the crime and for intent she must never forget that fact it was as if she was on an open stage her every action being monitored and recorded and analyzed by expert observers from the fu ture taking notes all around her just out of the light she couldnt conceal her actions so she had to make it look like a crime of passion she knew she even had to pretend she was unaware of the future scrutiny itself if it looked like an act it wouldnt convince anybody so she kept doing all the the light of other days private natural things everybody did farting and picking her nose and masturbating trying to show no more awareness of scrutiny than anybody else in this glass walled age she had to gather information of course but it was possible to conceal even that in the open too hiram and bobby were after all two of the most famous people on the planet she could appear not an obsessive stalker but a lonely widow comforted by tv shows about fa mous peoples lives after a time she thought she found a way to reach them it meant a new career but again it was nothing un usual this was an age of paranoia ofwatchfulness per sonal security had become common a booming industry an attractive career for valid reasons for many people she began to exercise to strengthen her body to train her mind she took jobs elsewhere guarding people and their property unconnected with hiram and his empire she wrote nothing down said nothing aloud as she slowly changed the trajectory jf her life she tried to make each incremental step seem natural driven by a logic of its own as if she was almost by accident drift ing toward hiram and bobby and meanwhile she watched bobby over and over through his gilded boyhood to his growth into a man he was hirams monster but he was a beautiful creature and she came to feel she knew him she was going to destroy him but as she spent her waking hours with bobby against her will he was lodg ing in her heart in the hollow places there refugees bobby and kate seeking mary made their cautious way along oxford street three years ago soon after delivering the pair of them to a refugee cell mary had disappeared out of their lives that wasnt so unusual the loose network of refugees spread worldwide worked on the cellorganization basis of the old terrorist groups but recently concerned hed had no news of his half sister for many months bobby had tracked her down to london and today he had been assured he would meet her the london sky overhead was a gray smoggy lid threatening rain it was a summers day but neither hot nor cold an irritating urban nothingness bobby felt an noyingly hot inside his smartshroudwhich of course had to be kept sealed up at all times bobby and kate slid with smooth unremarkable steps from group to group with practiced skill they would join a transient crowd worm their way to the center then as it broke up they would set off again always in a different direction from the way they had come if there was no other choice they would even go backward retracing their steps their progress was slow but it was all but impossible for any wormcam observer to trace them for more than a few pacesa strategy so effective in fact that bobby wondered how many other refugees the light of other days there were here today moving through the crowds like ghosts it was obvious that despite climate collapse and gen eral poverty london still attracted tourists people still came here presumably to visit the an galleries and see he ancient sites and palaces now vacated by englands royals decanted to a sunnier throne in monarchist aus tralia but it was also sadly clear that this was a city that had seen better days most of the shops were unfronted bargain bazaars and there were several empty lots gaps like teeth missing from an old mans smile still the sidewalks of this thoroughfare an eastwest artery that had long been one of the citys main shopping areas were crowded with dense sluggish rivers of humanity and that made diem a good place to hide but bobby did not enjoy the press of flesh around him four years after kate had turned off his implant he knew he was still too easily startledand too easily re pulsed by unwelcome brushes with his fellow humans he was particularly offended by unwitting contact with the bellies and flabby buttocks of the many middleaged japanese here a nation who seemed to have responded to the wormcam with a mass conversion to nudity now above the hubbub of conversation around them he made out a shout oi move it ahead of them people parted scattering as if some angry animal were forcing its way through bobby pulled kate into a shop doorway through the corridor of annoyed humanity came a rickshaw it was hauled by a fat londoner stripped to the waist with big slicks of sweat under his pillowy breasts the woman in the rickshaw talking into a wrist implant might have been american when the rickshaw had passed bobby and kate joined me flow which was forming anew bobby shifted his hand so that his fingers were brushing kates palm and began to handspell charming guy arthur c clarke and stephen baxter not his fault kate replied look around probably rickshaw guy once chancellor of exchequer they pressed on further making their way east toward oxford streets junction with tottenham court road the crowds thinned a little as they left oxford circus behind and kate and bobby moved more cautiously and quickly aware of their exposure bobby made sure he was aware of escape routes several avenues available at any moment kate wore her shroud hood a little open but beneath it her heat mask was smooth and anonymous when she stood still the shrouds hologram projectors throwing images of the background around her would stabilize and make her reasonably invisible from any angle around hera good illusion at least until she began to move again and processing lag caused her fake image to fragment and blur but despite its limitations a smartshroud might throw off a careless or distracted wormcam operator and so it was worth wearing in the same spirit bobby and kate were today both wearing their heat masks molded to seamless anonym ity the masks gave off false infrared signatures and were profoundly uncomfortable with their builtin heat ing elements warm against bobbys skin it was possible to wear allover body masks working on the same prin ciplesome of which were capable of masking a mans characteristic ir signature as a womans and vice versa but bobby having tried the requisite jockstrap laced with heating wires had drawn back before reaching that particular plateau of discomfort they passed one smartlooking town house presum ably converted from a shop which had had its walls replaced by clear glass panes looking into the brightly lit rooms bobby could see that even the floors and ceil ings were transparent as was much of the furniture even the bathroom suite people moved through the rooms naked apparently oblivious of the stares of peo ple outside this minimal home was yet another re the light of other days sponse to wormcam scrutiny an inyourface statement that the occupants really didnt care who was looking at themas well as a constant reminder to the occupants themselves that any apparent privacy was now and for ever illusory at the junction with tottenham court road they ap proached the center point ruin a tower block never fully occupied then wrecked during the worst of the scottishseparatist terrorism problem and it was here that bobby and kate were met as they had been promised a shimmering outline blocked bobbys path he glimpsed a heat mask within an open shroud hood and a hand stretched out toward his it took him a few sec onds to tune into the others fast confident handspelling i am i am bobby flipped his hand over and replied got you me other good whew good at last the reply came brisk and sure come now the stranger led them off the main street and into a maze of alleys bobby and kate still holding hands kept to the sides of the street sticking to the shadows wherever they could but they avoided the doorways most of whichbefore doors heavily boltedwere oc cupied by panhandlers bobby slipped his hand into the strangers think i know you the others hand with an iconic form registered alarm so much for shrouds and numbers bloody use less she meant the anonymous id number each member of the worldwide informal network of refugee tribes was encouraged to adopt each day the numbers were provided on demand from a central source accessible by wormcam rumored to be a random number generator buried in a disused mine in montana based on uncrack able quantummechanical principles not that he signed back arthur c clarke and stephen baxter what then shape of big fat arse cant conceal even with shroud bobby suppressed a laugh that was confirmation enough that was who he thought a woman southern english somewhere in her sixties barrel shaped goodhumored confident recognize style handspell style she made an acknowledgment sign yes yes yes heard that before must change cant change everything no but can try the handspelling alphabets with the fingertips brush ing the palms and fingers of the recipients hands had originally been developed for people afflicted with both deafness and blindness they had been adopted and adapted eagerly by wbrmcam refugees handspelling communication taking place inside cupped hands was almost impossible to decipher by an observer almost but not quite nothing was foolproof and bobby was always aware that wormcam observers had the luxury of looking back into the past and rerun ning anything they missed as often as they liked from whatever angle and in as tight a closeup as they chose but there was no need for the refugees to make the lives of the snoops any easier than they had to bobby knew from scraps of gossip and acquaintance that was a grandmother she had retired from her profession a few years earlier and had no criminal record or experience of unwelcome surveillance activ ity or any other obvious reason to go underground like in fact many of the refugees he had met during his years on the run she just didnt want people looking at her at last brought them to a door with a silent gesture their guide had bobby and kate stop here and adjust their shrouds and heat masks to ensure noth ing of themselves was showing the door opened revealing only darkness the light of other days and then in a final misdirection touched them both lightly and led them farther down the street bobby looked back and saw the door closing si lently a hundred meters further on they came to a second door which opened to admit them into a well of dark ness take it easy step step step two more in pitch darkness was guiding bobby and kate down a short staircase he could sense the room before him from echoes and scent it was large the walls hardplaster painted over perhapswith a sounddeadening carpet on the floor there was a scent of food and hot drinks and there were people here he could smell their mixed scent hear the soft rustle of their bodies as they moved around im getting better at this he thought another couple of years i wont need to use my eyes at all they reached the base of the stairs single room maybe fifteen meters square handspelled now two doors off at the back toilets people here eleven twelve thirteen fourteen ail adults windows opaqueable that was a common ruse rooms which were kept dark continually were liable to become re nowned as nests of refugees think okay kate spelled out now food here and beds come on she began to tug at her shroud and then at the jumpsuit she was wearing beneath with a sigh bobby began to follow suit he handed his clothes one by one to who added them to a rack he couldnt see then naked save for their heat masks they joined hands once more and entered the group all of them anonymous in their nudity bobby expected that he would even exchange his heat mask before the meeting was over the further to confuse those who might choose to watch them arthur c clarke and stephen baxter they were greeted handsmale and female notice ably different in texturefluttered at bobbys face at last somebody picked him outhe had the holistic im pression of a woman fiftyish shorter than he wasand her hands small and clumsy stroked his face hands and wrists thus touching in the darkness the refugees tenta tively explored each other recognitionsought with difficulty confirmed with caution even reluctancewas based not on names or faces or visual or audible labels but on more intangible subtler signs the shape of a per son in the dark before him her scentineradicable and characteristic despite layers of dirt or the most vigorous washingher firmness or weakness of touch her modes of communication her warmth or coolness her style at his first such encounter bobby had cowered shrinking in the dark from every touch but it was a far from unpleasant way to greet people presumablykate had diagnosed for himall this nonverbal stuff the touching and stroking appealed to some deep animal level of the human personality he began to relax to feel safe of course the anonymity of the refugee communities was sought out by cranks and criminalsand the com munities were relatively easy to infiltrate by those seek ing others who hid for good or ill but in bobbys experience the refugees were remarkably effective at selfpolicing though there was no central coordination it was in everyones interest to maintain the integrity of the local group and of the movement as a whole so bad guys were quickly identified and thrown out as were federal agents and other outsiders bobby wondered if this might be a model for how human communities might organize themselves in the wiredup wormcammed interconnected future as loose selfgoverning networks chaotic and even ineffi cient perhaps but resilient and flexible as such he sup posed the refugees were no more than an extension of the light of other days groupings like the mas networks and bombwatch and the truth squads and even earlier groupings like the am ateur sky watchers who had turned up the wormwood and with their taboos and privacy being stripped away by the wonncam perhaps humans were reverting to an earlier form of behavior the refugees spoke by grooming like chimpanzees suffused by the warmth and scent and touch and even the taste of other people these gatherings were extremely sensual and even at times eroticbobby had known more than one such gathering descend to a frank orgy though he and kate had made their apologies before getting too involved being a refugee then wasnt such a bad thing and it was certainly better than the alternatives on offer for kate but it was a shadow life it was impossible to stay in one place for very long impossible to own significant possessions impossible even to grow too close to anyone else for fear of be trayal bobby knew the nameslof only a handful of the refugees hed met in his three years underground many had become comrades offering invaluable help and ad vice especially at the beginning to the two helpless ne ophytes mary had rescued comrades yes but without a minimum of human contact it seemed they could never be true friends the wonncam couldnt necessarily deprive him of his liberty or his privacy but it seemed it could wall off his humanity suddenly kate was tugging at his arm ramming her fingers into his palm found her mary mary is here over here come come come startled bobby let himself be led forward she was sitting alone in a corner of the room bobby explored the setup lightly with his fingers arthur c clarke and stephen baxter she was clothed wearing a jumpsuit there was a plate of food cooling and untouched at her side she wasnt wearing a heat mask her eyes were closed she didnt respond to then touches but he sensed she wasnt asleep kate poked grumpily at bobbys palm might as well wear neon sign here i am come get me is she okay dont know cant tell bobby picked up his sisters limp hand massaged it and handspelled her name over and over mary mary mary mary mays bobby here bobby patterson mary mary abruptly she seemed to come awake bobby he could sense the shocked deepened silence around the room it was the first word anybody had spoken aloud since they had arrived here kate beside him reached forward and clamped her hand over marys mouth bobby found marys hand and let her spell to him sorry sorry distracted she lifted his hand to her mouth and he felt her lips pull up into a smile dis tracted and happy then but that wasnt necessarily a good thing happy meant careless what happened to you her smile broadened not supposed to be happy big brother know what i mean implant she replied simply implant what implant cortical oh he thought dismayed rapidly he relayed the in formation to kate shit bad shit kate signed illegal know that jamaica mary signed to him now what cell friend in jamaica see through his eyes hear the light of other days through his ears better than london marys touch in his hand was delicate an analogue of a whisper the new cortical implants adapted from neural implant vr apparatus were the final expression of wormcam technology a small squeezedvacuum worm hole generator together with neural sensor apparatus buried deep in the cortex of the recipient the generator was laced with neurotropic chemicals so that over sev eral months the recipients neurons would grow path ways into the generator and the neural sensor was a highly sensitive neuron activity pattern analyzer capable of pinpointing individual neuronal synapses such an implant could read and write to a brain and link it to others by a conscious effort of will an implant recipient could establish a wormcam connection from the center of her own mind to any other recipients armed with the implants a new linked community was emerging from the arenas and the truth squads and other swirling maelstroms of thought and discussion that had come to characterize the new young worldwide polity brains joined to brains linds linked they called themselves the joined it was bobby supposed a bright new future what it amounted to here and now however was an eighteen yearold girl his sister with a wormhole in her head you scared signed mary now horror stories group mind lose soul blah blah hell yes fear unknown maybe but suddenly mary pulled back from him and got to her feet bobby reached out blindly found her head but she pulled away was gone all over the room at exactly the same moment others had moved it was like a flock of birds rising as one from a tree there were slivers of light as the front door was opened come on bobby signed he grabbed kates hand and arthur c clarke and stephen baxter they made their way with the rest toward the door scared kate signed as they walked hurriedly you scared cold palm pulse can tell he was scared he conceded but not of the abrupt detection they had been through situations like this be fore and a group in a safe house like this always had an elaborate system of wonncamequipped sentries no it wasnt detection or even capture he was scared of it was the way mary and the others had acted as one a single organism joined he slid into his shroud the grandmothers in the wormworks david sat before a large wall mounted softscreen hirams face peered out at him a younger hiram a softer facebut indubitably hiram the face was framed by a dimly lit urban landscape decaying housing blocks and immense road systems a place that seemed to have been designed to exclude human beings this was the outskirts of birmingham a great city at the heart of england just before the end of the twentieth cen turysome years before hirarn had abandoned this old decaying country in hope of a better opportunity in america david had succeeded in combining michael mavens dnatrace facility with a wormcam guidance system and he had extended it to cross the generations so just as he had managed to scan back along the line of bobbys life now he had traced back to bobbys father the originator of bobbys dna and now driven by curiosity he intended to go fur ther back yet tracing his own rootswhich was in the end the only history that mattered in the darkness of the cavernous lab a shadow drifted across the wall sourceless he caught it in his peripheral vision ignored it he knew it was bobby his brother david didnt know why bobby was here he would join david when he was ready arthur c clarke and stephen baxter david wrapped his fingers around a small joystick control and pressed it forward hirams face smoothed out growing younger the back ground became a blur around him a blizzard of days and nights dimly visible buildingssuddenly replaced by graygreen plains the fen country where hiram grew up soon hirams face shrank on itself became innocent boyish and shriveled in a moment to an infant and it was replaced suddenly by a womans face the woman was smiling at davidor rather at some body behind the invisible wormhole viewpoint which hovered before her eyes he had chosen from this point to follow the line of mitochondrial dna passed un changed from mother to daughterand so this was of course his grandmother she was young midtwenties of course she was young the dna trace would have switched to hei from hiram at the instant of his concep tion mercifully he would not see these grandmothers grow old she was beautiful in a quiet way with a look that he thought of as classically english high cheek bones blue eyes strawberry blond hair tied up into a tight bun hirams asian ancestry had come from his fathers line david wondered what difficulty that love affair had caused this pretty young woman in such a time and place and behind him in the wormworks he sensed that shadow drifting closer he pressed at the joystick and the rattle of days and nights resumed the face grew girlish its changing hair style fluttering at the edge of visibility then the face seemed to lose its form becoming blurredbursts of adolescent puppy fatbefore shrinking into the form lessness of infancy another abrupt transition his greatgrandmother then this young woman was in an office frowning the light of other days concentrating her hair a ridiculously elaborate sculpture of tightly coiled plaits in the background david glimpsed more women mostly young toiling in rows at clumsy mechanical calculators laboriously turning keys and levers and handles this must be the s decades before the birth of the silicon computer this was perhaps as complex an information processing center as any where on the planet already this past so close to his own time was a foreign country he thought he released the girl from her time trap and she im ploded into infancy soon another young woman stared out at him she was dressed in a long skirt and illfitting badly made blouse she was waving a british union flag and she was being embraced by a soldier in a flat tin helmet the street behind her was crowded men in suits and caps and overalls the women in long coats it was raining a dismal autumnal day but nobody seemed to mind november david said aloud the armistice the end of four years of bloody slaughter in europe not a bad night to be conceived he turned dont you think bobby the shadow motionless against the wall seemed to hesitate then it separated moved freely took on the outline of a human form hands and face appeared hov ering disembodied hello david sit with me david said his brother sat with a rustle of smartshroud smart cloth he seemed awkward as if unused to being so close to anybody in the open it didnt matter david demanded nothing of him the armistice day girls face smoothed diminished shrank to an infant and there was another transition a girl with some of the looks of her descendants the blue eyes and strawberry hair but thinner paler her cheeks hollow shedding her years she moved through a blur of dark urban scenesfactories and terraced houses arthur c clarke and stephen baxter and then a flash of childhood another generation an other girl the same dismal landscape they seem so young bobby murmured his voice was scratchy as if long unused i think were going to have to get used to that da vid said grimly were already deep in the nineteenth century the great medical advances are being lost and hygiene awareness is rudimentary people are dying of simple curable diseases and of course were following a line of women who at least lived long enough to reach childbearing age we arent glimpsing their sisters who died in infancy leaving no descendants the generations fell away faces deflating like bal loons one after the other subtly changing from gener ation to generation slow genetic drift working here was a girl whose scarred face was marked by tears at the moment she gave birth her baby had been taken from her david sawor rather in this time reversed view given to hermoments after the birth her pregnancy unraveled in misery and shame until they reached the moment that denned her life a brutal rape committed it seemed by a family member a brother or uncle cleansed of that darkness the girl grew younger pretty smiling her face filling with hope despite the squalor of her life as she found beauty in simplicity a flowers brief bloom the shape of a cloud i the world must be full of such anguished biographies david thought unraveling as they sank into the past effects preceding cause pain and despair falling away as the blankness of childhood approached suddenly the background changed again now around this new grandmothers face some ten genera tions remote there was countryside small fields pigs and cows scratching at the ground a multitude of grimy children the woman was careworn gaptoothed her face lined appearing oldbut david knew she could be no more than thirtyfive or forty our ancestors were farmers bobby said the light of other days most everybody was before the great migrations to the cities but the industrial revolution is unwinding they probably cant even make steel the seasons pulsed summer and winter light and dark and the generations of women daughter to mother followed their slower cycle from careworn parent to bright maiden to wideeyed child some of the women erupted onto the screen with faces twisted in pain they were those unfortunates increasingly more common who had died in childbirth history withdrew the centuries were receding the world emptying of people elsewhere the europeans were drawing back from the americas soon to forget those great continents even existed and me golden hordegreat armies of mongols and tartars their corpses leaping from the groundwas reforming and drawing back into central asia none of that touched these toiling english peasants without education or books working the same piece of ground for generation on generation people to whom david reflected the local collector of tithes would be a far more formidable figure than tamerlaine or kublai khan if the wormcam had shown nothing else he thought it was this with pitiless clarity that the lives of most humans had been miserable and short deprived of freedom and joy and comfort their brief moments in the light reduced to sentences to be endured at last around the framed face of one girlhair mat ted and dark skin sallow expression ratlike wary there was an abrupt blur of scenery they glimpsed dis mal countryside a ragged family of refugees walking endlesslyand here and there heaps of corpses burning a plague bobby said yes they are forced to flee but there is nowhere to go soon the image stabilized on another anonymous scrap of land set in a huge flat landscape and once more arthur c clarke and stephen baxter the generations of toil so calamitously interrupted re sumed on the horizon there was a norman cathedral an im mense brooding sandstone box if this was the fens the great plain to the east of england then that could be ely already centuries old the great construction looked like a giant sandstone spaceship which had descended from the sky and it must utterly have dominated the mental landscapes of these toiling peoplewhich was of course its purpose but even the great cathedral began to shrink collaps ing with startling swiftness into smaller simpler forms at last disappearing from view altogether and the numbers of people were still falling the great tide of humanity drawing back all over the planet the norman invaders must already have dismantled their great keeps and castles and withdrawn to france soon the waves of invaders from scandinavia and europe would return home from britain farther afield as the death and birth of muhammad approached the muslims were withdrawing from northern africa by the time christ was brought down from the cross there would be only around a hundred million people left in all the world less than half the population of the united states of davids day as the faces of their ancestors pulsed by there was another change of scene a brief migration now these remote families scratched at a land of ruinslow walls exposed cellars the ground littered with blocks of mar ble and other building stone then buildings grew like timelapsed flowers the scattered stones coalescing david paused he fixed on the face of a woman his own remote ancestor some eighty generations removed she was perhaps forty handsome her strawberry hair tinged with gray her eyes blue her nose was proudly prominent romanesque behind her the dismal fields had vanished to be re the light of other days placed by an orderly townscape a square surrounded by colonnades and statues and tall buildings their roofs tiled red the square was crowded with stalls vendors frozen in the act of hawking their wares the vendors seemed comical so intent were they on their slivers of meaningless profit all unaware of die desolate ages that lay in their own near future their own imminent deaths a roman settlement bobby said yes david pointed at me screen i think this is the forum that is probably the basilica the town hall and law courts these rows of colonnades lead to shops and offices and the building over there might be a tem ple it looks so orderly bobby murmured even mod em streets and buildings offices and shops you can see its all set out on a rectangular grid like manhattan i feel as if i could walk into me screen and go look for a bar the contrast of this little island of civilization with the centurieswide sea of ignorance and toil that sur rounded it was so striking tha david felt a reluctance to leave it youre taking a risk to come here he said bobbys face hovering above the shroud was like an eerie mask illuminated by die frozen smile of his distant grandmother i know that and i know youve been helping the fbi the dna trace david sighed if not me somebody else would have developed it at least this way i know what theyre up to he tapped his softscreen a border of smaller im ages lit up around the image of the grandmother here wormcam views of all the neighboring rooms and the corridors this aerial view shows the parking lot ive mixed in infrared recognition if anybody approaches thanks its been too long brother i havent forgotten the way you helped me through my own crisis my brush with addiction arthur c clarke and stephen baxter we all have crises it was nothing on the contrary you havent told me why youve come here bobby shrugged the movement inside his shroud a shadowy blur i know youve been looking for us im alive and well and so is kate and happy bobby smiled if i wanted happy i could just turn on the chip in my head theres more to life than hap piness david i want you to take a message to heather david frowned is it about mary is she hurt no no not exactly bobby rubbed his face hot in his smartshroud shes become one of the joined were going to try to get her to come home i want you to help me set it up it was disturbing news of course you can trust me bobby grinned i know it otherwise i wouldnt have come and i david thought uneasily have since we last met discovered something momentous about you he looked into bobbys open curious face lit up by a day two millennia gone was this the time to hit bobby with another revelation about hirams endless tinkering with his lifeperhaps indeed the greatest crime hiram had committed against his son later he thought later there will be a moment and besides the wormcam image still glowed on the screen enticing alien utterly irresistible the worm cam in all its manifestations had changed the world but none of that mattered he thought compared to this the power of the technology to reveal what had been thought lost forever there would be time enough for life for their complex affairs to deal with the unshaped future for now his tory beckoned he took the joystick pushing it forward and the roman buildings evaporated like snowflakes in the sun the light of other days another brief blur of migrations and now here was a new breed of ancestor still with the characteristic straw berry hair and blue eyes but with no trace of the ro manesque nose around the flickering faces david glimpsed fields small and rectangular worked by ploughs drawn by oxen or even in poorer times by humans there were timber granaries sheep and pigs cattle and goats be yond the grouped fields he saw earthwork banks making the area into a fortbut abruptly as they sank deeper into the past the earthworks were replaced by a cruder wooden palisade bobby said the worlds getting simpler yes how did francis bacon put it the good effects wrought by founders of cities lawgivers fathers of the people extirpers of tyrants and heroes of that class extend but for short times whereas the work of the inventor though a thing of less pomp and show is felt everywhere and lasts forever right about now the trojan war is being fought with bronze weapons but bronze breaks easily which is why that war lasted twenty years with comparatively few casualties we for got how to make iron so we cant kill each other as efficiently as we used to the earnest toil in the fields continued largely un changing from generation to generation the sheep and cattle though domesticated looked like much wilder breeds a hundred and fifty generations deep and the bronze tools gave way at last to stone but the stoneworked fields were little changed as the pace of historical change slowed david let them fall faster two hundred three hundred generations passed the fleeing faces blur ring one into the other slowly molded by time and toil and the mixing of genes arthur c clarke and stephen baxter but soon it will mean nothing david thought bleaklynothing after wormwood day on that dark morning at of this patient struggle the toil of billions of small lives will be obliterated all we have learned and built will be lost and there may not even be minds to remember to mourn and times wall was close much closer even than the roman spring they had glimpsed so little history might be left to play itself out suddenly it was an unbearable thought as if he had imaginatively absorbed the reality of the wormwood for the first time we must find a way to push it aside he s thought for the sake of these others the old ones who stare out at us through the wormcam we must not lose the meaning of their vanished lives and then suddenly the background was a blur once more f bobby said weve become nomads where are we david tapped a reference panel northern europe t we forgot how to do agriculture the towns and settle ments have dispersed no more empires no cities hu mans are pretty rare beasts and we live in nomadic groups and clans settlements that last a season or two at best twelve thousand years deep he paused the scan she might have been fifteen years old and there was a round sigil of some kind crudely tattooed onto her left cheek she looked in rude health she carried a baby jg swaddled in animal hidemy remote greatuncle david f thought absentlyand she was stroking its round cheek she wore shoes leggings a heavy cloak of plaited grasses her other garments seemed to have been stitched together from strips of skin there was grass stuffed into her shoes and under her hat presumably for insulation cradling her baby she was walking after a group of t others men women with infants children they were making their way up a shallow sloping ridge of rock they were walking casually easily a pace that seemed destined to carry them many kilometers but some of the the light of other days adults had flinttipped spears at the ready presumably as a guard against animal attack rather than any human threat she topped the ridge david and bobby riding at their grandmothers shoulder looked with her over the land beyond oh my david said oh my they were looking down over a broad sweeping plain in the far distance perhaps the north there were mountains dark and brooding striped with the glaring white of glaciers the sky was crystal blue the sun high there was no smoke no tracery of fields no fencing all the marks made by humans had been erased from mis chill world but the valley was not empty it was like a carpet thought david a moving car pet of boulderlike bodies each coated in long red brown fur that dangled to the ground like the fur of a musk ox they moved slowly feeding all the while me greater herd made up of scattered groups at the near fringe of the herd one of me young broke away from its parent incautiously and began to paw at the ground a wolf gaunt whitefiurred crept forward the calfs mother broke from the pack curved tusks flashing the wolf fled mammoth david said there must be tens of thousands of them and what are they some kind of deer are those camels and oh my godi think its a sabertoothed cat lions and tigers and bears david said do you want to go on yes yes lets go on the ice age valley disappeared as if into mist and only the human faces remained falling away like the leaves of a calendar still david felt he could recognize the faces of his ancestors round almost always devastatingly young arthur c clarke and stephen baxter when giving birth and still retaining that signature of blue eyes and strawberryblond hair but the world had changed dramatically great storms battered the sky some lasting years the ancestors struggled across landscapes of ice or drought even desert starving thirsty never healthy weve been lucky david said weve had millen nia of comparative climate stability time enough to fig ure out agriculture and build our cities and conquer the world before that this so very fragile bobby said wondering more than a thousand generations deep the faces be gan to grow darker were migrating south bobby said losing our ad aptation to the colder climates are we going back to africa yes david smiled were going home and in a dozen more generations as this first great migration was undone the images began to stabilize this was the southern tip of africa east of the cape of good hope the ancestral group had reached a cave close to a beach from which thick tan sedimentary rocks protruded it seemed a generous place grassland and forest dominated by bushes and trees with huge colorful thistly flowers lapped right down to the seas edge the ocean was calm and seabirds wheeled overhead the intertidal shoreline was rich with kelp jellyfish and stranded cuttlefish there was game in the forest at first they glimpsed familiar creatures like eland springbok elephant and wild pig but deeper in time there were more unfamiliar species longhomed buffalo giant hartebeest a kind of giant horse striped like a zebra and here in these unremarkable caves the ancestors stayed generation on generation the pace of change was now terribly slow at first the ancestors wore clothes butas hundreds of gener the light of other days ations withered awaythe clothing was of decreasing quality reducing at last to simple skin bags tied around naked waists and at length not even that they would hunt with stonetipped spears and hand axes no longer with arrows but the stone tools too were of increasing coarseness the hunting less ambitious often no more than a patchy attempt to finish off a wounded eland in the caveswhose floors gradually sank deeper over the millennia as successive layers of human detri tus were removedat first there was something like the sophistication of a human society there was even art images of animals and people laboriously layered on the walls with dyestained fingers but at last more than twelve hundred generations deep the walls became blank the last crude images scraped away david shivered he had reached a world without art mere were no pictures no novels no sculptures perhaps not even songs or poetry the world was draining of mind deeper and deeper they fell through three four thou sand generations an immense desert of time crossed by a chain of ancestors who bred and squabbled in this un adorned cave the succession of grandmothers showed little meaningful changebut david thought he detected an increasing vagueness a bewilderment even a state of habitual uncomprehending fear in those dark faces at last there was a sudden jarring discontinuity and this time it was not the landscape that changed but the ancestral face itself david slowed the fall and the brothers stared at this most remote grandmother peering from the mouth of the african cave her descendants would inhabit for thousands of generations her face was outsized with her eyes too far apart nose flattened and features spread too wide as if the whole face had been pulled wide her jaw was thick but her chin was shallow and sliced back and bulging arthur c clarke and stephen baxter out of her forehead was an immense brow a bony swell ing like a tumor pushing down the face beneath it aod making the eyes sunken in their huge hardboned sock ets a swelling at the back of her head offset the weight of that huge brow but it tilted her head downward so that her chin almost rested on her chest her massive neck snaking forward but her eyes were clear and knowing she was more human than any ape and yet she was not human and it was that degree of closeness yet dif ference which disturbed him she was unmistakably neandertal shes beautiful bobby said yes david breathed this is going to send the pa leontologists back to the drawing board he smiled rel ishing the idea and he wondered suddenly how many watchers from his own far future would be studying him and his brother even now as they became me first humans to confront their own deep ancestors he supposed he could never begin to imagine their forms the tools they used their thoughtseven as this neandertal grand mother could surely never have envisaged this lab his halfinvisible brother the gleaming gadgets here and beyond those watchers still further into the future mere must be others watching them in turn and on off into me still more unimaginable future as long as humanityor those who followed humans persisted it was a chilling crushing thought all of it supposing the wormwood spared anybody at all oh bobby whispered he sounded disap pointed what is it its not your fault i knew the risk there was a rustle of cloth a blurred shadow david turned bobby had gone but here was hiram storming into the lab clattering the light of other days doors and yelling i got them bugger me i got them he slapped david on the back that dna trace worked like a charm manzoni and mary the pair of them he raised his head you hear me bobby i know youre here got them and if you want to see either of them again you have to come to me you got that david stared into the deep eyes of his lost ancestora member of a different species five thousand generations removed from himselfand cleared down the soft screen j i family history when she was forcibly restored to open human so ciety kate was relieved to find shed been cleared of the criminal conviction brought against her but she was stunned to find she was taken away from mary her friends and immediately incarceratedby hiram pat terson the door to the suite opened as it did twice a day there stood her guard a woman tall willowy dressed in a sober businesslike trouser suit she was even beauti fulbut with a deadness of expression and in her dark eyes that kate found chilling her name kate had learned was mac wilson wilson pushed a small trolley through the door hauled out yesterdays cast a fast professional glance around the room then shut the door and that was that over without a word kate had been sitting on the rooms sole piece of fur niture a bed now she got up and crossed to the trolley pulled back its white paper cover there was cold meat salad bread fruit and drinks a flask of coffee bottled water orange juice on a lower deck there was laundry fresh underwear jumpsuits sheets for kates bed the usual stuff kate had long exhausted me possibilities of the twice daily trolley the paper plates and plastic cutlery were the light of other days i useless for anything but their primary purpose and a nearly useless for that even the wheels of the trolley were of soft plastic f she went back to her bed and sat desultorily munching h on a peach the rest of the room was just as unpromising the walls were seamless coated with a clear plastic she couldnt dig her nails through there wasnt even a light fitting the gray glow that flooded the roomtwenty four hours a daycame from fluorescents behind ceiling panels sealed off behind plastic and anyhow out of her reach the bed was a plastic box seamlessly attached to the floor shed tried ripping me sheets but the fabric was too tough and anyhow she wasnt yet ready to visualize herself garrotting anybody even wilson the plumbing a john and a shower fixture was like wise of no value to her greater purpose the toilet was chemical and it seemed to lead to a sealed tank so she couldnt even smuggle out a message in her bodily wasteeven supposing she could figure out how but despite all that she had come close to escape once it was enjoyable to replay her neartriumph in her mind shed concocted the scheme in her head where even me wormcam couldnt yet peer shed worked on her preparations for over a week every twelve hours she had left the food trolley in a slightly different place just that fraction further inside the room she choreo graphed each setup in her head three paces from bed to door cut the second pace by that fraction more and each time shed come to the door to collect the trolley wilson had been forced to reach a little further until at last there came a time when wilson to reach the trolley had to take a single pace into the room just a pace that was allbut kate hoped it would be enough two running steps took her to the doorway a shoul der charge knocked wilson forward into the room and arthur c clarke and stephen baxter kate made it as far as two paces out the door her room turned out to be just a box standing alone in a giant hangarsized chamber the walls high and re mote and dimly lit there were other guards ail around her men and women getting up from desks drawing weapons kate looked around frantically seeking a place to run the hand that had closed on hers was like a vise her little finger was twisted back and her arm bent sideways kate fell to her knees unable to keep from screaming and she felt bones in her finger break in an explosion of grinding pain it was of course wilson when shed come to she was on the floor of her prison bound there with what felt like duct tape while a medic treated her hand wilson was being held back by another of the guards with a murderous look on that steely face when it was done kate had a finger that throbbed for weeks and wilson when she next came to the door on her twicedaily routine fixed kate with a glare full of hate wounded her pride kate realized next time she will kill me without hesitation but it was clear to kate that even after her attempted escape all that hate wasnt directed at her she won dered who was wilsons real targetand if hiram knew in the same way she knew she had never been hirams real target she was just bait bait in a trap she was just in the way of these crazy people with their unguessable agendas it did no good to brood on such things she lay back on her bed later in the routine shed used to structure her empty days shed take some exercise for now sus pended in light that was never quenched she tried to blank her mind a hand touched hers the ught of other days amid the chaos and recrimination and anger that fol lowed the retrieval of mary and kate david asked to see mary in the cool calm of the wormworks he was immediately jotted by the familiarity of marys blue eyes so like the eyes he had followed deep into time all me way back to africa he shivered with a sense of the evanescence of human life was mary really no more than the transient mani festation of genes which had been passed to her through thousands of generations even from the longgone neandertal days genes which she in turn would pass on into an unknown future but the wormcam had de stroyed that dismal perspective marys life was tran sient but no less meaningful for that and now that the past was opened up she would surely be remembered cherished by those who would follow and her life shaped in a fastchanging world might yet take her to places he couldnt even imagine she said you look worriedl thats because im not sure who im speaking to she snorted and for an instant he saw the old rebel lious discontented mary forgive my ignorance david said im just trying to understand we all are this is something new to us she nodded and therefore something to fear yes she said eventually yes then were here the wonnhole in my head never shuts down david every thing i do everything i see and hear and feel everything i think is shared yes she studied him but i know what you imply by that diluted right but it isnt like that im no less me but i am enhanced its just another layer of mind or of information processing if you like layered over my central nervous system the way the cns is layered arthur c clarke and stephen baxter over older networks like the biochemical my memories are still mine does it matter if they are stored in some body elses head but this isnt just some kind of neat mobile phone network is it you joined make higher claims than that is there a new person in all this a new combined youl a group mind linked by wormholes emergent from the network you think that would be a monstrosity dont you i dont know what to think about it he studied her trying to grasp mary within the shell of joinedness it didnt help that the joined had quickly become re nowned as consummate actorsor liars to be more blunt thanks to their detached layers of consciousness each of them had a mastery over their body language the muscles of their facesa power over communication channels that had evolved to transmit information reli ably and honestlythat could beat out the most expert thespian he had no reason to suppose mary was lying to him today it was just that he couldnt see how he could tell if she was or not she said now why dont you ask me what you really want to know disturbed he said very well maryhow does it feeir she said slowly the same justmore its like coming fully awakea feeling of clarity of full con sciousness you must know ive never been a scientist but ive solved puzzles i play chess for instance sci ence is something like that isnt it you figure some thing outsuddenly see how the game fits together its as if the clouds clear just for a moment and you can see far much farther than before yes he said ive had a few moments like that in my life ive been fortunate she squeezed his hand but for me thats how it feels all the time isnt that wonderful the light of other days do you understand why people fear you they do more than fear us she said calmly they hunt us down they attack us but they cant damage us we can see them coming david that chilled him and even if one of us is killedeven ifam killedthen we the greater being will go on what does that mean the information network that defines the joined is large and growing all the time its probably indestruc tible like an internet of minds he frowned obscurely irritated have you heard of attachment theory it describes our need psychologi cally to form close relationships to reach out to inti mates we need such relationships to conceal the awful truth which we confront as we grow up that each of us is alone the greatest battle of human existence is to come to terms with that fact and that is why to be joined is so appealing but the chip in your head will not help you he said brutally not in the end for you must die alone just as i must she smiled coldly forgiving and he felt ashamed but that may not be true she said perhaps i will be able to live on survive the death of my bodyof marys body but my consciousness and memories will not be resident in one members body or another butdistributed shared amongst them all wouldnt that be wonderful he whispered and would it be you could you truly avoid death that way or would this distributed self be a copy she sighed i dont know and besides the technol ogy is some way away from realizing that until it does we will still suffer illness accident death and we will always grieve the wiser you are the more it hurts yes the human condition is tragic david the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter greater the joined becomes the more clearly i can see that and the more i feel it her face still young seemed overlaid by a ghostly mask of much greater age come with me he said theres something i want to show you kate couldnt help but jump snatch her hand away she finessed her involuntary gasp into a cough ex tended the motion of her hand to cover her mouth then delicately she returned her hand to where it had been resting on the top sheet of her bed and that gentle touch came again the fingers warm strong unmistakable despite the smartshroud glove which must cover them she felt the fingers squirm into her palm and she tried to stay still eating the peach sorry shocked you no way warn she leaned back a little seeking to conceal her own handspelling behind her back bobby who else nice prison in wormworks right yes dna trace david helped refugee methods mary helped all family together shouldn l have come she signed quickly what hiram wants get you bait in trap not abandon you need you be ready tried once guards smart sharp she risked a glimpse to her side she could see no sign of his presence not so much as a false shadow an indentation in the bedcover a hint of distortion evi dently smartshroud technology was improving as rap idly as the wormcam itself i might not get another chance she thought i must tell him bobby i saw david had news about you his signing now was slower hesitant me what me your family i cant do it she thought ask hiram she signed back feeling bitter the light of other days asking you birth your birth asking you asking you kate took a deep breath not what you believe think it through hiram wanted dynasty david big disappointment out of control mother a big inconvenience so have boy without mother dont understand i have mother heather mother she hesitated no she isnt bobby youre a clone david settled back and fixed the cold metal mindseye hoop over his head as he sank into virtual reality the world turned dark and silent and for a brief moment he had no sense of his own body couldnt even feel marys soft warm hand wrapped around his own then all around them the stars came out mary gasped and grabbed at his arm he was suspended in a threedimensional diorama of stars stars spread over a velvet black sky stars more crowded than the darkest deert nightand yet there was structure he saw slowly agreat river of light stars crammed so close they merged into glowing pale cloudsran around the equator of me sky it was the milky way of course the great disc of stars in which he was still embedded he glanced down here was his body familiar and comfortable clearly visible in the complex multiply sourced light that fell on him but he was floating in the starlight without enclosure or support mary drifted beside him still holding on to his arm her touch was comforting odd he thought we can cast our minds more than two thousand light years from earth and yet we must still grasp at each other our primate heritage never far from the doors of our souls this alien sky was populated there was a sun planet and moon here suspended arthur c clarke and stephen baxter around him like the trinity of bodies that had always dominated the human environment but it was a strange enough sunin fact not a single star like earths sun but a binary the principal was an orange giant dim and cool cen tered on a glowing yellow core it was a mass of orange gas growing steadily more tenuous there was much detail in that sullen disc a tracery of yellowwhite light that danced at the poles the ugly scars of grayblack spots around the equator but the giant star was visibly flattened it had a com panion star small and bluish little more than a point of light orbiting so close to its parent it was almost within the giants scattered outer atmosphere in fact david saw a thin streamer of gas torn from the parent and still glowing had wrapped itself around the companion and was falling to its surface a thin hellish rain of fusing hydrogen david looked down to the planet that hovered beneath his feet it was a sphere the apparent size of a beachball halfilluminated by the complex red and white light of its parent stars but it was obviously airless its surface a complex mesh of impact craters and mountain chains perhaps it had once had an atmosphere even oceans or it might have been the rocky or metallic core of a gas giant an erstwhile neptune or uranus it was even pos sible he supposed that it had harbored life if so that life was now destroyed or fled every trace of its passing scorched from the surface by the dying sun but this dead blasted world still had a moon though much smaller than its parent the moon glowed more brightly reflecting more of the complex mixed light of the twin stars and its surface appeared at first glance utterly smooth so that the little worldlet looked like a cue ball machined in some great lathe when david looked more closely however he could see there was a network of fine cracks and ridges some of them evi dently hundreds of kilometers long all across thesur the light of other days face the moon looked rather like a hardboiled egg he thought whose shell had been assiduously if gently cracked with a spoon this moon was a ball of water ice its smoothed sur face was a sign of recent global melting presumably caused by the grotesque expansion of the parent star and the ridges were seams between plates of ice and per haps like jupiters moon europa there was still a layer of liquid water somewhere beneath this deepfrozen sur face an ancient ocean that might serve as a harbor even now for retreating life he sighed nobody knew and right now nobody had the time or resources to find out there was simply too much to do too many places to go but it wasnt the rocky world or its ice moonnot even the strange double star itselfbut something much grander beyond this little stellar system which had drawn him here he turned now and looked beyond the stars the nebula spanned half the sky it was a wash of colors ranging from bright bluewhite at its center through green and orange to somber purples and reds at its periphery it was ike a giant watercolor painting he thought the colors smoothly flowing one into another he could see layers in the cloudthe tex ture the strata of shadows made it look surprisingly three dimensionalwith finer structure deeper in its heart the most striking aspect of the larger structure was a pattern of dark clouds rich with dust set out in a star tlingly clear vshape before the glowing mass like an immense bird raising black wings before a flame and before the bird shape like a sprinkling of sparks from that bonfire behind there was a thin veil of stars sepa rating him from the cloud the great river of light that was the galaxy flowed around the nebula passing be hind it as if encircling it even as he turned his head from side to side it was impossible to grasp the full scale of the structure at arthur c clarke and stephen baxter times it seemed close enough to touch like a giant dy namic wallsculpture he might reach into and explore and then it would recede apparently to infinity he knew his imagination evolved to the thousandkilometer scale of earth was inadequate to the task of grasping the immense distances involved here for if the sun was moved to the center of the nebula humans could build an interstellar empire without reach ing the edge of the cloud wonder surged in him sudden unexpected i am priv ileged he thought anew to live in such a time one day he supposed some wormcam explorer would sail be neath the icy crust of the moon and seek out whatever lay at its core and perhaps teams of investigators would scour the surface of the planet below seeking out relics of the past he envied those future explorers the depth of their knowledge and yet he knew they would surely envy his generation most of all for as he sailed outward with the expanding front of wormcam exploration david was here first and nobody else in all of history would be able to say that long story japanese lab the place he used to clone tigers for witch doctors heather just a surrogate david wormcammed it all then all that mind control hiram didn t want more mistakes heather i felt no bond know why now how sad she thought she could feel his pulse in the invisible touch at her palm yes sad sad and then without warning the door crashed open mae wilson walked in holding a pistol without hes itation she fired once twice to either side of kate the gun was silenced the shots mere pops there was a cry a patch of blood hovering in the air another like a small explosion where the bullet exited bobbys body the light of other days kate tried to stand but the nozzle of wilsons eufl was at the back of her head dont even think about it bobbys shroud was failing is great concentric cu cles of distortion and shadow that spread around his wounds kate could see he was trying to get to the doof but there were more of hirams goons there he would have no way through now hiram himself arrived at the door his facfi twisted with unrecognizable emotion as he looked al kate at bobbys body i knew you couldnt resist it gotcha you little shit kate hadnt been out of her boxy cell forhow long thirty forty days now out in the cavernous dimly lit spaces of the wormworks she felt exposed ill at ease the shot turned out to have passed straight through bobbys upper shoulder ripping muscle and shattering bone butthrough pure chancehis life was not in danger hirams medics had wanted to give bobby a general anaesthetic as they treated him but staring at hiram he refused and suffered the pain of the treatment in full awareness hiram led the way across a floor empty of people past quiescent hulking machinery wilsoq and the other goons circled bobby and kate some of them walking backward so they could watch their captives making it obvious there was no way to escape hiram immersed in whatever project he was progress ing now looked hunted ratlike his mannerisms were strange repetitive obsessive he was a man who had spent too much time alone hes the subject of an ex periment himself kate thought sourly a human being deprived of companionship afraid of the darkness sub ject to constant more or less hostile glares from the rest of the planets population their invisible eyes surround ing him he was being steadily destroyed by a machine arthur c clarke and stephen baxter he had never imagined never intended whose implica tions he probably didnt understand even now with a pang of pity she realized there was no human in history who had more right to feel paranoid but she could never forgive him for what he had done to herand to bobby and she realized she had ab solutely no idea what hiram intended for them now that he had trapped his son bobby held kates hand tight making sure her body was never out of contact with his that they were insep arable and even as he protected her he was able subtly to lean on her without allowing the others to see draw ing strength she was glad to give him they reached a part of the wormworks kate had not seen before a kind of bunker had been constructed a massive cube halfset into the floor its interior was brightly lit a door was set in its side operated by a heavy wheel as if this was a submarine bulkhead bobby stepped forward cautiously still clutching kate what is this hiram why have you brought us here quite a place isnt it hiram grinned and slapped the wall confidently we borrowed some engineering from the old norad base they dug into the colorado mountains this whole damn bunker is mounted on huge shockabsorbent springs is that what this is for to ride out a nuclear attack no these walls arent to keep out an explosion theyre supposed to contain one bobby frowned what are you talking about the future the future of ourworld our future son bobby said there are others who knew i was com ing here david mary special agent mavens of the fbi they will be here soon and then ill be walking out of here with her kate watched hirams eyes glancing from one to the other of them scheming he said youre right of the light of other days course i cant keep you here although i could have fun trying just give me five minutes let me make my case bobby he forced a smile bobby struggled to speak thats all you want to convince me of something thats what this is all about let me show you and he nodded his head to the goons indicating that bobby and kate should be brought into the bunker the walls were of thick steel the bunker was cramped with room only for hiram kate bobby and wilson kate looked around tense alert overloaded this was obviously a live experimental lab there were white boards pin boards softscreens flip charts foldup chairs and desks fixed to the walls at the center of the room was the equipment which presumably was the focus of interest here what looked like a heat exchanger and a small turbine and other pieces of equipment white anonymous boxes on one of the desks there was a coffee halfdrunk and still steaming hiram walked to the middle of the bunker we lost the monopoly on the wormcam quicker than i wanted but we made a pile of money and were making more the wormworks is still far ahead of any similar facility around the world but were heading for a plateau bobby in another few years the wormcams are going to be able to reach across the universe and already now that every punk kid has her own private wormcam the market for generators is becoming saturated well be in the business of replacement and upgrade where the profit margins are low and the competition ferocious but you said kate have a better idea right hiram glared not that it will concern you he walked to the machinery and stroked it weve gotten bloody good at plucking wormholes out of the quantum foam and expanding them up to now weve been using them to transmit information right but your smart arthur c clarke and stephen baxter brother david will tell you that it takes a finite piece of energy to record even a single bit of information so if were transmitting data we must be transmitting energy as well right now its just a tricklenot enough to make a ligmbulb glow bobby nodded stiffly obviously in pain but youre going to change all that ffiram pointed to me pieces of equipment thats a wormhole generator its squeezedvacuum technology but far in advance of anything youu find on the market i want to make wormholes bigger and more stable much more more than anything anybodys achieved so far wide enough to act as conduits for significant amounts of energy and the energy we mine will be passed through this equipment the heat exchanger and the turbine to extract usable electrical energy simple nineteenthcentury technologybut thats all i need as long as i have the energy flow this is just a test rig but enough to prove the point of principle and to solve the problems mainly the stability of the wormholes and where bobby said slowly will you mine the energy from hiram grinned and pointed to his feet from down there the core of die earth son a ball of solid nickel iron the size of the moon glowing as hot as the surface of the sun all that energy trapped in there since the earth formed the engine that powers the volcanoes and earthquakes and the circulation of the crust plates thats what im planning to tap you see the beauty of it the energy we humans burn up here on the surface is a candle compared to that furnace as soon as the technical guys solve the wormhole stability problem every extant power generating business will be obsolete overnight nuclear fusion my hairy arse and it wont stop there maybe some day well leam how to tap the stars themselves dont you see bobby even the wormcam was nothing the light of other days compared to this well change the world well become rich beyond the dreams of avarice bobby murmured heres the dream boy this is what i want us to work on together you and me building a future build ing ourworld dad bobby spread his free hand i admire you i admire what youre building im not going to stop you but i dont want this none of this is realyour money and your powerall thats real is me kate and me i have your genes hiram but im not you and i never will be no matter how you try to make it so and as bobby said that links began to form in kates mind as they used to as she neared the kernel of truth that lay at the heart of the most complex story im not you bobby had said but she saw now that was the whole point as she drifted in space marys mouth was open wide smiling david reached out touched her chin and closed her jaw i cant believe it she said its a nebula he said its called the trifid nebula in fact its visible from earth oh yes but we are so far from home that the light that set off from the nebula around the time of alexander the great is only now washing over earth he pointed can you see those dark spots they were small fine globules like drops of ink in colored water they are called bok globules even the smallest of those spots could enclose the whole of our solar system we think they are the birthplaces of stars clouds of dust and gas which will condense to form new suns it takes a long time to form a star of course but the final stages when fusion kicks in and the star blows away its sur rounding shell of dust and begins to shinecan happen arthur c clarke and stephen baxter quite suddenly he glanced at her think about it if you lived heremaybe on that ice ball below usyou would be able to see during your lifetime the birth of dozens perhaps hundreds of stars i wonder what religion we would have invented she said it was a good question perhaps something softer a religion dominated more by images of birth than death why did you bring me here he sighed everybody should see this before they die and now we have mary said a little formally thank you he shook his head irritated not them not the joined you mary i hope youll forgive me for that what is it you want to say to me david he hesitated he pointed at the nebula somewhere over there beyond the nebula is the center of the gal axy there is a great black hole there a million times the mass of the sun and its still growing clouds of dust and gas and smashedup stars flow into the hole from all directions ive seen pictures of it mary said yes theres a whole cluster of stapledons out there already they are having some difficulty approaching the hole itself the massive gravitational distortion plays hell with wormhole stability stapledons wormcam viewpoints disembodied observers wandering through space and time he smiled and in dicated his floating body when you get used to this virtualreality wormcam exploration youll find you dont need to carry along as much baggage as this my point is mary that were sending human minds like a thistledown cloud out through a block of space time two hundred thousand light years wide and a hun dred millennia deep across a hundred billion star systems all the way back to the birth of humanity al the light of other days ready theres more man we can study even if we had a thousand times as many trained observersand me boundaries are being pushed back all the time some of our theories are being confirmed others are unsentimentally debunked and thats good thats how science is supposed to be but i think theres a deeper more profound lesson were already learning and that is that mindthat life itselfis precious he said slowly unimaginably so weve only just begun our search but already we know that there is no significant biosphere within a thousand light years nor as deep in the past as we can see oh perhaps there are microor ganisms clinging to life in some warm slimefilled pond or deep in the crevices of some volcanic cleft some where but there is no other earth mary the wormcam has pushed my perception out from my own concerns inexorably step by step ive seen the evil and the good in my neighbors heart the lies in my own past the banal horror of my peoples history but weve reached beyoncf that now beyond the clamor of our brief human centuries the noisy island to which we cling now weve seen the emptiness of the wider universe the mindless churning of the past we are done with blaming ourselves for our family history and we are beginning to see the greater truth that we are surrounded by abysses by great silences by the blind workingout of huge mindless forces the wormcam is ultimately a perspective machine and we are appalled by that perspective why are you telling me this he faced her if i must speak to youto all of you then i want you to know what a responsibility you may hold there was a jesuit called teilhard de chardin he believed that just as life had covered the earth to form arthur c clarke and stephen baxter the biosphere so mankindthinking lifewould even tually encompass life to form a higher layer a cogitative layer he called the noosphere he argued that the rough organization of me noosphere would grow until it co hered into a single supersapient being he called the omega point yes she said and she closed her eyes the end of the world me wholesale internal introversion upon itself of the noosphere which has simultaneously reached the uttermost limit of its complexity and centrality youve read de chardin we have its the wormwood you see he said hoarsely thats my problem i can take no comfort from the new nihilist thinkers the notion that this tiny scrap of life and mind should be smashedat this moment of tran scendent understandingby a random piece of rock is simply unacceptable she touched his face with her small young hands i understand trust me were working on it and looking into her youngold eyes he believed it the light was changing now subtly growing signifi cantly darker the bluewhite companion star was passing behind the denser bulk of the parent david could see the com panions light streaming through the complex layers of gas at the periphery of the giantand as the companion touched the giants blurred horizon he actually saw shadows cast by thicker knots of gas in those outer layers against the more diffuse atmosphere immense lines that streamed toward him millions of kilometers long and utterly straight it was a sunset on a star he realized with awe an exercise in celestial geometry and perspective and yet the spectacle reminded him of nothing so much as the ocean sunsets he used to enjoy as a boy as he played with his mother on the long atlantic beaches of france moments when shafts of light cast by the thick the light of other days ocean clouds had made him wonder if he was seeing the light of god himself were the joined truly the embryo of a new order of humanityof mind was he making a sort of first con tact here with a being whose intellect and understanding might surpass his own as much as he might surpass his neandertal greatgrandmother but perhaps it was necessary for a new form of mind to grow new mental powers to apprehend the wider perspective offered by the wormcam he thought you are feared and despised and now you are weak fear you despise you but so was christ feared and despised and the future belonged to him as perhaps it does to you and so you may be the sole repository of my hopes as i have tried to express to you but whatever the future i cant help but miss the feisty girt who used to live behind those ancient blue eyes and it disturbs me that not once have you mentioned your mother who dreams away what is left of her life in darkened rooms do we who preceded you mean so little mary pulled herself closer to him wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him despite his troubled thoughts her simple human warmth was a great comfort lets go home she said i think your brother needs you kate knew she had to tell him bobby shut up manzoni hiram snarled he was raging now throwing his arms in the air stalking around the room what about me made you you little shit i made you so i wouldnt have to die knowing knowing that youd lose it all kate said manzoni arthur c clarke and stephen baxter wilson took a step forward standing between hiram and bobby watching them all kate ignored her you want a dynasty you want your offspring to rule the fucking planet it didnt work with david so you tried again without even the incon venience of sharing him with a mother yes you made bobby and you tried to control him but even so he doesnt want to play your games hiram faced her fists bunching what he wants doesnt matter i wont be blocked no kate said wondering no you wont will you my god hiram bobby said urgently kate i think youd better tell me what youre talking about oh i dont say this was his plan from the beginning but it was always a fallback in case you didnt cooperate and of course he had to wait until the technol ogy was ready but its there now isnt it hiram and another piece of the puzzle fell into place youre funding the joined arent you covertly of course but its your resources that are behind the brainlink technol ogy you had your own purpose for it she could see in bobbys eyesblackringed marked by painthat he understood at last bobby youre his clone your body and nervous structures are as close to hirams as is humanly possible to manufacture hiram wants ourworld to live on after his death he doesnt want to see it dispersedor worse fall into the hands of somebody from outside the family youre his one hope but if you wont cooper ate bobby turned to his cloneparent if i wont be your heir then youll kill me youll take my body and youll upload your own foul mind into me but it wont be like that hiram said rapidly dont you see well be together bobby ill have beaten death by god and when you grow old we can do it again and again and again the light of other days bobby shook off kates arm and strode toward hiram wilson stepped between hiram and bobby pushing hiram behind her and raised her pistol kate tried to move forward to intervene but it felt as if she were embedded in treacle wilson was hesitating she seemed to be coming to a decision of her own the gun muzzle wavered then in a single lightningfast movement she turned and slapped hiram over the ear hard enough to send him sprawling and she grabbed bobby he tried to land a blow on her but she took his injured arm and pressed a determined thumb into his wounded shoulder he cried out eyes rolling and he fell to his knees kate felt overwhelmed baffled what now how much more complicated can this get who was this wil son what did she wanh with brisk movements wilson laid bobby and his cloneparent side by side and began to throw switches on the equipment console at the center of the room there was a hum of fans a crackle of ozone kate sensed great forces gatheringhn the room hiram tried to sit up but wibon knocked him back with a kick in the chest hiram croaked what the hell are you doing initiating a wonnhole wilson murmured concen trating a bridge to the center of the earth kate said but you cant the wormholes are still unstable i know that wilson snapped thats the point dont you understand yet my god hiram said youve intended this all along to kill you quite right i waited for the opportunity and i took it why for christs sake for barbara wilson my daughter who arthur c clarke and stephen baxter you destroyed her you and your wormcam with out you hiram laughed an ugly strained sound dont tei me it doesnt matter everyone has a grudge i always knew one of you bitter arseholes would get through in the end but i trusted you wilson if not for you i would be happy her voice was pellucid calm what are you talking about but who gives a fuck lookyouve got me hiram said desperately let bobby go and the girl they dont matter oh but they do wilson seemed on the verge of crying dont you see he is the point the hum of the equipment rose to a crescendo and digits scrolled over the softscreen monitor outputs on the wall just a couple of seconds wilson said that isnt long to wait is it and then it will all be over she turned to bobby dont be afraid bobby barely conscious struggled to speak what you wont feel a thing what do you care but i do care she stroked his cheek i spent so long watching you i knew you were cloned it doesnt matter i saw you take your first step i love you hiram growled a bloody wormcam stalker is that all you are howsmall ive been hunted by priests and pimps and politicians criminals nationalists the sane and the insane everybody with a grudge about the inventor of the wormcam i evaded them all and now it comes down to this he began to struggle no not mis way not this way and with a single snakelike movement he lunged at wilsons leg and sank his teeth into her hamstring she cried out and staggered back hiram clung on with his teeth like a dog the womans blood trickling from his mouth wilson rolled on top of him and raised her fist hiram released wilsons leg and yelled at kate jet him out of here get him out but then wilson the light of other days drove her fist into his bloodied throat and kate heard the crunch of cartilage and bone and his voice turned to a gurgle kate grabbed bobby by his good arm and hauled him by main force over the threshold of me bunker he cried out as his head raided on the doors thick metal sill but she ignored him as soou as his dangling feet were clear she slammed the door masking the rising noise of the wonnhole and began to dog it shut hirams security goons were approaching bewildered kate hauling on me wheel screamed at them help him up and get out of here but then the wall bulged out at her and she glimpsed light as bright as the sun deafened blinded she seemed to be falling falling into darkness the ages of sisyphus a s two apledons disembodied wormcam view points bobby and david soared over southern af nca it was the year four decades had elapsed since the death of hiram patterson and kate bobbys wife of thirtyfive years was dead a year after he had accepted that brutal truth it was never far from bobbys thoughts no matter what won derful scenery the wormcam brought him but he was still alive and he must live on he forced himself to look outward to study africa today the plains of mis most ancient of continents were covered with a rectangular gridwork of fields here and there buildings were clustered neat plastic huts and machines toiled autonomous cultivators looking like overgrown beetles their solarcell carapaces glinting people moved slowly through the fields they all wore loose white clothes broadbrimmed hats and gaudy lay ers of sunblock in one farmyard neatly swept a group of children played they looked clean well dressed and well fed running noisily bright pebbles on this immense tabletop landscape but bobby had seen few children today and this rare handful seemed precious cherished and as he watched more closely he saw how their movements were complex and tightly coordinated as if they could tell without delay or ambiguity what the oth the light of other days ers were thinking as perhaps they could forhe was toldthere were children being bom now with worm holes in their heads linked into the spreading group minds of the joined even before they left the womb it made bobby shudder he knew his body was re sponding to the eerie thought abandoned in the facility that was still called me wormworksthough forty years after the death of hiram the facility was now owned by a trust representing a consortium of museums and universities so much time had elapsed since mat climactic day me day of hirams death at the wormworksand yet it was all vivid in bobbys mind as if his menaoiy were itself a wormcam his mind locked to the past and it was now a past that contained all mat was left of kate dead a year ago of cancer her every action embedded in unchangeable history like all the nameless billions who had preceded her to the grave poor hiram he thought all he ever wanted to do was make money now with hiram long dead his company was gone his fortune impounded and yet by accident he changed me world david an invisible presence here with him had been silent for a long time bobby cut in empathy subroutines to glimpse davids viewpoint the glowing fields evaporated to be replaced by a desolate arid landscape in which a few stunted trees struggled to survive under the flat garish sunlight a line of women worked their way slowly across the land each bore an immense plastic container on her head containing a great weight of brackish water they were stickthin dressed in rags their backs rigid one woman led a child by the hand it seemed obvi ous that the wretched childnaked a thing of bones and papery skinwas in me grip of advanced malnutrition or perhaps even aids what they used to call here bobby remembered with grim humor the slims disease arthur c clarke and stephen baxter he said gently why look into the past david things are better now but this was the world we made david said bitterly his voice sounded as if he were just a few meters away from bobby in some warm comfortable room rather than floating in this disregarded emptiness no wonder the kids think we old folk arc a bunch of savages it was an africa of aids and malnutrition and drought and malaria and staph infections and dengue fever and end less futile wars an africa drenched in savagery but he said it was an africa with elephants there are still elephants bobby said and that was true a handful of animals in the zoos their seed and eggs flown back and forth in a bid to maintain viable populations there were even zygotes of elephants and many other endangered or otherwise lost species frozen in their liquid nitrogen tanks in the unchanging shadows of a lunar south pole craterperhaps the last refuge of life from earth if it proved after all impossible to de flect the wormwood so there were still elephants but none in africa no trace of them save the bones occasionally unearthed by the robot farmers bones sometimes showing teeth marks left by desperate humans in bobbys lifetime they had all gone to extinction the elephant the lion the bear even mans closest relatives the chimps and gorillas and apes now outside the homes and zoos and collections and labs there was no large mammal on the planet none save man but what was done was done with an effort of will bobby grasped his brothers viewpoint and rose straight upward as they ascended in space and time the shining fields were restored the children dwindled to invisibility and the farmland shrank to a patchwork of detail obscured by mist and cloud and then as earth receded the bulbous shape of af the light of other days rica itself schoolbookfamiliar swam into bobbys view farther to die west over the atlantic a solid layer of clouds lay across the oceans curving skin corrugated in neat graywhite rows as the turning planet bore africa toward the shadow of night bobby could see equatorial thunderheads spreading hundreds of kilometers toward the land probing purple fingers of darkness but even from this vantage bobby could make out the handiwork of man there was a depression far out in me ocean a great cappuccino swirl of white clouds over blue ocean but this was oo natural system it had a regularity and sta bility that belied its scale the new weather management functions were slowly reducing the severity of the storm systems that still raged across the planet espe cially around me battered pacific rim to me south of me old continent bobby could cleariy see the great curtainships working their way through the atmosphere the conducting sheets they bore shimmering like dragonfly wings as they cleansed the air and restored its longdepleted ozone and off the western coast pale masses followed me line of me shore for hundreds of kilometers reefs built up rapidly by me new breed of engineered coral laboring to fix excess carbonand to provide a new sanctuary for the endangered communities of plants and animals which had once inhabited the worlds natural reefs long destroyed by pollution over fishing and storms everywhere people were working repairing building the land too had changed the continent was almost cloud free its broad land graybrown me green of life suppressed by mist the great northern mass which had been the sahara was broken by a fine tracery of blue white already along me banks of the new canals the glow of green was starting to spread here and there he could see the glittering jewellike forms of powerpipe arthur c clarke and stephen baxter plants the realization of hirams last dream drawing heat from the core of earth itselfthe energy bounty free and clean which had largely enabled the planets stabilizing and transformation it was a remarkable view its scale and regularity stunning david said it reminded him of nothing so much as the old dreams of mars the dying desert world restored by intelligence the human race it seemed had gotten smart just in dme to save itself but it had been a difficult adoles cence even as the human population had continued to swell climatic changes had devastated much of the worlds food and water supply with the desertification of the great grain regions of the us and asia the drowning of many productive lowland farming areas by rising sea levels and the pollution of aquifers and the acidification or drying of freshwater lakes soon the problem of ex cess population went into reverse as drought disease and starvation culled communities across the planet it was a crash only in relative terms most of earths population had survived but as usual the most vulnerablethe very old and the very younghad paid the price overnight the world had become middleaged new generations had emerged into a world that was re covering still crowded with aging survivors and the youngscattered cherished wormcamlinkedregarded their elders with increasing intolerance indifference and mistrust in the schools the children of the wormcam made academic studies of the era in which their parents and grandparents had grown up an incomprehensible taboo ridden prewormcam age only a few decades in the past in which liars and cheats had prospered and crime was out of control and people killed each other over lies and myths and in which the world had been systematically trashed through willful carelessness greed and an utter lack of sympathy for others or foresight regarding the future the light of other days and meanwhile to the old the young were a bunch of incomprehensible savages with a private language and about as much modesty as a tribe of chimpanzees but the generational conflict was not the full story it seemed to bobby that a more significant rift was opening up the mass minds were still bobby supposed in their infancy and they were far outnumbered by the unjoined older generationsbut already their insights folded down into the human world were having a dramatic effect the new superminds were beginning to rise to the greatest of challenges challenges which demanded at once the best of human intellect and the suppression of humanitys worst divisiveness and selfishness the mod ification and control of the worlds climate for example was because of the intrinsically chaotic nature of the global weather systems a problem that had once seemed intractable but it was a problem that was now being solved the new generations of maturing joined were already shaping the future it would be a failure in which many feared democracy would seem irrelevant and in which even the consolation of religion would not seem impor tant for the joined believedwith some justification that they could even banish death perhaps it would not even be a human future at all it was wonderful aweinspiring terrifying bobby knew that he was privileged to be alive at such a mo ment for surely such a great explosion of mind would not come again but it was also true that heand david and the rest of their generation the last of the unjoinedhad come to feel more and more isolated on the planet that had bome them he knew this shining future was not for him and a year after kates death the illness that had suddenly taken her from himthe present held no interest what arthur c clarke and stephen baxter remained for him as for david was the past and the past was what he and david had decided to explore as far and as fast as they could two old fools who didnt matter to anybody else anyhow he felt a pressurediffuse almost intangible yet summoning it was as if his hand were being squeezed david are you ready bobby let a comer of his mind linger in his remote body just for a second shadowy limbs formed around him and be took a deep breath squeezed his hands into fists relaxed again lets do it now bobbys viewpoint began to fall from the afri can sky down toward me southern coast and as he fell day and night began to flap across me patient face of the continent centuries falling away like leaves from an au tumn tree a hundred thousand years deep they paused bobby and david hovered like two fireflies before a face heavy browed fiatnosed cleareyed female not quite human behind her a small family grouppowerfully built adults children like baby gorillaswere working at a fire they had built on mis ancient beach beyond them was a low cliff and the sky above was a crisp deep blue perhaps this was a winters day the brothers sank deeper the details the family group the powderblue sky winked out of existence the neandertal grandmother herself blurred becoming expressionless as one gener ation was laid over another too fast for the eye to fol low the landscape became a grayish outline centuries of weather and seasonal growth passing with each sec ond the multipleancestor face flowed and changed half a million years deep her forehead lowered her eye the light of other days socket ridges growing more prominent her chin reced ing her teeth and jaws pronounced perhaps this face was now apelike bobby thought but those eyes re mained curious intelligent now her skin tone changed in great slow washes dark to tight to dark homo erectus david said a toolmaker migrated around the planet were still falling a hundred thou sand years every few seconds good god but so little changes the next transition came suddenly the brow sank lower the face grew longerthough the brain of this remote grandmother much smaller than a modern hu mans was nevertheless larger than a chimpanzees homo habilis said david or perhaps this is aus tralopithecus the evolutionary lines are tangled were already two million years deep the anthropological labels scarcely mattered it was profoundly disturbing bobby found to gaze at this flick ering multigeneration face the face of a chimpanzeelike creature he might not have looked at twice in some zoo and to know that this was hi ancestor the mother of his grandmothers in an unbroken line of descent maybe this was how the victorians felt when darwin got back from the galapagos he thought now the last vestiges of humanity were being shed the brain pan shrinking further those eyes growing cloudy puzzled the background blurred by the passage of the years became greener perhaps there were forests covering af rica this deep in time and still the ancestor diminished her face fixed in the glare of the wormcam viewpoint becoming more elemental those eyes larger more timid now she reminded bobby more of a tarsier or a lemur but yet those forwardfacing eyes set in a flat face still held a poignant memory or promise david impulsively slowed their descent and brought them fleetingly to a halt some forty million years deep arthur c clarke and stephen baxter the shrewlike face of the ancestor peered out at bobby eyes wide and nervous behind her was a back ground of leaves branches on a plain beyond dimly glimpsed through green light there was a herd of what looked like rhinocerosbut with huge misshapen heads each fitted with six horns the herd moved slowly massive tails flicking browsing on low bushes and reaching up to the dangling branches of trees her bivores then a young straggler was being stalked by a group of what looked like horsesbut these horses with prominent teeth and tense watchful motions ap peared to be predators david said the first great heyday of the mammals forests all over the planet the grasslands have all but disappeared and so have the modem fauna there are no fullyevolved horses rhinos pigs cattle cats dogs the grandmothers head flicked from side to side ner vously every few seconds even as she chewed on fruit and leaves bobby wondered what predators might loom out of this strange sky to target an unwary primate with bobbys unspoken consent david released the moment and they fell away once more the background blurred into a bluegreen wash and the ancestors face flowed growing smaller her eyes wider and habitually black perhaps she had become nocturnal bobby glimpsed vegetation thick and green much of it unfamiliar and yet now the land seemed strangely empty no giant herbivores no pursuing carnivores crossed the empty stage beyond his ancestors thin cheeked shadowed hugeeyed face the world was like a city deserted by humans he thought with the tiny creatures the rats and mice and voles burrowing among the huge ruins but now the forests began to shrink back melting away like summer mist soon the land became skeletal a plain marked by broken stumps of trees that must once have risen tall the light of other days ice gathered suddenly to lie in thick swaths across the land bobby sensed life drawing out of this world like a slow tide and then clouds came immersing the world in dark ness rain dimly glimpsed began to leap from the dark ened ground great heaps of bones assembled from the mud and flesh gathered over them in gray lumps acid rain murmured david light flared dazzling overwhelming it was not the light of day but of a fire that seemed to span the landscape the fires violence was huge star tling terrifying but it drew back under a leaden sky the fires began to collapse into isolated blazes that dwindled further each licking flame restoring the greenery of another leafy branch the fire drew at last into tight glowing pellets that leapt into the sky and the fleeing sparks merged into a cloud of shoot ing stars under a black sky now the thick black clouds drew back like a curtain a great wind passed restoring smashed branches to the trees gently ushering flocks of flying creatures to the branches and on the horizon a fan of light was gath ering growing pink and white at last turning into a bea con beam of brilliance pointing directly up into the sky it was a column of molten rock the column collapsed into an orange glow and like a second dawn a glowing diffuse mass rose above the horizon a long glowing tail spreading across half the sky in a great flamboyant curve masked by the daylight brilliant in the night the comet receded day by day drawing its cargo of destruction back into the depths of the solar system the brothers paused in a suddenly restored world a world of richness and peace the ancestor was a wideeyed frightened creature that lingered above ground perhaps incautiously trapped there arthur c clarke and stephen baxter beyond her bobby glimpsed what appeared to be the shore of an inland sea lush jungles lapped the swampy lowlands along the coast and a broad river decanted from distant blue mountains the broad ridged backs of what must be crocodiles sliced through the rivers slug gish muddy waters this was a land thick with life unfamiliar in detail and yet not so unlike the forests of his own youth but the sky was not a true bluemore a subtle violet he thought even the shapes of the clouds scattered over head seemed wrong perhaps the very air was different here so deep in time a herd of homed creatures moved along the swampy coast looking something like rhinos but their move ments were strange almost birdlike as lumbering they mingled browsed nested fought preened and there was a herd of what looked at first glance like ostriches walking upright with bobbing heads nervous move ments and startled suspicious glances in the trees bobby glimpsed a huge shadow moving slowly as if tracking the giant planteaters perhaps this was a carnivoreeven he thought with a thrill a raptor all around the dinosaur herds clouds of insects hov ered were privileged david said weve a relatively good view of the wildlife the dinosaur age has been a disappointment for the time tourists like africa it turns out to be huge and baffling and dusty and mostly empty it stretches after all over hundreds of millions of years but bobby said dryly it was kind of disappointing to discover that t rex was after all just a scavenger all this beauty david and no mind to appreciate it was it waiting for us all this time ah yes the unseen beauty were the beautiful volute and cone shells of the eocene epoch and the gracefully sculpted ammonites of the secondary period created that man might ages afterward admire them in his cabinet darwin in the origin of species the light of other days so he didnt know either i suppose not this is an ancient place bobby you can see it an antique community that has evolved to gether across hundreds of millions of years and yet and yet it would all disappear when the cretaceous wormwood did its damage the earth is nothing but a vast graveyard bobby and as we dive deeper into the past those bones are rising again to confront us not quite we have the birds the birds yes rather a beautiful end to this partic ular evolutionary subplot dont you think lets hope we turn out so well lets go on yes so they plunged once more dropping safely through the dinosaurs mesozoic summer two hundred million years deep ancient jungles swept in a meaningless green wash across bobbys view framing the timid mindless eyes of millions of generations of ancestors breeding hoping dying the greenery abruptly cleared revealing a flat dusty plain an empty sky the denuded land was a desert baked hard and flat beneath a high harsh sun the sands uniformly reddish in color even the hills had shifted and flowed so deep was time the ancestor here was a small reptilelike creature who nibbled busily on what looked like the remains of a baby rat she was on the fringe of a scrubby forest of stunted ferns and conifers that bordered a straggling river something like an iguana scampered nearby flashing rows of sharp teeth perhaps that was the mother of all the dinosaurs bobby mused and beyond the trees arthur c clarke and stephen baxter bobby made out what looked like warthogs grubbing in the mud close to the sluggish water david grunted lystrosaurs he said luckiest crea tures who ever lived the only large animal to survive the extinction event bobby was confused you mean the dinosaurkiller comet no david said grimly i mean another the one we must soon pass through two hundred and fifty million years deep the worst of them all so that was why the great lush jungle panorama of the dinosaurs had drawn back once again the earth was emptying itself of life bobby felt a profound sense of dread they descended once more at last the final stunted trees shuddered back into their buried seeds and the last greenerystruggling weeds and shrubsshriveled and died a scorched land began to reconstitute itself a place of burnedout stumps and fallen branches and here and there heapedup bones the rocks increasingly exposed by the receding tide of life became powerfully red its like mars and for the same reason david said grimly mars has no life to speak of and in lifes absence its sedi ments have rusted slowly burning subject to erosion and wind killing heat and cold and so earth as we approach this greatest of the deaths was the same all but lifeless the rocks eroding away and all through this a chain of tiny ancestors clung to life subsisting in muddy hollows at the fringes of inland seas that had almostbut not quitedried to bowls of lethal martian dust earth in this era was very different david said tec tonic drift had brought all of the continents into a single giant assemblage the largest landmass in the history of the planet the tropical areas were dominated by im mense deserts white the high latitudes were scoured by the light of other days glaciation in the continental interior the climate swung wildly between killing heat and dry freezing and this already fragile world was hit by a further calamity a great excess of carbon dioxide which choked animals and added greenhouse heating to an already nearlethal climate animal life in particular suffered almost knocked back to the level of pond life but for us its nearly over bobby the excess co is drawing back into where it came from deep sea traps and a great outpouring of flood basalts in siberia gases brought up from earths interior to poison its surface and soon that monstrous world continent will break up just remember this life survived in fact our ances f tors survived fix on that if not we wouldnt be here as bobby studied the flickering mix of reptile and rodent features that centered in his vision he found that idea cold comfort they moved beyond the extinction pulse into the deeper past the recovering earth seemed a very different place there was no sign of mountains and the ancestors clung to life at the margins of enormous shallow inland seas that washed back and forth with the ages and slowly after millions of years as the choking gases drew back into the ground green returned to planet earth the ancestor had become a lowslung waddling crea ture covered with short dun fur but as the generations fluttered past her jaw lengthened her skull morphing back and at last she seemed to lose her teeth leaving a mouth covered with a hard beaklike material now the fur shrank away and the snout lengthened further and the ancestor became a creature indistinguishable to bobbys untrained eye from a lizard he realized in fact that he was approaching so great a depth in time that the great families of land animals the turtles the mammals and the lizards crocodiles and arthur c clarke and stephen baxter birdswere merging back into the mother group the reptiles then more than three hundred and fifty million years deep the ancestor morphed again her head became blunter her limbs shorter and stubbier her body more streamlined perhaps she was amphibian now at last those stubby limbs became mere lobed fins that melted into her body life is retreating from the land david said the last of the invertebrates probably a scorpion is crawling back into the sea on land the plants will soon lose their leaves and will no longer be upright and after that the only form of life left on land will be simple encrusting forms suddenly bobby was immersed carried by his retreat ing grandmother into a shallow sea the water was crowded there was a coral reef below stretching into the milky blue distance it was littered with what looked like giant longstemmed flowers through which a bewildering variety of shelled creatures cruised looking for food he recognized nautiloids what looked like a giant ammonite the ancestor was a small knifelike unremarkable fish one of a school which darted to and fro their move ments as complex and nervous as those of any modem species in the distance a shark cruised its silhouette unmis takable even over this length of time the fish school wary of the shark darted away and bobby felt a pulse of empathy for his ancestors they accelerated once more four hundred million years deep four hundred and fifty there was a flurry of evolutionary experimentation as varieties of bony armor fluttered over the ancestors sleek bodies some of them appearing to last little more than a few generations as if these primitive fish had lost me knack of a successful body plan it was clear to bobby that life was a gathering of information and com the light of other days plexity information stored in the very structures of liv ing thingsinformation won painfully over millions of generations at the cost of pain and death and now in this reversed view being shed almost carelessly and then in an instant the ugly primeval fish disappeared david slowed the descent again there were no fish in this antique sea the ancestor was no more than a pale wormlike animal cowering in a seabed of rippled sand david said from now on it gets simpler there are only a few seaweedsand at last a billion years deep only singlecelled life all the way back to the begin ning how much further he said gently bobby weve barely begun we must travel three times as deep as to this point the descent resumed the ancestor was a crude worm whose form shifted and flickeredand now suddenly she shriveled to a mere speck of protoplasm embedded in a mat of algae and when they fell a little finther there was only the algae abruptly they were plunged into darkness shit bobby said what happened i dont know david let them fall deeper one million years two still the universal darkness persisted at last david broke the link with the ancestor of this perioda microbe or a simple seaweedand brought the viewpoint out of the ocean to hover a thousand ki lometers above the belly of the earth the ocean was white covered in ice from pole to equator great sheets of it scarred by folds and creases hundreds of kilometers long beyond the icy limb of the planet a crescent moon was rising that battered face unchanged from bobbys time its features already uni arthur c clarke and stephen baxter maginably ancient even at this deep epoch but the cra dled new moon shone almost as brightly in earths reflected light as the crescent in direct sunlight earth had become dazzling bright perhaps brighter than venusif there had been eyes to see look at that david breathed somewhere close to earths equator there was a circular ice structure the walls much softened a low eroded mound at its heart thats an impact crater an old one that ice covering has been there a long time they resumed their descent the shifting details of the ice sheetsthe cracks and crumpled ridges and lines of dunelike mounds of snowwere blurred to a pearly smoothness but still the global freeze persisted abruptly after a fall of a further fifty million years the ice cleared like frost evaporating from a heated win dow but just as bobby felt a surge of relief the ice clamped down again covering the planet from pole to pole there were three more breaks in the glaciation before at last it cleared permanently the ice revealed a world that was earthlike and yet not there were blue oceans and continents but the con tinents were uniformly barren dominated by harsh ice tipped mountains or by rustred deserts and their shapes were utterly unfamiliar to bobby he watched the slow waltz of the continents as they assembled themselves under the blind prompting of tec tonics into a single giant landmass theres the answer david said grimly the super continent alternately coalescing and breaking up is the cause of the glaciation when that big mother breaks up it creates a lot more shoreline that stimulates the pro duction of a lot more lifewhich right now is restricted to microbes and algae living in inland seas and shallow coastal watersand the life draws down an excess of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere the greenhouse ef the light of other days feet collapses and the sun is a little dimmer than in our times and so glaciation yes on and off for two hundred million years there can have been virtually no photosynthesis down there for millions of years at a time its astonishing life survived at all the two of them descended once more into the belly of the ocean and allowed the dna trace to focus their attention on an undistinguished mat of green algae somewhere here was embedded the unremarkable cell which was me ancestor of all the humans who ever lived and above a small shoal of creatures like simple jel lyfish sailed through the cold blue water farther away bobby could make out more complex creatures fronds bulbs quilted mats attached to the seafloor or free floating bobby said they dont look like seaweed to me my god david said startled they look like edi acarans multicelled lifeforms but the ediacarans arent scheduled to evolve for a couple of hundred million years somethings wrong they resumed their descent the hints of multicelled life were soon lost as life shed what it had painfully learned a billion years deep and again darkness fell like a hammer blow more ice bobby asked i think i understand david said grimly it was a pulse of evolutionan early event something we havent recognized from the fossilsan attempt by life to grow past me singlecelled stage but its doomed to be wiped out by the snowball glaciation and two hun dred million years of progress will be lost damn damn when the ice cleared a further hundred million years deep again mere were hints of more complex multicel led life forms grazing among the algae mats another arthur c clarke and stephen baxter false start to be eliminated by the savage gtaciation and again the brothers were forced to watch as life was crushed back to its most primitive forms as they fell through the long featureless aeons five more times the dead hand of global glaciation fell on the planet killing the oceans squeezing out of existence all but the most primitive lifeforms in the most marginal environments it was a savage feedback cycle initiated every time life gained a significant foothold in the shal low waters at the fringe of the continents david said it is the tragedy of sisyphus in the myth sisyphus had to roll the rock to the top of the mountain only to watch it roll back again and again thus life struggles to achieve complexity and significance and is again and again crushed down to its most primitive level it is a series of icy wormwoods over and over maybe those nihilist philosophers are right maybe this is all we can expect of the universe a relentless crushing of life and spirit because the equilibrium state of the cosmos is death bobby said grimly tsiolkovski once called earth the cradle of mankind and so it is in fact the cradle of life but but said david its one hell of a cradle which crushes its occupants at least this couldnt happen now not quite this way anyhow life has developed complex feedback cycles controlling the flow of mass and energy through earths systems we always thought the living earth was a thing of beauty it isnt life has had to learn to defend itself against the planets random geo logical savagery at last they reached a time deeper than any of the hammerblow glaciations this young earth had little in common with the world it would become the air was visibly thickunbreath able crushing there were no hills or shores cliffs or forests much of the planet appeared to be covered by a shallow ocean unbroken by continents the seabed was the light of other days a thin crust cracked and broken by rivers of lava that scalded the seas frequently thick gases clouded the planet for years at a timeuntil volcanoes thrust above die surface and sucked the gases back into the interior when it could be seen through the thick rolling smog the sun was a fierce blazing ball the moon was huge the size of a dinner plate though many of its familiar features were already etched into place but both moon and sun seemed to race across the sky this young earth spun rapidly on its axis frequently plunging its surface and its fragile cargo of life into night and towering tides swept around the bruised planet the ancestors in this hostile place were unambitious generation after generation of unremarkable cells living in huge communities close to me surface of shallow seas each community began as a spongelike mass of matter which would shrivel back layer on layer until a single patch of green remained floating on the surface drifting across me ocean to merge with some older community the sky was busy alive with me flashes of giant me teors returning to deep spacetrequentlyterribly fre quentlywalls of water kilometers high would race around the globe and converge on a burning impact scar from which a great shining body an asteroid or comet would leap into space briefly illuminating the bruised sky before dwindling into the dark and the savagery and frequency of these backward impacts seemed to increase now abruptly me green life of me algal mats began to migrate across the surface of the young turbulent oceans dragging the ancestor chainand bobbys view pointwith it the algal colonies merged shrank again merged as if shriveling back toward a common core at last they found themselves in an isolated pond cupped in the basin of a wide deep impact crater as if on a flooded moon bobby saw jagged run mountains a stubby central peak the pond was a livid virulent arthur c clarke and stephen baxter green and somewhere within the ancestor chains con tinued their blind toil back toward inanimacy but now suddenly the green stain shriveled reducing to isolated specks and the surface of the crater lake was covered by a new kind of scum a thick brownish mat oh david breathed as if shocked we just lost chlorophyll the ability to manufacture energy from sun light do you see whats happened this community of organisms was isolated from the rest by some impact or geological accidentthe event that formed this crater perhaps it ran out of food here the organisms were forced to mutate or die and mutate they did bobby said if not if not then not us now there was a burst of violence a blur of motion overwhelming and unresolvedperhaps this was the vi olent isolating event david had hypothesized when it was over bobby found himself beneath the sea once more gazing at a mat of thick brown scum that clung to a smoking vent dimly lit by earths own in ternal glow then it has come to this said david our deepest ancestors were rockeaters thennophiles or perhaps even hyperthermophiles that is they relished high tem perature they consumed the minerals injected into the water by the vents iron sulphur hydrogen cmde inefficient but robust they did not require light or oxy gen or even organic material now bobby sank into darkness he passed through tunnels and cracks diminished squeezed in utter dark ness broken only by occasional dull red flashes david are you still there im here whats happening to us were passing beneath the seabed were migrating through the porous basalt rock there all the life on the planet is coalescing bobby shrinking back along the the light of other days ocean ridges and seafloor basalt beds merging to a sin gle point where where are we migrating to to the deep rock bobby a point a kilometer down it will be the last retreat of life all life on earth has come from this cache deep in the rock this shelter and what bobby asked with foreboding did life have to shelter fromt we are about to find out i fear david lifted them up and they hovered in the foul air of this lifeless earth there was light here but it was dim and orange like twilight in a smoggy city the sun must be above the horizon but bobby could not locate it precisely or the giant moon the atmosphere was palpably thick and crushing the ocean churned below black in some places boiling and me fractured seabed was laced with fire the graveyard is truly empty now bobby thought save for that one small deepburied cachecontaining my most remote ancestorsthese young rocks have given up all their layered dead and now a blanket of black cloud gathered as if hurled across the sky by some impetuous god an in verted rain began rods of water that leapt from the dap pled ocean surface to the swelling clouds a century wore by and still the rain roared upward out of the ocean its ferocity undiminishedindeed so voluminous was the rain that soon ocean levels were dropping perceptibly the clouds thickened further and the oceans dwindled forming isolated brine pools in the lowest hollows of earths battered cracked surface it took two thousand years the rain did not stop until the oceans had returned to the clouds and the land was dry and the land began to fragment further soon bright glowing cracks in the exposed land were widening brightening lava pulsing and flowing at last arthur c clarke and stephen baxter there were only isolated islands left shards of rock which shriveled and melted and a new ocean blanketed the earth an ocean of molten rock hundreds of meters deep now a new reversed rain began a hideous storm of bright molten rock leaping up from me land the rock droplets joined the water clouds so mat the atmosphere became a hellish layer of glowing rock droplets and steam incredible david shouted the earth is collecting an atmosphere of rock vapor forty or fifty kilometers thick exerting hundreds of times the pressure of our air the heat energy contained in it is stupendous the planets cloud tops must be glowing eartfa is shining a star of rock vapor but me rock rain was drawing heat away from the battered land andrapidly within a few monthsthe land had cooled to solidity beneath a glowing sky liq uid water was beginning to form again new oceans co alescing out of the cooling clouds but the oceans were formed boiling their surfaces in contact with rock vapor and between the oceans mountains formed unmelting from puddles of slag and now a wall of light swept past bobby dragging after it a front of boiling clouds and steam in a burst of unimaginable violence bobby screamed david slowed their descent into time earth was restored once again the blueblack oceans were calm the sky empty of cloud was a greenish dome the battered moon was disturbingly huge the mans face familiar to bobby save for a missing right eye and mere was a second sun a glowing ball that outshone the moon with a tail that stretched across the sky a green sky murmured david strange methane perhaps but how the light of other days what bobby said the hell is thatt h the comet a real monster the size of modem day asteroids like vesta or pallas perhaps five hundred kilometers across a hundred thousand times the mass of the dinosaur killer the size of the wormwood yes remember that the earth itself was formed from impacts coalescing from a hail of planetesimals that or bited the young sun the greatest impact of all was prob ably the collision with another young world that nearly cracked us open the impact that formed the moon after that the surface became relatively stablebut still the earth was subject to immense impacts tens or hundreds of them within a few hundred million years a bombardment whose violence we cant begin to imagine the impact rate tailed off as the remnant planetesimals were soaked up by the planets and there was a halcyon period of relative quiescence lasting a few hundred mil lion years and then this earth was unlucky to meet such a giant so late in the bombardment an impact hot enough to boil the oceans even melt the mountains but we survived bobby said grimly yes in our deep hot niche they fell down into the earth once more and bobby was immersed in rock with his most distant ancestors a scraping of thermophilic microbes he waited in darkness as countless generations peeled back then in a blur he saw light once more he was rising up some kind of shaftlike a well toward a circle of green light the sky of this alien pre bombardment earth the circle expanded until he was lifted into the light he had some trouble interpreting what he saw next he seemed to be inside a box of some glassy material the ancestor must be here with him one crude cell among millions subsisting in this container the box was arthur c clarke and stephen baxter set on some form of stand and from here he could look out over oh dear god said david it was a city bobby glimpsed an archipelago of small volcanic is lands rising from the blue sea but me islands had been linked by wide flat bridges on the land low walls marked out geometrical formsthey looked like fields but this was not a human landscape the shapes of these fields seemed to be variants of hexagons there were even buildings low and rectangular like airplane han gars he glimpsed movement between the buildings some kind of traffic too distant to resolve and now something was moving toward him it looked like a trilobite perhaps a low segmented body that glittered under the green sky sets of legs six or eightthat flickered with movement something like a head at the front a head with a mouth that held a tool of gleaming metal the head was raised toward him he tried to make out the eyes of this impossible creature he felt as if he could reach out and touch that chitinous face and and me world imploded into darkness they were two old men who had spent too long in vir tual reality and the search engine had thrown them out bobby lying there stunned thought il was probably a blessing he stood stretched rubbed his eyes he blundered through the wonnworks its solidity and grime seeming unreal after me fourbillionyear specta cle he had endured he found a coffee drone ordered two cups gulped down a hot mouthful then feeling somewhat restored to humanity he returned to his brother he held out the coffee until davidmouth open eyes glazedsat up to take it the light of other days the sisyphans david murmured his voice dry what thats what we must call them they evolved on early earth in the interval of stability between the early and late bombardments they were different from us that methane sky what could thai have meant perhaps even their biochemistry was novel based on sulphur compounds or with ammonia as a solvent or he grabbed bobbys arm and of course you understand that they need have had little in common with the crea tures they selected for the cache the cache of our an cestors no more than we have with the exotic flora and fauna which still cling to the deepsea vents in our world but theythe thermophiles our ancestorswere the best hope for survival david slow down what are you talking about david looked at him baffled dont you understand yet they were intelligent the sisyphans but they were doomed they saw it coming you see the great comet yes just as we can see our own wormwood and they knew what it would do to their world boil the oceans even melt the rock for hundreds of meters down you saw them their technology was primitive they were a young species they had no way to escape the planet or outlive the impact themselves or deflect the impactor they were doomed without recourse and yet they did not succumb to despair they buried the cachedeep enough so the heat pulse couldnt reach it yes you see they labored to preserve lifeus bobbyeven in the midst of the greatest catastrophe the planet has suffered and that is our destiny bobby just as the sisyphans preserved their handful of thermophilic microbes to out live the impactjust as those algal mats and seaweed struggled to outlast the savage glaciation episodes just as complex life evolving and adapting survived the arthur c clarke and stephen baxter later catastrophes of volcanism and impact and geolog ical accidentso must we even the joined the new evolution of mind are part of a single thread which reaches back to the dawn of life itself bobby smiled remember what hiram used to say theres no limit to what we can achieve if we work together yes thats it exactly hiram was no fool fondly bobby touched his brothers shoulder i think and once again without warning the world im ploded into darkness epilogue fcrfobby please wake up bobby can you hear dme the voice came to him as if from afar a womans voice he heard the voice understood the words even before a sense of his body returned his eyes were closed he was lying flat on his back on what felt like a deep soft bed he could feel his limbs the slow pulse of his heart the swell of his breath everything seemed normal and yet he knew it was no something was wrong as subtly askew as the violet sky of the cretaceous he felt unaccountably afraid he opened his eyes a womans face hovered before him fineboned blueeyed blond hair some lines at the eyes she might have been forty even fifty yet he recognized her mary was it his voice he raised his hand a bony wrist protruded from a sleeve of some silvery fabric the hand was fineboned the fingers narrow and long like a pianists was it his hand maryif it was maryleaned forward and cupped his face youre awake thank hiram for that can you understand me yes yes i what do you remember arthur c clarke and stephen baxter david the wormworks we were traveling yes good you remember on his anas tasis david told us what you had seen anastasis he thought resurrection his fear deep ened he tried to sit up she helped him he felt weak light he was in a smoothwalled chamber it was dark a doorway led to a corridor flooded with light there was a single small window circular it revealed a slab of blue and black blue earth black sky the air of earth was clear as glass there was a silver tracery over the blue oceans some kind of structure hundreds of kilometers above the surface was he in orbit no the earth was not turning he was in some kind of orbital tower then my god he thought am i dead have i been resurrected mary she growled and ran her hand through loose hair david said youd be like this questions questions her intonation was clumsy her voice dry as if she wasnt used to speaking aloud why have i been brought back oh the worm wood is that it mary frowned and briefly seemed to be listening to remote voices the wormwood you mean the comet we pushed that away long ago she said it casually as if a moth had been brushed aside bemused he asked then what i can tell you how you got here she said gently as to why youll have to figure that out for your self sixty more years had worn away he learned it was the wormcam of course it was possible now to look back into time and read off a complete dna sequence from any moment in an individuals life and it was possible to download a copy of that persons mindmaking her briefly joined across years even de the light of other days cadesand by putting the two together regenerated body and downloaded mind to restore her to bring her back from the dead you were dying said mary at the instant we cop ied you though you didnt know it yet my cloning yes the procedure was still experimental in hirams time there were problems with your telomeres ge netic structures mat controlled the aging of cells your decline was rapid after after my last memory in the wormworks yes how strange to think mat even as he handed that last cup of coffee to david his life had already been effec tively over the remnant evidently not worth living she took his hand when he stood he felt light dreamlike spindly for the first time he noticed she was naked but wearing a pattern of implants in the flesh of her arms and belly her breasts seemed to move oddly languidly as if the gravity wasnt quite right here she said there is so muctryou must learn we have room now the earths population is stable we live on mars the moons of the outer planets and were heading for the stars there have even been experiments in down loading human minds into the quantum foam room for what for the anastasis we intend to restore all human souls back to the beginning of the species every refu gee every aborted child we intend to put right me past to defeat the awful tragedy of death in a universe that may last tens of billions of years how wonderful he thought a hundred billion souls restored like the leaves of an autumnal tree what will it be likel but he said slowly arc they the same people am i me some philosophers argue that its possible leibnizs arthur c clarke and stephen baxter identity of the indiscemibles tells us that you are you but but you dont think so no im sorry he thought that over when were all revived what will we do next she seemed puzzled by the question whyany thing we want of course she took his hand come kate is waiting for you hand in hand they walked into the light afterword the concept of a time viewer though venerable has been explored only sparingly in science fictionperhaps because it is so much less dramatic than time travel but there have been a number of remarkable works on the theme ranging from gardner huntings the vicarion to orson scott cards pastwatch the redemp tion of christopher columbus one of us has briefly sketched its implications in previous works perhaps the bestknownand bestexample is bob shaws slow glass classic which shares our title analog au gust today me notion has the first glimmers of scientific plausibility offered by modem physicsand a reso nance with our own times surrounded as we are increas ingly by the apparatus of surveillance the concept of spacetime wormholes is well described in kip thornes black holes and time warps einsteins outrageous legacy the proposal that wormholes might be generated by squeezing the vacuum was set out by david hochberg and thomas kephart

afflicted by savage glacial episodes has been proposed by paul hoffman of harvard university and his coworkers see science vol p august and the notion that primitive life might have survived earths
