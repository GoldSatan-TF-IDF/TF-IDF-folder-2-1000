tenacious prologue the sound of carriage wheels echoed loudly in the blackness of downing street with a jangle of harness and the snorting of horses the vehicle stopped outside no and footmen braved the rain to lower the step and hand down the occupants the prime minister william pitt did not wait for the speaker of the house of commons but henry addington knew his friend of old and smiled at his nervous vitality quite dished em in the debate william he puffed as he caught up and they mounted the stairs to the upper landing it will hold them for now pitt said briefly the sound of their voices roused the household a butler appeared from the gloom with a maid close behind in here pitt threw over his shoulder as he entered a small drawing room the maid slipped past with a taper lit the candles and a pool of gold illuminated the chaiselongue pitt sprawled on it fulllength while addington took a winged chair nearby oh a bite of cold tongue and ham would answer pitt said wearily to the butlers query then closed his eyes until the man had returned with brandy and a newopened bottle of port he poured then withdrew noiselessly pulling the doors closed hard times addington offered you think so henry since that insufferable coxcomb fox rusticated himself i have only the french to occupy me he took a long pull on his port addington studied the deep lines in his face general buonaparte and his invasion preparations he asked quietly there had been little else in the press for the last two months paris had performed a masterstroke in appointing the brilliant victor of italy to the head of the socalled army of england which had beaten or cowed every country in europe his task now was to eliminate the last obstacle to conquest of the civilised world spies were reporting the rapid construction of flat trooplanding barges in every northern french port and armies were being marched to the coast invasion of the land that lay in plain sight of the battalions lining those shores was clearly imminent what else pitt stared into the shadows if he can get across the twenty miles of the channel then then were finished of course we have the navy addington said stoutly er yes the navy were in bloody mutiny lessn a year ago and are now scattered all over the world necessary of course he brooded over his glass grenville heard that the french will turn on hanover and that his majesty will oblige us to defend his ancestral home dragging us into a land war ridiculous of course addington cradled his brandy and waited pitt sighed the worst of it all is not being possessed of decent intelligence having to make decisions in a fog of halftruths and guesses is a sure way to blunder into mistakes that history will judge without mercy take this henry spencer has confirmed that our grand general buonaparte has left off inspecting his soldiers standing ready for the invasion and has been seen in toulon whats he doing in the mediterranean that he abandons his post no one knows but we have enough word that theres an armament assembling there not a simple fleet you understand but transports storeships a battle fleet are we therefore to accept that the moment we have dreaded mostwhen the french revolution bursts forth on the rest of the worldis now at hand and if it is why from toulon he paused there was the slightest tremor in the hand that held the glass if theres to be a sally where dundas speaks of constantinople the sublime porte others argue for a rapid descent on cairo defeating the mamelukes and opening a highway to the red sea and thence our vital routes to india and some point to a landing in the levant then a strike across arabia and persia to the very gates of india and you at first pitt did not speak then he said quietly it is all nonsense romantic nonsense this talk of an adventure in the land of sinbad its all desert impassable to a modern army its a stratagem to deflect our attention from the real object which is after leaving toulon buonaparte does not sail east instead he sails west he pauses off cartagena to collect spanish battleships then passes gibraltar and heads north with the fleet in cadiz joining him as he passes he brushes us aside and reaches the channel there the brest fleet emerges to join him thirty of them with a combined fleet of moren fifty oftheline around him he will get his few hours to cross and then it will be all over for us i fear addington chose his words carefully but would it not be prudent to send ships into the mediterranean to stop him at the outset and leave englands defence the poorer he pondered for a space and continued in an odd tone but then the decision is taken out of my hands what i think is of no account the austrians are adamant that as a condition to an alliance we must provide a naval presence to protect naplesyou will recollect that the queen of naples is austrian born and as the austrians are the only friends we havepace the portuguese we must accede and then of course theres todays dispatch from genoa genoa yes something that changes the stakes utterly how so we have a reliable agent in genoa hes reporting that the french have been active buying barrelsfour thousand of the very biggest with ten iron hoops but no bung holes addington was mystified for the first time pitt smiled henry old fellow youll never be mistaken for a character of the seafaring species such barrels are tied to ships sides to assist them in floating over shallow waters and that is proof positive that dundas is right the french armament is to force the dardanelles by this means and take constantinople sultan selim iii is friendly to us and we cannot allow this to happen i shall therefore direct that st vincent off cadiz forthwith undertakes a reconnaissance in force we will return to the mediterranean chapter lieutenant thomas kydd turned in his chair to tysoe his servant an ill have another soup if y please he smiled at his friend renzi and loosened his stock in the warmth of the crowded wardroom of hms tenacious thunderin good prog nicholas dye think moose muffle pringle captain of marines called over the hubbub he inspected the piece of meat he had speared spring moose is better in june youll find once the beast has a mort of fat on him the wardroom echoed to gusts of laughter in response to a sally by captain houghton at the head of the tablehis officers had invited him to dine with them this night the older of the seamen servants glanced at each other meaningfully the ship had pulled together in fine style with officers in harmony so much less was the likelihood of interference in their own community kydds soup plate was removed ah i think the baked shad he said and turned to pybus the surgeon not as i mean t say im wearying of cod you know that in nova scotia is a felony mr kydd pybus said drily reaching for the chicken as usual he was wearing an old green waistcoat kydd nodded at the servant and his glass was neatly refilled he let his eyes wander beyond the colour and chatter of the occasion through the graceful sweep of the stern windows to halifax harbour the darkness relieved by scattered golden pinpricks of light from other ships at anchor just a year ago he had been under discipline before the mast accused of treason after the nore mutiny he had joined the insurrection in good faith then been carried along by events that had overwhelmed them all but for mysterious appeals at the highest level he should have shared his comrades fate and been hanged with them he had never dreamed of elevation to the sanctity of the quarterdeck now he had won another great prize acceptance by the other officers as an equal where might it all lead pray assist me with this rheingau tom renzi said reaching across with a white wine there was a contentment in him too kydd observed his friend who had come with him from the lower deck was now settled at this much more agreeable station which befitted his highborn background mr kyddyour health sir the captains voice carried down the table kydd lifted his glass with a civil inclination of the head votter santay he responded gravely houghton had risen above his objections to his fifth lieutenants humble origins after a social coup had established kydds connections with the highest in the land unaware of her identity kydd had invited prince edwards mistress to an official banquetto the great pleasure of the prince i cn well recommend th ruffed grouse sir kydd said a seaman picked up the dish and carried it to the captain who acknowledged it graciously tall glasses appeared before each officer filled with what appeared to be a fine amber fluid the captain was the first to try by george its calfs foot jelly he said lemonwhos responsible for this perfection he demanded of his steward lady wentworths own recipe sir she desires to indicate in some measure to his majestys ship tenacious her sensibility of the honour lieutenant kydd bestowed on her by accepting her invitation to the levee i see said the captain and flashed a glance at kydd the third lieutenant gervase adams shifted in his chair no disrespect intended sir but it gripes me that we wax fat and indolent while our country lies under such grave peril houghton frowned any officer of honour would feel so mr adams but the safeguarding of trade and securing of naval supplies is of as much consequence to your country as the winning of battles pray bear your lot with patience there may yet be a testing time ahead for us all houghton motioned to his steward and the last dishes were removed the cloth drawn decanters of marsala and port were placed at the head and foot of the table and passed along always to the left as custom dictated when all glasses had been filled houghton nodded almost imperceptibly to bryant first lieutenant and president of the mess who turned to kydd as the most junior lieutenant present mr vicethe king kydd lifted his glass and paused for quiet gentlemen the king the words echoed strongly around the table the simple ceremony of the loyal toast seemed to kydd to draw together all the threads of his allegiance to king and country and with others he followed with a sincere god bless him the solemn courtesies complete other toasts were made foxhunting and old port our brothers at sea and the heartfelt a willing foe and sea room red faces testified to the warmth and the wine and when the brandy had circulated houghton called captain pringle might we press you to honour us with your flute should i be joined by our excellent doctor i would be glad to sir the marine was a proficient and sensitive player and a lively violin accompaniment from the normally acerbic pybus set the mood of the evening adams was persuaded to render a creditable sweet lass of richmond hill in his light tenor and renzi delivered a reading from his new copy of lyrical ballads it is the first mild day of march each minute sweeter than before the redbreast sings from the tall larch that stands beside our door there is a blessing in the air which seems a sense of joy to yield to the bare trees and mountains bare and grass in the green field houghton rose to his feet he raised his glass and said softly to tenacious tenacious came the reply with more than one murmured bless her there were no ready words to describe the affection that the old gun shipoftheline had won in the hearts of her officers and kydd felt a lump in his throat he could see the others were affected too in the quiet a sudden knock at the wardroom door sounded overly loud with rainwater streaming from his grego the duty masters mate awkwardly handed over an oilskin packet capn sirurgent from flag it was unusual to the point of disquiet that the admiral had seen fit to act immediately instead of waiting for the usual morning postal round and all craned towards the head of the table houghton scanned the covering letter then looked up gravely gentlemen you should be advised that the situation in europe has intensified therefore we are to be recalled from this station to join that of admiral the earl st vincent before cadizwe sail with the utmost dispatch taking the deck for his first seawatch since leaving halifax kydd strode to the ships side and looked down with satisfaction at the busy wake forming and spreading in a hiss of obedience slipping astern to join the other side in a lazy track that stretched far into the distance he returned to the binnacle the ships heading was within a whisker of east by south his eyes rose to meet a look of reproach from the helmsman and he concealed a smile he had no right to usurp the quartermasters responsibility for the course and knew only too well the irritation of a meddlesome officerofthewatch but these were momentous times since houghton had received his orders from the admiral he had been unsparing in his drive to get tenacious to sea whatever additional information he was privy to had lined his face and he had issued each officerofthewatch stern instructions to clap on every stitchbut woe betide all should it cost even a single spar as he paced the quarterdeck kydds thoughts turned briefly to another matter gibraltar was less than a days sail away from cadiz it would serve his purpose well if they touched on that fortress port it would give him great satisfaction to conclude a particular task there he had decided on it after parting with his uncle in a remote settlement in the canadian maritimes kydd stopped to feel the ships motion under all plain sail in the brisk quartering southwesterly tenacious heaved and rose over the long atlantic rollers in a strong and compelling rhythm pleasing in its regularity he sensed the waves meeting her bow and surging aft under the keel the vessels slow pitch conforming to its motion but there was something furthera trifle perhaps but out of harmony with the concert of movement he glanced across the deck captain houghton was taking the air on the weather side walking with the first lieutenant there was a full watch of the hands on deck and others were at work on their partofship kydd signalled to the quartermaster that he was going forward then made his way to the foredeck and stood feeling sensing the bowwave swashed and hissed below above him soared the headsails taut and trim but there was something he turned to peer up above the mighty forecourse past the tops to the topsail and topgallant something was causing a hesitation a brief interruption in the forward urge of the ship he moved to one side until he could see the end of the bowsprit spearing into the sky ahead it soared and dipped but then kydd saw what was happening it was not an upanddown motion instead it described a circle in the sky certain indication that the helmsman was having to ease the wheel each time the bows met an oncoming sea that was ita griping caused by the ships tendency to come closer to the wind when her forefoot bit deep into the wave kydd was annoyed that the quartermaster had not noticed it he knew that with every billow tenacious was losing way through the water only a tiny amount but there were countless thousands of waves across the atlantic he turned on his heel and headed back trying to work out how to resolve the problem the usual remedy was to move provisions or guns aft but the ship was fully stored and this would be awkward and dangerous also with but a single frigate nearly out of sight ahead it would be prudent to leave the guns where they were he reached the quarterdeck and houghton glanced at him curiously kydd did not catch his eye as he ordered the mateofthewatch hands to set sail stunsls had been struck earlier in the day and the man looked surprised he hesitated then hailed the boatswain mr pearce kydd told him as were lasking along winds frm the quarter i mean t take in the foretopmast staysl and then well set the large jib the boatswains eyebrows rose but after only the briefest look in the captains direction he drew out his silver call kydd knew it was not a popular order among the men the large jib would have to be roused out from below and heaved up on deck the long sausage of canvas needing thirty men at least to grapple with it and the handing of the foretopmast staysail a foreandaft sail leading down from aloft was hard wet and dangerous followed by the awkward job of hanking the large jib houghton had stopped pacing and was watching kydd closely the master emerged from the cabin spaces to stand with him and the first lieutenant but kydd kept his eyes forward as the boatswain set the men about their tasks the focslemen lowered the foretopmast staysail the men out on the bowsprit using both hands to fist the unruly canvas as it came down the stay this was a job for the most experienced seamen in the ship balancing on a thin footrope they bellied up to the fat spar and brought in the sail forming a skin and stuffing in the bulk before passing gaskets round it all the while the bowsprit reared and fell in the lively seas kydd stayed on the quarterdeck looking forward and seeing occasional bursts of spray from the bow shoot up from beneath soaking men and canvas he felt for them at last the jib was bent on and began jerking up flapping and banging and the men made their way back inboard sheets were tended and the action was complete mr kydd what was your purpose in setting the large jib houghton called kydd crossed the deck and touched his hat the ship gripes sir i surely you would therefore attend to the trim sir were fully stored difficult t work below he began recalling his experiences as a quartermasters mate and the dangers lurking in a dark hold when the ship was working in a seaway this way we cn cure the griping an get an edge of speed houghton frowned and looked at the master who nodded ah i believe mr kydd means t lift the bowsyoull know the headsls are lifting sails an at this point o sailing the large jib will do more of a job in this than our staysl and the speed houghton wanted to know but kydd could already sense the effects the hesitation was gone and it felt much like a subtle lengthening of stride he turned to the mateofthewatch a cast o the log if y please it was only half a knot more but this was the same as subtracting from their voyage the best part of a hundred miles for every week at sea kydd held back a grin and if it comes on t blow we let fly sir houghton gave a curt acknowledgement does seem t me shes a seakindly ship if y know what i mean sir kydd dared the wardroom was a quite different place from what it had been a day or so before officers sat at table for dinner together in the usual way but now they were in seafaded comfortable uniform and there was always one absent on watch and instead of the stillness of harbour repose there was the soaring swooping movement of deep ocean that had everyone finding their sealegs once more fiddles had been fitted round the tabletaut cords at the edge to prevent plates tumbling into laps glasses were never poured more than half full and wetted cloths prevented bottles sliding all familiar accompaniments to sea service the chaplain entered for dinner passing along hand by hand to steady himself do take a sup of wine kydd said solicitously thank you perhaps later peake murmured distracted he reached for the breadbarge which still contained portions of loavessoon they would be replaced with hard tackand selected a crust i confess i was ever a martyr to the oceans billows he said faintly kydd remembered the times when he had been deprived of renzis company while peake and he had been happily disputing logic and could not resist saying then is not yr philosophy comfort enough nicholas conjure some words as will let us see th right of it renzi winked at him was it not the sainted traherne who tells us let me see you never enjoy the world aright till the sea itself floweth in your veins till you are clothed with the heavens and crowned with the stars and perceive yourself to be the sole heir of the whole world peake lifted dull eyes and said weakly i believe the good book may be more relied upon in this matter as you will find in proverbs the thirtieth chapter there be three things which are too wonderful for me the way of an eagle in the air the serpent on a rockand the way of a ship in the midst of the sea bamptons voice cut above the chuckles that you can safely leave with us mr peake but well have early need of your services i fancy adams gave the second lieutenant a quizzical look you dont really think wed be cracking on like this unless theres to be some sort of final meeting with the french it stands to reason bampton continued the table fell silent the frantic preparations for sea the storing of powder and shot and lastminute fitting and repairs had left little time for the contemplation of larger matters renzi steepled his fingers not necessarily all we have is rumour and hearsay we have abandoned the mediterranean with reason that we can no longer support a fleet there and therefore every vessel of ours is undefended prey in this case we have no means of intelligence to tell us what is happening hence the wild speculation now we do know of general buonaparte and his designs on englandthe landing boats in every northern french port the daily inspections of his army of england do you not feel it the more likely that he will ransack toulon and cartagena for ships of force to swell the brest fleet to an unstoppable power that will overwhelm us rather that is than retain them in a landlocked sea for some sort of escapade far away just as i said bampton snorted a conclusion with mr buonaparte in the chops of the channel somewheres id wager and except were being sent south to cadiz renzi old trout youre not being clear adams admonished him am i not then it could be that i am as much in the dark as you are we to be part of a grand fleet about to break into the med again or might it be that we being only a sixtyfoura fine one indeed as i am obliged to remarkour purpose is merely that of releasing the more warlike seventyfours at the head of the table bryant glowered as first lieutenant his interest in a future bloody battle and the subsequent custom of promotion to commander for an active officer had been all too apparent on the quiet north american station the prospect of sitting out his battle far from the action was hard to endure theres a reason for it never fear he said loudly jervis aint the one to ask for ships without hes got a plan my moneys on him takin buonaparte as he heads north with the toulon squadron afore he can join up with the mongseers off brest it was exhilarating sailing a starboard tack with winds quartering mile after deepsea mile on the same course as they edged south the weather brightened the vivid white of towering clouds and hurrying whitehorse seas contrasting pleasingly with the deep ultramarine of the water the stimulating stream of oceanic air impelling them along made it hard to stay below and when renzi took over his watch kydd felt too restless to retire to his cabin to work on his divisional list and waited while renzi satisfied himself as to the ships condition they fell into step in an easy promenade around the quarterdeck the messenger midshipman returned to the helm as did the duty masters mate leaving the two officers to their privacy they paced in silence until renzi said dear fellow do i see you satisfied with your lot is this the visage of him who is at one with the world since your elevation to the ranks of the chosen are you content now with your station kydd paused nicholas ive been athinking who i am where im headed in life that sort o thing he shot his friend a glance its not long since i was in bilboes waiting fr the rope now im a kings officer what does that say t you well in between there was a prodigious battle and some courage as i recall kydd gestured impatiently nicholas ill tell ye truly while i was afore the mast i was content i allow that then t be a sailing master was all i could see an all i wanted from life then with just one turn o the screw my stars change an here i am makes me thinkmight be anything can happen why anything atall he spun round to face renzi squarely nicholas m life will never be complete until i have my own ship walk my decks not a man aboard but tips his hat t me does things my way an for me i get the chance to win my own glory because i make the decisions good or bad theyre mine and i get the rewardsor the blame so how does it sound nicholascapn thomas kydd royal navy renzi raised an eyebrow a junior lieutenant with such ardour where is the old tom kydd that i knew he gave a smile then added i admire your fervour and respect your passion for the laurels but you will have noticed of course that fortune bestows her favours at random you stand just as much a chance of having your head knocked off as winning glory less than three weeks later they passed the distant blue peak of morro alto to starboard marking the island of flores at the western extremity of the azores their passage in the steady westerlies had been fast and sure and it was becoming a point of honour to win every advantage gain the last fraction of a knot hms tenacious was answering the call noon the hallowed time of the grog issue for the hands a fife at the main hatchway started up with the welcome strains of nancy dawson and kydd waited for the decks to clear it was time too for the ceremony of the noon sight officers readied their instruments at local apparent noon while the men were below they would fix the line of longitude passing through their position and thus compute the distance remaining to their rendezvous off cadiz a crisp horizon and the ships motion predictably even it was a good sighting most officers retired to their cabins for peace in the concentrated work of applying the necessary corrections and resolving the mathematics resulting in the intersection of latitude and longitude that was the ships location at midday from first one then another cabin came disbelieving shouts well dammefive degrees of longitude noon to noon two hundred and fifty miles off the reel in twentyfour hours shes a champion that night glasses were raised to tenacious in the wardroom but as the ship neared the other side of the atlantic a more sombre mood prevailed exercise of gunnery took on new meaning as the ominous rumble of heavy guns was felt through the deck at all hours who knew what trial by battle lay ahead landfall on the continent of europe was the looming heights of portugals cape st vincent which faded into the dusk as they held course through the night the officers took their breakfast quietly and though the fleet was not expected to be sighted before the afternoon every one went on deck straight after the meal news for the love of god let us have news groaned adams running his hands through his fair hair they had been cut off from the world for weeks across the width of the atlantic and anything could have happened for all we know of it bampton said drily we may be sailing into an empty anchorage the spanish gone to join the french and our grand battle decided five hundred miles away bryant glared at him or peace declared said renzi conversations tailed off at the mention of this possibility and all the officers turned towards him he continued pitt is sorely pressed the coalition in ruins and the threat to our shores could not be greater if he treats with the french now exchanges colonies for peace he may secure a settlement far preferable to a longdrawnout war of attrition he paused after all france alone has three times our population a five times bigger army what do y mean by this kind o talk sir bryant snapped simply that if a french or spanish vessel crosses our bows do we open with broadsides is it peace or is it war it would go hard for any who violate hardwon terms of peace at a little after two the low anonymous coast of spain firmed in a bright haze ahead the mainmast lookout bawled down deck hoooo sailotheline a dozen or moreat anchor the long wait was over gunners party came the order there would be salutes and ceremony as they joined the fleet of admiral of the blue the earl st vincent kydd as tenaciouss signal lieutenant roused out the signal flag locker and found the largest blue ensign he smiled wryly at the thought of the hard work he knew would be there for him later the signal procedures this side of the atlantic would be different and he would need to prepare his own signal book accordingly ahead the dark body of the fleet against the backdrop of enemy land slowly resolved into a long crescent of anchored warships spreading the width of the mouth of a majestic harbour as they approached kydd identified the flagship in the centre the mighty gun ville de paris her admirals pennant at the main to seaward of the crescent a gaggle of smaller ships was coming and going victuallers and transports dispatch cutters hoys a sudden crack of salutes rang out startling him at his telescope answering thuds came from the flagship now opposite ville de paris tenacious backed her main topsail but an officious halfdecked cutter foamed up astern and came into the wind an officer with a speaking trumpet blared up the admiral desires you should moor to the suthard of the line obediently tenacious paid off and got under way for her appointed berth kydd marvelled at the extraordinary sight before him the grandest port in spain locked and secured by a fleet of ships so close that the great ramparts of the city were in plain view with a wide sprawl of white houses glaring in the sun turrets cathedral domesand a curious tower arising from the sea at the end of the line they rounded to and came to single anchor the newest member of the fleet captain houghtons barge was in the water even as the cable was veered resplendent in full dress with best sword and decorations he was swayed into it by yardarm tackle and chair and departed to report to the commanderinchief houghton did not return immediately rumour washed around theres been a fright only bryant huffed just as the frogs always do made to put t sea an when they see us all in a pelt put about and scuttle back not like old jarvie t take a scare so adams looked disconsolate the thought of enervating blockade duty was trying on the spirit after the thrill of the headlong race across the atlantic still an all youll not be wanting entertainment bryant mused the old buggers a right hard horse marks o respect evewwn in a blow captains to be on deck during the night when takin in sail and if theres a sniff o mutiny courtmartial on the saturday hangs em on the sunday the captain arrived back at dusk and disappeared into his cabin within the hour word was passed that all officers were desired to present themselves in the great cabin forthwith i shall be brief houghton snapped the situation in respect to the present threat to england is unclear frances army of england is still massing for invasion and there are fears for ireland now weve heard that its commanderinchiefthis general buonapartehas abandoned it for the time being and gone to toulon god knows why now you know as much as i and the admiral to more important matters those who have served before with sir john jervis now the earl st vincent know well what to expect in the article of discipline and order we are now a part of his fleet and his opinions on an officers duty are robust and unambiguous you will each consult the fleet order book until its contents are known intimately any officer who through ignorance of his duty brings disrepute upon my ship will incur my most severe displeasure sir might we know our purpose are we to remain while the seventyfours our purpose is very clear mr adams in case it has escaped your notice let me inform you that in this port there are twentysix oftheline under almirante mazzeredo should we fail in our duty and let this armada get to sea his face tightened we lie before cadiz on blockade sir and here we shall stay until the spanish see fit to sail do you understand me chapter the sound of firing transfixed the wardroom at their breakfast after just three days on blockade any variation to routine was welcome and there was a rush to the hatchway as saluting guns announced the approach of a smart from the north houghton appeared on deck wiping his mouth with a napkin sir called bampton who was officerofthewatch pennants of hms vanguard seventyfour flag of rear admiral nelson aha now well see some action growled bryant snatching the telescope from bampton and training it on vanguards quarterdeck yeees that must be him always was the popinjay he handed the glass back didnt think to see him back at sea only last year at tenerife he lost an arm to a musketshot had it sawn off right arm it was too bampton took a brief sight then lowered the telescope yes but a vain man very vain he muttered the ship passed close by gold lace glinted on her quarterdeck seamen stood rigid at their stations in tenacious boatswains calls piped attention to the new rear admiral joining and all hands tried to catch a glimpse of the renowned victor of the great battle of st vincent he of the patent bridge for boarding firstrates where he had taken one enemy ship then used it as a steppingstone to lead an attack on his next victim vanguard rounded the line to join the halfdozen or so vessels close inshore and the officers of tenacious returned to their breakfast sir vanguard is signalling rawson reported to kydd well growled kydd in mock exasperation at his signals midshipman er sirunion at the mizzen topmasthead distinguishing pennants er thats captains repair on board flag an they are let me see orion alexander emerald othersand us so er yes siracknowledge my duty t the captain an acquaint him of the signal if y please houghton wasted no time his barge disappeared quickly into a throng of small craft but he was back just as rapidly and summoned all officers to his cabin he motioned them to sit at the polished table but remained standing and leaned forward animated gentlemen i have to tell you that intelligence of the gravest kind has been received from overland concerning the french intentions every eye was on him it seems that they are at this moment massing in toulon and are about to make a sally he spread out a smallscale chart of the mediterranean this is far more serious than a simple adventure it has the attention and presence of their highest general napoleon buonaparte and could mean either a mass breakout from the mediterranean to join up with their forces in brest or some descent to the east in a move towards the ottomans or india they have had the mediterranean as their private sea for too longit has made them ambitious and the danger this poses to our country is incalculable therefore i have to tell you that sir john has determined that at last we shall reenter the mediterranean there shall be an immediate reconnaissance in force towards toulon to discover the french intentions it will be led by rear admiral nelsonand we shall be a part in this major fleet off cadiz in addition to a full admiral as commanderinchief there was a vice admiral for the van of the lineofbattle and a rear admiral for the rear exceptionally there was also a separate squadron whose task was to rove close inshore harrying the enemy at every opportunity and this was the particular command of rear admiral nelson there was a stunned silence then excited babble broke out houghton grinned and straightened if you please gentlemen sir horatio will brook no delay he intends to sail for gibraltar in two days i will not have tenacious disappoint so you will bend every effort to ready her for sea carry on the rock of gibraltar resolved from the haze like a crouching lion dominating the vessels that drew up to its flanks to join the shipsoftheline and frigates already there as anchors plunged into a gunmetal blue sea the thunder of salutes acknowledged the visiting princess royal as the flag of a senior admiral the ships came to rest and the slight breeze brought a smell compounded of sunbaked rock goats donkey droppings and moorish cooking which irresistibly took kydd back to his service there in achillesand the adventures that had followed i do believe it will now be granted to us to glimpse the grand panjandrum himself renzi said looking at vanguard anchored a few hundred yards away kydd held back a reproof his friend had been at the great battle of st vincent and witnessed nelsons achievements at first hand oh said bampton is he so much the swell he must parade before us kydds colour rose at bamptons tone not as i would say renzi replied rather i have heard he keeps a splendid table and is the most affable of hosts should you have seen him here a year or so ago in minerve frigate youd clap a stopper on yr opinions kydd added and recounted the daring escape of nelsons ship from two spanish shipsoftheline from the top of the rock kydd had watched the whole incident nelson had bluffed the enemy by heaving to and suspecting he was leading them into a trap the spaniards had sheered off but the real reason for his action was that he had lowered a boat to rescue a man overboard the talking died as vanguards boat was hoisted out and several figures boarded it stroked strongly for the shore and was met at ragged staff by a file of redcoats a military band and a reception committee making his number with the governor murmured adams ohara said kydd with a grin they call him cock o the rock on account of him being so amiable t the ladies after a short interval there was a pealing of boatswains calls and the captain of tenacious departed god knows our nel isnt one to waste his time lingering in port the first lieutenant said he turned to the boatswain no liberty all hands to store ship turn to partoship the boatswain called his mates and stalked forward the piercing blast of their pipes echoing up from the hatchways all the water an provisions we can take aboardour ships are on their own once we sail bryant growled but this was work for the warrant officers petty officers and ships company kydd seized his opportunity nicholas should you step off with me y could be of some service m friend renzi raised one eyebrow er regarding town major mulvany and his wife do you not think it a trifle rash to venture abroad in gibraltar that you may meet them kydds infatuation with emily mulvany was nearly a year previously but renzis gibe was enough to bring a flush ive heard theres a new man in post now he said defensively bryant saw no reason to deny them both a few hours ashore and within a short time they were speaking to the chief valuer for moses levy the biggest jeweller in gibraltar your opinion on this if y please kydd said passing him his hoarded treasure the man took the object scratched the surface with a hookshaped pick and closely inspected the result then he took down a dusty vial with a glass dropper and deposited several drops of fluid on the tiny specks a remarkable piece he said grudgingly hefting the hunk of raw gold may i know where this was found he said as he set it on one pan of his scales no sir you may not kydds uncle would find his haven destroyed by prospectors if ever kydd let it be known it had been his uncles gift to probably the last family member he would see and kydd was going to see it well used the valuer carefully added weights to the other pan kydd glanced at renzi who seemed unaffected by the excitement the man peered at the weights then said this is what i can offer four hundred silver pesos on account now and an adjustment later after it has been assayed that would seem equitable renzi said outside he added at six pesos to the guinea an excellent trademore than enough to they knew where they had to go a bare twenty minutes along the familiar bustle of main street was town range the residential quarter for army officers and in a sidestreet they found the garrison swordcutler kydd turned to renzi now nicholas understand that its a fightin sword im getting none o your macaroni pigstickers as youve mentioned before dear chap the steelglittered interior was hung with every conceivable hand weapon ceremonial armour regimental gorgets and armorial heraldry kydd wandered along the racks of edged weapons this was no quartermasters armoury with stout greysteel blades and wooden hilts here was damascened elegance in blue gold and ivory see this kydd said selecting one he flourished itthe military style seemed heavier the slightly curved blade urging more of a slashing stroke than a direct thrust it did however have a splendid appearance the blade blued along its length with silver chasing down from the hilt the halfbasket guard ornate and firegilded a fighting sword renzi drawled aye well a fine piece kydd said replacing it as a man stepped out from the workshop at the rear gentlemen an honour he spoke softly but his eyes took measure of kydds strong build and upright bearing balthasar owen its not so often we are visited by the navy not a small sword is my guess he added with a smile glancing at a discreet lightbladed hanger usually worn by gentlemen in the street a fightin sword for a naval gentleman if y please kydd replied owen hesitated the expense is not t be considered let th blade be the best y have should you have any fine toledo steel blades it would answer renzi added a toledo blade this will be difficult since the late war began you will understand the best steel in the world we agree renzi pressed and in the matter of your price owen closed the front door toledo steel is the hardest there is because it is forged from an iron heart and the finest steel lapped and folded on itself more than three hundred times this gives it flexibility but great hardness it can take a razors edge that has been known to last centuries you see at the forge the swordsmith works only by night such is their care that when the blade is plunged into the oil the heats colour is exactly known the result an impeccable temper he paused and looked keenly at the two there have been many attempts at fraud can you tell the singular damascening of a toledo blade no then the only one you may trust is myselffor if i sell you an inferior then my standing as swordcutler to the military will be exploded now if i can find such a one it would cost dear perhaps more than three hundred silver pesosin english money say fifty pounds very well said kydd immediately which is to say no paper money payment upon delivery aye and workshop time compensated kydd began to count out the spanish coins should ye need an advance t assist in th looking then owens expression eased as it happens i have knowledge of two suitable bladesthese are of course just that blades i will fetch them they will be hilted here in my workshop to your instructions er ltenant kydd royal navy sir bows were exchanged and owen withdrew kydd smiled at renzi o course the whole world knows o this toledo steel but i never thought t sport such a one i give you joy of your expectation brother renzi who had been tutored from youth in the art of fencing lifted out a straightbladed spadroon and swung it round his wrist then in a glittering whirl of motion it came to rest the needle point an inch from kydds nose supple light in hand but of no account in a serious contest renzi said and replaced it in the rack owen returned carrying a long package which he carefully unwrapped on the counter top kydd caught his breath despite the ugly naked tang at the top the sword blades lethal gleam shone with an impossibly fine lustre take it urged owen if you look closely you might perceive the damascene workings kydd lifted the blade sighting along it and feeling its weight admiring the almost imperceptible whorls of metal colour the other toledo i have is a thirtytwoinch owen said this being only a twentyeight no sir aboard ship we set no value on length kydd said stroking the blade in reverence sudden an quicks the word the shorter swings faster is the fullering to your satisfaction sir kydd slid his thumb down the single wide groove feeling its sensual curvature as it diminished towards the tip aye it will do then perhaps we should discuss the furniture kydds brow creased yes the blade is forged in toledo we perform the hilting here kydd avoided renzis eye and listened politely naval gentlemen are taking a stirrup knucklebow these days he said familiarly lifting a sword by its blade and holding it vertical instead of forming a round semicircle the guard had a pleasing sinuosity ending in a flat bar you will remark the short quillion on this piece he added touching the sword crosspiece more to your sea tastes i believe and the gripsfor a fighting sword we have ivory filigree sharkskin kydd said firmly and turned to see renzi nodding aye dark sharkskin it must be now yr pommel ah yes you naval gentlemen will be asking for the lionhead pommel it remains only to specify how far down the backpiece of the grip you wish the mane to extend some gentlemen halfway will be fine chased er silver gold ah yes how will gold chasin look dye think nicholas dear fellow this is a fighting sword i think then none owen returned the sword to its place and the detailing he pursed his lips and crossed to another rack triangular langets he said showing the neat little catch for holding the sword secure in its scabbard not so plain im thinkinhave you an anchor perhaps certainly would you consider damascening in blue and gold some bladeetchinga mermaid a seahorse perhaps and the scabbard black oiled leather of course with carrying rings and frog stud for belt or shoulder carriage shall the sword knot be in bullion or blue tassels it was well into the afternoon before all details had been settled the swordcutler had puzzled over kydds insistent demand for engravings of choughs but he had promised a sketch of the birds for the etching for the rest it had cost a pretty premium to command the entire resources of the workshop to have it finished in time but he would then possess the finest sword imaginable and there was every reason to suppose that it would soon be drawn in anger back on board the remainder of the day passed busily men sweated in the heat as they struck stores down into the hold others roused out cannonballs from their lockers and scaled rust from them more still went over every inch of rigging so far signal instructions from their new admiral had not been sent over so kydd concentrated on what he had a detached squadron was not a fleet even if commanded by an admiral and there might be difficulties probably a fat sheaf of complex signal details would arrive the day they sailed kydd thought ruefully the following day the pace had calmed gibraltar dockyard was not a major fleet base and had no vast stocks of sea stores mens minds began to turn shoreward for the last opportunity to raise a wind for who knew how long liberty was granted to the trusties of the larboard watch until evening gun kydd knew where they would headthere were establishments enough in irish town alone to cater to an entire fleet he and renzi found time to share a pleasant meal at the old porter house on scud hill they sank an ale on the terrace the entire sweeping curve of gibraltar bay lay before them under the setting sun spain the enemy was a bare five miles distant the two friends talked comfortably together of remembered places far away unspoken however was any mention of the fire of war which must soon reach out and engulf them both soon after breakfast a midshipman appeared mr kydd sir and the capn desires to see you when convenient the coding of the summons indicated delay would not be in his interest and his pulse quickened as he remembered that the previous day houghton had spent the whole afternoon and evening with admiral nelson kydd quickly mounted the companionway and knocked at the door sir there was another captain with him and a midshipman rigid to one side houghton rose thank you for your time mr kydd i believe you remember captain essington kydds astonishment quickly turned to pleasure as he shook the hand of his captain in triumph at the bloody battle of camperdown who had commended him to acting lieutenant in tenacious but for essingtons intercession at his lieutenants examination kydd would have been for a certainty back before the mast he is flagcaptain of princess royal houghton added essingtons face creased to a smile lieutenant if you are at leisure it would gratify me should we take the air on the quarterdeck for a small while sir kydd fell into step beside the eminent officer your captain speaks highly of you essington said at length a source of some satisfaction to me that the service has seen some benefit to my actions after camperdown you may rely on m duty sir kydd said stiffly im sure of it essington returned but today i have come on quite a different missionhe paused while they passed the quartermasterwhich i find delicate enough in all conscience kydd tensed he had been puzzled that houghton had held back to allow a senior flagcaptain to talk directly with him and now this admission of delicacy essington stopped pacing and faced kydd the essence of it all is sir my nephew bowden has been sent to me in the character of midshipman to place upon the quarterdeck of princess royal however in short i do not believe it in his best interest to serve in the same ship as his uncle neither do i feel a flagship of the cadiz blockade a good place to learn the elements of his profession captain houghton has been good enough to agree to exchange him into tenacious where he will join the gunroom and begin his education er yes sir kydd could see no reason why he should be informed of such an arrangement i tell you this in order that you be under no apprehension that he is to be accorded any privileges whatsoever beyond those extended to his fellow young gentlemen notwithstanding his gentle birthand you may understand he is my sisters childi desire that he be treated the same sir with respect i cant see how this is a concern fr me essington smiled this is then the delicacy it is my wish that young bowden do learn his nauticals properly neglecting none to be a sure foundation for his future i do not ask you will be the schoolmaster in this but i would take it very kindly in you should you watch over his learning that is his notions of seamanship will then be of prime worth coming as they will from one whose own such are so unquestioned sir you flatter me kydd said carefully but nursemaid to a midshipman and anyway as an officer he would not have any direct relationship with a midshipman that was the province of the masters mates and petty officers essington frowned i do not ask you will interfere merely that as the occasion presents you do try him in the particulars sparing neither his feelings nor time as you deem necessary aye aye sir kydd acknowledged formally very well captain houghton knows of my request and will hear any suggestion you may have conformable to the requirements of his ship hesitating essington went on quietly the boy is er eager to please having latterly formed a pressing desire for the sea life which will not be denied but his ideas of life in a midshipmans berth are somewhat whimsical sir i i have instructed him that under no circumstances should you be approached on matters not pertaining to the sea profession essington said hell find his place soon enoughor suffer either way this is not a concern of yours he hauled a gold hunter from his waistcoat i see it is past eleveni have to go ashore now it only remains for me to wish you good fortune mr kydd and to thank you kydd watched the gangling midshipman he had seen in the captains cabin emerge from the cabin spaces aft the lad in brand new blues and a toolarge cocked hat looked bewildered seeing essington he went to him remembering at the last moment to remove his hat his fingers worked nervously at his dirk as they exchanged murmured words the boy attempted a last embrace and then essington went down the side amid the ceremonial shriek of pipes kydd caught the glint of tears the rigidity of barely held control mr rawson he bellowed up to the poopdeck where he knew his signal midshipman had been working at the flag locker rawson appeared at the poop rails in his shirtsleeves then slid down the ladder to join him sir mr rawson this is mr bowden be so good as to convey him t the midshipmens berth and settle him inan none of yr guardo tricks if y please kydd turned away feigning disinterest but listened to the exchange that followed so what do we call ye then rawson teased spit it out younker er charles sir no all of it rawson said with relish well find out from the ships books anyway well er itsits herher damn it fellow we havent got all day herherhercules aaberdour charles ayscough sir said bowden in a small voice well now what infernal bad luck for you rawson said fruitily id wager the honourable as well the boy nodded miserably couldnt be bettered rawson said with a whoop welcome to th cockpitonians wheres your seachest then by later that forenoon tenacious was in tolerable seagoing order her gear inspected and renewed or turned end for end spars scraped back and well blacked guns and gunlocks minutely checked every conceivable corner and space was stowed with sea stores a thousand miles into a hostile mediterranean was not the place to discover deficiencies sitting with the others scratching away at last letters kydd sucked his quill there would be no mail sent or received as they sailed deeper into the ancient sea he bent again over his letter to his family but was noisily interrupted by a midshipman hurtling into the wardroom all officers he shrilled on deck instanterits the admiral the admirals barge had been seen putting off from vanguard but it did not shape a course inshore as usual with flag pennant aflutter it headed straight for tenacious with an unmistakable figure resplendent in gold lace and decorations in the sternsheets an appalled watch officer sent messengers scurrying while he hastily pulled together a side party houghton shot up from below roaring for the first lieutenant who when he finally appeared showed every evidence of hasty dressing kydd took his place with the receiving party of officers on the quarterdeck nervously tugging his hat and smoothing his waistcoat no one was in fit state to greet an admiral it was the usual custom to alert the ship well in advance but this was the famed nelson who was known to be different from the rest the bowman of the barge hooked on with a quite unnecessary flourish high at the deck edge the boatswain waited with his silver call poised his mates and sideboys in a line inward to the group of officers at the instant the top of a cocked hat appeared the calls pealed out together and rear admiral of the blue sir horatio nelson came aboard his flag breaking at the mizzen houghton came forward and removed his hat sir welcome aboard hms tenacious might i have the honour of presenting my officers the deck was absolutely still not a man moved except around the admiral at the junior end of the receiving line kydd dared a glance at the man who even now was known throughout the navy and increasingly by the general public one whose reputation must shortly be tested in this daring foray not as tall as kydds nelsons figure was sparse and drawn in no sense that of a hero and seemingly dwarfed by the weight of his decorations and gold lace kydd tried not to look at the empty sleeve pinned across his chest and the spindly legs and tensed as the admiral approached and lieutenant kydd sir fifth and junior houghtons tone betrayed that he too was affected by the presence do you come from a seagoing family no sir kydd answered i come frm guildford in th country he became uncomfortably aware of prematurely white hair and the odd milkyblue right eye then what made you follow the sea ii was pressed sir there was no avoiding the admission but to his relief a thin smile appeared and now you are a kings officer come aft the hardest way to your great credit sirthats so captain it is sir houghton stuttered kydd tried to think of a suitable reply but nelson had passed on before they entered the cabin spaces houghton turned to the officers sir horatio wishes to address you all shall we say my cabin in ten minutes in the great cabin of tenacious a chart of the mediterranean was already spread out on the table nelson wasted no time you will have heard from your captain the essence of what faces us the enemy is up to mischiefbut where he looked from face to face theres been no news no more intelligence forwarded to me than you yourselves know were sailing into the unknown but of this im sure the enemy must make his move soon and we shall be ready gentlemen we have the finest sea service of the age and we shall do our duty there were murmurs of approval bryants sounding above them all now to strategy our course will be to toulon we cruise off and on until we discover for a certainty what the french are doing if they make a move to the west we fall back im prepared to let gibraltar be taken to make certain that we can hold them at cadiz and there with the whole fleet we shall try for a conclusion there was a shocked silence which he broke we are talking now of the very security of our islandsthey will not pass he touched the chart to the east if on the other hand general buonaparte is considering an adventure to constantinople he will find he is trapped the waters are shoal and there is but the one entrance the dardanelles there he will find us waiting and he will see that it will bring the turks into close alliance and if they are further east to the levant perhaps the red sea we shall fall on their lines of supply he straightened painfully his face grim and set but all is vaporous posturing until we have met their fleet and disposed of it while it exists the mediterranean is a french lake all our striving must be to entice it to sea and bring it to battle that gentlemen is our entire strategy questions the heightened feeling was almost palpable bryant asked boldly what will be our force sir vanguard yourselves orion and alexander with three frigates too big to discourage from looking where we please too small to think we engage big enough to lure em out nelson snapped and waited for another question signals sir we havent yet the new instructions kydd found himself saying the others frowned but he was concerned that he did not yet have a signal book ready for any major fleet action in prospect neither will you nelson said briefly you are in a detached squadron of sir johns fleet off cadiz his signals therefore will still apply he then turned to kydd and smiled grimly and if any ship of the enemy lie ahead why our duty is plain and no signal required there was a stirring among the officers these were not the highly planned intricate tactics of a fleet in lineofbattle service under this admiral promised to be a time each would remember after the men had finished their grog and noon meal the officers sat down to dinner the wardroom was alive with only one topic a proud man but conceited bampton said firmly vanity does not a leader make in my opinion oh so you have personal knowledge of our famed commander there was an edge to adamss voice not directly but i have heard let the mans actions speak for emselves i say boomed bryant bampton came in instantly they have oh orders do you call them orders if you see an enemy ship damn the signals and close with him what kind of orders are those in a fleet action there has to be detailevery circumstance foreseen all manoeuvres planned in such a manner that every captain will know what is expected of him as for signalsis this an example to our junior officers are you satisfied mr kydd kydd had no experience in a fleet action as an officer as a masters mate on the lower deck during the battle of camperdown he had never been privy to the wider tactical picture on the quarterdeck now as a signal lieutenant he was expected to act as a crucial link in the chain of command hes a fighting seaman that i like kydd said firmly a rear admiral but goes out in th boats himself at cadiz takes the fight t the enemy seeking a reputation at the cannons mouth bryant snorted impatiently a plainsailing admiralim satisfied an i surely know what will answer with him kydd finished his meal in silence and went up on deck a lone figure stood by the hances it was bowden staring out unseeing kydd approached but before he could say anything the lad had moved away tysoe kydds servant appeared quickly the princess royal was giving a grand reception that evening in honour of admiral nelson and all gibraltar would be there full fig n sword certainly sir kydd held back a smiletysoe was never more contented than when he was arrayed in his finery the silver buckles sir of course kydd knew that this was tysoes way of ensuring he would not follow the modish wearing of hessian halfboots and pantaloons in place of kneebreeches and stockings but tysoe was not privy to the real purpose of the evening the function was a ruseseeing a grand party begin the watching spaniards would conclude that there would be no martial activity in the fleet that night or indeed the following morning but while the affair was proceeding the darkened vessels at anchor were being prepared directly the officers returned in the early hours they would put to sea and at dawn the spanish would realise that the english fleet had sailedbut out of their sight and in the opposite direction to their expectation back into the mediterranean at last at dusk boats put off from all ships heading for the glittering spangle of lights on princess royals quarterdeck the sound of an orchestra and excited voices floated across the still water kydd mounted the side and was greeted by the flaglieutenant the effect of so much blue and gold of the navy and the scarlet and gold of regimentals was breathtaking under the soft lanthorn light an officer of equal standing in the host ship took him into the throng seaman servants circulated with wine ladies stooped to admire the flowers that adorned the bitts round the mast and marvelled at the vivid colours of the flags of every nation draped along the bulwarks kydd felt a well of contentment this was what it was to be a kings officer to taste the sweets of his own achievement in a world he had entered by right the stage upon which he would perform for the rest of his professional life he saw his host bringing forward a young lady who dimpled with pleasure on seeing kydd the honourable arabella grantham believes she saw you before he added enviously yr servant miss arabella said kydd essaying a deep bow mr kydd you might not remember but when you were king neptune i was a cygnet she giggled it stopped him short until he recalled the fancydress assembly he had attended the last time he had been in gibraltar but o course the cygnet er impulsively she pressed forward eyes wide mr kydd it would make me very happy if you could i have no right yr pleasure is my command he said immediately feeling smug renzi would be impressed with this evidence of his developing urbanity er yes mr kydd what id adore more than anything in this world her eyes dropped but the lashes fluttered as she finished breathlessly is that you do introduce me to your famous nelson a lowly junior lieutenant sir horatio nelson miss arabella he began her blue eyes looked up at him beseechingly he glanced aft it was easy to spot nelson he was conferring at the centre of a distinguished group of senior officers and their followers if y please he offered his arm awkwardly and navigated them through the throng warning her of the odd ringbolt and hatch coaming rehearsing the words he would use that would excuse the impertinence of approaching a flag officer without leave nelson looked distracted as he listened to an anecdote from a jovial admiral who was clearly his senior it did not take a great leap of imagination to grasp that he would far rather be ranging the seas than dallying in port kydd waited for the account to finish and the guffaws to die then addressed nelson with trepidation ssir might i present miss arabella grantham who did express t me a desire to make yr acquaintance and will not be denied nelson gave kydd a cold stare before which he quailed then the gaze turned on the young woman and was transformed why my dear you are to be gratified this instant he said do you now meet admiral nelson of the blue at once your devoted admirer he bowed then took her hand and kissed it lieutenant your discernment in the matter of beauty is to your credit but i can only lament that it is much in evidence you have failed in your duty this young lady is without the means of refreshment on this warm night aye aye sir said kydd he noted that the hand had not been released bowed and went dutifully in search of some punch tempers on deck were fraying in the hot night as tenacious made ready for sea get forrard this instant damn your blood sir an officer threw at bowden as the hapless midshipman was jostled by men too busy to tell him where to go itll be stunsls o course the master said unable to risk the revealing bending of sail before the concealment of dark they were now faced with the task of sending up the long bolsters of canvas almost by touch casting under jib as the large fore and aft sail mounted it became plain from its limp flap that the light wind had backed even more easterly and they were once more held in the thrall of the rock this will need more than stunsls houghton snapped id hoped wed make our offing by dawn but now sir vanguard is putting her boats in the water bampton said carefully this implied a hard time for all yes i can see that houghton said irritably but what will they do there was no question but that they must follow the motions of the admiral and there were two alternatives he could take tow the heavy warships out with every boat available or warp out their launch and large pinnace only in the water sir then its to warp he turned to the boatswain mr pearce see to the launch and red cutter they would lay out an anchor ahead of the ship and heave up to it using the capstan then take it out and repeat the process inching to sea by main force mr kydd if you are at leisure youd oblige me by taking away the launch houghton said adams was to have the cutter hoisting out the heavy boat would take time so kydd went to his cabin to change into a comfortable seagoing rig then mustered his boats crew it was going to be hard sweaty painful work with the halfton of the kedge anchor slung from the boat and the even bigger weight of the catenary of hawser stretching to the ship kydd was glad to see dobbie a petty officer built like a prizefighter in his party sir he acknowledged with a gaptoothed grin bettern being down in th cable tiers the familiarity would have irked some officers but since his duel with dobbie in halifaxwhen the seaman had accused him of betraying the mutineers at the nore and kydd although an officer had been prepared to defend his name in the timehonoured fashion of the lower deckkydd had reason to tolerate it besides dobbie was right in a short while the job of the men coiling in the heavy wet cable in the hot fetid gloom of the orlop would be all but unendurable he turned to a boatswains mate pass the word for mr bowden er oo was that sir mr midshipman bowden if y please the calls echoed down the ship after some delay a breathless bowden hurried up managing to doff his hat and trip over at the same time mmr kydd sir even in the dimness the apprehension in his face was plain please t accompany me in th launch it would be instructive for bowden to see men at the very extremity of labour the launch smacked into the water and was brought round to the side steps where it hooked on the boats crew tumbled down the ships side and took their places aafter yyou sir bowden said there was a stifled chuckle among the men on deck and kydd said no lad its after you senior gets in last out first two capstan bars and a darklanthorn were handed down the light was hot and smelly but would be vital in the work to come kydd settled in the stern there was no rudder for this work dobbie would handle the steering oar shove off growled dobbie to the dark figure of the bowman standing right forward obediently the boathook was wielded and they moved out into the calm black waters but it was only to ease down to the mizzen chains where the kedge anchor was stowed if y pleases sir said dobbie holding a capstan bar in each hand he motioned towards the midshipmans unfortunate choice of seating in the centre of the boat o course shift out of it mr bowden the bars were placed fore and aft over the stroke thwart and the transom and the kedge anchor swayed down and was lashed into place its long shank easily spanning the width of the boat with flukes one side and stock the other the launch squatted down in the water with the weight out oars movement was heavy and slow as they made their way along the dark mass of the ship to her bow within her bulk there would be hundreds of men taking their place at the capstanswith hawsers out to two boats both the main and fore jeer capstans would be manned by every soul that could be found to keep up momentum their hawser was paid out to them and kydd himself doubled it back through the anchor ring holding it while dobbie passed the seizing he knew they were under eye from houghton on the focsle and he would be merciless to any who delayed their departure then began the slow row out a deepsea lead line streamed out with them to tell them when to let the anchor go heavy and unresponsive the boat was a hog to pull and the night was warm and close there was none of the usual muttering and smothered laughter that showed the men in spirits this was going to be a trial of strength and nerve holy jesus bawled dobbie are we goin t let orion show us th way out o harbour lets see some sweat then with the weight of iron and endless curve of hawser there was no way that redoubled effort would show in increased speed a dispiriting thing for men doing their best but if they flagged the heavy boat would rapidly slow in the moonless night it was difficult to make out expressions but kydd could see the unmoving dogged downward set of their heads he glanced to his side at bowden who was staring at the straining men palefaced in the silence ragged panting and the synchronised clunk and slither of oars in thole pins was loud in the night air kydd looked astern the black mass of the ship seemed just as close and he determinedly faced forward dobbie caught the movement and turned on his men god rot it but ill sweat the salt frm yer boneslay inter it y scowbunkin lubbers yr worsen a lot o dublin durrynackers kydd knew what they must be enduringmuscles across the shoulders and forearms burning with pain turning hands on the looms of the oar to claws but if they were to be out in the cool breezes to seaward before dawn a low groan came from the anonymous dimness forward kydd frowned if this was an expression of discontent he would take the steering oar himself and send dobbie there he knew that the hard petty officer kept a ropes end handy and he would have no compunction about letting him loose suddenly there was a disturbancea tangle of arms and cries of alarm oars kydd roared dobbie get forrard an see what it is they had lost momentum dobbie ran down the centreline on the thwarts kydd heard grunts and felt the boat sway its boyd sirbin an taken poorly ive got is oar dobbie shouted hoarsely give way kydd ordered still at the steering oar the thunk of oars began immediately the men knew only too well how hard it was to begin again from a standing start he blessed his luck at having dobbie but noticed bowdens hands clutching the gunwale they twitched convulsively at last they reached the mark on the leadline oars the boat quickly slowed and stopped dobbie padded back down the boat now joe he said to the stroke oar who stood up took out his knife and began sawing at the lashings of the anchor when they had fallen away the two took the end of a capstan bar each in cupped hands go said kydd the two men strained upwards bodies shuddering with effort then the anchor began to shift to slide until it toppled off the stern of the boat with a sullen splash taking the hawser with it the boat bobbed in relief hold water larboard belay that kydd ordered lay t yr oarsfive minutes no longer the anchor would take time to sink to the sea bed and there would be time then to resume their task the men eased their bodies gratefully as best they could mr bowden go forrard an see what you cn do the lad got to his feet and made his way clumsily forward kept upright by hands from indignant seamen he reported back aa form of calenture i think sir hes still unconscious hhis friends have him out of the way in the middle of the boat and ive put my coat under his head aand i ye did right mr bowden then kydd turned to dobbie out oarscarry on they returned under the bows of tenacious passing adams in the cutter going out having two boats at work meant that precious momentum would be preserved all too soon the unseen labourers on the gundeck capstans had brought the ship up to her second anchor and the weary round must begin again the torment continued into the early hours the same hot lifeless night air fathomless dark sea gasps panting the gigantic black bulk of the rock had receded so slowly and there were still no breezes on either hand the anonymous blocks of the rest of the squadron showed that they too were enduringbut at first light it could be seen that their mission of stealth had not succeeded they were nearly clear of gibraltar bay as the featureless grey of early dawn took on the colour of day to starboard the spanish fort of punta carnero woke to life and the flat crump of guns sounded across the bay it was in the nature of a salutea derisory recognition that despite all their efforts whoever wished might see the british make sally once again into the sea from which they had been proscribed for so long chapter the squadron did not pick up a breeze until the mighty rock was well astern its shape receding in the bright haze then with the everconstant eastgoing current invisibly urging them on a chuckle of water began at the forefoot topmen crowded up in the yards to extend the sail width with stunsls and the master exerted every skill to trim the complex machinery of canvas and rope that was driving their ship ahead was nelsons vanguard tenacious could not disgrace herself kydd was not on watch as officers were not required to keep the deck but the whole ships company wanted to take sight of the ancient sea closed to them until this moment renzi stared into the blue expanse ahead his expression calm but an unconscious halfsmile in place kydd suspected his friend was contemplating the dangers ahead in this maelstrom of competing nations that was the cradle of their civilisation but he seemed distant and preoccupied it might well be more than that kydd remembered a letter renzi had received in gibraltar that had had a noticeable effect on his friend but he knew of old that renzi would disclose the distraction only when he was ready so he would not press matters there was no reason why he should go below but kydd could wait no longer he had taken a peek at the package earlier but there had been no time for more despite his lack of sleep the thought of what he would see now thrilled him with guilty excitement he mumbled an excuse and hurried down the companionway tysoe had taken possession of the long oddly shaped article for him while he had been aboard princess royal and it was still in its brownpaper wrapping kydd opened it carefully hefting the precious weight and feeling like a child with a longawaited gift the black gleam of oiled leather then the martial gilding of the top of the scabbardand suddenly it was in his hands the weapon that would probably be by his side for the rest of his sea life he clicked open the langets securing the sword and eased up the blade far enough to see engraved just below the hilt less than an inch in size as neat a pair of cornish choughs as he could have wished for with a lethal slither he withdrew the sword from its scabbard the halflength bluing of the blade was as handsome as he had remembered he came to point the action seeming so natural the sword in flawless balance kydd drew it close in admiration mesmerised by the steely shimmer he flourished it slowly feeling its grace and accuracy the sharkskin grips sure and true he stood to lose his life if enemy blood caused it to slip from his hand reluctantly he slid the blade back into the scabbard it was unbelievable that he could be the owner of such a fine weapon he gathered up the appurtenances the belt with its frog a matching baldrica broad strap for shoulder carriage of the sword complete with a bold gilded fouled anchor deviceand a beautifully worked sword knot eyeing the tassels doubtfully kydd resolved to replace it in combat with a securely spliced manila lanyard he hung the sword by its rings left the rest on his desk for tysoe to stow and returned on deck as nonchalantly as he could the favourable southwesterly firmed but backed more to the east stunsls to leeward were struck as they were backwinded by their topsails the master frowned at the sight of vanguards lee stunsls still abroad not as i should say but for a raw captain berry hangs on t his canvas a mort long he muttered an hour later the winds were further towards the southeast and the remaining stunsls were taken in hands to quarters houghton snapped under plain sail there was no need to worry over delicate sail set and he would have his way with gun practice mr kydd you will take post as second of the gundeck for now if you please kydd had been expecting this in battle in a hardfought slugging match a signal lieutenant might well find himself employed at the guns replacing a killed or wounded gundeck officerin fact that very instance had provided his own elevation to the quarterdeck the long twentyfours of tenacious were powerful weapons but kydd had cut his teeth as a young man on the thirtytwopounders of duke william any others were lesser beasts the crews mustered on the gundeck throwing off muzzle lashings taking down the rammers sheepskin staves and other implements the bark of gun captains was loud in the close air as they goaded men to their stations it seemed impossibly crowded but there was a pattern in the seething mass and kydd waited on the centreline adams was in charge of the forward half of the gundeck standing like kydd well clear of the throng he caught kydds eye removed his hat and performed an exaggerated bow kydd grinned and returned the gesture then turned back to his section dobbie was gun captain but also quarter gunner responsible for the after four guns on the larboard side his squat powerful build was perfectly suited to hard work in the low decked spaces kydd watched as dobbie bullied crews into place two to throw off the cross seizings and bight the fall of each side tackle others hauling the training tackle to the rear of the gun and standing braced to take in the sudden slack when the gun fired the remainder ready to train the guns round by brute force with handspikes under the carriage wheels sudden daylight as the gunports were opened the sharp squeal of small blocks gave an edge to the preparations and dobbie thrust over to his gun captains peering at their gunlocks checking their gunners pouch and powder horn each gun captain was responsible for his own gun then immediately to dobbie who in turn would answer for their effectiveness to kydd a hierarchy of responsibilities upon which kydd could not trespass gun crews mustered sir dobbie reported touching his forehead a midshipman hovered theoretically having charge of the guns under kydd but wise enough to give dobbie room thank you dobbie kydd said and walked across purposefully to one of the guns he removed the cover of the conical match tub inside he could see that the perforated head had its full complement of unlit slowmatch hanging downin action should a gunlock fail one would be used to touch off the gun he eased it off and peered inside but wheres our water he said mildly turning to dobbie if a piece of the lighted match fell water would be needed to douse it quickly the look dobbie gave the gun captain suggested that no further action would be required ye know the captain permits no sham motions kydd said careful to direct his remarks in general all t be as in battle stand fast the shot n cartridge he let it hang then turned to the nearest of the gun crew yr station at quarters after tackle o number eleven larbd he said instantly and second division o boarders he was listed to be called away to board the enemy in the second wave when the trumpet sounded and where do ye find yr weapons ahforrard arms chest t see this man knows his duty afore he sees his grog kydd replied briskly to the midshipman who hastily scrawled in his notebook he turned to go back to his place on the centreline but heard the smothered chuckles of a powder monkey clutching his cartridge box now then y scallywag he said do ye tell me what is y duty should there be a fire at the gun the youngsters eyes went wide er tell mr jones he squeaked im sure the gunner will know of it b then kydd said then glared at the midshipman the younker t tell you of his duty before you get yr grog the ships company of tenacious had been together for some time now and practice was becoming more a matter of detail gun captains could be stood down while second gun captains took over men could exchange stations and be equally proficient they were hardening well kydd paced slowly down the deck amid the heavy rumble of cannon but his mind strayed to the poopdeck that was his principal station in battle heading the signals team a task requiring the utmost coolness under enemy fire an admiral had only the medium of signals to bring his fleet round to meet a sudden threat and if the signal lieutenant blundered carry on he snapped to the midshipman there was little further he could contribute to the ongoing sweat and toilhe would go up and see how rawson the senior signal midshipman was spending his time in the absence of his officer with so many men below at the guns the decks seemed deserted but as kydd hurried up the poop ladder he was reassured to see his men at work rawson turned and touched his hat were doin some exercising with emerald sir he said gesturing to the lithe frigate on their beam an theyre not up t snuff is my opinion he confided an its not your duty t pass judgement on others mr rawson kydd admonished him a seaman whipped down the current hoist which kydd saw was number your signal hoist cannot be distinguished kydd glanced about the flag locker was neatly stowed the seamen quietly at their posts at the halliards signal log sir the small portable table near the mizzen mast was rigged the rough log open ready for recording every signal received and sent he enquired about the signal flares and swivel gun for attracting attention at night brought up an stowed in the halfdeck sir all seemed in order then he noticed a figure hanging back on the other side of the deck gauntfaced and despondent it was bowden he was also sporting the beginnings of a black eye what about mr bowden kydd demanded er rawson said in surprise hes not as who might say a prime hand do we not all have t learn kydd snapped in rising irritation why isnt he at the log or haulin on a line or some such rawson looked dogged and kydd rounded on him get up t the main masthead this instantyoull maybe have time then t think o something he realised part of his anger was directed at himself he owed essington a service but there was little he could do about bowden somewhat more sensitive than the others the lad was clearly suffering what he needed kydd saw suddenly was what sailors called a seadaddy someone in whom to confide who would place things in perspective for him with a pang kydd remembered joe bowyer a kindly old seaman who had sailed with cook and who had befriended him in his early days at sea and fired in him a passion for the life but who was best suited to this kydd knew that he as an officer could not fulfil the role then it came to him poulden a fine seaman with a gentle manner he would be ideal he was in the same division as bowden and now he would have a word with the first lieutenant to put him in the same watch and station pleased he called mr bowden the lad hurried across and kydd handed rawsons signal telescope to him do ye know aught of signals no then nows a good time t learn he continued this is yr signal book admral nelson relies on us to get his wishes known to our captain and if were slack in stays the powerful squadron sailed deeper into the mediterranean crossing the prime meridian in barely three days and raising the peak of minorcas mount toro in a week as they shaped course north for toulon the tension increased every vessel they sighted now would be an enemy and if the french fleet sailed they would be directly in its path no one believed that nelson would stand aside tamely and all readied themselves for the ultimate challenge the line of rendezvous was reached a parallel of latitude off toulon that would be their station while two frigates ranged ahead off the port their intelligence would be vital in the coming struggle even as the squadron took up position terpsichore frigate returned with a prize late in the afternoon vanguard hove to and signalled for all captains in a fevered buzz of speculation houghton took away his barge rather less than an hour later he was back all officers was his first order and while the line of menowar got under way again the officers of tenacious assembled in the great cabin news gentlemen houghton said looking from one to another in short i am happy to say we are not too late the french have not sailed terpsichores prize is la pierre a corvette of the french navy admiral nelsons staff have questioned the crew closely and they being inclined to boastfulness have been free with their information i have to tell you now that the rumours we have been hearing are substantially correct this armament is of prodigious size reported by many at over thirty sailoftheline and hundreds of transports and their chief general napoleon buonaparte arrived in toulon some days ago and is now reviewing his troops and siege train it seems these troops are at this moment embarking in their transport gentlemen admiral nelson believes that they are to sail directly sir does he know where theyre headed kydd asked no said houghton flatly it seems that this buonaparte is keeping his plans even from his officers in the absence of any reliable facts we can only assume that the most credible is a lunge west to join with the spanish then out to the atlantic north for a junction with the brest fleet and then england indeedwhy else the troops muttered bryant louder he asked do we know anything of their commander sir yes this is admiral the comte de brueys a gentleman of the old france he has been at sea since the age of thirteen and has seen much service he knows the mediterranean well and flies his flag in lorient which is of one hundred and twenty guns he added heavily sir what are our orders from the admiral i have seen no orders yet sir bampton sounded peevish but houghton responded courteously sir horatio has been good enough to open his mind to his captains we understand sufficiently well what are his wishes these he will communicate by signals which will be few in number but each of which will be of the highest importance besides we are a reconnaissance squadron on detachment only and our orders therefore are those of our commanderinchief admiral jervis i commend their thorough perusal by all my officers then sir our duty is clear bryant said vigorously we hold to the line of rendezvous the prize has been sent to cadiz with dispatches detailing the situation in toulon houghton interrupted earl st vincent will determine what manner of action might be required and in the event the french sail before then i have the strongest opinion of admiral nelsons leadership in this affair houghton said stiffly we all know our duty sir the sky was deep blue white clouds towering and the sea aglitter as the squadron headed along the rendezvous line under easy sail the order came to exercise small arms by divisions kydd knew the weapons well the boarding pike an eightfoot shaft with a forged pick head was purely for defensive purposes the tomahawk was seldom used as a weapon its value in scaling ships sides and cutting away netting a pistol had but one shot and then became a club kydd had no doubt that the cutlass was the prince of weapons he waited while sailors shuffled into line on one side of the deck facing him for the main part these men were unblooded in battle strangers to the hatred and violence of handtohand combat they would preserve their own lives and bring victory to their ship only if they had skill at arms greater than that of the enemy kydd stood in shirt and breeches the sea breeze ruffling across his chest ill have yr attention now if y please it seemed an age since as a pressed man he had listened while a lieutenant gave him the lesson he was about to impart to these men im now going t save your skins im telling you how to fight and win he signalled to poulden who came forward kydd took up a cutlass and admired it theatrically letting its lightly oiled grey steel blade and plain black hilt catch the sun there were murmurs at the sight now see here he said poulden advanced on him with his own cutlass kydd slowly raised his own blade and brought it down towards pouldens unprotected head but well before the blow fell poulden lunged forward with the point directly at kydds chest you see should you slash at your foe hell be inside you with a thrustit only needs an inch or two o steel to end the fight a figure to one side caught his eye it was bowden an intense expression on his face kydd wondered what he could be thinking there was no way to prepare anyone for the impact of finding a living person at the end of a blade who must be killed by the plunge of that same steel in his bodybefore he killed you laffin kydd called the darkfeatured boatswains mate came forward take this he snapped throwing one of the two wooden practice swords at him on yr guard sir laffin waved his sword sketchily but kydd performed a crisp front prove distance manoeuvre and tapped his ear smartly the man recoiled and brought up his sword to point which kydd had no trouble evading nettled laffin began a laborious assault instantly kydds sword slithered along the inside and in a last flick laid the way open for a fatal lunge youre a dead man laffin ten seconds kydds eyes took in the rest of his division yere all a lubberly crew who are going t leave me alone on an enemy deck while youre all being pigstuck around me now well learn some real fightin using poulden a fair swordsman as his opponent he demonstrated the positionsguard assault halfhangerand the importance of footwork he knew his swordsmanship did not have the elegance of a fencing master but was workmanlike forged in the struggle for survival in the short brutal encounters of boarding now shall we see what yeve learned ill take th first dozen mr rawson the deck by the mainmast was soon filled with figures flailing and clacking at each other under the amused eye of the watch on deck suddenly kydd bellowed prince o the poop the fighting stopped kydd leaped up the ladder to the poopdeck where he leaned over the rail and looked down with a devilish smile im defendin my poopany who dares t take it from me rawson made the first challenge with a creditable show but was transfixed after tripping over a taffrail knee the next two were quickly disposed of but then a voice came from the rear i sir i do answer your challenge renzi mounted the ladder and came to an elegant salute at the top kydd knew his friend was a truly accomplished swordsman who had been tutored by masters in his youth but did not believe he would use his skill to disgrace him before his men kydd answered the salute gracefully and ceremoniously proved distance the tips of the plain wooden blades held each other at point then began their lethal questing flicking clacking from inside guard to st george and assault left cheek point shift and guard again the thrusts were thoughtfully considered held off for that fraction of a second that allowed a perception of intent by the audience renzis expression was polite amused for some reason this annoyed kydd and he dared a thrust of force renzi retreated to a series of guards as kydd continued to smack at his blade with loud cloks kydd was about to overbear renzi when renzis face hardened his sword flicked out like a barb of lightning never the same move probing testing vicious it chilled kydd this was not his friendthis was a terrifying enemy with lethal intent who would batter his way past his defences and finish the contest in death there was no sound from the onlookers renzi moved forward forcing kydd into a tiring defence everything he did of no avail against the faultless automaton bearing down on him the end must comeunless he tensed let his right leg bunch and sank as if brought to his knees renzi drew back his blade for the final downward thrust that would end with the point at kydds throatbut kydds blade flashed out low and took him squarely in his unprotected upper thigh ha you see kydd cried loudly my man is now spit wounded he falls to the deckhe is now helpless at my mercy kydd knew his unfair move would never be seen in a gentlemans fencing studio but where was the referee on an enemy deck renzi drew back slowly his gaze reptilian he let his sword drop to the deck with a clatter through sparkling royal blue seas the sun beating down the squadron advanced to the end of the line then went about and back again while energetic frigates cruised far ahead and abeam ready to notify the slightest move of significance by the enemy kydd prepared as best he could he had to be familiar not only with the signal flags but with their tactical and strategic meaning in the confusion of battle he had to be able to piece together the fleet commanders intentions from brief glimpses of bunting at the halliards and inform his captain accordingly the fighting instructions held all that he should know but he was troubled that his one experience of a great battle of fleets was now a jostling memory of chaos powdersmoke and noise which made it hard to know what his own ship had been doing let alone others and that was supposing they fell back to cadiz and became part of a much larger fleet if the french put to sea nelson would probably sacrifice himself and his little squadron to delay themit would be less a fleet battle than a heroic destruction so much depended on the next days distracted he paced the deck forward out of the corner of his eye he saw bowden sitting on the forehatch with poulden a laborious longsplice under way the lads look of concentration was intense and kydd was pleased to see his work had a fine seamanlike appearance bowden looked up shyly at him the afternoon wore on in the dogwatches he would exercise with the cutlass again and on the following forenoon there would be muskets and a target dangling at the yardarm he passed renzi standing gazing at vanguard ahead he was clearly deep in thought and kydd had not the heart to disturb him in the evening cutlass drill was delayed houghton had been talking with the master who made no secret of his distrust of the weather and both watches took off the royals and sent down the masts before the end of the dogwatch the breeze had freshened from the northwest dont care what they calls itmistral or tramontana its bad cess to us ifn its coming from the norard the master said gravely it was peculiar in kydds experience cloudless skies and exuberant seas perfect weather but the wind was increasing to a degree that in english waters would give rise to concern for the future after supper kydd arrived to take over the watch orion and alexander were ahead and under topgallants while the frigates closed up for the night rather you than me old pickle adams said cheerfully master thinks a tartars blowing up he disappeared below kydd eyed the canvas and sniffed at the wind m duty t the captain an i advise taking in th courses he told his messenger houghton came on deck i see vanguard has still her royals abroad he said suspiciously aye sir kydd said carefully but orion an alexander have taken em in and if im not mistaken there is alexander going t topsails now as if reading houghtons thoughts he added and were still stayin with flag sir admittedly their line was now more of a gaggle in the evening gloom as they watched lanthorns jerkily mounted to the mizzen top of vanguard very well you may use the watch on deck only mr kydd houghton hesitated then went below it would mean a longer harder job but the watch below would not be disturbed however within twenty minutes the wind had changed from an insistent stream to a buffeting squally threat mr pearce i mean to turn up all the hands in striking courses kydd told the boatswain who went to fetch his mates houghton arrived quickly the seas were higher but in a way that was peculiar to this landlocked sea short steep and rapid meeting the bow in a succession of sharp explosions of white their consorts began distancing themselves sea room was becoming necessary in the increasingly boisterous conditions even with the halfmoons occasionally clouddimmed light keep the men on deck mr kydd houghton said drawing his coat round him in less than an hour it had worsened the moon was now all but obscured by lowerlevel racing scud and the topsails bellied and tautened to ironlike rigidity ill trouble you to closereef the topsls houghton ordered men crowded into the weather shrouds and began climbing it was murky and indistinctkydd knew they were going as much by feel and familiarity with their aerial world as sight they would be deadly cautious transferring hold from one hand one foot to another only when it felt secure slamming wind gusts could shake the hold of the unwary and send them helpless to their death when they reached the tops and eased out on the yard they would no longer even be free to hold onbalancing on a thin footrope with empty space beneath they had to lean over and with both hands fist the maddened canvas into submission then secure the points with a reef knot still the wind increased hammering in from the northwest with a flat ferocity at one in the morning a particularly savage squall shook and pummelled the ship with a report like gunfire the topsails blew to pieces and tenacious fell off the wind until fore and aft sail were set to stabilise her the winds noise in the bartaut rigging was a rising howl that tore at the reason this was nature gone mad seas driven up by the frenetic wind caused an ugly roll which threw serious strain on spars and rigging preventers and rolling tackles could help but when squalls and rain clamped in there was nothing for it but endurance through the long night with occasional halfglimpsed pinpricks of lanthorn light all that could seen of other ships finally dawn came in a grey welter of cold spray and whipping wind as the light extended lookouts in the tops spotted other ships scattered around the galelashed seascape calling their names down one by one as they recognised them the vessels altered course to form up the squadron once more but which was the flagship and there were no frigates all that could be seen were two shipsoftheline and another further off that must be admiral nelson yet there was something not right with the distant vessel as they beat their way closer it became clear vanguard had lost her entire foremast as well as all her topmasts and was surviving with scraps of sail on what remained with tumbled masts and no steadying canvas aloft the ship rolled grievously on every plunge showing her copper or submerging her lower gunports conditions on board would be indescribable but she was still gallantly holding a course houghton took a telescope braced himself against the savage roll and focused on the stricken vessel the master moved up next to him a boat cannot live in these seas mr hambly houghton said we can do nothing for them no sir said hambly neutrally but on this board he stands into mortal peril sir the land corsica sir dead to looard an not so many miles the awesome force of the gale from the northwest had driven the squadron towards the craggy coast of corsica to the southeast but how close were they he must wear o course with the wind blast on the larboard side any sail that vanguard could hoist would only impel them further towards that coast they must therefore bring the gale to the other side and let her drive before it but with no possibility of setting any kind of sail forward there would not be the leverage to bring the big round she was trapped on her course theyll tack then no sir hambly responded she wouldnt atall get through the winds eye i fear were t see a calamity very soon sir it was inconceivable the greatest fighting admiral of the age in his own flagship beaten on to the rocks then almost certain deathor at best survival and humiliating capture by the french we have to do something damn it houghton rasped the other two ships were lying tentatively on her beam in these surging conditions it was too risky to get closer could stream rafts for survivors when no one took up kydds thought and he resumed his sorrowful gaze at the doomed vessel in all conscience they could stay with the ship only until that fatal last halfmile then there was sudden movement on her decks the rags of sail still up were brought in until the ship was bare without the steadying of high canvas she began a sickening wallow the merciless wind nearly abeam a flicker of paleness showed around her plunging bow ah all eyes turned to hambly who cleared his throat selfconsciously er that is t say its clear they have right seamen aboard vanguard thats a spritsl theyre setting an theyll wear ship with that a spritsail was an ancient sail from another age one spread below the bowsprit and long since disappeared from modern warships the effect of the diminutive sail set so far forward was immediate painfully vanguard began to pay off under the leverage rotating slowly until the seas previously battering her from abeam now came under her stern she gathered steerage way and bracing the spritsail yard hard round showed canvas on her mizzen completed the turn and finally wore round at last the threat of shipwreck was averted the quarterdeck of tenacious erupted in shouts of admirationnow their flagship had a chance only one frigate could be seen the others must have been blown towho knew where the storm showed no sign of calming and the last frigate fell away into the spindrift then disappeared it was now a matter of enduring the jerking bruising motion a tedious wearying period that stretched time and deadened the spirit a second night drew in but before the light faded a flutter of colour showed at the admirals mizzen mr kydd houghton handed over his telescope the image danced uncontrollably and kydd adopted a foulweather brace right elbow jammed firmly to his side the other against his chest with his feet splayed wide without needing to refer to his pocket signal book he knew the hoist alexanders pennant pass within hail then orion closed cautiously and finally it was the turn of tenacious coming up slowly on the flagships leeward side they saw the damagetopmasts missing foremast a splintered stump lines of rigging tangling on the decksit could not possibly be repaired at sea without doubt the cluster of figures on her quarterdeck would include admiral nelson kydd clung to the shrouds listening as houghton brought up his speaking trumpet and hailed flag ahoy his voice was strong and well pitched but it was nearly lost in the uproar of the swashing seas between the madly surging vessels do ye hear came distantly across from the flagship quarterdeck i do sir haveyoucharts houghton held up a hand in acknowledgement of oristano sardinia so the admiral was seeking a dockyard in sardinia under their lee have we quickly mr hambly no sir nothing moren a smallscale o that coast regretnocharts the remote figure waved once and the ships began to diverge the admiral had three choices to chance unknown waters and a possibly hostile port in sardinia make a lengthy return to gibraltar in his crippled ship or when the weather abated transfer to one of the others and scuttle vanguard darkness came and the long night brought no relief from the hammering northerly only when dawns cold light imperceptibly displaced the blackness was there a moderation in the welter of torn seas alexander orion and tenacious came together once more shes signalling kydds eyes were sore with salt spray as he tried to read vanguards hoist to alexander prepare to take me in tow now well see what theyre made of i think said bryant wedging himself against the outside corner of the masters cabin and calmly contemplating across the chaotic tumbling seas the heroic feat of seamanship now demanded boats wont swim said kydd similarly exercised can float off a keg wi a messenger line mused the master if alexander dare take a windd position this was where the main difficulty lay to allow the keg to float downwind or any like manoeuvre implied placing alexander upwind the huge windage of the s at slow speeds would ensure they drifted inexorably to leeward but it would be at differing rates for different ships and weather conditions the consequences of the ship to weather drifting faster and colliding with the one to leeward with all the inertia of one and a half thousand tons was too horrific to think about alexander lay off preparing her move any close manoeuvring was deadly dangerous in the wild seas and it would take extreme care to pass over the line safely she wore round in a big circle and approached vanguard from astern and to windward sail was shortened down to goosewinged foretopsail and storm staysails and she approached with the buffeting wind on her quarter closer she eased the sheets of two of the three staysails and lined up for her runshe was clearly trying for a close glancing approach to vanguards poop with one fleeting moment to get the line across the voluted beakhead of alexander slowly approached the carved stern of vanguard as she did so the scale of the independent plunging and rearing of the two ships was evident alexanders bowsprit and its complex tracery of rigging speared closer then in seconds the situation changed a chance convergence of wave crests into a larger one rose up on alexanders outer bow at the same time as its trough allowed vanguards stern to slide towards her it looked as if the two ships would merge in splintering ruin but then the focslemen on the foredeck of alexander boomed out the foretopmast staysail to weather by main force and by small yards she yawed giddily and slid past kydd strained to see any tiny thread of black rope against the white water indicating a line had been passed there was none the plunged past tenacious on her way round once more and kydd could see activity on both ships but when the light line had been finally passed across from alexander it would in turn bring aboard a heavier hawser then probably one of the anchor cables roused up from the tiers in the orlop at more than a hundred and twenty pounds for every fathom streamed it would be a fearsome task to manhandle this time alexander came up to leeward of the stricken flagship necessarily head to head to bring their focsles adjacent kydd used his signal telescope to watch he could make out a lone seaman in the forechains with his coiled heaving line tensed waiting the two ships closed alexander deliberately keeping well to leeward as she edged ahead they began to overlapthe seaman started to swing his smaller coil in readinessbut even as he did so it became obvious that the windward vessel was catching more of the winds blast and drifting down fast on the more sheltered leeward alexanders bowsprit sheered off rapidly once more the big manowar went round ponderously once more the seaman in the chains began his swing and once more it proved impossible time wore on in tenacious hands were piped to dinner and the heaving line was cast twice more the afternoon watch was setand on the next pass a line at last was caught on vanguards foredeck those watching in other ships dared not breathe as the dots of men on her focsle scrambled to bring in the line but alexander was falling away fast kydd knew what they had to do a dark cavity in alexanders stern windows was where her cable would be led out but first vanguard must hold fast the precious light line while a stouter rope was heaved in from alexander and manhandled through the hawsehole where it would be led to the main capstan below in the sweating gloom this hawser would be heaved in its distant other end seized to the main cable issuing out of alexanders stern windows as it was led from the giant riding bitts further forward it was now only a matter of time little by little the great cable nearly two feet in circumference was drawn across the foaming sea until vanguard was finally tethered the weight of the seven hundred feet of heavy rope between the two ships formed a catenary a graceful curve in the cable that acted as a giant spring in the towing absorbing the shocks and fretful jibbing of the stormlashed ships alexander showed small sail then more until reefed topsails gave her enough force to pull vanguard in line and then miraculously begin a clawing slewing motion ahead as if in respect to the feat performed in the teeth of its hostility the wind moderated from a full gale to a sulky bluster then later to a steady northnorthwesterly and foul for oristano the ships limping at no more than walking pace could not lie close enough to the wind to overcome the current taking them south and the only dockyard on the west of sardinia was left astern what now do you think mr hambly houghton asked there seemed to be no avoiding a long and chancy tow back to gibraltar adams brightened sir when i was a mid in cruizer we chased a corsair to sardinia and he disappeared we found him in san pietro bay south of here in as snug a harbour as youd find within forty leagues i believe admiral nelson could lie there in perfect peace while he repairs enough to sail back to gibraltar mr hambly lay me within hail of the flagship it was a notion clearly to nelsons liking and the tow was shaped more southerly the winds diminished rapidly to a pleasant breeze and with the sun now strong again and in the ascendant wisps of vapour rose from the waterlogged decks a distant lumpy bluegrey appeared from the bright haze ahead san pietro island sir adams said smugly our anchorage lies beyond after several days of danger and hardship kydd found the prospect of surcease and peace attractive but as the sun went down so did the breeze and those who had cursed the wind were now regretting its failing sail was set to stunsls but their forward movement slowed to a walk again and then a crawl the night came languorously in violet and pink but no breeze blew from the sardinian shore a halfmoon rose stars pricked the heavens and the ships remained drifting then kydd saw something that awakened memories of an atlantic night when death had risen out of the darkness to claim his frigate breakers sir i see breakers barely perceptible but distantly picked out by moonlight there was a white line of surfthe storm swell driving into the shore it seemed that the other ships had spied it there was movement of lanthorn light around their focsles without doubt they too would bend their best anchors to their cables tenacious found out the sombre truth with the rest there was no wind to haul off the land and the water was bottomless it was unjust weary after so much strife they now faced another night of dread feeling the sullen swell rolling under their keel relentlessly bearing them towards the dark mass of the land while the sails hung useless in the moonlight they were long hoursrestless waiting fearing the dawn and starting at every flap and shiver aloft it was hard simply to endure the deep sea lead was cast regularly eventually it touched bottom at three hundred feet but this was too deep for anchoring when sunrise came it was soft and warm welcoming them with the deep blue of the morning skybut the royal blue of the open sea changed to the liquid green of inshore constrained by the dead weight of the tow alexander and vanguard had not been able to take advantage of every little shift in the night breeze and now lay significantly closer inshore from the quarterdeck of tenacious it looked a grave situation the two s still joined by the long cable were now within a short distance of the shore and it was heartbreaking that after all their efforts the flagship would end in the breakers they could now clearly see alexander must cast off th tow murmured the master shaking his head at least one ship of the two would then escape but there was no indication that this was plannedno boats in the water to take off the ships company of vanguard no general signal of distress or move to abandon ship both menowar drifted on carried together towards the bare nondescript coast then as if relenting in its tantrum the wind returned just enough to fill the sails of alexander and allow her to crawl past the craggy northern cape of san pietro island safely past a signal hoist mounted in the flagship sir our pennants and assume the van kydd said means us to lead the way i believe mr adams this snug harbour tenacious stole round the southerly point of the island led in by lieutenant kydd in the cutter with a hand leadline sounding ahead kydd had put poulden on the leadline and bowden on the simple signal flags relaying back the depths there was time enough to spy out the land they entered a fine inlet between san pietro island and another the enfolding bay was sheltered from everything but a southerly they could anchor there in perfect peace with space enough for twenty shipsand it was good holding ground shells and soft shale came up with the lead the bare scrubby land shimmered in the glare of the morning sun and kydd scanned it cautiously for any activity there were some vestiges of cultivation on the steep slopes and the occasional redtiled farm dwelling but no fortifications that he could detect he completed his sweep of the little bay and told bowden to indicate with his white flag over red that he considered it worth bringing in tenacious then he prepared to carry out the second part of his orders as he pulled deeper into the bay he looked for any signs that the local inhabitants might be hostile already dots were appearing on the sandy beach and dunes stretch out if y please kydd urged the rowers if he was to represent the royal navy to a foreign power he would make sure his men did not let him down he turned the boat towards a knot of people and when it beached allowed himself to be chaired ashore by two seamen ltenant kydd his majestys ship tenacious he announced loudly bowing in a general way to the people and bringing an immediate hush to the crowd er anyone speaks english dressed in the exotics of the inner mediterranean they looked at kydd with curiosity he picked out the most dignified of the men and repeated the question the man started in consternation threw out his hands and jabbered fearfully we come t repairin peace that is kydd tried again but could feel a rising tide of unease more people arrived and he saw the curiosity replaced by scowls he glanced back at his boat he had deliberately not armed the seamen with him and had not worn his own sword a swirl of movement at the back of the crowd caught his eye a donkey was coming down a track to the beach ridden by an officer of some kind laughter broke out from the boats crew at the comical sight of the mans legs flapping out to the sides of the diminutive beast silence roared kydd aghast the officer came to a stop and slid to the ground his face dark with anger he wore an odd folded hat with a scarlet tassel and a faded but flamboyant uniform that ill fitted his corpulent figure the seamen could not stifle their mirth and kydd ground out ill take the cat t the next man who so much as grins s help me he bowed as low as he could to the officer who stiffly returned the gesture after he had snarled something to the crowd which subsided obediently ltenant kydd he began again but the officer broke into impassioned speech gesturing at tenacious sir i cant understand frustrated they glared at each other speechless pardonnezmoi mon commandant bowden came in awkwardly mais si vous avez le frangais the officers expression changed fractionally and he answered in gruff choppy french they exchanged sentences and bowden turned to kydd sir this officer comes from fort charles on the island hes a captain of militia and therefore an officer of his sardinian majesty he demands to know by what right we are coming ashore all kydd knew was that sardinia was a neutral country thank ye bowden do you tell him were only here a short time to repair storm damage an mean no act o hostility bowden relayed his wordssome of the crowd understood what he said and passed it on to the others the officer stiffened kydd looked at bowden impatiently sir he says that under the terms of their treaty with france sardinia may not allow an english vessel to enter any port in the kingdom and that is his final word kydd saw there was no moving himno argument or show of force was appropriate on the other hand no repairs could be contemplated if the ships would be at the mercy of unfriendly local forces bowden listen carefully i want you t say this so the others can hear you understand yes sir tell him that we agree not to enter his port just anchor offshore that was no concessionthe little cluster of buildings and small wharf he could see at the inner coast of the island could not possibly take four shipsoftheline bowden did as he was told now mark this kydd went on tell him that a big ship has many sailorsthey must be fed if any has livestock or vegetables they can turn them into english silver this very day should they bring them here to this beach excitement grew as the word spread the man kydd had addressed earlier now pushed across wanting to know if the english sailors preferred beef or mutton and small boys raced off with the news the officer barked at them but the mood had changed here was instant prosperity for this tiny settlement and it would go ill with him if he stood in its way he hesitated then turned to kydd once more bowden translated sir he says that after consideration he finds that if we keep out of the port the terms of the treaty are not in violation and sir he wishes us an enjoyable visit the shouts of approbation that followed forced a smile from the officer who clambered aboard his donkey lifting his hand in farewell just at that moment three great shipsoftheline came into view filling the pretty bay with their warlike majesty and unanswerable presence the officer nearly fell off the donkey in fright kydd said quietly i dare t say our admiral would be satisfied with the usual salutes nelson brought his battered flagship to rest then signalled captains to report condition of ships for sea in addition to the usual readiness statement an assessment of storm damage was required and tenacious hastened to comply for her junior lieutenant this meant accompanying the boatswain and carpenter on their rounds a task congenial to kydds heart as it was an opportunity to make a closer acquaintance of his ship they began at furthest forward and in a borrowed pair of sailors trousers kydd was soon out on the eightyfoot length of the bowsprit with the two warrant officers his experience in a caribbean dockyard had shown him the difference between the dark weathered fissures in timber a shipwright would call a shake and therefore ignore and the long brightsided splits that would betray the much more serious condition of a sprung spar he inched along the jibboom horse careful to check under as well as above the foremast came next they used a girtline with a boatswains chair at each side of the mast to closeinspect the fat timbers of the foremast a made mast constructed of several pieces keyed together instead of a single length of timber it was unlikely to have sprung and they moved on quickly from the foretop to the topmast as they worked kydd noticed the deference pearce the hard boatswain was according the carpenter both were standing officersthey would remain with tenacious even when put into reserveand had been together for years kydd had never paid much attention to the carpenter who figured on no watchbill and went about his business with little fuss they spread out over the yards the older men moving deliberately while kydd attended to the pole royal mast and then it was time to move to the mainmast as they inched out on the mainyard the double strikes of eight bells sounded announcing grog and dinner for the hands the job had to be finished but kydd could not in all conscience order the other two men to press on without something to eat he leaned over the big spar and hailed the deck mr rawson ahoy the midshipman looked upward be s good as to light along some scran for usweve a job still t do aloft the upper yards were completed and they descended to the maintop just as a hand waved through the lubbers hole from below kydd went over it was bowden weighed down with a seamans messkid slung round his neck he took the steaming vessel realising that it must have taken considerable resolve for the raw lad to make the climb wheres mr rawson i told him to bring this ah he had other duties that pressed sir bowden said neutrally kydd suspected that rawson had coerced bowden into making the climb hoping for a spectacular disaster bowden disappeared but then a younger midshipman popped into view passing up a bag containing a loaf of bread local oranges and messtraps kydd was quietly pleased at bowdens climb up the mast and his initiative in coopting another midshipman who had not finished yet he extracted a bottle of claret from his coat your servant said t give you this kydd spread out his victuals gentlemen shall we dine the boatswain hesitated before he dipped his bread into the common pot mr feakes if y please kydd encouraged the carpenter who bent to his plate youve been carpenter aboard fr some years i believe he asked aye sir since launch thats before th war then sir bin wi the old girl at the first o june he was pearce put in admiringly an with cybele in india the glorious first of junethe first great fleet action of the war and both feakes and tenacious had been there kydd looked at feakes there was no sign of those momentous dangerous times on his lined face and he warmed to the old sailor kydd felt the stout bulk of the mainmast at his back as he took in the stately soaring of stays and shrouds halliards and pendants in their precise curves the sweetness of the deckline from high above as it passed from bowsprit to oldfashioned stern this was a ship to love to remember with fondness down the years he felt a curious pang as he thought about feakes and tenacious growing old together kydds feelings for tenacious turned to a catch in the throat however as he realised that in the near future enemy shot might smash its way into her vitals this time she might not be as lucky as she had been at the glorious first of june and camperdown he got to his feet well carry on he said gruffly our nels awaiting fr our report captain houghton and the first lieutenant left for vanguard with kydds report as first dogwatchmen went to supper within the hour they were back pass the word for mr feakesthe carpenter ahoy the captains barge conveyed the carpenter to the flagship it was dusk when he returned and hurried directly to houghtons cabin minutes later bryant was summoned and before much longer the word was out to nelsons considerable satisfaction feakes had given out that vanguard could not only be juryrigged for the retreat to gibraltar but might conceivably be put into some kind of shape to meet the french at sea in a race against time the flagship had to be fitted for sea with the only resources they had spare spars twicelaid rope and willing hands and in recognition of feakess faith and intelligent direction tenacious was to perform the most difficult task she would lash alongside vanguard and in a feat of seamanship that would stretch every talent aboard she would be used to extract the stump of foremast and lower in the new to the flagship that night feakes and his mates transferred to vanguard and set about readying the ship for a complete replacement of all topmasts orion would craft the new mizzen topmast alexander would provide a foretopmast while vanguard herself would work on the main within two days the preparations were complete in brilliant sunshine and under curious eyes from ashore tenacious was warped in close to vanguard as the ship working the evolution tenacious had charge of the operationbryant stood at the bulwark with speaking trumpet and the manner of a bull mastiff should any hesitate or fail they could depend on an instant reaction when the partners of the foremast had been knocked out tenaciouss mainyard was braced around and with stout tackles and guys clapped on it the ugly splintered stump of the foremast was plucked out like a tooth getting the new one in was a more serious matter the raw length of the threefootthick lower mast might if it slipped plummet down and transfix the bottom of the flagship it took the entire forenoon but by midday vanguard had her masts made whole once more a foretopmast had been fashioned from a spare main topgallant mast and hoisted into place and her bowsprit strengthened by fishing across the weakened part with timber lengths in less than four days nelsons flagship had been transformed from a stormshattered wreck to a shipoftheline ready for seareckoned by all hands to have been made whole again and set to take her place in the lineofbattle admiral nelson wasted no time the squadron set sail reformed and shaped their course there was no talk of retreating to gibraltar they would sail north their duty was clear and unchangedto return off toulon and resume their mission gun practice and combat preparation intensified to a high pitch as they neared the rendezvous to collect their frigates which were vital to the squadron they would look into enemy ports and report in detail but as the lookouts searched the horizons a lone sail was spotted boldly crossing their course it was a balkan merchant vessel stopped by orion she had intelligence of such import that the admiral called an instant conference the storm that had driven them south had allowed the french to slip out of port and away it had finally happened the feared napoleon buonaparte was at sea and headed for an unknown destination with an immense fleet of overwhelming numbers fifteen shipsoftheline and fourteen frigates with brigs cutters gunboatsseventytwo warships in all but these were not the heart of the fleet in four hundred transports there were tens of thousands of battlehardened troops this immense armada could have only one purpose nelsons response was immediate the awesome fleet had to be found and for that he needed his precious frigates to extend the line to comb the seas there was no choice they must crowd on sail to reach the rendezvous as fast as they could and then with the frigates spread out abreast begin the search when the enemy was found nelson would detach one ship to report back to cadiz for orders while continuing to shadow they reached the appointed place but there was not a frigate in sight orion searched to the east along the line of latitude while tenacious took the westbut there were no frigates they waited at the rendezvous dusk fell and night gave time for contemplation of the situation dawn arrivedand no frigates the day passed even the meanest imagination knew what it must be costing their helpless admiral night another day and still no english sail in the afternoon a garrulous fisherman was stoppedand he had news in some vague position not so far away he had chanced upon a great fleet passing at least ten perhaps a dozen shipsoftheline which he thought to be english clearly incorrect given that nelsons was the only squadron in the mediterranean in a friendless sea with every mans hand turned against them and utterly outnumbered nelson and his little band were faced with a quandarywhat to do next chapter sail hooooo the masthead hail stilled all talk and halted work on deck far to the west they could detect the merest pale flicker against the sparkling horizon the squadron kept tight formation this might be the first of a powerful french force sent to deal with a few impudent english ships reported to have entered their sea but there were no additional sail the vessel tacked about to reveal the two masts of a humble brig it was no outlying scout of the enemy fleet just one of the countless workhorse craft of its kind in the mediterranean going about its business tenacious returned to her routine however the brig made no move to turn away it stood on its course of intersection one which would bring it close to the flagship curious eyes followed its steady approach until at two miles distance vanguards challenge accompanied by the crack of a gun brought a flurry of bunting to its halliards correct answer fr todaycant make out her pennants kydd said flicking through his signal book she was apparently english in a sea where they had thought they were the only members of his majestys navy vanguards yards came round as she heaved to allowing the brig to come up and deliver dispatcheswith news that changed the situation the reconnaissance squadron was to be no more a powerful force of ten shipsoftheline was on its way to join nelson to transform it into a battle fleet the fisherman had been righthe had seen english ships there were cheers of joy at last the tables had turned no longer the fearful trespasser they were now the predator admiral nelsons orders were not long in coming and covered everything from the disposition of menowar in a tactical formation to the issue of lemons and fresh water kydd settled down to write up his signal book nelsons instructions were clear and vigorous and although there was not a flood of new signals there were a dozen general signals and fiftysix concerning tactical manoeuvres all of which had to be carefully detailed and indexed in his pocket signal book the most important were those covering their preparations for the chase the fleet was to be tightly formed in three columns a nautical mile apart and each ship two and a half cables from the next ahead divisions for battle would be signified by a specific triangular flag these were empowered to take on the enemy independently but it was the fighting memorandum that had the officers talking it spoke in powerful terms of close combat during which should a captain compel any of the enemys ships to strike their colours he is at liberty to judge and act to cut away their masts and bowsprit and that possession of ships of the enemy should be by one officer and one boats crew only that the british ship may be enabled to continue the attack the overall tenor of the orders was encapsulated in one single stirring sentence this special observance namely that the destruction of the enemys armament is the sole object this was real fighting talk no intricate manoeuvres no time wasted in forming a lineofbattle just forthright demands to fall upon the enemy in the most direct and effective manner at hand and the confident assumption that the english fleet would prevail the wardroom was abuzz long into the night with the implications for individual initiative the risk for nelson in trusting his captains with the closein climax of a battle and the probability of a rapid conclusionone way or the other first one then a multitude of sails lifted above the horizon after an anxious wait the ships were finally revealed to be the longedfor reinforcements for three days the newly formed battle fleet lay hove to boats plied busily between ships as captains met their admiral and officers reported to the flagship with their order books to receive the details resulting from strategy realised into tactics by the fertile mind of their chief when all was complete the collection of fourteen warships was as one under a single command it was time to go in chase of the french fleet signal guns on vanguard cracked impatiently in three divisions led by nelson and supported by captain troubridge to larboard of the line and captain saumarez to starboard the fleet began its quest kydd was anxious but it was not the hazards of storm or enemy that made his palms moist it was the knowledge that he and his ship were under the eye of the most famous fighting admiral of the age they were daring to become one of an elite band of ships and men beginning to be known throughout the royal navy troubridge of culloden hallowell of swiftsure foley of goliath hood of zealous to see the crusty houghton return from colloquy with nelson eyes alight and pride in his voice kydd knew that this was a professional pinnacle in his career and whatever happened he must not fail nelsons first move was to the eastward rounding the north of corsica with his fleet in tight formation laying to in the evening off the sprawling island of elba it was vital to gain intelligence on the whereabouts of the french armament to blunder into it round the next point of land would be disastrous all that was known was that the french had sailed and because the reinforcements had come from gibraltar without sighting them the armada must have passed north about corsica and then down the italian coastto rome naples malta with not a single frigate to scout ahead there was little choice the brig mutine was pressed into service the game little vessel would look ahead into the bays and harbours of the coast of italy and hope she could survive any encounter with the french meanwhile the fleet would stop any vessel that dared show itself these were few a terrified moorish xebec swore that he had seen the french fleet at syracuse and a tunny fisherman solemnly declared that he had sailed through the entire armada not far to their immediate south three days previously the land of corsica and north italy under their lee were french now and hostile so would not provide reliable intelligence nelson could not wait the trail was going cold the english fleet weighed anchor and stood to the south broadsides loaded and in fighting formationbut all they met was mutine on her way back to deliver her report no sighting not even a rumour the battle fleet followed the coast south the old port of civitavecchia was a bluegrey smudge to the eastward as mutine looked cautiously into it another day brought a misty grey rome to the horizon on they sailed until the limits of french occupation were reached this was now the kingdom of the two siciliesindependent but neutral by treaty of amity with revolutionary france naples was important enough though to serve as the seat of the senior british diplomat in the mediterranean so surely there they would receive reliable intelligence on this most sinister event of recent times neither kydd nor any in tenacious was able to catch sight of the famous city only the massive cone of vesuvius was recognisable above the lumpy coastline as the fleet hove to far out in the bay of naples ready to get under way in an instant to meet the enemy nelson remained aboard his flagship while the trusty mutine sailed inshore bearing his flagcaptain to the ambassador within two hours troubridge was hastening back to nelson observed by an impatient fleet this had to be the news they so badly needed speculation rose to fever pitch when the flagship at last hoisted the lieutenant repair aboard signal that always preceded the issue of orders the first lieutenant of tenacious was sporting enough to toss a coin for the task and it was renzi who occupied the sternsheets of the barge sailing out to vanguard there was some delay before the craft returned but when renzi came up the side steps he wore an enigmatic smile and excused himself to attend upon the captain when he emerged he was surrounded instantly by impatient officers gentlemen he protested i have but done my duty by the order bookdo you suppose i am made privy to all the strategical secrets of sir horatio that he confides his fears and anxieties to me to be nicholas kydd pleaded be s good as to tell yr friends what you sawand heard o course are we to renzi paused for a moment then said firmly its malta the island was almost at the geometrical centre of the mediterranean and astride the main eastwest sea routes with a stonebuilt fortress of great antiquity and a magnificent harbour it had been ruled for seven hundred years by warrior monks the knights of st john hospitallers who still held feudal court over the maltese how do you know renzi was pressed by several at once i was there when captain troubridge was still aboard pacing about the quarterdeck with nelson it seems gentlemen that the armament was recently seen passing southward it is perfectly logical that malta is the objective surely a descent on sicily is to be recommended adams said with this buonaparte has naples and the rest of italy and can split the mediterranean in twoa far greater prize i believe therefore what better than to take malta as a safe harbour for the seizure of sicily do not neglect the attraction of the gold and treasure of seven hundred years a pox on all this talk bryant grated lets be after em afore they sets ashorewherever theyre headed i think well find our answer at the strait of messina renzi continued equably our french tyrant must pass through and then well see what kind of course he shapes kydd remembered that the strait divided italy from sicily but was hazy about the details theyll be close enough t spy from ashore renzi raised an eyebrow when you recollect that these very same are the lair of the scylla and charybdis of the ancients he paused but in the absence of cries of understanding he went on which are the terrors that lie in wait for the unwary mariner each side of the strait that he must brave if he wishes to pass through on the one side there is scylla who dwells in a cave high up she will dart forth her snaky heads seize sailors from the very decks of their ship and bear them away shrieking to her den and on the other is charybdis who engulfs the laggardly in a frightful chasm into which the seas rush with a mighty roar that may be heard for leagues i fear it is this passage we must ourselves soon hazard there were no ancient monsters but the narrow strait held another threat only a mile wide it was a perfect location should the french fleet having got wind of their presence desire to lie in wait the english without scouting frigates and having no room to turn and manoeuvre would be helpless during the night they passed stromboli its lurid orange flaring up to deter them they reached the strait but no french warships loomed however it was clear they were expected the scrubby foreshore was crowded with people the fleet hove to and boats came out immediately one with an enormous union flag made straight for the flagship bryant brought the news from vanguard they had been waiting for malta right enough an caught in the actthe consul said the grand master gave up the island to this buonaparte only a week past much plundering an such but now hes to account to us aye kydd answered but well settle him depend ont he remembered the time he had spent in the last days of venice another antique civilisation with centuries of continuous history brought down by the same ruthless leader he felt bitter that the world he had grown up in with all its traditional ways its colour and individuality was now being dragged into chaos and desolation by this man the flagship picked up her pilot for the passage and ignoring the hundreds of boats that now surrounded them the fleet formed line for the transit from the fervent cries and theatrical gestures of the populace there was no doubt that they saw nelsons fleet as their only safeguard against the dreaded buonaparte there were currents as fast as a man could run but they met no other perils as they passed through the strait the eastern mediterranean few aboard had been in this half of the ancient world to the south were the sands of north africa and far to the east the fabled holy land on the northern side was greece the classical fount of civilisation and then the ottomans in constantinople every one was now under threat of war ahead a bare two days sail was the victorious enemy would the fleet stay within the fastness of the grand harbour reputedly the greatest stronghold in the mediterranean or with their greater numbers would they chance an encounter at sea would napoleon buonaparte himself take command on the flagship with stakes so high nothing short of a fight to the finish would serve nelson would ensure this possibly within a day these waters would witness a battle whose like they had never seen before it was crucial that any piece of intelligence was brought to bear from every ship in the fleet boarding parties were sent away to stop and question all vessels of size but with little result it would be a brave merchantman who ventured close to malta during these times they stood to the southward ready for whatever might come at malta yet again the signal hoisted in the flagship was investigate strange sail and once again it was tenaciouss pennants that accompanied it your bird grunted bryant to kydd the sail was now visible from the deck and it was small aye aye sir kydd answered without enthusiasm and went to his cabin to change into a more presentable frockcoat then buckle on his sword rawson could be relied on to muster the boats crew they had time tenacious had left the line and was thrashing out under full sail to intercept only when they had stopped the vessel would he take away the cutter which was now kept towing astern this was not his first boarding and he had grown weary of trying to make himself understood to those who had every reason not to understand him it was yet another of the myriad small craft plying the inland sea a brig of uncertain origin that had led them on a fine dance and now lay under backed mainsail awaiting kydd and his party as so often there were no colours flying idly rawson speculated on the short passage across an austrian id wager surlylookin crewbe trading with sicily sugar fr wine or some such what d you think mr hercules bowden sat with his face turned towards the brig and said nothing there was only need to take one midshipman whose task was to stay in the boat and keep the seamen from idle talk but kydd wanted bowden and his french with him rawsons animosity towards the boy irritated him and no doubt made the lads life hard in the crude confines of the midshipmens berth pipe down rawson kydd snapped irritably but there was nothing more he could do for bowden that would not be construed as favouritism the lad must find his own salvation the boat bumped alongside and kydd stood up as the bowman hooked on the shabby fore chains he stared directly at the only man on deck wearing a coat instead of the universal blouse and sash of the mediterranean sailor probably the master the brig reeked of dried fish eventually the man growled at one of the sullen seamen who threw a woodenstepped ropeladder over the side thank ee he said politely and mounted to the deck ltenant kydd royal navy he intoned bowing significant looks were exchanged and there was a low mutter among the other men beginning to gather which is the captain kydd said loudly captain he repeated slowly there was no response bowden ask em in french an say who we are still no one replied they stared stonily at kydd th captain kydd said sharply is mi the man in the coat grunted keeping his distance kydd understood his reluctance he might now be making a prize of their vessel or at the very least pressing men and he was backed by the mighty presence a few hundred yards away of a shipoftheline yr papers kydd said miming the riffling of paper the master eased a wellthumbed wad out of his waistcoat and handed them across without expression aha ragusan although the language of the registry certificate was none that he could decipher the vessels origins were plain ragusa was a busy port in the balkans opposite italy and as far as kydd could remember still ruled by the bourbons and therefore not an enemy he pulled out the crew list and gave it a quick search it was unlikely that a british deserter would be careless enough to sign up under his own name but this had happened in kydds experience he recognised the layout of a bill of lading but it was incomprehensible the next document was a little less oblique but as kydd pored over the certificate of clearance from chioggia which he remembered was near venice he sensed a sudden tension should they be found to be carrying cargo bound for any french possession by the rules of war it was contraband they stood to have it and the ship seized as lawful prize however his orders were plain they were not for prizetaking but for the acquiring of intelligence by any means after the source had been shown to be friendly and therefore reliable with a smile he closed the papers and fixed the masters eye fair winds then capn and a prosperous voyage to ye the brig was obviously trading with the enemyhow else could they survive commercially in the eastern mediterranean it was their bad luck that the english had chosen to enter there now bowden started to translate but the man waved him to silence got luck tenente he said stolidly and more strongly by god grace to wictory of the francesi sir thank you capn kydd said with a little bow have you b chance seen em at sea on your voyage he added casually making rocking motions with his hands no tenente not as after they sail frm malta kydd couldnt believe his ears they have left malta certamenteall ships all men now sail this was incredible it was much too soon for the invasion fleet to sail back to france but if not where were they he had to be sure if on his word nelson stopped looking around malta for the fleet and went off in some other direction captain i have t know very important the man nodded vigorously what day did they sail asked kydd ah seidicigiugno you say he frowned in concentration then traced sixteen in his palm and looked up apologetically just four days previously captain what course did they steer when they left che kydd ground his teeth in exasperation bowden tell them sir it seems in this part of the mediterranean they only have dogitalian or german ii dont know those he flushed kydd turned back to the master whatcoursethey steer he aped a man at the wheel peering at a compass scusi they not seen by me he said turning away the fleet had sailed after invading malta now the french were close very closebut this was about as much information as he was going to get thank you sir youve been very helpful kydd said he hailed the cutter alongside and tumbled in stretch out y buggers pull y hearts outthe frogsre close by you are quite certain sir admiral nelson fixed kydd with a stare so acute it made him falter ersir youll understand i had t win his favour so i overlooked his contraband cargo as prize rightly so nelson snapped it is never the duty of a naval officer to be gathering prizes when the enemy is abroad and therefore sir he had no reason t lie to me the stare held then nelson turned to his flaglieutenant fleet to heave to and i shall havelet me see troubridge saumarez ball and darby to repair aboard directly kydd waited uncertain on the weather side of the quarterdeck nelson paced forward deep in thought he saw kydd and said absently remain aboard if you please we may have further questions of you the slow pacing continued kydd kept out of the way the first boat arrived boatswains calls pealed out as a commanding figure with a patrician air and wearing full decorations came up the side the young officerofthewatch whispered to kydd thats saumarez o the orion a taut hand but a cold fish betimes next to board was a wellbuilt straighteyed captain in comfortable sea rig troubridge culloden second senior o course fine friends with our nel from the american war dont be flammed by his appearancejervis thinks him even bettern nelson nelson greeted him warmly and began to walk companionably with him a voice called loudly from the poopdeck and a signal lieutenant appeared at the rail sir the strange sail we saw earlier leander signals theyre frigates culloden and orion hauled their wind and prepared to close with them nelson stopped frigates were a significant force and the first french warships they had seen he hesitated for a second then ordered call in the chasing ships the signal lieutenant disappeared to comply i rather think that with the french fleet close i shall keep my fleet whole he added to the remaining officers another captain arrived a man with deepset eyes who punctiliously raised his hat to nelson even while the admiral welcomed him ball alexander much caressed by our nel since he passed us the towline in that blow off sardinia kydd looked at him there was little of the bluff seadog about the ascetic figure nothing to suggest that this was a seaman of courage and skill the last was a slightly built officer with guarded eyes darby bellerophon keeps t himself really shall we go below there was a compelling urgency in the tone kydd followed them in trepidation into the admirals quarters where the large table in the great cabin was spread with charts do sit gentlemen nelson said his clerk busied himself with papers kydd took a small chair to one side tenacious stopped a ragusan brig not two hours ago lieutenant kydd he nodded at kydd who bobbed his head performed the boarding and is available for questions i am satisfied that he has brought reliable word he has found that the french armament is no longer at malta it has sailed and we have no indication of course or intent none i do not have to tell you that our next action is of the utmost consequence which is why i have called you together to give me your views and strategic reasoning saumarez broke the silence sir are we to understand that this is in the nature of a councilofwar he said carefully it was an important point if a later inquiry found nelsons decision culpable the formalities of a council would provide for him some measure of legal protectionat the cost of involving themselves no it is not kindly regard this asas a conference of equals saumarez he said with a frosty smile now to business the french have left malta where are they headed he looked at each captain in turn i desire to have you answer this question do we stand on for malta or steer for sicily or do you consider it altogether another destination kydd recalled that this was nelsons first command of a fleet of ships in his own right was he seeking support for a command decision that should be his alone may we have your own conclusions first sir troubridge asked very well they might be on their way back to france after their conquest but i doubt it and besides theyd find it a hard beat with transports against this norwesterly no in my opinion they are headed further into the eastern mediterranean he stopped the turks and constantinople murmured troubridge i think not the holy land theres plunder aplenty there and a royal route to india across mesopotamia it was the youthfullooking berry present as captain of the flagship possibly as there were no further offerings nelson declared incisively there is one objective that i think outweighs all others egypt there were mutterings but nelson cut through forcefully yes egypt should they take the biggest mediterranean port alexandria they have then but twenty leagues overland and they are at the red sea and from there two weeks to our great possessions in india saumarez stirred restlessly sir saving your presence i find this a baseless conjecture we have not one piece of intelligence to support such a conclusion nevertheless this is my present position nelson said i should be obliged for your arguments to the contrary in the absence of news we deal in speculation and presumption sir we must reason ourselves to a conclusion this is mine troubridge leaned back with a broad smile pon my word sir horatio this will set them aflutter in whitehall conceive of itthe entire fleet dispatched to the most distant corner of the mediterranean to egypt no less the pyramids the desert whitehall is two months away the decision will be made today the reflected sundappled sea played prettily on the deckhead but it also threw into pitiless detail the admirals deep lines of worry the prematurely white hair the glittering eye then i concur troubridge said it has to be alexandria should alexandria be captured our interests in india will be at appalling risk this cannot be allowed unexpectedly it was saumarez yes captain ball it seems the most likely course sir darby putting to sea in a wind foul for france does appear an unlikely move unless their intentions lie eastward anything further no then it shall be alexandria thank you gentlemen a thousand sea miles to the eastto the fabled orient the egypt of cleopatra the sphinx the eternal nile and a french invasion fleet waiting for them there the english fleet prepared accordingly the most vital task was to crowd on as much sail as possible to try to overhaul the french and force a meeting at sea before the landings the winds were fair for the levant and with stunsls abroad the fleet sped across the glittering deep blue seas for day after day there was little sailhandling with the winds astern and for watch after watch there was no need to brace and trim the steady breeze drove them onward in an arrowstraight course for the southeast corner of the mediterranean gun practice filled the day gun crews were interchanged sidetackle men put on the rammer the handspike and gun captains were stood down while the seconds took charge it was fearful work in the summer heat tons of dead iron to haul in and out twentyfour pounds in each shot to manhandle guncarriages squealed and rumbled even in the light of evening at daybreak as soon as there was the slightest lightening of the sky doubled lookouts at the masthead searched the horizons until they could be sure there was no strange sail then after quarters the men would go to breakfast among the guns that shared their living space and always the thought the secret dread that the enemy were just ahead a vast armada covering the sea from horizon to horizon that would result in a cataclysmic battle to be talked about for the rest of time it took the english fleet less than a week to cover the distance keeping well away from land and stopping all ships they could find for the barest clue as to the french positions in the morning light a hazy coastline formed ahead and the fleet went to quarters ships fell into two columns and prepared for battle keyed up to the highest pitch of readiness the low coast firmed and drew nearer kydd raised his telescope to a dense scatter of white against the nondescript sandy shore the straggling ancient town of alexandria with its pharos tower he passed quickly over the tall minarets and the lofty seamark of pompeys pillar amid the pale stone sprawl of a medieval fort the forest of black masts that they sought was missing kydd knew from such charts as they had that the port had two harbours each side of a mushroomshaped peninsula of land the fleet passed slowly by telescopes glinting on every quarterdeck but at the end it was all too clear that there was no french fleet at anchor anywhere in alexandria the disappointment was cruel mutine hove to closer inshore a boat pulled energetically from her to vanguard was she returning with longedfor news conversations stilled about the deck as the ships lay to within the hour boats were passing up and down the fleet with their messageno french fleet no news whatsoever of it kydd kept his glass trained on the flagship he could make out people on her upper deck some moving some still and once he recognised a small lonely figure standing apart it was not difficult to imagine the torment that must be racking their commander it had been his final decision to come to egypt to seek the french but they were not hereit might be that they had been comprehensively fooled and that the enemy was on his way in the other direction to gibraltar and the open atlantic to fall upon england while they were in this furthest corner of the mediterranean in hours the fleet was under weigh and tenacious was stretching to the northwestward ships company stood down from quarters the sea watch was set and word was passed that houghton who had been called to the admiral before they set sail wished all officers to present themselves in his cabin i am desired by sir horatio to acquaint you all with the position we find ourselves in it was unusualunprecedented eventhat houghton had sat them informally round a smaller table with an evening glass of sherry this was not going to be the official passing on of orders i will not attempt to conceal the dismay the absence of the enemy has caused the admiral kydd caught renzis eye but there was nothing in it except sombre reflection and the dilemma this causes our viceconsul tells us that there have been no french forces upon this coast save some venetian frigates and small fry he also swears that the ottomans have found our own presence as unwelcome as the french and intend to resist any move of aggression in this we can see that there are definitely no major enemy forces in the vicinity the officers waited patiently as houghton continued trading ships in harbour have been questioned and are adamant that there are no french at sea it is as if they have vanished then sir we are obliged to conclude that admiral nelson is wrong in the essentials said bampton heavily and thus we are beating to the norard on speculation houghtons eyes narrowed take care mr bampton this is the commander of the fleet you are questioning bamptons lips thinned and he continued obstinately nevertheless sir it seems we are at sea on a venture once again with not a scrap of intelligence to justify it i am at a loss to account for his motions houghton put down his glass sharply it is not your duty to account for the actions of your commander recollect your situation sir kydd felt for any man who faced with a decision put action above fainthearted inaction and said strongly t put it plain he has no intelligence t work withso what do you expect sir lies in port waitin for word t be passed or figures something an active officer can do and that is said bampton acidly houghton came in quickly sir horatio feels that the objective still remains in the eastern mediterranean possibly the turks constantinople perhaps consider if this great armada prevails over the ottomans then not only asia minor but necessarily the holy land and egypt fall to the french kydds mind reeled with the implications and then hell have cut the mediterranean in two just so we shape course to the north gentlemen to asia minor and the greek islands again seizing every opportunity to gather intelligence where we may the enemy cannot hide a fleet of such size for ever as they left the cabin renzi murmured to kydd even so nelson will be hard put to justify his conduct before their lordships of the admiraltytwice he has missed them and for a junior admiral on his first command in the steady northwesterly it was a hard beat northward closehauled on the larboard tack with bowlines at each weather leech as they struck deeper into the north it appeared not a soul had seen anything of the french and the further on they sailed the less likely a mighty descent on constantinople seemed it was passing belief that the passage of such a great fleet had gone unnoticed and when they attained the entrypoint of the aegean and therefore constantinople without finding a soul who had heard of a french fleet it was time to take stock ah mr adamsreturned from the flag with orders i see even bampton was curious as he watched the young officer spring over the bulwarks on his return from the flagship houghton opened the order book and studied the last entry then snapped it shut he would not be drawn and with a frown retired to his cabin leaving the deck to his officers well demanded bryant others sidled up the quartermaster hovered and the master found it necessary to check the condition of the larboard waterway adams adjusted his cuffs i must declare he said lightly our nel is the coolest cove youll ever meetfrench armada loose who knows where and he wont hear any as say it wont end in a final meeting so its to be a continuation of the same battleready night and day until we come up with em dammit adams does he say where were lookin bryant hissed well i was not actually consulted by sir horatio but er i did overhear him speaking with berry kydd smiled and it seems that if weve not sighted em by twentyseven east then we beat south about candia back to the western med quitting the chase said bampton with relish fallin back on gibraltar more like bryant snapped no choice kydd growled all th same this buonaparte has the devils luckhow else cn he just vanish no one sees him an all his ships remembering the size of the mediterranean above a million square miles renzi put in but not forgetting that we havent touched land since sardinia wood n water storeswe cant go on like this for ever bampton observed if i dont misread nelson is not yr man to give away th game hell hunt em down wherever theyre hidin and then well have our fight hes had bad fortune is all kydd declared bampton smiled my guineas are on that before august well have a new commandermark my words the signal for the fleet to come about on the starboard tack was hoisted within the hour and obediently the ships shaped course westward closehauled and taking the seas on their bows renzi did not go below there was a pleasing solitude to be had when the men went to breakfast thoughts could flow unchecked to their natural conclusion and the deck with a minimum of watchmen about was his for the walking his mind strayed to the letter he had received in gibraltar it was from his father who in his usual bombastic manner had insisted that he come home to discuss his future there was little chance of that in the near term but there was no point in putting it off for ever the next time he was in england he would return to face him peake the chaplain came up from below interrupting his thoughts nicholas i was told you always took the air at this time he said in his precise manner i do hope you will not object to my company the deck lifted in response to a comber under the bows and he lurched over to grip a convenient downhaul a double crossing of the north atlantic had not improved his sealegs you are most welcome padre renzi answered warmly he had respect for the man who was the most nearly learned of all aboard one with whom he could dispute rousseau natural law ethics or any other subject valued by an enlightened mind the chaplain had volunteered for the sea service as his contribution to the struggle against france but with a life perspective best termed literal he was not preserved from the torments of midshipmen and irreverents by a saving sense of humour as milton has it in solitude what happiness who can enjoy alone or all enjoying what contentment find admonished peake just so mr peake yet please believe i have a desire at times to withdraw from the company of menbut merely for the contemplation of the sublime that is at the very essence of the sea he had not the heart to discourage a man so manifestly reaching out renzi saw peake look about doubtfully at the straining sails and hurrying waves the fleets progress west was necessarily against the same streaming northwesterly that had brought them eastward so rapidly now at each watch there would be anxious glances to the flagship for the signal prepare to tack the warning that yet again there would be all hands at the sheets and braces for the hard work at putting about peake would see little of the sublime in such seaenforced labour renzi mused then enquired you are not enjoying your watery sojourn such lands as youve seen would cost a pretty penny to experience were you to ship as passenger i do not value such adventures canada i find has an excess of colour and what i saw of gibraltar does not spark in me any great desire for sightseeing yet you have chosen the sea life i feel a certain calling at the same time i will confess to you sir in a sense it weighs heavily oh peake turned to face him nicholasi think we might be accounted friends fellow believers that is he hastened to add in the essential rationality of the objective man when detached from corporeal encumbrances i warm to leibniz and his position before that of your spinoza and his deductions mr peake quite sowe have discussed this before as i recollect no sir what i face might be considered a dilemma of conscience ah bayle and the sceptic position renzi said with keen anticipation peake winced not as who should say sir i will be frankin the lively trust in your discretion and the earnest hope that you will assist me in coming to a comfortable resolution my discretion is assured sir but i cannot be sanguine about my suitability to aid you in a matter of churchly ethics never so renzi allow me to set forth the essentials since childhood i have been charmed by the tightness of nature such nicety in the disposition of leaves on a stem musculature in a cat the flight of a swallow in fine renzi it is lifes vitality itself that for me is of all the world the greater worth he looked closely at renzi then out to the immensity of the sea here is the dilemma my friend i had an adequate living as curate in a peaceful village in shropshire and you may believe that for the quiet and reflective mind there are few occupations that can better that of a country parson when the revolution began in france i was puzzled then an emigre french family came to the village and i learned of the true situation while attending upon the matriarch who had lost her mind at the experience his voice strengthened this is the reason for the offer of my services to his majestythat in some way i was playing a part in the defending of my country against such unspeakable horrors a noble part mr peake renzi murmured but in my time on tenacious i have learned much indeed the sailors are rough fellows but in their way are as tender as babes to each other and the midshipmen scamps and rascals indeed but i feel that they act as they do out of a need to retreat from martial horrors to the innocence of their so recently departed childhood renzis eyebrows went up but he said nothing peake drew a deep breath and continued what i am saying is that i have been privileged to see a species of humanity nauta innocentia that perfectly displays the qualities of lifecherishing animation that i so value so you may recognise the anguish i feel when the captain calls for practice with his cannonthose mortal engines whose rude throats could counterfeit the dread clamours of jove renzi my friend please understand it causes me the utmost pain when my unruly imagination pictures for me their purpose the tearing apart of the sacred flesh of life and its utter and final extinction be they enemy of my country i cannot prevent the betraying thought that even so they hold within them the same vital flame how can i bring myself to accede to my captains constant pressing to hurl unrelenting maledictions on the french in sermon and prayer when i find myself in such brotherly commune with their lifeforce how can i hate an enemy when i understand only too well what it is to contain life within you whatever should i do nicholasim torn help me do my duty the beat west was tiring and dispiriting long miles of vigilant ships but empty sea a distance further than a complete atlantic crossing weeks turning to monthsand still not even the wisp of a rumour of a vast french fleet south of crete with the ancient land of greece left to starboard they were traversing the width of the ionian sea and approaching where they had left with such hopes a long month before there was now a pressing need for provisions and water in these lonely and hostile seas the only possibility was the kingdom of the two sicilies and of these the closer was syracuse on the eastern shores of sicily the hardrun fleet each ship with the blue ensign of rear admiral nelson aloft sighted the rugged pastel grey coast of sicily at last and prepared to enter the ancient port the sleepy town lay under the suns glare to starboard mysterious ruins above scrubby cliffs to larboard it was a difficult approach with troubled waters betraying rocky shoals extending menacingly into the bare halfmile of the intricate entrance once inside the spacious reaches of an enfolding harbour welcomed the ships one by one they dropped anchor people gathered along the seafront hastily filled bumboats contended to be first out to the fleet but with decorum proper to the occasion englands union flag arose on each manowars jackstaff forward but before they could proceed the local officials had to be placated it was difficult for the city governor any favouritism towards the british might be construed as a violation of neutrality by the suspicious french and at first he was obstructive and implacable it required an exercise of ingenuity and tact to arrive at a form of words that allowed a show of resistance after which his attentions could not be faulted every vessel hoisted out her boats for the hard task of watering the massive casks had to be manhandled from a spring or rivulet ashore and floated out to the ship where they would be finally hoisted out and struck down into the hold the enthusiastic townsfolk endeared themselves to the thirsty mariners and renzis classical soul when they pointed out the continued existence of the famed fountains of arethusa an aqueduct from ancient times bringing water from the interior to the town and perfectly capable of supplying the wants of a whole fleet kydd was touched that admiral nelson with all his crushing worries had noticed that the cask wine taken aboard for the mens grog issue was being affected by the heat his orders were that for every pipe of wine two gallons of brandy were to fortify it he made sure as well that depleted victuals were promptly restored from local sourceslemons by the cartload endless wicker baskets of greens and beef on the hoof in the sunshine spirits rose idly kydd watched poulden in the shade of the massive mainmast patiently work a longsplice for bowden the lad had lost his pale complexion to a ruddier colouring and his gawky sea gait had steadied to a careful stepping his body was now more lean than willowy his expression poised and composed voices rose on the quarterdeck attracting kydds attention mutine had just entered harbour after another reconnaissance she went aback close to the flagship and hardy her commander stepped into her boat shell have something tsay i believe kydd said vaguely aware of a shadowy world of plots and spies and the surreptitious allegiances of greed and trade that were the main source of information in this part of the world probably that the french by now are past gibraltar said bampton sourly he had come on deck at the first excitement and was still buttoning his waistcoat the master came up behind them mutine showed no signal on enterin he said pensively does this mean she has no news t offer it would be beyond belief if this crossroads at the very centre of the mediterranean touched at by merchant vessels plying both sides of the sea did not have some word of the french houghton emerged on deck sniffing the wind and trying to look indifferent to the tension the quarterdeck fell quiet as a flagship pinnace approached them her youthful flaglieutenant punctiliously doffed his hat to the quarterdeck and then the captain there were murmured words as houghton took delivery of a packet of orders and retired to his cabin the flaglieutenant waited have ye news sir kydd asked him boldly others edged over to hear the reply news you mean the french forces yes ohthen no news my friend none no sighting if thats what you mean sir goddammit we still dont know where the buggers are exploded bryant pushing past kydd that is not what i said sir the lieutenant said bryant went red but before he could continue the officer confided happily you should have seen his nibs when hardy brought in his report in as rare a taking as ever ive known capering around his cabin like a schoolboy yr meaning sir barked kydd the lieutenant was now surrounded by eager officers my meaning i thought it was perfectly clear sir no sighting of the french fleet anywhere in the western med and that to those with the perspicacity to remark it means they must necessarily be in the eastsir horatio was correct in his first assumption then then sir it is quite apparent if we discount the seas north around to the east where we have cruised so recently it leaves only the levant and the south sir it can only be egypt why then did we not sight we were too hasty in our descent on alexandria we hauled past them in the night sir horatio believes and thus found an empty port should we clap on sail this instant we should find them there at anchor within their army probably ashore then sir we shall have the rencontre we so ardently desire houghton stepped out briskly from his cabin you have heard then gentlemen he said with satisfaction i can tell you that we sail for alexandria on completion of stores and you may depend upon it we shall have an encounter within the week one by one the shipsoftheline slipped past the lighthouse and small fort at the tip of the long neck of land upon which old syracuse shimmered in the bright sun their next landfall the even more ancient land of egypt the breeze held and strengthened and the fleet stretched out over the sparkling sea under all sail possible bampton was not persuaded however still our motions are driven by conjecturewhere is your evidence they are not in the westbut who has considered that having taken malta they are satisfied and have retired back to toulon evidence as if in answer to his words the fleet stood on for greece with the peloponnese in plain sight nelson sent in troubridge of culloden to speak with the turkish authorities the big sailed into the wide bay towards koroni castle when he returned he finally brought news that the french had been positively sightedsteering southeastward they had been seen some weeks before but it was a mystery as to why they had gone so far to the north instead of making a straight run of it to alexandria it was the master who grasped the significance cabotage sir he told houghton theyre a lubberly crew hereabouts an navigate by following the coast along point b point and never a notion of workin a deepsea reckoning we sailed direct got there before em culloden was followed by a humble twomaster astern this was a french winebrig that the same obliging governor who had given them their vital news had also graciously allowed to be carried off as prize from under the guns of the castle later the wine would be transhipped to the fleet as rations please take a chair mr kydd houghtons manner as he greeted kydd in his cabin was oddtense perhaps kydd thought but that could be because he had only recently returned from conclave with nelson during their long chase the admiral had made it his practice to see his captains in twos and threes in the great cabin of vanguard there together they would share his fighting vision and intentions playing out the possible settings for combat ill not mince words we are about to be joined in battle with an enemy of great force it will be a hardfought contest which is vital to our country but i have the utmost confidence in admiral nelson and his battle plans which we have discussed thoroughly it only requires we follow where he leads and ive no doubt whatsoever of the outcome he paused and looked at kydd intently as i recollect this will be your first experience of the quarterdeck in an action of significance in the lineofbattle sir camperdown his only fleet action did not counthe had been below with the guns and at no time had really understood what was happening outside his ship and besides he reminded himself it was before he had been raised to be an officer it is the custom of the service for the duty of signal lieutenant to be devolved on the junior you have discharged this duty to my satisfaction so far sir but you will forgive my concern when you reflect that at this time of supreme crisis when it is crucial the intentions of the commander be knownand only by signali am obliged to place the safety and honour of my ship in one who has had no officerlike experience of a fleet action and who is the most junior aboard kydd flushed am i then t be superseded sir what is the signal division designated to harass the enemy rear why blue burgee signific an number twentynine both at mizzen peak sir kydd said instantly the night signal to haul to the wind and sail with starbd tacks on board one light at th ensign staff one in the mizzen shrouds an fire one gun and to larbd two lights in the foreshroudsthat is t say one above the otherand two guns houghton nodded and kydd saw that behind the hard expression his captain needed reassurance before a great battle houghton got up and stared out from the stern windows that is well mr kydd i can see that you have applied yourself to your profession he paused then continued softly sir horatio is a fine leadera great man i believe there we may see a ruthless determination to achieve victory that spares neither himself nor his officers ive seen it in no other man i would not have tenacious fail him mr kydd aye sir houghton swung round remember always that the best plans and dispositions are as nothing if they cannot be communicated we have no repeating frigates therefore a great deal depends on your vigilance and attention to duty he hesitated i would wish you well mr kydd at midnight kydd handed over the watch to renzi and went below to the darkened wardroom to turn in from the chart he had seen that they would make landfall on alexandria the following morning and as he slipped into his gently swaying cot unsettling thoughts came to trouble him there could be no mistaking the gravity of the situation the enemy would fight to the limits to repulse any attempt to overthrow their position as lords of the mediterraneanat stake was their chance at a breakout into the outer world and an unstoppable path to complete domination two great fleets would meet in mortal combat tomorrow to determine who would be future masters of the sea and therefore the course of history he tossed restlessly eyes open in the hot darkness it might well be his last night on earth into his mind came the horrors of mortal wounding the dark hell of the cockpit and the surgeons sawor would it be quick a heavy shot tearing him in two he shied from the possibility of personal extinction and tried to focus on halfremembered religious shibboleths but they had small enough meaning now should he perhaps ask mr peake to spend some time with him tomorrow to seek strength in the sturdy faith of his fathers he rolled over restlessly and forced his thoughts to the commander the illustrious nelson he of calvi tenerife the patent bridge at st vincent the savage boat fighting at cadiz now there was one who would not suffer night terrors to trouble him his written orders were full of words like victory destruction duty honour there was even a clause directing that a single lieutenant and midshipman should take possession of defeated enemy ships however big the better to allow their ship to move on and engage another kydd felt better there was no doubt that nelsons fleet would conduct itself in the best traditions of the royal navy and therefore so would he his anxiety ebbed professionally he felt confidence seamanship and courage were what were required now and besides a small voice offered it might well be that the french were not in alexandria having vanished again the morning dawned hazy as the sun rose on sparkling deep blue seas the northwesterly was picking up the fleet perfectly on course they would raise alexandria later in the morning nelson had signalled to alexander and swiftsure to sail on ahead to report and all eyes were on the pale horizon impatient for news land was sighted again the unmistakable flat duncoloured dunes and lofty palms of egypt and far ahead the sprawl of a cityalexandria alexander was standing off the port everyone aboard tenacious turned to her signal lieutenant what was the news as they drew nearer the pharos tower resolved distantly out of the morning haze and there were tantalising glimpses of the masts and rigging of what could only be a vast amount of shipping still there was no signal kydd waited for the simple twoflag hoist number eleven enemy in sight followed by a compass bearing the details that came after would be the most interesting the number of shipsoftheline and frigates lesser vessels would not concern the admiral he kept his glass trained all along the deck not a word was spoken his arms began to achebut then it came feverishly kydd deciphered the signal bellowing down to the tight group waiting on the quarterdeck from alexander sir two shipsotheline an six frigates french colours this could be at best only a trivial remnant of the great armada for which they were so desperately searching a roar of dismay echoed about the ship along with shouts of anger as word spread below kydd slumped it was too much they had been fooled again the french had disappeared with the devilish fortune they seemed to command and there would be no mighty battle that day he caught sight of houghtons expression of devastation for him there was now no prospect of promotion or prizemoney beside him bryant stood disconsolate the seamen at the upperdeck twelvepounders were outraged and voluble the fleet began to string out as ships no longer under the urgency of the lineofbattle quested forlornly for the missing enemy a hardrun chase of many weeks spirits high keyed up with tension and now this sir rawson pointed to one of the two s that had reached furthest to the east there was colour at her signal halliards kydd brought up his glass it was number eleven enemy in sight he bellowed a storm of cheering broke out trembling with excitement kydd tried to steady the telescope sixteen sailothelineat anchorbearing east bsouthfour frigates twenty miles from alexandria snugly at anchor within aboukir bay near the mouth of the nile they had found their quarryat last chapter distant four leagues mr hambly what do you consider our speed over the ground now houghton still had his glass up looking intently at the long menace of dark lines of rigging over the sandy point far ahead the master pursed his lips and glanced over the side five five an a half my guess sir houghton lowered his telescope and swung round to look astern at the straggle of ships some two or three miles off i see he said thoughtfully resuming his watch ahead sir kydd ventured well i fear you may not rely on action today mr kydd why so sir there will not be time enough should we wait until all our ships have come up then form our lineofbattle at five knots it will be hours before we can close on the enemy and sunset comes at seven or sono well not be fighting today tomorrow when they come out this will be when we force a conclusion the bay opened up with the tiny aboukir island at the western side there was breathless quiet inside in an endless line of ships parallel to the shore was the french fleet bryant growled damme but theyre well placed with the land to their backs the french had a wall of guns more than a mile and a half long waiting for any assailant willing to risk passing the island which they could see was occupied and armed kydds attention was all on the flagship complex dispositions would need to be communicated concerning arrangements for the night the enemy must not be allowed to escape but the british ships could not anchor too close inshore nelson might risk standing off and on sailing out to sea and back again possibly with half of his fleet then bunting appeared on the poopand a single signal soared kydd hesitated as the image danced in his eyepiece prepare for battle he roared houghton gaped good god he means to bring em to action now with a grim smile he turned to bryant we have three hoursi believe well clear for action now a shipoftheline could clear for action in fifteen minutes if necessary but this day would be the hardest fought of their lives things were better done in the cool of forethought than the heat of battle victory could depend on the smallest precaution having been properly attended to kydds action position was on the poopdeck at the signals there was little to do in readiness beyond the mustering of the bunting in the flag locker and ensuring that the log was at hand signal halliards cleared and free the handful of seamen and rawson in no doubt about their duties here preparation was of the mind kydd knew by heart most of the hoists he could foresee and his signal book had been brought up to date with the very latest that had been entered in the fleet commanders order book he reviewed the provisions for night signals complicated specified arrangements of lights in varying configurations and false fireswooden tubes of combustibles that burned with a blue light and had several meanings depending on how and when they were deployed and most important the recognition signal for british ships only now circulated to the fleet it would be four lights in line hoisted high to be as visible as possible above powdersmoke the lighting rig had been checked twice by the boatswain who also had a spare charged at hand kydd tucked his signal telescope under his arm and paced slowly conscious of a thudding heart and tight stomach but resolutely refusing to steal a look into the bay mr kydd the captain called from the quarterdeck sir houghton looked energised but wore a hard expression ive no doubt your men at quarters are mustered ready aye sir then as you are at leisure you will probably wish to take a turn about the decks he snapped kydd understood as other officers were occupied with their quarters at the guns and elsewhere he was being asked to keep a roving eye on the clearing for action perhaps steady the men as they anticipated the slaughter to come this was no sudden frantic sighting of the enemy it was a cold considered approach tenacious would face her ordeal in perfect battle order at this moment vanguard would be similarly engaged so there would be no communication in the immediate future and rawson with his handful of seamen could be trusted to stand by at the signals take the glass kydd told him handing over his telescope and any signal from the flagship i want t know about instantly dye hear the entire ships company was at work an ants nest of activity men taking up shot for the garlands alongside each gun jostled past kydd streams of sailors brought up hammocks and soaked them to form barricades in the fighting tops for the marine musketeers a party was at work on the sauve tete the netting spread twelve feet high above the deck to protect against rigging shot to pieces falling from aloft the boatswain and his mates were methodically laying out essential damagecontrol gearrigging stoppers and lengths of line that could be secured above and below a severed rope to restore its function jigger tackles were becketed up under the hatchway coaming canvas and twine ready to repair important sails at hand as were grappling irons to hold an enemy alongside while they boarded kydd smiled wryly tenacious would probably be the smallest manowar in the lineany boarding would likely be in the other direction he glanced aloft at the massive lower yards tons in weight chain slings were rigged to support them should the tye blocks at the mast be shot through and the braces to heave round the yards were augmented by preventers and pendants to handle the heavy spar if cannon fire knocked it askew from forward he heard the reassuring sound of grinding steel as the gunners party put a final edge on the tomahawks cutlasses pikes and other edged weapons down the main hatchway it was a different kind of bustle cabin bulkheads were knocked away and officers personal effects were struck below in the hold he saw his own cabin dismantled the desk where each day he had faithfully written his journal taken bodily by two seamen to the hatch preceded by his cot and chest renzis cabin was treated in the same way and when the long wardroom table had been disassembled and carried away there was nothing to spoil a continuous sweep of the gundeck right to the stern the torpid eighteenpounder gun with which he had familiarly shared his cabin now awakened and readied for fighting on the gundeck more preparations were in train the gunner had unlocked the grand magazine and stringent fire precautions were in force fearnought firescreens and leather firebuckets were around each hatchway and in the magazines lanthorns were put in sealed sconces wearing felt slippers those inside this area would make up cartridges and pass them out to the chain of powder monkeys who in turn carried them up to the guns kydd shivered at the fearful thought of being confined here in a blazing battle with no knowledge of the outside world the tons of powder in plain sight their only company he moved forward and saw renzi who gave a grave nod before turning back to a quarter gunner with orders images of camperdown flashed before him this place was not named the slaughterhouse for nothing within hours it would be a hell of smoke and noise smashed timbers and screaming and after sunset the dim gold of battle lanthorns would be the only light they had to fight the guns the preparations continued spare gunbreeching ropes and tackles were laid around the hatchways and arms chests for boarders were thrown open on the centreline gun captains returned from the store with a powder horn gunlock flints pouches of firing tubes all the necessary equipment to bring the great guns to life finally the decks were strewn with sand and galley ash then wetted this would not only give a better grip for the men at the gun tackles but help them retain their footing in blood kydds last stop was the orlop where the surgeon made ready and the carpenter gathered his crew as part of battle preparations the men held in irons there were released given full amnesty for their crimes in the face of events of far greater moment he was about to go down the ladder when a breathless rawson dashed up signal sir prepare t anchor by the stern his eyes were wide thank ye ill be up directly by the stern had rawson misread the signal he hurried back to the poop pushing past the busy swarms and snatched up the signal log there it was and repeated by orion and others mr kydd houghton called from the quarterdeck sir kydd hurried down the poop ladder do you not understand sir horatios motions er t anchor by the stern not altogether i have t say sir then sir mark the enemys position they are anchored in line along the shore away from us and directly down the wind ill have you note without doubt the admiral wishes to advance on them from there then lay his ships alongside an enemy and stayin short to anchor but should we anchor in the ordinary way by the bow then as is the way of things we will rotate round to face the wind and o course wed be cruelly raked until our guns bear again undoubtedly and additionally with springs on th cables we cn direct our fire as we please just so mr kydd with one signaltwo flagsnelson had levelled the odds then you will oblige me sir in taking a cable through a stern chase gunport aye aye sir making fast t the mizzen yes kydd saluted and left the deck happy to have something of significance to do in this time of waiting mr pearce he called to the boatswain we have a task it was no trivial matter rousing out the hundredfathom length of twelveinch stream cable from below then ranging it along the gundeck from where it was seized round the fat bulk of the mizzen mast through the gunroom and out of one of the pair of chase ports with the wake of the moving ship foaming noisily just feet below the thick rope had to be heaved out of the stern and passed back along the ships side beneath the line of open gunports and to an anchor on the bows the cable was kept clear of the sea by a spunyarn at every third port ready for instant cutting loose and at the bows it was bent on to the anchor bryant approached the captain ship cleared for action sir there was a taut ferocity about the first lieutenant kydd saw almost a bloodlonging for the fight he wondered if he too should adopt a more aggressive bearing very well mr bryant there will be time for supper for the men before we go to quarters i believeand everyone shall have a double tot if you please kydd called rawson over go below an get yourself something t eat younkerafter youve seen y men get their grog it would not be long before they went to quarters the enemy was now in plain view on the right side of a low sandy bay fringed by date palms and inshore of a guardian island no more than thirty feet high their line stretching away into the distance on the left were some higher sand hills which kydd knew from their rudimentary chart was the rosetta mouth of the nile with its distinctive tower in the evening sun he picked up knots of people coming down to the waters edge there would be a big audience for the evenings entertainment he wondered if the famed general buonaparte was watching perhaps from the small medieval castle at the mouth of the bay he went below the men were in spirits roughhumoured as he remembered himself when he had been one of them the old jokes about prizemoney the lottery of death the exchange of verbal wills in the wardroom he stuffed his pockets with hard tack an orange and a large clean cloth then accepted his fighting sword and crossbelt from his servant his uncle who had provided the fine blade was now unimaginably distant he eased out the blued steel far enough to glimpse the cornish choughs then clicked it home again and buckled it on whose blood would it taste first or would he yield it in surrender to great odds as he left he felt a stab of forebodinghe was going out on deck and perhaps would never return but he shook it off and as he reached the upper deck his eyes immediately searched out the waiting enemy this is a grave and solemn moment mr bryant admonished houghton breaking into the first lieutenants avid description of what he had once found in a captured french ship we shall mark it with due reverence pass the word for the chaplain at length the man appeared i desire to see a short service before we open hostilities if you please mr peake aa service yes certainly do you not feel it wise to seek the blessing of the almighty on our endeavours you mean do i have to instruct you in your duty sir a rousing hymn to get the men in spirit some bracing words about the rightness of our cause doing our christian duty that sort of thing and of course finish with a suitable prayer calling for a blessing of our arms on this day steadies the men puts heart into them make it briefwell be at the guns in an hour as he hurried along the upper deck renzi saw a figure he recognised clinging to the bulwarks head bowed why whats this mr peake at your prayers i see he said with most of the men below there were only a few curious pairs of eyes to gawp at them peake lifted his face it was a picture of misery i cant do it mr renzi he said thickly cannot do what sir the captain wishes me toto speak words of violence to incite men to acts of bloodshed and thisthis i find in all conscience i cannot do sir renzi knew the man was finished if he was unable to function as expected it would be construed as common cowardice we must discuss this he said taking peake firmly by the arm and urging him below they passed through the maindeck with its gun crews animated by grog one called out what cheer the sinbosunyell have work enough t do afore we sees the sun again when they arrived in the orlop the cockpit table was ready laid with shining instruments the surgeon lifted a fearfullooking long knife and began stropping it deliberately peake shied away under his direct stare mr pybus youd oblige us extremely by allowing us the temporary privacy of your cabin renzi said the surgeon laid down the knife dear fellow i can think of no better lair to wait out this disagreeable time by all means renzi sat peake on the patients stool mr peake you came forward to serve his majesty is this not so there was no reply and now your country needs youand in particular at this time you sir he added forcefully peake stared at him as renzi pressed on our ships companyall handsare putting their lives at peril in the service of their country and their fellow man they look for meaning and surety words they can carry with them in their hour of trial can you not feel it in your heart mr renzi you are no practised hand at dissimulation so speak direct sir you assume a lack of moral fibre in me a reprehensible shyness in the face of mortal danger let me assure you this is far from being the case then sir what prevents you in the performance of your divinities i have referred before to my abhorrence of any man seeking to wreak violence upon a fellow creature i do not propose to explicate further renzi bit his lip his immediate duty was to the gun crews under his command and thence to his ship and time was pressing do i understand that you take exception to the form of words used by the captain of course i do renzi did not speak for a space then if your words to the men suitably chosen are thereby made acceptable to you you would feel able to deliver your service peake looked doubtful but answered if they did no violence to my precepts mr renzi then to the specifics renzi produced paper and a pencil in fine to which phrases do you have objection aaaall the hands clear lower deck aaall the hands lay aft in the short time left to them before their ordeal the men of tenacious would bare their heads before their maker to seek a benediction with the officers standing on the poopdeck an improvised lectern at the rail the men assembled on the upper deck below we shall begin with that wellloved hymn awake my heart arise bryant announced the fiddler stepped forward nodded to the fife and both struck up the men sang heartily their fullthroated roar a testimony to the feelings that the simple communal act was bringing the hymn complete the men stood silent and expectant the chaplain stepped up to the lectern glancing nervously at the captain he cleared his throat and took out his notes er at this time you men louder if you please reverend hissed the captain the chaplain looked uncertainly over the mass of faces before him and tried to speak up that is to say as we sail towards the enemy er our mind is drawn to our forebears who in like manner faced the foe houghtons stern frown lessened and he nodded approvingly emboldened peake snatched another look at the paper and continued yea our antecedents of yore indeed we think of them thenthe staunch faith of themistocles indeed the dismay of the euboeans at traitorous eurybiades he peered at the paper once more are we to be as achilles sulking in his tent get on with it muttered houghton the men were becoming restless some threw glances over their shoulders to the dark ships of their adversary while loyal myrmidons do the bidding of others we must always remember that this was the same achilles who had prayed for the destruction of the achaeans and from it we may understand that will do thank you mr peake houghton rasped the chaplain looked grateful and raised a tranquil face heavenward let us pray a spreading rustle moved over the assembly we will pray for gods divine guidance in this matter a barely smothered snort came from the first lieutenant undismayed peake went on calmly as we contemplate the dreadful hurts we are going to inflict on these frenchmen the despoliation of bodies and minds that are the inevitable consequence of modern war mr peake houghtons voice was steely with warning that we must nonetheless visit on their living bodies as they seek to do to our own mr bryant beat to quarters roared houghton there was a moments astonishment then the ship dissolved into frantic movement whipped on by the volleying of drums at the hatchway already at his station on the poopdeck kydd could see it all unfolding in minutes men were standing to their guns manning the fighting tops behind barricades of hammocks or deep in the magazines the boatswains party stood to on deck ready to attend to the many special duties about the ship now the die was solemnly cast each man would stay at his post until the battle was won or lost or he was taken below to suffer agony under the surgeons knife they stood silent and watchful as their petty officers reported to the masters mates who then informed their officers that the men were now at their fighting stations then they stood easy dealing in their individual ways with the fact that they were being borne steadily towards whatever fate was to be theirs sir flag is signalling rawson said his voice unsteady kydd realised that this was not only the midshipmans first big fleet action but probably the first time he would be under hostile fire from a manowar kydd took up his telescope number fortyfive at the main fortysix at the mizzen which is he was trying to keep the youngster occupied during the approach aa the lads face contorted as he tried to get the words out quite right m duty to the captain an flag signals attack enemys van and centre quickly now there would be little time to worry about him when battle had been joined he swung forward and settled his glass on the enemy line on the face of it the french admiral had chosen well anchoring close in with the shore his broadsides facing seawards and the bay was shoalthere was telltale white water and troubled rippling at awkward places however there were no reliable british charts of the area they would have to take their chances on the attack but crucially there was an element the french could not command the wind it could not be more fair for their approach the northnorthwesterly blowing directly down upon the van of the enemy line and towards the rear the english could choose the time and the precise point of their attack once they reached the line however there would be no alternative but to stand yardarm to yardarm and smash out broadsides until there was a conclusion kydd could see that about a third of the french menowar were larger even than the biggest of their own and in the very centre of their line a monster towered above the others mounting from the number of her gunports or more guns the regularity of their positions indicated that they were probably secured to each other with stout cables effectively preventing any attempt at breaking the line in the swiftly setting sun the french force looked awesome and it was now their duty to throw themselves at this wall of guns whatever the cost again a presentiment tightened kydds bowels this day would see a clash at arms of such an immense scale it would test every man to the limit a signal hoist rose rapidly up the flagships mizzen halliards kydd had been waiting for it and hailed the quarterdeck form lineofbattle as convenient it was now the last act rawson hoist battle ensigns it would be the white ensign although a rear admiral of the blue squadron admiral nelson had chosen the white as being more visible in the dark some said it was because he had a personal fondness for the purity of white in the colours as rawson bent to the flag locker kydd added captain wants t see four of em and hoisted high he turned back to the flagship as he watched her own battle ensigns mounted swiftly enormous flags that would leave no doubt whatsoever about her allegiance and not four but six eventually streamed out proudly bull roars of cheering erupted from their men another hoist alter to starboard the english fleet now shaped their course to round the little sandy island but were in no recognisable lineofbattle in their haste to close with the enemy they strung out eagerly zealous and goliath vying with vanguard for the position of honour in the lead others crowding in behind tenacious found herself pressed by culloden which had cast off her prize under tow and was coming up fast while swiftsure and alexander astern but under a full press of sail hastened to join them from where they had been off alexandria one by one the anchored ships answered the challenge colours soared aloft until every ship in the line flaunted the tricolour of france and the first shots of defiance thudded out from the medieval fort at the end of the bay the english ships did not deign to waste powder in reply goliath now led the race with a leadsman in the chains taking continual soundings she rounded the shoals at the point of aboukir island and headed directly across for the first ship of the enemy line closely followed by zealous the anchored fleet opened fire the evening twilight adding a viciousness to the stabbing flashes piercing the towering clouds of gunsmoke kydd could feel the deck shaking from the massed thunder of guns battle had been joined the action that was going to determine the future of the world was beginning kydds pulse raced and he found he was clutching the hilt of his sword how would this night end who would be the victor and would he be alive to see it the english fleet held fire as they approached singlemindedly heading for the van of the line kydd lifted his glass eagerly to witness the first british ship grapple with an enemy it would be goliath she was flying towards the first of the enemy line as if to win a race still with silent guns kydd shifted the telescope quickly to the flagship a final hoist flew engage the enemy more closely he snatched a quick look at rawson the lad was pale but determined and smiled back bravely youll remember this night mr rawson we both will dont y worry of me mr kyddive a duty to do an ill do it he crossed over to the signal log and carefully entered the details kydd resumed his watch on goliath everything depended on staying clear of the rocky shoals that lay unseen all around in the lurid glow of a vast sunset goliath reached the first shipoftheline the enemy ships fire slackened and grew uncertain as the british passed the point of intersection for not only could her guns no longer bear but when goliaths helm went over to cross her bows she could only wait for the ruin and death that must surely follow from only a few yards range a full broadside slammed into the unprotected bow of the hapless french ship thirtytwopound shot smashing and rampaging through the entire length of the vessel in an unrelenting path of destruction through the swirling powdersmoke kydd strained to see goliath wheel about but to his astonishment she continued on her rigging visible beyondon the inside of the line damme whats he about kydd had not seen adams arrivehe had made an excuse to leave his post at the guns below to see the excitement before they in turn were engaged he stands to take the ground and there o course hell be helpless no i think not kydd said holding the image in his eye goliath had passed further along her guns seeking a fresh target while zealous stretched out to reach the same point ye know what i think hes seen the anchor buoythese frenchies are at single anchor and he knows theyve swung to th wind stands t reason they have to leave room to swing an thats where hes going to place his ship it was daring and intelligent and the move was from individual initiative not the result of a signal it deserved to succeed zealous reached the lineagain the erupting billows of gunsmoke in the gathering darkness gunflash illuminated it eerily from within the frenchmans foremast toppled and crashed the british ships helm went over and she likewise ran down the inside slowing after her stern anchor was slipped which brought her to a stop abreast her helpless target to begin a relentless pounding kydds fist thumped the rail as he willed tenacious to join the fight a shout came from behind from one of the signal hands sir culloden shes kydd wheeled round and peered into the twilight next astern culloden lay unmoving stopped dead and at an unnatural angle of heel shes run aground god save em said adams in her hurry to clear aboukir island she had shaved the point too closely cant be helped now theyll miss the sport a signal hoist jerked up cullodens masts then another kydd deciphered them and hurried down to the quarterdeck to houghton sir number fortythreeculloden is aground an warning us and does recall mutine fr assistance houghton stopped pacing the warning is more for swiftsure and alexander i should think he muttered looking at the developing battle ahead then back to the helpless manowar more to the point what possible use to troubridge is mutine a contemptible little brig there is no other bryant said shortly eyes straying to the noise and gunfire of the battle mr bryant we must assist we sir of all the admirals ships which do you think he can most spare we are the smallest the most insignificant of his force but we are a shipoftheline and have the size to be of consequence in assisting bryant spluttered sir they must take their chances we have a duty mr hambly haul us out of the line and bring us to a cables length off culloden mr kydd signal her that we are coming to assist mr bryant you will go in a boat and speak with captain troubridge requesting his orders in respect of any assistance we might be able to give tenacious would thus be denied the glory of the grandest fight in history in order to stand by a stranded ship kydd held his silence as he returned to his station lifting his telescope again he could see the thrilling sight of audacious following zealous as he watched her passing broadside at the luckless enemy sent her mainmast toppling like a felled tree the main body of the english fleet now reached the head of the line theseus and orion followed the others inside as close as kydd could see the firing was onesided the french had not prepared for action on their inshore sides near aboukir island tenacious hove to well clear of the unfortunate culloden her boat pulled for the motionless watched sourly from the ship by frustrated seamen while the battle raged on without them kydd stared helplessly at the great spectacle now the flagship was coming down on the french lineshe however chose the seaward side and the vengeful french gunners smashed out their anger in broadsides undeterred vanguard selected her prey and anchoring by the stern eased to a stop and began her own cannonade others followed their admiral and kydds last sight of the battle before darkness and vast quantities of powdersmoke split by gunflash hid his view was the black shapes of the remainder of the english fleet streaming into action down the french line where tenacious was hove to there were only the sounds overloud in the dark of backed sails slapping and fretful the slop of water against her side and the monotone grumbling of seamen out of the dark kydd heard a hail then confused shouting a telescope was of little use now and he tried to make out the source he saw a glimmer of light from a lanthorn in their boat the rowers laying into their oars like lunatics and the first lieutenant standing ranting urging the boat surged alongside bryant heaved himself up and bounded on to the quarterdeck sir capn troubridge thanks you for your concern but advises we should lose no time in joining the fleet a roar of cheering erupted and without orders seamen clapped on to the braces houghton said calmly we shall pass down their line and the first frenchman unengaged is ours the yards came round and tenacious resumed her charge little could be made out at the distance but as they came closer individual fights resolved illuminated by furious gunfire ships lay together in palls of smoke and it was clear that the first half of the french line was in trouble the inspired action of goliath passing down the inshore side had resulted in it being pitilessly battered from both sides men ready at her guns tenacious finally reached the head of the line the totally dismasted wreck of the first ship lay unresisting under the onslaught of zealous and audacious they reached the third and the easily recognisable form of vanguard her opponent laying to her anchor alongside and also suffering from two english ships at work on the opposite side then the smoke drifted clear and there proud and free above the enemy tricolour flew a large white ensign it brought savage cheers from the men redoubled when the second in line fell silent her colours lowered followed shortly by the hopeless wreck of the first tenacious sailed on but even before she reached the fourth hoarse cheers went up when it could be seen that she too had given up the fight was it victory that night so soon but four ships taken out of the dozen or so left twothirds of the french fleet ahead nelsons plan of concentrating his forces at the head of the line and overwhelming the stationary enemy one by one was a brilliant success so far but with tenacious the last to enter battle there was no more strength left that could be brought to bear on the rest downwind of the head of the line kydd could now smell the battle acrid powdersmoke heated gunmetal and ancient wooddust blasted from old timbers there was also the pungency of damp burned timberfires had been recently extinguished in their path was an english ship lit almost continuously by her guns smashing low into her antagonist whose vicious return fire was in turn causing visible ruin to her timbers but settling in place on her inshore side was another english ship beginning her cannonade from the opposite side the noise was hellish scores of the biggest guns in the fleet contending furiously with even bigger french ones in a ceaseless thunderous drumming ahead at the centre of the line the huge flagship lorient was now in action with two english ships and beyond her another french twodecker was smashing out her broadsides at a smaller ship it could not be long before they themselves must join in the action and kydd had no illusions about their chances they were the smallest vessel in the english fleet and a fraction of the size of the french flagshipor any of the enemy for that matter as they came to pass the three vessels kydd looked down from the poop at tenaciouss little quarterdeck command group suddenly bryant pointed energetically to the french ship her foremast was already down and as her mainmast majestically crashed to the deck in a tangled ruin kydd could see what had excited bryant the massive sides were no longer unmoving she had either cut her cables to escape the terrible punishment or they had been simply shot away and now she was slowly dropping out of the line and leaving an opening houghtons roared orders could be heard clear above the din seamen scrambled up the shrouds to take in sail and forward others rushed to clear away the anchor tenacious slowed waiting as the french vessel slipped away trailing wreckage and the stink of defeat it was a shrewd move instead of lying alongside a heavier enemy to be pounded by bigger guns houghton was taking the opportunity to slip between the stern of one and the bow of the other and while he took position fire with impunity into both the stern anchor went down in a rush the cable slipping away rapidly but the move had been seen by the big ship next down and while her guns could bear they opened up on tenacious kydd stood in the darkness on the exposed poopdeck feeling the slam of unseen shot and debris at this moment he felt more for the old ship than for himself she had endured at camperdown in an earlier age and she was his first ship as an officer so he had a tender feeling for her that made any hurts the more grievous to bear a missile whistled past the eerie sound fading as it passed into the blackness beyond kydd noticed rawson pacing determinedly at his side his youth touchingly apparent the youngster would be a different person before the night was over it was all he could offer but kydd said conversationally to him o course th musketeers aboard the frenchy cant see us in the dark secure the flag lockers if y please sir rawson replied with an effort his face was pale but composed in the flickering light why yes well not be seeing flags again this day now there would be signal lanthorns in the flagships rigging to watch for and all the detail of night signalling to worry about tenacious sailed inside the arc of fire of the enemy whose guns stopped one by one as they approached the bow of their target on her foredeck dark figures were running from the light upperdeck guns the sudden crash and blast from their own guns took kydd by surprise so close their iron balls could not miss and when the smoke cleared the beautifully ornamented bow was scarred and pitted with blotches of ugly blackness then their stern cable told and tenacious slewed heavily round the quarter of the enemy shipoftheline yet again nelsons prescience was confirmed springs on the cable controlled from the capstan meant that the ship as a whole with its lines of guns could be aimed by slackening and tightening on the appropriate spring their guns resumed with a crashing broadside but the enemy replied with venomthey would be made to pay for their boldness the french guns were heaved round by handspike to bear aft as far as possible then opened up on them savagely kydd felt the deep concussion in the pit of his stomach and the heavy balls took tenacious in her hull sending splinters sheeting and skittering about twisting chain shot langridge and other ugly mankilling evil whirled through the night air kydds skin tightened being at idleness in the open was so different from action on a gundeck here he could only sense countless muzzles seeking their target before they exploded into violence below there was furious activity the means and duty to hit back the guns of tenacious smashed out again in an earsplitting crash at such close range the strike of their shot was visible on the enemy side and pieces of wreckage tumbled into the short space of ruddy water between the vessels the stench of powder and ruin was overpowering a shriek from forward ended in a bubbling deathcrythree marines ran to the poop and set up a firing party aiming far up at the mizzen fighting top of the enemy from where the muzzle flash of muskets stabbed downwards again the space between the ships was enveloped in powdersmoke but kydd detected a different pattern beyond the end of the length of their target glided the shadowy bulk of another ship coming into position at her stern before she had anchored her guns on the far side exploded into actionthe powdersmoke alive with gunflash like summer lightning quickly followed by her near side a savage broadside into the french ships stern quarters with four lanthorns in a line at her mizzen peak she had to be an english the swiftsure kydd thought she had slipped into place between their own adversary and the flagship firing at both from each side of guns he tried to make out the mighty manowar just past their opponent and saw that she was now set upon by three english ships in a mindnumbing cannonade the battle was now reaching a peak of ferocity the shattering slam of guns made it difficult to think back along the line their own flagship was impossible to see in the darkness kydd felt the frustration of helplessness stay here im going t the quarterdeck he said suddenly to his men anything was better than the aimless nervous pacing and he had a duty to advise the captain of his inability to sight more than the most elementary signals houghton and the first lieutenant were pacing slowly together in grim conversation followed by several midshipman messengers kydd touched his hat and delivered his report thank you mr kydd houghton acknowledged barely noticing him do you hold yourself in readiness here for the time being kydd joined the master near the helm watching the captains clerk attempting to scribble into a notebook by the light of a feeble lanthorn his duty was to minute events as they happened but kydd wondered how accurate his jottings could be given that they were made in near darkness their author half blinded by the flash of guns and probably petrified with fear a sudden iron crash and ringing tone like a struck anvil sounded forward as an upperdeck gun took a square hit from a round shot there would be carnage as it dismounted and kydd felt pity for the casualties ahead the hulking enemy manowar was showing every sign of fightbut kydds attention was taken by a petty officer running aft and touching his forelock to the captain what is it houghton said sorry sir dont know what t do like kydd stared at him what would take a hardened seaman like that away from his post in battle its like this sir number three larbd ninepounder took a hit an it did fer its crew he hesitated as if to spare the details come on man give your report houghton spat out the petty officer continued in a puzzled voice we goes t see whats t do theres nothin we can do fr two o them an we goes to heave em overside and thenand then the parson he comes outa nowhere an stops us stops you the chaplain what do you mean stops you houghtons anger communicated itself to the seaman who recoiled sir i cant just scrag th chaplainnot the parson sir dammit houghton exploded get that ninny off the decknow sir kydd hurried forward with the petty officer the gun lay shattered and dismounted with a weal of bright steel across its breech a man lay crouched sobbing in pain while another sprawled unmoving and the chaplain wildeyed and trembling with emotion stood over a third why mr peake what is it kydd said it dawned on him that this was probably the first time the chaplain had seen guns fired in war sssir i have difficulty in finding the words thisthis blackguard he stuttered i saw with my own eyes telling his men to take the fallen andand drop them into the sea i cannot believe his contempt for the dead he is blind to humanity hehe does suddenly severed by a shot aloft the entire length of an eightyfoot main topgallant lift slithered down in an unstoppable cascade throwing peake forward into the pinrail kydd picked him up and steadied him mr peake why are you here your duty my duty is to be with my flock wherever theyve been called even to this barbaric struggle andand to do what i can he seemed both pathetic and noble at the same time kydd felt unable to respond harshly mr peakeyour duty is not here on deck or at the guns the chaplain looked at him resentfully you will speak to this man then tell him he is doing his duty mr peake the dead have t be cleared from th fighting space of the living or every sacrifice is in vain kydd took a deep breath they will be remembered sir that y may rely onand by every one o their shipmates as theyd wish it this is the custom o the service sir and may not be put aside he finished firmly ii cannotthat is to say kydd paused there was no lack of fortitude in the man but an edge of madness was lapping at his reason come sir there are those that need ye he said and drew him away he took peake firmly by the arm and led him below past the bedlam of both decks of guns down to the after hatchway and past the sentries to the orlop if ever the parson needed a glimpse of hell thought kydd this was it there was no daylight in the gloomy cavern but lanthorns were sufficient to show such a scene that peake held back at the bottom of the hatchway ladder rigid with horror spreading out from the base of the ladder where they had been brought and left wounded men lay moaning and writhing some were ominously still cries of pain and mortal despair filled the air almost drowning the rumbling of guns run out on the deck above further into the orlop in the space outside the midshipmens berth known as the cockpit a table had been set up on three seachests a smaller spread with the dull gleam of medical instruments a bunch of lanthorns above gave light to this operating table and pybus almost unrecognisable in a bloody apron was directing the surgeons mates and loblolly boys in preparing the next man for his attention kydds gorge rose but he stepped resolutely round the wretches on the deck and pulled peake to pybus the doctor looked at them briefly youll wait your turn with the others he snapped turning his back kydd was shocked at the change in their dryhumoured surgeonhis blackrimmed eyes were sunken but there was an iron control and ferocious purpose get out of my way he snapped crossly a seaman was lifted on to the table his lower leg a grisly tatter of blood and bone fragments below a kerchief tourniquet the man was white with pain his eyes rolled as he understood where he was being laid but the loblolly crew took his arms and legs and spreadeagled him with ropes to four stanchions kydd and peake were mesmerised the seamans bloody trousers were cut away quickly the sudden touch of the surgeons mate making him flinch with dread a leather pad dark with stains was put into his mouth and as pybus approached the mans piteous eyes fixed on his following his every move his body was rigid with terror hold still and ill not make a mistake pybus said levelly and closed in for the job unable to look away kydd saw pybus take his bloody knife and thrust it up between the mans thighs it did not hesitate in a whirl of movement the knife sliced in a single practised stroke clear round the entire leg a mindfreezing howl came from the wretch on the table who writhed hopelessly against his tethers but without delay pybus took his sawmuch like a butchersand applied himself to the bone while the man fought and shrieked into the leather in his teeth the harsh grating of the saw continued until the pitiable remnant of leg separated and fell with a meaty thud it was retrieved and dropped into a tub pybus took his needle and standing astride the stump swiftly sutured across a flap of skin left for the purpose then stood aside to let his mates treat it with spirits of turpentine the whole procedure incredibly was over in less than two minutes he mopped his forehead then said thickly to kydd as he wiped down his blade what are you here for then ah doctor i have here mr peake who desires t be of some use he felt faint but carried on er if ye could indicate to him any who might have need o some er comfort of religion why please t inform him for a space pybus regarded them both his expression unreadable you might see to him he said pointing to a quiet figure pulled to a sitting position against the ships side hes ruptured his femoralno hope hes only minutes left oh and that powder monkey his face burned so and calling for his mother kydd made quickly for the hatchway the chaplain would find employment enough now for a moment the cocoon of belief in his own invulnerability slipped and terror seized him at the thought of his own maiming and subsequent descent into the orlop but that way led to nightmares and cowardice and he crushed the images deliberately he shifted his thoughts to renzi and paused at the top of the ladder to the gundeck to catch a glimpse of his friend there it was a different kind of hell men worked their guns by only the dim light of battle lanthorns in the stinking thunderous gloom amid thick swirling powdersmoke consumed with a wild thirst from the acrid fumes they were unable to see their antagonist in the outer darkness but for the deadly flash of their cannon muzzles this was brutal killing work serving the iron beasts like slavesknowing that whichever was the first to falter would lose the battle gun captains drove on their men with hoarse cries and curses locked for ever in the ceaseless rhythm of swabbing out hot muzzles loading and running out a manic imperative that pushed men on and on to heroic feats of strength and endurance it was impossible to see across the deck and he feared for his friend then renzi his uniform stained grey appeared from a gusting swirl of smoke calm and pacing slowly with a halfsmile that stayed in place kydds joy and relief at seeing him metamorphosed a cheery wave into a grave doffing of his hat which was equally solemnly returned kydd bounded up the ladder and out on to the familiar dark chaos of the open quarterdeck he looked about for the pacing figures of the captain and other officers but when he located them they were motionless all their attention in one direction beyond the stern of their adversary and across a short stretch of sea the enemys mighty flagship was afire chapter fire seamen could brave gales to go aloft or stand fearless against the deadliest cannonade but the elemental terror of fire aboard ship could turn the hardest man to craven panic and kydd had a personal dread of it in the caribbean in seaflower he had seen a ship ablaze they had tried to claw against the wind to save the sailors but helpless had been forced to watch their enda choice of being burned alive or throwing themselves into the water to sharks in a feeding frenzy seems t be aft around the mizzen chains the poop kydd forced his voice steady as he trained his signal telescope on the intermittent flaring on the big ships afterend where her signal crew would be gathered his imagination supplied the details there would be frantic scrambling to extinguish the flames before they took hold firebuckets dashed at them by men held with feral dread as if charged by a wild bull sailors would be taken from the guns from beloweveryone who could be spared would be put to work for a bucket chain before the engine and hose were brought into play mr pringle houghton wheeled on the captain of marines take six of your best men to the foredeck they are to kill any man aboard the frenchman who attempts to douse the flames am i understood yes sirclear the deck of any enemy approaching the fire kydd froze with horrorbut he understood if the huge enemy ship was destroyed by fire it was as satisfactory as if she had been reduced by hours of bombardment it was unlikely that the french would abandon their proud flagship to the flames while it was possible to save her soon there would be so much death and pain men who would find it in themselves to defy the bullets for the sake of their ship and be struck down others who would know the bitter taste of selfloathing when they discovered they could not the conflagration lessened and wavered then returned as their murderous fusillade achieved its object shots came too from swiftsure unchecked the flames mounted licking dangerously along the edge of the driver boom little wisps flickering upward and along it would not be long before the fire took strong hold and then there would be no turning backtimbered and with tarred rigging the manowar would become an inferno kydd watched as one figure black against the light of the blaze raced along with a bucket then was cut down the figure toppled into the flames where it thrashed for a little then was still more figures darted and fell and kydd tore his eyes away a terrible sight sir he said to houghton who was watching with bryant houghton cast him a curious look even if they are frenchies kydd finished lamely the blaze was spreading about the poop and its light now tinged the faces of the officers in tenacious as they stared at the awful sight they resumed pacing there was no need to make the job of any vengeful french sharpshooter the easier the master pulled out a large kerchief and wiped his forehead does strike me sir that such a monster must have a mort o powder aboard the blaze reaches the grand magazine why it would put a volcano to shame there is that of course mr hambly do you wish me to allow them to extinguish the fire a grim smile belied houghtons words yet a reasonable course for her captain would be to strike now to save lifebut i doubt he will do that then sir do you not feel it prudent t shift berth if she explodes it will put every ship to hazard bryant came in houghton took three paces more before replying consider mr bryant our people have been fighting for long this night theyre exhausted and cant in all mercy be expected to stand at a capstan but should we cut our cable in the darkness we cannot easily range another through the sternport and therefore we lose our advantage and in any event i am obliged to point out that while our immediate opponent remains at her anchor so must we aye aye sir as always in the sea service duty would stand well before consideration of personal safety but the fearful logic of war dictated that the enemy could not be allowed to save themselves or their ship the end therefore would probably be cataclysmic the pitch darkness was now rolling back with the light of the burning ship as the blaze strengthened and leaped the entire bay was illuminated and kydd imagined a fearfully fascinated audience of thousands watching from the lines of shipsand they themselves were at its very centre the massive threedecker the next after their own adversary houghton turned to kydd i want to know the moment she shows any sign of yielding but even with her after deck uncontrollably on fire her lower guns continued to crash out against her tormentors there would be no easy end for this proud ship pass the word for the boatswain and gunner mr bryant i rather fear that we must remain for the final act i would have you prepare tenacious there could be no more dangerous situation a burning powder keg of gigantic dimensions about to explode near to them cease firing secure the magazines on the upper deck men glanced fearfully across at the flaring torch that was the enemys after deck then cleared their own of cartridges and all combustibles the boatswain sent men aloft with lines firebuckets were hauled up and emptied over the sails furled along the tops of the yards the decks sluiced ill have a sentry on the cable if you please mr pringle there would be some who might be tempted to cut the cable and run if they did it would only send them blundering downwind straight into the deadly blaze flames had now run along lorients deck and were reaching up into the masts and rigging in a crackling flare that cast the scene in a ruddy orange kydd felt a creeping awe at the approaching moment of doom houghton turned to them all gentlemen i do believe we should now consult our situation we shall run in the guns and secure the gunports so too the hatches must be battened but i believe we must take our chances under the halfdeck carrying dripping swabs and leather buckets of water men took their last look at the blazing ship as they went below then the gratings over the hatches were covered with the thick tarpaulin more usually to be seen in stormy weather and secured with battens hammered into cleats kydd reflected on the hell below in the stinking closeness each thinking that the very next instant could bring the titanic explosion that would crush them to oblivion or capsize the ship and drown them all god damme but this business sticks in my throat bryant growled kydd saw that men from the ship were now beginning to jump from her decks into the sea and worm from the gunports to drop into the water yet still her guns fired her colours flew it was madness an insane defiance against the inevitable but from a sense of glory honour houghton watched with grim concentration then he turned abruptly to bryant we cannot stand by and see those brave fellows drown is the launch still at the boom it is sir but then take it mr kydd do what you can before the end aye aye sir his mind raced crowding with images of the caribbean inferno his dread of fire threatening to unhinge him he took a long deep breath then made his way to the bulwarks for protection the launch and cutter had been placed on the unengaged sheltered side of the ship the launch was their biggest boat but it seemed so frail a bark to approach such a maelstrom of fire he pulled back and sought out rawson go below get a petty officer an six dont tell em why rawson returned with poulden and six hands who gaped in awe at the burning ship the capn wants us t see if we can save some o the frenchies yonder kydd said forcing a tremor from his voice one of the seamen spoke up aye well theyre sailors an all arent they mates others rumbled a cautious agreement held by the grim spectacle then into th boat lads kydd ordered you too mr rawson he added alongside the dark bulk of tenacious the boat seemed no refuge and kydd fought down a rising panic heading where to sir said rawson quietly the frenchy if y please any swimmers would be fanning out in all directions and would be lost in the dark the only real chance for saving more than one or two would be to stand off the burning flagship they left the shelter of the side of their ship and came into full view of the blaze which now bathed the whole bay in firelight as bright as day when it became apparent where they were heading one of the seamen looked behind him and cried out be jasusshes goin ter blow shut y trap poulden growled instantly she goes we all go another seaman said fearfully and the boats speed fell off be damned t your infernal shyness rawson said in a most creditable rasp see swiftsure shes damn near alongside and not afeared the english was within half a pistol shot of the flaming ship off her bow from where she had been slamming in her broadsides and there was no indication that she was about to pull away it was puzzling why she was so close yet was making no moves to save herself kydd shook his head the grandeur and horror were having an effect on his senses he roused himself see there y swabs theres other boats out an theyre not hanging back do ye want t shame tenacious in front o them a cry rang out from the bowman who was pointing to a shadowy blob in the fiery path on the water go kydd snapped at rawson who obediently put the tiller over they came up to the dark shape oars the bowman leaned over and grappled bear us a fist ralph he called the two tugged and suddenly there was a weak stream of words followed by retching anyone speaks french kydd demanded he turned to poulden get him down in th boat search him and if hes trouble throw him back give way the boat continued heading towards the appalling tower of flame alive and magnificent but touching every primordial nerve in kydds body they were close enough now to hear the fierce roar of the flames against it the battlefield sounds were a dull background another survivor shrieked as he was pulled aboard sounds of his agony continued then stopped suddenly clambering back poulden reported quietly sorry sir e was all burned like over th side kydd said without hesitation he watched as others were pulled in but it was becoming unreal the martial thunder of guns and battle overlaid with closer sounds of humanity in distress yet all in terrified thrall to a cataclysm that could happen before he drew his next breath they heard a tiny cry in the night and a ships boy was heaved in over the sternsheets he was shivering hysterically and scrabbled for the bottom of the boat whimpering leave him alone kydd growled the ship was now afire from stem to stern a towering conflagration of horror that had to be visible as far as alexandria itself cannon still fired from her lowest line of guns it was bravery at an insane level in conditions that could not be imagined kydds boat continued on two men were found roped together one probably could not swim they floated away both dead another levering himself up the gunwale heard english being spoken and with his last gasp cursed the uncomprehending seamen and slipped to his death still more cries came from the darkness thenfaster than thoughta searing white flash leaped over kydds entire vision with a suffocating slam of superheated air in a trancelike state kydd tried to make sense of the disorder and the fact that he was still alive his sight cleared at the same time as a wave violently rocked the boat sending them all into a tangled heap water flooded over the gunwale the boat righted and all eyes turned to the conflagration an immense fiery column climbed skywards and at its base there was just foam and vapour the flagship and a thousand men had vanished slowly other features in his landscape became perceptible there was swiftsureso close and yet untouched in a flash of insight kydd realised the reason they themselves were not destroyed the force of the explosion had been vast but it was nearly all vented upwards in an inverted cone and therefore the safest place in fact was close to the ship rawsons bloodless face turned to kydd mouthing silent words at the sheer wonder of their survival others uncurled from foetal positions some made halfhearted efforts to retrieve oars several bent to find the bailer and start sheeting out the water that half filled the boat kydd turned to the task in hand but as he tried to shake off his disorientation he saw a silent splash rear up to seawardand an icy fear gripped him the mighty explosion had blasted skywards perhaps thousands of feet now the pieces of an entire battleship were falling slowly back to earth there were more splashes near and farand an enormous one that ended with a jagged spar spearing back up from the depths others trailed tangles of rigging and plunged spectacularly with an increasing rain of smaller fragments still trailing wisps of flame then came a gasp of pain and the flurry of beating hands kydd tore off his coat and shared it with the nearer men rawson threw his to the men forward they cowered under their pitiful shelter feeling the strike of particles and larger burning fragments flinching at the thought of a giant missile coming down on them kydds skin crawled as he imagined the four tons of a cannon a thousand feet above hurtling down on their little boat the pattering and splashing all around seemed to go on for an agebut no great piece came near it was only when the lethal rain had petered out that kydd could accept reality the blast cone had projected most of the wreckage well beyond them he waited a little longer then ventured out from under the coat staring around wildly where there had been a fiery column before a sullen towering of black smoke shot through with sparks now hung a desolate stink of cinders and ruin lay pungent on the air an eerie stillness reigned over the battle scene an awed recognition perhaps of the catastrophic event so much greater than any local affray guns fallen silent in respect at the sudden removal from the earth of the greatest object of before then accentuating the unreality of the scene the calm silver of a rising moon settled softly over the still ships in the launch not a word was spoken as each man came to terms with what he had experienced kydd drew on his coat again and pulled himself together there may still be those in the water god forbid out oarscome on lads lets be havin ye theres sailors out there lookin t be saved it was going to be a long night kydd tossed and turned sleep was hardhis mind reeled with stark impressions of fiery grandeur horribly burned bodies shattered wreckage they had returned only a couple of hours before dawn to a ship whose company was dropping with exhaustion men were asleep at their guns and place of duty after six hours hard fighting they were now at the extremity of weariness he became aware of someone close by it was rawson sir m apologies for waking you but its dawn an admiral nelson is signalling kydd raised himself on an elbow and tried to focus his thoughts oh er well ill be up presently rawson turned to go but kydd added quietly an thank you mr rawson the youngster had known that dawn would allow signals to be seen and although he was as exhausted as kydd he had made it his duty to be up on the poopdeck ready with tenaciouss answering pennant going wearily up the ladders kydd was aware of his tiredness his feet plodded forward his mind in a daze and he had to take several seconds to orient himself when he reached the signals post number fiftyfive with our pennants sir kydd fumbled in his little signals book that is t say assist ships in battle sir rawson said gently his eyes hollow ive acknowledged sir he had had no right to do so but kydd was grateful the captain ive sent word sir a brief spark of youthful high spirits showed as rawson confided an would you credit they had t bang a pot to wake him more respect to yr betters younker kydd answered but suppressed a grin by long custom of the sea a seaman could be shaken awake but never an officerthat might be construed as laying hands on a superior a capital offence the men must have been hard put to think of a way to rouse their captain kydd went down to the quarterdeck to await houghton prudently using his signal telescope to spy out the morning situation despite his weariness he was awestruck at the scene of devastation and ruin the entire enemy van ship after ship in a line had hauled down their colours their opponents were still at anchor opposite them in the same position from where they had thundered out their broadsides but there was an interval of more than half a mile from where the flagship had been the remainder of the line had abandoned their places downwind of the inferno to edge away to the south they were now in an untidy gaggle well into the bay two looked as if they had run aground during the night three or four others were still in a fitful exchange of gunfire with two english s good morning sir houghton was dishevelled and lacked a shoe but his coming on deck was sufficient to bring order to the desultory scenes of ruin and weariness thank you mr kydd what is the state of the action at this time his voice was hoarse and abrupt bryant appeared from forward and houghton turned to him we shall assist as ordered i mean to weigh and proceed this hour sir every man possible at the capstan stand fast the topmen we shall muster at quarters as we sail for the enemy kydd could not shake off his daze of tiredness not even the sight of the undamaged enemy they had yet to fight outnumbering the few english ships in any condition to confront them was sufficient to raise an emotion they fell before the wind and sailed south directly towards the thunder of guns it seemed so cruel so unfair the fight appeared to intensify as they approached ahead were but two english ships and a quick count of the enemy gave nine sail of force waiting theseus was passing abeam under a full press of sail but when kydd searched astern there were no other english ships on their way to join them the four of them would face the french alone like a band of fighters squaring up to another gang the four english formed up together and faced their opponents anchoring in a line and the firing began almost immediately their main opponents were the three gun battleships and a opposite more than a match for them all but in addition there were five ships inshorethree frigates and the two shipsoftheline that had grounded kydd paced at his station his function had little meaning in a subbattle with no designated commander but he would remain at his post until called upon it would be renzi and adams on the gundecks below who would be the hardest workedthey must be calling on all they could think of to keep their exhausted men toiling at their guns but if it was not enough rawson paced beside kydd hands firmly crossed behind his back a vicious whir above ended in the twang of parted ropes the french were firing high with chainshot to try to bring down the rigging and disable them debris tumbled and kydd could feel solid hits thudding into the hull of tenacious once or twice there was the wind of passing round shot but no deadly musket fire at these longer ranges their guns crashed out at the two battleships around but the winds were backing westerly and the gunsmoke swirled up and around them in choking clouds bowden emerged from the hatchway to the gundeck blinking in the sunlight he was grey with fatigue but held himself with dignity as he reported to houghton then turned away to return with his orders at that moment a round shot slammed across the deck and bowden was flung down in an untidy sprawl he did not move kydds fuddled brain struggled to take in the significance of the lifeless figure seamen from a nearby gun crew rushed to him but with a tearing cry rawson ran forward knocked them aside and lifted bowdens body the head lolled back revealing a livid wound that oozed scarlet he lives rawson croaked recovering kydd stepped forward get him t the doctor he told the seamen there was a chance that pybus could stem the tide of death in the young manpresuming that the doctor himself had not succumbed to exhaustion at least he could tell the lads uncle in all sincerity of his complete devotion to duty kydd made no move to stop rawson going below with bowden as juvenile rivalries were now swept away in the horrors of war the firing intensified for a period then slackened two of the french gun ships veered cable and eased round further away from the english line this exposed the two grounded ships to heavy fire the closest lost her foretopmast but before it had finally settled over her bow in a snarl of rigging her colours jerked down the situation was changing fast another english ship arrived and anchored next to a frigate which loosed her broadside then struck her colours kydds fog of weariness began to lift the focus of gunfire now shifted to the four remaining ships of the original french line but kydds attention to these was cut short when houghton sent for him mr kydd do you take possession of the french seventyfour to take possession it was every officers dream to board a vanquished enemy and this day thomas kydd would do so it was incredible wonderful all trace of fatigue left him aye aye sir he stammered he had no doubt however of why he had been chosen he could be spared in the continuing conflictothers would continue the fight carry on mr kydd houghton gave a dry smile and turned away kydds heart rose with pride but the formalities must be observed his mind scrambled to recall the procedures as he told a messenger pass the word for mr rawson the midshipman appeared his features drawn how does mr bowden do kydd asked hes nearmissed by a ball mr pybus says he is tolerably sanguine for his life but hes sore concussed an will need care which can be arranged id wager kydd said but now we go t take possession of the frenchy yonder he added briskly it had the desired effect the resilience of youth ensured that a smile appeared on the midshipmans face beg mr pringle for a halfdozen marines and ask the first lieutenant for a boats crew there were things to rememberhe had heard of the embarrassment of one lieutenant who had arrived triumphantly aboard a conquered ship but had omitted to bring along a flag to hoist over that of the enemy and he had no french to deal with their captives but that could be remedied well have petty officer gurnard in the boat this man he knew came from jersey in the channel islands and would have the french like a native he wished he could shift from his greystained uniform to something more presentable but all his possessions were struck below in the hold his cocked hat was passed into the boat where the crew and marines waited then kydd swung over the bulwarks and down the side they pulled steadily towards the motionless french shipoftheline and as they did so the men began to cheer and whoop the second vessel aground had lowered her colours silence in the boat growled kydd he would see to it that the surrender was seemly and in accordance with the strict and ancient customs of the royal navy as they rounded the stern they saw below the shattered windows and trailing ropes the vessels name heureux means happy sir the nuggety channel islander offered thank you gurnard kydd replied thinking it an odd name for a shipoftheline we shall find a better when shes ours you may depend upon it the bowman hooked on at the side steps ignoring stony looks from the french seamen above kydd addressed himself to the task of going up the side it would be disastrous if he lost his footing or stumbled he jammed on his hat firmly and keeping his sword scabbard from between his legs he heaved himself up the noisy jabbering lessened as kydd stepped aboard a knot of officers stood before him their eyes hostile around them were scores of seamen staring and resentful others were coming up from below filling the decks an older officer with the gold of authority removed his hat and gave a short stiff bow kydd returned it removing his own hat je suis jean etienne le capitaine de vaisseau national de france heureux his voice was hoarse ltenant thomas kydd of his britannic majestys ship tenacious bows were exchanged again as gurnard translated the captains eyes never leaving kydds pour ihonneur de la patrie gurnard spoke quickly to keep up it seemed that only in the face of so patently an overwhelming force and the unfortunate absence of their great commander had they been brought to this pass he seems t be much concerned sir that you er recognise the heroic defence of their vessel he says sir t avoid further um effusion o blood it were better they acknowledge their present situation par consequent a bas le pavilion je rends le vaisseau an therefore he must strike his colours and give up the vessel a hush fell over the upper deck as the word rippled out kydd returned the intense look gravely i sympathise with captain etiennes position an can only admire the courage he an his ships company have shown he searched for more words but it was difficult to suppress the leaping exultation that filled his thoughts he tried to think of what it must be like to yield up ones ship and i do hope sir that th fortune of war sees you soon returned t a fitting place of honour the captain inclined his head and stepped forward his eyes released kydds as he unhooked his sword and scabbard from its belt fastening there was a pause for just a heartbeat then etienne held out the lengthy curved and tasselled weapon in both hands it was kydds decision if there had been a truly heroic defence he had an option to return the sword in this instance he thought not with a civil bow he accepted the sword and handed it smoothly to rawson etienne made a courtly bow then straightened it was impossible to discern any emotion in his expression thank you captain i accept th sword of a gentleman in token of the capitulation o this vessel something like a sigh went up from the watching company as gurnard spoke the words of finality and closure kydd paused and looked about this was a memory that would stay with him all his days he turned to a seaman hoist our colours above th french at the mizzen peak halliards if y please facing etienne he said directly if youd be good enough to leave the magazine keys with me sir there was no compromise in his tone any madman with a taste for glorious suicide could put them all in mortal peril etienne muttered briefly to another officer who left and returned with a bunch of keys which he handed to kydd who gave them to the sergeant of marines now sir you are free t go about your business until i receive my further orders good day to you sir kydds role was over the marines had secured the magazines the french sailors were dispersing below to whatever consolations remained until they were taken in charge but while he waited to be relieved from tenacious kydd declined out of respect for the feelings of the officers to enter the cabin spaces and wardroom and remained on deck absently his steps led him up to the poopdeck to heureuxs signal position under the two big flags that floated overhead he sighed deeply the bay of aboukir in the glittering purity of early morning had all the desolation and grandeur of a dying battlefield every manowar in the french line stretching away to the north lay in the stillness of surrender ship after ship some broken mastless wrecks one lying inshore with only her upperworks above water and closer a frigate still afire resistance in the south was nearly at an end the last two ships of the french line had cut their cables and were now fleeing with two frigatesbut nelson was signalling urging swiftsure and the others in chase only two enemy were left one was drifting helplessly on the shoals and the other was no more than a defiant wreck that must shortly be silenced by the english ships coming down in reinforcement kydd shook his head in silent admiration it was a victory on such a scale as never before in historynot merely the winning but the complete annihilation victory was not strong enough a word to describe what lay before him chapter glory be its incredible breathed rawson gripped by the glittering expanse of the bay of naples covered with hundreds of boats whose joyous passengers shouted and waved wildly they had come to see nelson hero of the nile grand conqueror of the dreaded french with their dreams of empire terminator of the ambitions of the greatest general of the age be sure an youll not see the like o this again kydd responded equally awestruck as they drew closer he saw the seafront coast roads quayside and the ramparts of castles all black with massed sightseers sounds of music and the martial thumping of drums came towards them from three flagbedecked barges rowed abreast in which musicians enthusiastically beat out rule britannia and god save the king a ceremonial felucca forged into the lead her foredeck packed with an angelic choir in laurel leaves not to be outdone the noble barges in the colours of the kingdom of the two sicilies and great britain pulled strongly seawards towards the battleworn menowar kydd glanced astern rear admiral nelson was standing on the quarterdeck of his flagship vanguard was under tow by tenacious the foremast that had been repaired after the storm off toulon and seen her through the long battle had not survived the squally weather they had encountered within sight of stromboli kydd snatched a quick look through his telescope over his goldlaced frockcoat the admiral wore a red sash with the resplendent star of the bath over his breast spangles of light came from his gold and silver medals unmistakable with his empty sleeve pinned up he stood grave and unmoving in the centre of the quarterdeck from which he had fought his great battle nelson had retained only two of his squadron culloden and alexanderthe rest had been dispatched to gibraltar and tasks about the mediterranean he had employed tenacious to assist his battered ship back to naples the only friendly port in a friendless sea more boats arrived and the bay filled with noise colour and excitement one vessel in particular caught kydds eye a rich and stately barge with an imperious female figure in white gossamer gesticulating hysterically in its prow he saw at the ensign staff that this was an english official craft of high status probably the ambassador before he could confirm it rawson exclaimed flag sirshe signals it was cast off the tow tenacious would round to and wait for vanguard with her reduced sail to overtake and precede her into harbour the press of boats advanced and one by one the upperdeck guns of vanguard began to thudtwentyone for the king tenacious followed gun for gun her brave show of flags streaming out in the smoke the ambassadorial barge at last reached the flagship which backed topsails while a small party was helped up the side a large union flag broke at the mizzen and vanguard moved ahead slowly to her anchorage even before she had swung to her anchor she was surrounded by clamouring watercraft guns banged and thudded from the towered castles ashore as salutes were exchanged and shrieks of feminine delight greeted the thunder of the flagships guns which had last spoken at the nile the tide of boats enveloped tenacious as well nobles and wives courtiers and mistresses all had come to see the famed warriors of the sea renzis italian was much in demand as the flower of neapolitan society was escorted aboard and given a tour of one of nelsons famed menowar a richly ornamented royal barge put off from the shore quickly lad kydd told rawson rouse out yr naples standard an as many ensigns as y can find hoist em for breaking at fore main n mizzen the navy had a way of invisibly hoisting a flag and setting it afly at exactly the right time by folding the bunting tightly and passing a hitch round it at the signal a sharp tug on the halliard would burst it open to float proudly on the wind the royal barge headed directly for the flagship and curious eyes made out the long figure of the king in black velvet and gold lace as he joined the ambassador on the quarterdeck of nelsons ship then went below an hour later the king returned on deck to resume his ceremonial barge for his return admiral nelson prominently at his side gentlemen houghton called for attention holding a paper tonight every officer of the fleet shall be a guest at a grand official banquet in our honour i desire each of you to exert every effort in your appearance in the evening twilight boats of the fleet made their way inshore as each pinnace touched at the quayside it was met with surging crowds and strident huzzahs of bravissimo nelson il vincitore di abukir the officers stepped ashore in a cloud of flapping birds released by fishermen opentop carriages whisked them away through noisy ecstatic crowds into the maze of streets behind the massive fortress that dominated the foreshore and after a short journey they arrived in the courtyard of a dark stone romanesque building they were handed down by liveried footmen and conducted into a reception room entirely in red and gold with extravagantly ornate chandeliers for kydd the simple blue white and gold of the naval officers stood out clean and noble against such overpowering opulence a receiving line was in progress at the opposite end of the room officers conversed selfconsciously as they waited their turn while servants bore round flutes of iced champagne it all had a giddying impact on kydds senses he glanced at renzi who winked you have met general acton a nearby equerry asked ltenant kydd hms tenacious an i have yet t make his excellencys acquaintance kydd replied remembering what he had been told acton was the englishborn prime minister of naples known afar as a master diplomatist the room filled with more blue and gold the champagne came round again and kydd found himself being politely addressed by the general who was arrayed in a handsome embroidered uniform complete with a sash at the waist kydd had taken the precaution of having renzi move through the line before him so his civil inclination of the head and his polite notice of the austere woman at the generals side was a model of urbanity others arrived one italianate officer improbably in black leather buskins had a large scimitar hanging from a broad belt his moustache working with the effort of conveying his emotions at the magnificent victory a short peal of trumpets in the next room summoned all to dinner kydd knew his duty and as a junior officer obediently entered the banquet hall among the first and was ushered to a table far from the place of honour awaiting its hero a small ensemble in sordina delicately picked its way through rule britannia while the purple and gold banquet hall filled with sea officers trying hard to appear unaffected by the magnificence boyd third o the alexander the cherubic officer on kydds right introduced himself kydd fifth o tenacious an proud t take the hand of any out o the ship i saw so handsomely take th admiral under tow in that blow off corsica boyd broke into a grin which widened when the officer opposite kydd leaned over to offer his hand as well aye that was clean done indeed he rumbled his older face creased with memory you should really have been there to see our nel in a passion shaking his fist at alexander for disobedience in not casting off the tow ohhayward of vanguard he added a lieutenant from the flagship attracted interest immediately but hayward deflected it by addressing kydd tenaciouswas it not an impudence for a sixtyfour to lay herself alongside an eighty and have at her kydd chuckled we saw our chance when one o the french fell out o the line it gave us a berth off the stern o franklin an we didnt waste our powder the conversations died as the orchestra trailed off into silence and all eyes turned to the doorway then it burst into a rapturous see the conquering hero comes as general acton appeared with nelson who looked frail and tired but was clearly enjoying the occasion they processed up the room together each table rising to clap and huzzah the commander as he passed at the high table nelson stood in his place for a moment looking out over his officers who had achieved so much in his name then bowed low to left and right a storm of cheering erupted that continued long after he had taken his seat excited conversation resumed while soup appeared in goldrimmed bowls kydd was now experienced enough at formal dinners not to expect it to be hot damme but this is a night to remember said boyd dipping his spoon with gusto cant say however as id know any of em up there with his nibs he added nodding at the high table which seemed to be populated mainly with mediterraneanlooking notables its a puzzler t me kydd said why the kings not here as well t welcome the admiral why its not such a mystery renzi said calmly helping himself to a sweetbread sautie the others not knowing renzi raised their eyebrows our noble host is the prime minister no less of the kingdom of the two sicilies a certain john actonwho also happens to be an englishman employed in that post the king dare not show his approbation of our late action in too formal a manner with the french at his borders and a treaty in placebut he cannot of course prevent a display of natural feelings at such a victory from an english national do ye think well meet the king nicholas kydd asked i dobut in another place i believe and the ambassador you would say he is diplomatically absent from a private party will you not hayward said half defensively indeed that would serve to avoid adding moment to the occasion hayward leaned back you seem unusually well informed for a sea officer renzi i was at naples onon another occasion sir i had reason then to be grateful to the ambassador for his politeness in the matter of accommodation a charming host of another age a learned gentleman whose shining qualities and lucid brain mark him out far above the common run he had the tables attention so continued he has served in post since sixtyfour and there is not overmuch he does not know about the character of your neapolitan a sprightly man if i might remark it he is accounted the best dancer in the palace and is greatly esteemed by the royal family thereby being of inestimable value to the cause of great britain but hes of an age i gather boyd mumbled through his haunch of lamb perhaps but he has married a young wife who keeps him in spirits her entertainments are legendary you may believe thirtyfive years his younger but they are devoted whats his name demanded kydd his name sir william hamiltonhis wife emma the attention of the officers returned to the food be sure to accord that dish the homage it deserves said renzi to boyd who had begun to address a creamy rice platter with tiny white shavings arranged neatly on top those are the immortal white truffles of alba and will amply reward your delicacy in the tasting the courses came and went the din of conversation increased with the flow of wine and the need to try to put aside the stark imagery of recent times you know we missed by a whisker bringing the french to battle while they were still at sea said hayward reflectively that day when we couldnt find em near malta and thought theyd gone to the westward it seems that those frigates we chased off were scouts ahead of their main fleetwhile we were hove to in our councilofwar they crossed our wake there were wry grins but several officers stared at the tablecloth and others had furrowed brows boyd broke the spell er kydd were you not out in a boat at the nile the images rushed in aye i was but it was impossible to find the words to describe the events of that night and he ended muttering at his plate ill tell you a singular thing said a neatfeatured man to the right innes swiftsure after the frenchy blew itself to kingdom come ben hallowell our owner thought to fish out of the sea a good stout length o the frenchys mainmast then has the audacity to get chips to make it up into a coffin which he then presents to his admiral and well received it was by all accounts it was indeed hayward agreed keeps it by him in his seacabin how singular murmured renzi but th hero of our age kydd said vigorously glancing up to the table where the admiral held court among his noble admirers he turned to hayward our nelive heard such catblash about his character is it true how do you hayward stroked his chin a man of strong views and stronger convictions and only two words will serve with him duty and honour woe betide any officer who forgets himself in this particularhes as merciless as jove yet the men love him and he feels his captains are as shakespeare has it in henry v a band of brothers when hes to hand you believe that nothing can fail but this is not to say he ignores the lower ordersive seen him climb the mizzen shrouds to show a green midshipman the way and youll all have seen his order book filled the half over with instructions for the wellbeing of the lower deck innes turned to hayward and asked has he married yes but ive never met the lady ive heard he took her as a widow in the caribbean no children laughter gusted and swelled around them and the mood changed renzi if youve been here before pray tell us the essence of the place innes said abstracting the largest piece of roast hare ahnaples the seat of the kingdom of the two sicilies ruled by ferdinand the fourth lately in treaty of amity with the french the queen is sister to marie antoinette and has her views on the character of the french nation the court has been termed grotesque and cruel although the people adore their king belay all that if y please kydd interrupted pleasantly should we want t step ashore what diversions cn we expect naples that goethe considers the third city of the world a tolerable number of diverting entertainmentswe have vesuvius which swallowed the roman pompeii an inordinate number of churches arts and cultures kydd smiled ruefully at the others but in all this we have to remember that there are jacobin spies on every corner those who would slit a throat for two piastres and ladies who must be accounted the most rapacious of their species and shameless renzi finished a sudden roar of acclamation went up from the table next to them as the officers lurched to their feet to raise their glasses to nelson who moved on and stood quite near kydd wine with you gentlemen he said handing over his glass for refreshing our late victory owes all to my gallant band of officers whose conduct was in the highest traditions of our service to the health of his majesty damnation to th french sir warm with wine kydds elation was rising success attend ye alwaysan in a bumper nelson gave a short bow and looked at him quizzically kydd had an impression of a deeply incised face haggard with fatigue a slight almost delicate body flintlike gaze and febrile energy kydd is it not aft through the hawse and now an ornament to his profession speechless with pleasure kydd bowed awkwardly ththank you sir he stammered officers scrambled to set their glasses abrim to you sir horatio and old englands glory tenacious would have to wait her turn for repair at the castellammare dockyard a dozen miles across the wide bay in the meantime there seemed no reason why the delights of the city should not be sampled see naples and die renzi murmured as the two friends stepped ashore from the time of their adventures in venice kydd had known that renzi had been on the grand tour expected of the gentility and had visited many cities in europe he knew little more other than that he had been accompanied by a dissolute companion who had extended his education into areas renzi refused to speak of yet at the same time had also kindled in him a deep love of learning how fine t play the hero kydd said as they strode together down the broad seafront road on every side passersby waved and cheered while women threw flowers over them a neapolitan officer stopped before them and bowed elegantly rising with an elaborate gesture of welcome why thank ye sir kydd said happily seeing the pleased surprise on the officers face at renzis gracious reply beggars hobbled towards them and small boys ran up chanting kydd made to find a coin but renzi pulled him on these are the lazzaroniif you give to one youll have the whole city round your ears leaving the seafront they went up into narrow streets past meat stalls joiners working in the street hucksters pedlars performers after the purity of the sea every port had a characteristic smell for all sailorsthat in naples was compounded from the garlicladen pasta cooking on every street corner a universal underlying odour of fish and the ordure of horses where are we bound nicholas kydd asked you wished to see the sights of naples if we are fortunate we will soon have the opportunity to take our fill of the most diverting curiosities not far from the royal palace renzi pointed out a little further up the hilly streets a relatively modest building kydd saw it bore the arms of great britain the embassy of course i am to renew acquaintance with sir william hamilton and his amusing wife i believe the doorman accepted renzis card and ushered them both into a drawing room presently a tall aristocratic gentleman with striking eyes and a hooked nose entered holding renzis card and looking puzzled lieutenant renzi he looked at them keenly then suddenly exclaimed mr laughton you have the advantage of me sir i had no knowledge of your arrival and sir i am known in the sea service as lieutenant renzi kydd had long known of his friends past and how for deeply held moral conviction in respect of a family act resulting in the suicide of a youth he had selfsentenced himself to a period of exile in the focsle of a manowar renzi had taken the name of an obscure medieval monk who had placed the love of learning above the distractions of the world very well the keen eyes rested for a moment longer on him then shifted to kydd sir may i present mr thomas kydd a lieutenant in the royal navy who is my particular friend the honour is all mine gentlemen to be in the presence of two such who have lately met with so much success in the destruction of englands enemies kydd and renzi bowed and hamilton went on regrettably my wife cannot receive you as she is at this moment with the queen sir do not stand on ceremony for our sake my friend wishes merely to make the acquaintance of the author of the celebrated campi phlegraei to perhaps view some small curiosities treasures of an enquiring mind hamiltons expression eased you were always of a persuasion to discover your classical education at source as i remember mr laumr renzi his intelligent eyes turned on kydd do you sir know aught of the pausilypon the serapeum of puteoli perhaps it would please me well t see em at first hand if that were possible kydd said stoutly his answer would serve whether these were places or things renzi hurried to his rescue since i have been absent sir has progress been made at all on the discoveries of herculaneum indeed so should you be at leisure on the morrow it is my practice as you may recollect to mount to the rim of vesuvius in the interests of science it would certainly be possible to visit ercolano on our way might i suggest the hour of eight o clock herculaneum turned out to be a dusty expanse of crumbling ruins picked over by paid labourers and dilettantes kydd was glad they had taken the precaution of shifting to shore clothing and stout shoes renzi was in his element happily exchanging observations on the house of argus pliny the elder and other unpronounceable names kydd was glad for him but it seemed an age before they resumed their carriage and made for the colossal glowering presence of the volcano has it been er angry at all since hamilton smiled we had a brisk entertainment in seventynine certainly and have had some alarums since but had you confided your unease to me before we left i could have provided you with a phial of the blood of san gennaro which infallibly protects those who venture on the slopes of vesuvius that wont be necessary said kydd and stared out at the scrubby countryside it grew thin and bare and with a sudden thrill he caught sight of the first brownblack hardened lava flows a little further on the carriage stopped at a small gathering of waiting retainers and horses we shall ride to the end of the track gentlemen then we will be obliged to walk the rest of the way hamilton swung astride a pony and led the party in single file up a steep path that wound round the massive flanks of the volcano they rode in silence the uneasy quiet and garish rocks speaking to kydd of a devilish underworld that lay beneath him ready to explode at any moment the soil lost the last of its vegetation its colour now an inflamed dull red then the track petered out and the horses were slipping on the greyblack cinder that covered everything in sight now we walk hamilton said and dismounted they trudged up an incline the cinders crunching underfoot the acrid pungency of the volcano hung on the air renzi glanced at kydds set face and grinned you are in the best of hands brother sir williams writings on the character of volcanoes are applauded throughout the civilised world kydd muttered in a low voice y know well that i cant abide fireand now y asks me to look on the fires o hell itself hamilton affected not to hear id give half my fortune to be in england when they receive news of your famous victory renzi chuckled therell be a scramble on change id wager he said pitt will see his chance to turn the credit to hard coinit will quite put the opposition to the blush no doubt said hamilton regarding renzi curiously but you must appreciate that the greater effect will be here conceive of itnot just a victory over the french but their annihilation they now have no means to support their claim to the mediterranean in short the careful building of colonies and garrisons since you were driven from the mediterranean is as nothing now all are isolated and ripe for our seizing one by one and at our convenience you will be aware that turkey has declared against france and is opening the dardanelles to our ships austria is much heartenedas you will know the queen of naples is the daughter of an austrian emperor and is now in raptures dare we hope that a second coalition is possible renzi nodded quietly a crooked smile appeared on hamiltons face but what i relish most is the sure knowledge that at this very moment the first general of france napoleon buonaparte is stranded helplessly in the deserts of egypt with above thirty thousand of his best troopsand no hope of rescue kydd swelled with pride their hard chase and heroic battle had brought about an abrupt change in the balance of power of far more significance than any of the endless land battles he had heard about and all this could rightly be ascribed to the achievement of one man horatio nelson were masters of the mediterranean for now sir renzi said respectfully what do you see as our probable future course hamiltons low chuckle was almost inaudible we have won a great victory mr renzi but we have by no means won a war we are sadly beset on all sides with precious few friends and no recognisable strategy for turning defence to aggression a fragment of low cloud enveloped them in a cool embrace its sombre light depressing then it dissipated and the warm sun returned stopping suddenly hamilton turned and pointed to the bay of naples below a breathtaking sweep of scores of miles there sir beyond the point of posillipo it is there you should ask your question bacoli said renzi puzzled no i speak of the cave of the cumaean sybil which still exists perhaps you should seek your future at the feet of the prophetess receive your oracle as did so many from distant lands in the time of the ancients the three stood on the flank of the volcano held by the vast panorama with all its beauty and antiquity i believe we must press onits another hour yet hamilton said glancing down the track to where a laden mule and servants followed behind them eventually the ground levelled and they found themselves standing on the rim of vesuvius kydd felt his palms sweat in a way they never had even at the height of the battle for the track was only a few feet wide meandering along next to the colossal maw of the volcano a stygian stink of steam and sulphur hung on the air but to kydds mingled relief and disappointment there was no heaving hell of fire in the interior merely dead scree slopes and untidy heaps of grey ash from which vapours issued while renzi helped hamilton with his stakes chain measures and thermometers kydd wandered along the path fascinated and repelled it felt like some great sleeping beast that was harmless until a careless act woke it to terrible life he was not sorry when hamilton concluded his work and they set off down the track to the horses when they arrived it was already late afternoon and a spectacular sunset promised to the west directly at their feet sir renzi said suddenly it would gratify my spirit beyond words were we to linger a while to partake in the close of this day hamilton grunted as he heaved himself up on to his pony i understand you renzi please believe me but tonight i am to receive someone who has travelled far and must prepare should you wish however i shall send my carriage back for you that is most kind in you sir william renzi said with a bow kydd sighed with exasperation but as he had seen in the south seas renzi was always most at peace in the midst of one of natures displays and it would not be a kindness to fret about moving on they settled on the cinders and watched the unfolding beauty and afterwards dear friend we shall sample the entertainments of the night at the first hand renzi said softly there was peace of a kind here on the flanks of a volcano that had devoured all of two ancient towns but to kydd it was the peace of the dead what he could not get out of his mind was the magnitude of their recent successand all the consequence of a single minds contriving and command like madness is the glory of this life renzi murmured his eyes fixed on the gathering rose and gold display what was that you said nicholas kydd asked politely his eyes still on the gathering sunset renzi declaimed let rome in tiber melt and the wide arch of the ranged empire fall here is my space kingdoms are clay kydd frowned thats as may be nicholas but youll agree weve a famous victory t be proud of renzi rapt with the heavenly closing ceremony of the day said nothing ive been thinking about things kydd said seriously working through m life y understand oh what did you conclude brother renzi answered distantly kydd held on to his temper i was considering m position in the light o recent events he said ah yes do ye want t hear or no renzi turned to kydd of course dear fellowdo fill and stand on as it were kydd caught his breath it was difficult enough to put into words the powerful feelings he had found within him the insight into himself that he sensed was there for the perceiving itsits that steppin ashore a hero ii find it agreeable is all some would find it diverting renzi murmured his attention clearly elsewhere what i mean isif y take my meaningid rather it were me my doing my victory his eyes burned is it so necessary to crave pardon fr the sin of ambition why should it not be me indeed why not renzi said drily then noticing kydds anger he sat up that is to say it would be well to reflect that to be in the character of a hero necessarily involves elements of chance as well as merit kydd glowered at him chance o course theres chance was it mischance or luck that had me in the horse n groom sinking an ale just when th pressgang went in or when seaflower went ashore over the reef in that hurricanoe i dont deal in logic overmuchive seen too much o how quick the world cn go all ahoo to worry about plotting m course too far ahead but what ive learnedan its a lesson well takenis that when things are on the flood fr you take it in both hands an clap on all sail if its going afoul then snug down an ride it out without whining this is an observation i cannot disallow ive been fortunate this ill be th first t admit toa foremast hand crossed t the quarterdeck but whos t say that this is an end to my portion o luck where will i go to next quite so be you always ready for anything that chances by no kydd snapped that is not what im going t do er ive seen how a reglarbuilt hero goes about it nelsonis he one t wait for what comes his way heaves to n waits fr the enemy to sail over to him no he makes his chances by rising up an seizing em renzi watched him but made no comment kydd folded his arms you see nicholas from this day forward im t make my own luck like admral nelson im looking for my chances an taking em the very instant i see them an if that means perils an hazard t me then this is what i must do an i hope i wont prove shy in that hour as the heat of his words cooled he gave an awkward smile so y seei mean t make something of mself is all looking at him seriously renzi said quietly this i can see brother let us pray it leads you not into tempestuous waters some day nicholas be sure an this is what i mean finish good sir the bright day is done and we are for the dark heat built quickly in the morning calm the ships lay listlessly at anchor in the bay and kydd and renzi walked languidly about the decks of tenacious the gunports were triced open to allow the small zephyrs to bring some measure of relief to the humid conditions in the tween decks boarding nettings were not rigged below them less in respect of the unlikelihood of unfriendly visitors than in recognition of the disinclination of seamen to desert in such an unfamiliar port bumboats however were always to be seen alongside hoping to entice sailors through the open gunports with gewgaws wiping his forehead kydd tried to ignore his dull nausea and uncertain footing and asked renzi tell me true did you mark what th dwarf was doing with the blackamoor and the straps renzi avoided his eye i rather feel that on this occasion we were unfairly gulled into a lower class of entertainment owing to ourour agreeable acquaintance with the famed lachryma christi wine kydd peered over the side at the bumboats but he was not an officerofthewatch in harbour this was a job for a masters mate who would turn sullen if advised of his duties by an idle officer signals were now in abeyance in port the admiral would distribute his orders and dispatches by midshipman and boat and in any case it was rumoured that nelson had accepted an offer of hospitality from sir william hamilton and was staying ashore in their house resting treading carefully around three seamen who were eyeing him warily he noted that their splicing and boltrope sewing had not progressed far since his and renzis last turn round the deck for this was the second occasion that the boatswain had been too ill to take charge of his men it was inevitable the toll on discipline and spirit in a harbour of such allure rawson and bowden had sampled the delights together overstayed their leave and were now confined to the ship while adams was refusing morosely to show his face ashore after a mysterious encounter involving a lady other incidents were more serious one seaman had been brought back by his messmates stabbed in the neck and over fifty were unfit for work it was proving difficult to overcome the lassitude that seemed to pervade the air after their recent extremity of effort with houghton and bryant away up country inspecting fortifications bampton had been left acting captain and at seven bells there was the depressingly more frequent clear lower deck hands to witness punishment sir henry soulter has been a toprate petty officer an focsle hand always ready t step forward when theres perilous duty to be done its not his character thats at question now mr kydd bampton said acidly its his actions did he or did he not make threatening gestures and thereafter strike laffin boatswains mate kydd stifled a weary sigh he had the essence of the matter from soulters friends inflamed by unaccustomed grappa soulter a gifted seaman and steady hand had responded too readily to taunting of a personal nature from laffin and had laid into him unfortunately this had been witnessed by pringle the captain of marines who had thought it his business to take the matter further it was splitting hairs as to whether laffin was in fact soulters superior but if it were so adjudged then it was a very serious matter indeed requiring a courtmartial and the death penalty not discounted aye sir soulter admits th charge but states that it was under much provocation that there can be no extenuating circumstances in a crime of this nature mr kydd said bampton importantly if he admits the charge kydds temper rose soulter was in his division and he knew his value but now bampton was playing god with them both he does kydd snapped so striking a superior this is a grave charge soulter sir soulter said woodenly bampton let it hang then said this should result in your courtmartial you villain how do you feel about that sir however in this instance i am prepared to be lenient mr kydd sir im certain soulter did not intend a disrespect t his superior and now regrets his acts he said stolidly kydd knew that bampton would never hand a courtmartial to houghton on his return and felt nothing but contempt for the show he was making very well soulter you are to be disrated as of this hour and shall shift your hammock forward immediately soulters eyes glowed then went opaque and you shall be entered in the masteratarms black book for one month this was shabby treatment indeed the man would revert to common seaman and laffin would therefore have free rein to indulge his revenge not only that for a month soulter would be cleaning heads and messdecks before all the seamen of whom he had been in charge before the men were dismissed and went below for the noon meal kydd sat at the wardroom table without appetite it could have been worseat least there were no lashes awarded for an act that was so predictable for top fighting seamen kept in idleness in a port of this nature he would see to it that soulter was reinstated at the first opportunity kydd brightened he knew soulter was a popular petty officer fair and hardworking by the unwritten rules of the lower deck he would have been seen to be unjustly treated and therefore would not be demeaned before the others by his impositions im getting t be a mort weary of naples m friend kydd said reluctantly its not a place fr your right true shellback renzi did not hasten to offer a further run ashore kydd had noticed his distaste for the squalor of some streets renzi was no prude but kydd had a feeling that it sat uneasily with the classical splendours that filled his head after a space renzi said smoothly you wish to depart these shores before you have been introduced to culture of altogether a different sort an evening of entertainment of a far more decorous nature oh said kydd without enthusiasm an invitation from sir william that even the admiral feels it an honour to accept nelson a select few will be there you may be sure the ambassador honours us greatly for our interest in antiquity and should you be absent it will be noticed i fear but nelsonan probably some of his captains almost certainly in the warm dusk kydd ran his finger about the constricting circle of the stock round his neck irritated as well by the tickling of the frilly starched jabot under his chin he consoled himself that a naval officers fulldress uniform was a trial at times but was far easier than the elaborate frogging and tight pantaloons of the army the palazzo sessa was ablaze with lights and rich banners flew from each corner of the building crowds massed outside hoping to catch a glimpse of the hero of the hour the two officers passed through the doorway to cheers from the excited people after the dimness of a violet dusk the light of massed chandeliers was overpowering highlighting rosebloomed faces and sparkling jewellery over ample bosoms i say youre kydd of tenacious are you not the left epaulette and single ring at the cuff proclaimed him a commander a captain in the quaint naval way of an unrated ship even if he was younger than kydd aye sir said kydd my father has mentioned you he said with just a hint of the supercilious but i see these knaves are neglecting you here he neatly abstracted a champagne flute from a passing tray should we not be well primed to salute the honour of the allconquering nelson he took a long pull at his glass before kydd could recollect himself enough to utter an unconvincing sir horatiovictor o the seas yes well must make my number with carraciolo the bumbling fool he thrust through the assembly and was lost kydd looked round for renzi and found him talking with a thickset postcaptain who stood bolt upright the champagne flute in his fist looking diminutive ah kydd please make the acquaintance of captain troubridge sir a pleasure t see you again an dare i offer m consolation on culloden takin the ground as she did and missing the sport damn chartsbut a glorious occasion hey kydd caught a sight of the commander he had spoken to before on impulse he asked sir are you acquainted with th officer over there speakin to the lady in blue i am troubridge answered looking at kydd oddly thats the captain of bonne citoyenne and as you should know he is also nelsons son ii stepson that is to say josiah nisbet i see thank ye sir the buzz of conversation increased then fell away quickly as a hush spread over the room a trio was coming down a staircase that led from the apartments above the ambassador with nelson and between them an arm on each a cherubic but striking lady whom kydd had not seen before but who must be emma lady hamilton the hush was broken by a single cry of viva il conquistatore it was taken up all over the room in a bedlam of joyous shouts nelson in his splendid decorations responded by beaming and bowing to left and right lady hamilton struck an imperious pose and cried avast all ye i present duke nelson marquis nile baron alexandria viscount pyramid baron crocodile and the prince of victory laughter and patriotic cries burst out and the three descended into the gathering presently the ambassador held up his hands for silence for those who love naples an evening of civilisation pray come with me let the entertainments begin in the drawing room a semicircle of elegant chairs in two rows faced a small ensemble of harpsichord to one side two violins to the other the musicians remained in a bowed position while the guests settled kydd found a chair in the second row from which he could see nelson and the hamiltons they were in fine form sir william animated and relaxed while his lady seemed to be in full flood of sociability towards her distinguished guest nelson appeared equally engaged his responses to lady hamiltons sallies almost boyish in their artlessness hamilton rose and faced his guests i know you will be amazed and delighted when i tell you that i have persuaded the famed tenor romualdo farrugia to perform for us tonight he will begin with pergolesis lo frate nnamorato of course in the original neapolitan dialect next to kydd renzi stirred with interest farrugia what a coup in opera buffo the finest in all napleswhich is to say the world a short dark man in an extravagantly rich costume strode out and bowed low then fixed his audience with a fierce gaze a cascade of notes on the harpsichord concluded with entry of the violin continuo and the piece began it was magnificent the effortless power of his voice infused every note with its full charge of emotion and significance kydd had never heard anything like it the singer retired to a storm of applause hamilton rose and turned to the guests equally fortunate is it that the noted soprano bellina cossi is delaying her return to vienna to perform for us tonight she sings about a shepherdess at the banks of a river who does not feel inclined to waste herself on a lukewarm lover of course this is the scarlatti cantata sul margine dun rio the beauty of the crystal clear notes their passion and tenderness moved kydd and he felt detached from his hardy sea life the music just as it had in venice lifted him into an untouchable realm of the spirit in a warm haze he heard hamilton announce a dueta scene from a recent cimarosa opera le astutzie femminili he let the music wash deliciously over him and was sincerely sorry when it was over an intermission hamilton announced but do not despair we shall shortly have our own particular entertainment for you the scraping of chairs and murmured conversations were muted under the lingering spell of the music but livened as the guests partook of sweetmeats and lachryma christi they returned to stand informally about the front of the room are you prepared called hamilton thenact the first first one then another black man in turban and baggy trousers came through the door naked from the waist up they carried between them a long scarlet curtain on brass rods intrigued the guests watched as the men took position they bowed and when they rose so did the rods suspending the curtain in a creditable imitation of a miniature stage ah i believe i know what is to come said renzi mysterious bumps and scrapes sounded from behind the curtain urgent whispers could be heard and then hamilton emerged ecce he calledand swept aside the curtain at first kydd could not make out what was happening but then he saw that it was lady hamilton in a theatrical pose standing motionless before a large upright seashell in a flowing classical greek robe all composed within an empty picture frame candles were held artfully by the ambassador to throw a dramatic light upon her kydd was astonished at the diaphanous material of her gown which left little to the imagination and a decollete that would be thought risque even at the theatre at the same time he saw that the chubbiness had not extinguished a very real beautyan expressive and angelic face raised to heaven that was the quintessence of innocence aphrodite rises frm the waves several shouts vied with each other they were rewarded with a smile from the enchantress and then the curtain closed it opened again to a different pose an ardent lovelorn entwining around the branch of a tree beseeching an unseen figure and still in the filmy gown glycera frolicking with alcibiades a slight frown appeared while protracted but jovial disputation took place cleopatra and antony receive the news called renzi at length to be thrown a dazzling smile kydd looked to see how nelson was receiving the entertainment and was startled to see the gallant admiral wildly applauding each manifestation always gracefully acknowledged by lady hamilton places were resumed for the second half dorabella and guglielmo from cost fan tutte kydd had seen lady hamilton sit with nelson again her arm laid on his and not removed he glanced about no one seemed to have noticed except possibly troubridge who stared forward stonily the plot of the scene was whispered brokenly by renzi it seemed to be nothing but unlikely disguises and trifling complications following a wager but the music carried kydd along once more at the end hamilton thanked the performers and added our entertainment is concluded for tonight my friends and honoured guests the hour is late but for those who wish to indulge there is a faro table in the next room the guests rose in a babble of excited talk as hamilton and his lady escorted nelson to the next room what do we do now nicholas kydd whispered at this hour we have the civilised choice to linger or depart immediately renzi replied nothing will be imputed from our actions would it be at all curious should we desire t see a faro table without we play i dont think so brother renzi said they moved into the next room where already a large card table was set out lady hamilton stood behind nelson urging him excitedly a footman offered iced champagne which kydd found most acceptable in the heat of the night feeling happy and expansive kydd remarked to renzi yr foreign cant is all pedlars greek t me nicholas but the music i have t say it leaves me with th hot shivers renzi nodded of the first rate the pity is to escape it in naples in the nursery your tradesman in the street all are singing from the heart wherever they be a truly gifted people it seemed there were others who wished to linger some at the gaming table others promenading before the inattentive hero of the nile kydd accepted another glass of champagne while he looked about the room have ye noticed were the only ltenants he said proudly discounting the indeterminate neapolitan army officers it was an agreeable observation and he sighed with the sheer joy of the moment so it seems said renzi turning to see the origin of raised voices it was nisbet the young commander had approached the faro table and confronted his stepfather redfaced his cravat hanging askew from their distance it was impossible for kydd and renzi to make out the words but the reaction of bystanders was eloquent enough there was a scuffle and more shouting and in a room suddenly quiet troubridge and another officer frogmarched nisbet past them and into the night the room burst into horrified talk lady hamilton stared after them her face chalklike a colonel lurched towards kydd telling everyone he could find of what he had heard damme but his own son near calls him outdishonouring his mothers nametells his own admiral where his duty lies who could conceive of it he bellowed gleefully houghton held up his hand for silence and so it will be hard for me to take my leave of tenacious a ship we have all grown to love and respect but the needs of the service must rise above all hear him hear him the wardroom resounded to the thump of hands on the table the rattle of glasses but who can say gentlemen we may meet againat sea knowing growls indicated that it was not lost on the officers at the table that houghton was going on to the command of a powerful the mainstay of the lineofbattle and it would be remarkable if he so much as noticed the humble tenacious if they did sight one another now before i sit down there is one concern that is of particular satisfaction to me and that is in the matter of promotions the table fell instantly silent as you must be aware my own removal into a seventyfour might have been expected but following a successful action it is the custom of the service to bring forward deserving officers kydds pulse quickened was his star now ascending to take him onward and upward it has been difficult to choose which among you but as of this morning i received word from sir horatio that he has graciously acceded to my recommendation he paused surveying his officers gravely i therefore selected an officer who to me appears particularly forward one whose ardent spirit in the face of the enemy has been so often remarked i know you will all join with me in congratulating lieutenant bryant there was a moments pause as the news sank in then the wardroom broke into goodnatured shouts of envy and felicitation he has been made commander into dompteur sloopofwar and late prize to join earl st vincent before cadiz kydd was startled by the intensity of his reaction to this news envy was turning unworthily to jealousy as a commander bryant was now lifted out and above them all to a different and higher plane of existence as captain of his own ship kydd forced a smile as he looked across at bryant who was redfaced with pleasure loudly admitting his good fortune independence prizemoney the prospect of leading a ships company to honour and glory in his own name bryant had it all now then the feeling passed no doubt kydds turn would come he couldnt be the junior for ever and there was still a chance that there would be further promotions after the nile kydds natural generosity of spirit returned and he leaned across to shake bryants hand give you joy of yr step sir he said with a broad smile we shall wet y swab afore ye leave on his plain lieutenants uniform bryant would henceforth ship a golden epaulette to larboard for all the world to see and know by it that he was now the captain of a ship captain houghton left his command in the morning of the following day as was the custom the officers rowed him ashore in his barge still leaving unanswered the allimportant question of who would succeed ah yes said adams reflectively in the wardroom afterwards this is all very well but its who theyll find for premier that id be more concerned with stranger coming in doesnt know our ways a new first luff can be a deuced awkward party kydd agreedthe first lieutenant was responsible for so many vital domestic arrangements from apportioning the watchandstation bill of the hands to ensuring before the captain that the appearance of the ship was taut and seamanlike there was plenty of scope for tyranny or slackness both equally dismaying within the confines of a manowar sir it was the duty masters mate at the door what do we do wi thisn it was a plain message sealed and addressed to the first lieutenant hms tenacious been waitin these several days fer the new first ltenant and we dont rightly know what t do with it well now and heres a puzzler said adams turning it over and trying to glimpse its contents very obviously it was not of the usual flow of administrative trivia for it was of different quality paper and the seal was a private one return it bampton said flatly there is no first lieutenant open it pybus and kydd said together renzi frowned reading a gentlemans mail was a sad lapse in propriety adams grinned since theres no indication on the outside of who sent this i propose to open it and discover where to return it he fumbled at the seal broke it and began reading the short letter good god he gasped its the new owner hes asking the first ltenant to prepare the ship for his arrivalthis afternoon in the space of two hours there was little of substance that could be done to the ships appearance and when at precisely four bells a boat was reported putting off from the shore the officers gathered expecting the worst the boatswains calls twittered bravely as a lone figure in the full dress uniform of a postcaptain royal navy mounted the side the piping ceased as a tall preciselooking officer doffed his hat to the quarterdeck and again to bampton at the head of the waiting line of officers er bampton second lieutenant he said removing his hat i regret to say there is no first lieutenant at the moment thank you mr bampton said the officer after a pause sir might i now introduce mr adams later mr bampton stepping to the centre of the quarterdeck the officer withdrew a parchment which he unfolded clearing his throat he began to read by the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral captain christopher main faulkner hereby appointed to the command of his majestys ship tenacious the man had a high penetrating voice which to kydd came oddly from such a tall figure whereof you shall answer at your peril faulkner concluded folded his commission and returned it inside his coatand hms tenacious had a new captain there will be a meeting of all officers in the great cabin in one hour thank you gentlemen it allowed just enough time to hoist aboard the new captains furniture and other baggage before the officers assembled as instructed please be seated faulkner began rather older than the captains kydd had known the mans manner was careful and fastidious i am happy to make your several acquaintances he said evenly in the matter of the first lieutenant we have a difficulty only this morning was i told that mr protheroe designated for the post has unfortunately been struck down with a fever a most vexing circumstance clearly this vessel requires a first lieutenant but in the time available i have been unsuccessful in finding an officer of sufficient seniority therefore i am going to ask mr bampton to accept the post bampton started with surprise then gave a barely suppressed smile of triumph mr adams will advance to second lieutenant but concerning the remaining two gentlemen i have my reservationstheir slight length of service in this vessel does not warrant my confidence that they are ready for service at a more senior level kydd coloured after the nile and service on the north american station he knew he was more experienced than most at his age faulkner steepled his fingers sir horatio has been kind enough to find me an officer prepared for immediate employment and he will be joining tenacious tomorrow he paused his brow furrowing in annoyance however there is a difficulty that officer is a passed midshipman only newly promoted to acting lieutenant thus i am obliged to appoint him as fifth lieutenant and therefore signal lieutenant and trust that mr renzi as third and mr kydd as fourth lieutenant will find they are able to discharge their responsibilities in a correct and timely manner as befits their new station he looked soberly round the room it is particularly regrettable that there are so few officers of seniority available in this part of the mediterranean but haste is necessary in this instance i refer in fact to the sailing orders that i have just received gentlemen tenacious being in all respects ready for sea she will be proceeding to a secret rendezvous to assist in an enterprise of great importance the nature of which i may not divulge to you until we are ten leagues to seaward chapter minorca of course it has t be agreed kydd offering the remaining whitebait to renzi it did not take much deliberation to understand why an invasion of the easternmost of the three main islands of the balearics was thought so necessary britain had reentered the mediterranean but her victorious fleet was alone in a hostile sea it was urgent that a forward base be established to maintain it in port mahon there was a compendious harbour and a fine dockyardand minorca was an island therefore defensible once taken and unlike gibraltar with reliable winds kydd glanced up the table it was odd to see bampton at the head president of the mess he looked to the other end where their new junior mess member sat quietly mr dugdale did y ever visit minorca at all why yes mr kydd the man said warily reluctant to imperil his position with any illconsidered move he was older than almost all of the other officers far from the green newly promoted midshipman they had expected he had found a place as a midshipman in the last war then been left without a ship at its end and had eked out a penurious existence ashore until the outbreak of the present war only now had he the good fortune to secure an acting lieutenancy well spit it out man kydd said helping himself to the last of the haunch of rabbit it was only a brief visit sir as youll know it had been british for twenty years before the people were used to our ways and dare i say it contented with their lot for the spanish rule was not always welcome to your average minorcan there are two main townsciudadela to the west and port mahon to the east the spanish kept mainly behind the city walls of ciudadela while we were happy with mahon a firstclass harbour it is splendid careening and repair fine quarters ashore in english style and guarded by great forts should this be our base in the future why i cannot think of a finer bampton stirred if it becomes so youre rather forgetting that its been in the hands of the spanish these sixteen years and theyre not about to present their fortresses to us upon our request we shall have to fight for themand this means nothing less than an assault an amphibious landing has anyone here had the joy of going into battle with the army no kydd kept quiet the illfated descent on guadeloupe in the caribbean he had experienced as a young petty officer would probably not count then consider yourselves fortunate an opinionated and ignorant tribe i fancy well need every mort of patience we can muster on the day hows th island defended kydd asked dugdale his brow wrinkled there are big forts on each side of the entrance to mahon the biggest as i remember is fort st philip which would stand next to any in europe and many minor forts and batteries around and about bampton gave a thin smile its as well then that i can tell you this is not our task we shall not be going ashore he announced flatly thank god for that murmured adams but how do you know this the captain has seen fit to entrust me with certain confidences bampton said smoothly and im able to tell you that the main task of our squadron under commodore duckworth is to defend the landing against any ships of force that the enemy sees fit to send to oppose the assault we shall see out the operation at sea dugdale opened his mouth to speak but said nothing what is it mr dugdale bampton said caustically er after the late complete destruction of the french at the nile surely they have nothing left to throw at us you are forgetting cartagena bampton said heavily the spanish battle fleet and mallorca added renzi it would be strange if the spanish do not maintain a standing force there for mutual protectionand less than eight leagues to the west from minorca half a days sail this could do us a real mischief at the time of our landing even if we have the advantage of surprise cartagena is ten times the distance and the issue could be decided before they receive any intelligence and are able to respond we cannot discount that our intentions against minorca are known the spanish may well be at sea and lying in ambuscade for us bampton said irritably in any case captain faulkner has set me a task renzi raised an eyebrow presumably involving us as a matter of fact it does im to put before you all that one liaison officer from each ship has been requested by the commodore to attend his councils with the army command he paused any officer interested is asked to put himself forward should there be none the commodore will be under the necessity of detailing one himself as too vital in the management of the ship i am to be excluded as is mr dugdale on account of his junior status therefore i am open to suggestions from the remainder adams glowered itll be jawing all day notes and reports all night not if i ever have the choice renzi stared into space then ill do it kydd said at th least ill get t know whats afoot but foremost in his mind was the possibility of notice and the first chance of seizing any prospect of active service that came his way yesthis was a positive nelsonstyle move the secret rendezvous was the line of north latitude where it seemed at first glance a mighty fleet was gathered but closer observation revealed that there were only two shipsoftheline other than tenacious and half a dozen assorted light frigates and cutters the rest were transports and supply craft with fifteen enemy shipsoftheline in cartagena or possibly at sea close by kydd wondered whether this was showing great confidenceor disastrous folly in the great cabin of the hms leviathan commodore duckworth a large wellbuilt man with an open seamanlike face started proceedings i have the honour to welcome aboard lieutenant general sir charles stuart field officer commanding the expedition by contrast stuart was an aristocratic sharpfeatured officer with an impenetrable air of authority the reduction of minorca will not be an easy task he said briskly but the commodore has assured me of the steadfast support of the navy and im satisfied that the operation may proceed without delay youll understand began duckworth getting to his feet but was interrupted by stuarts continuing this officer is my second in command he said nodding at a short fierce officer who half rose revealing the tartans and kilt of a highland regiment colonel the lord lynedoch laird of balgowan known in the regiment as colonel graham duckworth sat heavily the navy were not to be the leading players on this stage i shall begin with an overview of the enemy force awaiting us our information derives from a hodgepodge of sources and is therefore not necessarily reliable but opposing us are about five thousand troops some it seems heavy dragoons others garrisoned in the major fortresses guarding port mahon our prime objective there are as well a considerable number of small forts and guntowers on the coastline which we would do well to avoid my intentions in summary are these draw near if you please stuart said sharply tapping an opened map with a slender polished stick although port mahon is our objective the landing will be here in the central north at the bay of fornellsthere is a good harbour quite sufficient to bear our transports and larger ships having established ourselves ashore we drive south to the centre of the island and to the town of mercadal here at this point i will split my forces one division will press west to invest the administrative capital of ciudadela on the west coast this is merely to occupy the spanish while the more important division strikes east to take port mahon from landward is this clear aye sir but i foresee that we shall have opportunity to discuss your objections later colonel now to the order of battle the navy its primary task is to prevent the spanish fleet interfering with the landing but equally vital is the need to keep the expeditionary force well supplied and in a timely manner finally i look to the navy to deny the enemy resupply therefore as i have mentioned in another place previously there will be no role for the navy ashore the twentyeighth regiment of highlanders colonel paget will be the main field force and will be accompanied the flow of military verbiage washed over kydd as he pondered stuarts strategy it sounded straightforward enough but even with his limited experience he could think of many reasons why it could all go wrong now colonel graham you have objections sir i do sir in any venture to put troops ashore we are critically reliant on our understanding of the enemys positions that they are not in sufficient numbers to prevent our disembarkation by any means what intelligence do you have sir that encourages you to believe fornells is open to us stuart paused i do not have direct information true there is a species of revolutionary minorcan zealot opposed to spanish rule assisting us but their intelligence leaves much to be desired his lips thinned it were better we rely on our own estimates colonel if it transpires that the enemy presses us too hard in fornells we must abandon the attemptand strike elsewhere addaya to the east has been mentioned with respect sir colonel just three miles inland there is a road marked here passing between the two if the enemy uses this to transfer forces rapidly between we will not see themwe will have no warning until they fall upon our exposed landing colonel graham in war risks must be taken the landing must take place somewherehave you any other suggestion no then sir we land as planned in fornells accepting casualties if need be now on to the details in the matter of sir kydd felt the same exhilaration the same unstoppable conviction that had carried him on to make the fateful decision to hand over his signal codes to the american navy now he was stepping forward in a councilofwar to propose a seamans solution to an army difficulty stuart stopped raising his eyes questioningly sir ltenant kydd o tenaciouswe cant see th soldiers from where we are coming in frm the sea as we will stuart continued to look at him stonily the rest of the cabin turning curiously to look at the usurper yes sir minorca is a low island not many hills as youd say but in th sea service when we navigate past we always take a sight of monte toro a single mount y can see leagues out to sea without ever ye sees the island should anyone climb t the top with a spyglass then nothing can be hid from himall th motions of the soldiers will be made clear it bein lessn four miles distant and by this you shall know for a surety in which place to throw in your own forces graham thumped the table preposterous how is your spyglass man then going to advise general stuart run helterskelter back down the mountain there were sniggers from the other army officers even with a fast horse colonel graham i amer was signal ltenant in hms tenacious genral stuart im sure will be very satisfied should he take intelligence on th quarterdeck of leviathan that informs him hour b hour of where the spanish are we have a fine enough set o signals in the navy we can use for th purpose the murmuring died away as stuart contemplated kydd possibly for this it will mean crossing unknown territory occupied by the enemy aye sir but did i not hear about yr minorcan patriots they cn see us through t the mountain right enough commodore er i can see nothing wrong in principle at this stage sir but mr kydd you are prepared that you may be taken up as a spy as most assuredly you are sir one moment if you please sir a young army subaltern stood up and banged his head on a deckbeam which made him sit again abruptly this is an army operation sir and on land i cannot see how the navy can be expected to recognise military movements therefore i do volunteer for the task kydd bristled he swung on the young officer i think i cn be trusted to recognise a parcel o spanish redcoats but can you sir tell if the wind is foul fr a landing if we have to shift from fornells i have m doubts of it quite so said stuart but do i understand you to mean that you can undertake to observe the enemy from their rear signal over their heads to my headquarters at sea to advise on just where their forces are massing to oppose us yes sirand give ye warning should reinforcements be afoot hmmm reliably sir a line o frigates ahead of a fleet cn watch sixty miles o seaan theres three hundred signals in the book they can use t advise the admiral kydd did not mention there was no signal hoist in the book he could remember for fornells or marching towards or any other military terms for that matter very well we will take this forward mr kydd be so kind as to consult with the adjutant on how best to proceed stuart hesitated then declared to the meeting for the purposes of this operation we press on as before ifif this signalling fails in its intention we have lost nothing and will resume the assault without the information however if your scheme succeeds we will be greatly in your debt mr kydd kydd bowed politely but inwardly he was exulting he had seized the moment this was what it was to be a nelson he resumed his place but before he had settled duckworth leaned across and said testily a word with you afterwards at your convenience mr kydd say yr piece nicholas but please t make it speedy the landing is set fr only two days hence kydd rummaged in his chest looking for anything that he could put over his uniform he had a dim recollection from somewhere that he could not be shot as a spy if he was in uniform tom my friend do ye lend me yr watch id be grateful renzi untagged the expensive hunter from his waistcoat its not too early to reconsider the plan he said softly you see it is not the fear of failure that troubles me it is your unthinking trust that so many things will go right for you kydd stopped and looked directly at renzi if nelson let fear o what can go wrong come t the front why hed never have sailed against the enemy at the nile nothing was ever won b holding back nicholas renzi bit his lip then how will you set up for signals without you provide a mast and halliards ill find a way pass the lashing if y please renzi tried another tack if you are taken you can expect no mercy there are tales told of the spanish treatment of prisoners that make ugly enough i have t be ready by six bells if you cant help be s kind as to stand clear kydd tested the lashing round a small seamans chest inside was a full set of naval signal flags and tack lines that would allow the sending of any message in the book and all the while tenacious cruised ever closer to minorcas east coast for a secret night rendezvous with the revolutionary group what is your plan brother not so rarefied m friend after we get ashore its just four an a bit miles to monte toro through scrub n a few farms weve got good charts o the island from when we were here in eightytwo ive copied a track from them theres a path up to th top where the ladies used to go for the view an up there is just a nunnery ill not disturb em if i set up on their roof i believe and you can see the spanish from there a prime position fornells t the north five miles turn about to the noreast to addaya four miles an with a height of eye up there close t a thousand feet theres nothing that moves i cant see renzi murmured words of general unease as he helped bring the chest on deck sir ready in all respects kydd said to faulkner very well you have no qualms at this stage mr kydd it is not too late ready sir kydd said stoutly then we will proceed lookouts to your stations mr pearce aye aye sir said the boatswain and the darkness was suddenly split by the ghostly blue of the light of a flare reflected on sails it sputtered and fizzed sending dark shadows dancing about the deck illuminating the faces of the men in a few minutes the flare died to red sparks and blackness clamped in once more absolute silence long minutes passed nothing could be heard but the easy creak of the ship in the placid seas and the distant cry of a seabird kydd clutched a rope tightly tenacious was his true home where he had been formed as a kings officer faced death and destruction crossed whole oceans now he was leaving her warm security for the unknown perils that lay out in the darkness a faint cry came out of the night and was immediately followed by a hail from the foretop deck hooooo an its three points t larbd mr pearce sir he took his speaking trumpet and roared into the night god save king george an answering cry came and minutes later a small fishingboat appeared the boatswain gave a signal for it to come alongside and kydd prepared to board bowden was standing close bear a hand with m chest mr bowden he asked trying to keep the tension from his voice upturned faces in the boat watched as bowden passed a hitch round it and went down the side to the boat to receive it from the seamen lowering away kydd turned for a farewell sight of his ship and a handshake from the captain renzi waited until lasthis grip was tight no words were spoken good luck t ye sir came a low cry from the anonymous darkness forward and a lump formed in kydds throat he lifted an arm in response and went into the boat a jabber of nervous spanish greeted him and a womans voice cautioned pons he say as ow we must not waste th time taken aback kydd muttered something and took the chest from bowden away y go mlad he said an thank ye cant do that sir bowden said quietly id be disobeying captains orders wha he asked me to accompany you sir kydd realised that this was probably not the way it had happened but already the anonymous figure in the bows had poled off and the comforting bulk of tenacious was receding into the blackness yr a rascal bowden but i thank ye all the same pons ask you do not spikhe listen for danger in the sternsheets the woman was close enough for him to be aware of her female scent a darker mass loomed and the boat stopped in the water the fitful halfmoon laid a fragile luminosity over the water revealing a third figure whom kydd presumed to be pons he was listening with rigid concentration at length he signalled to the rower who skimmed the boat about and glided in to the shore there was just enough light to make out a rickety landingstage the boat bumped against it and the rower went forward to secure the painter pons stood and made his way clumsily up behind him while kydd prepared to land on enemy soil there was a flurry of movement in the dimness forwardand in a sudden chill of horror kydd saw the flash of moonlight on an arc of bright steel and heard a gurgling cry then a dull splash echoing in the tiny bay whwhy did is th only safe way the girl said flatly even if he want he can tell no tale now shaken kydd motioned to bowden to help sway up the chest they took a barely visible path over the low scrubcovered hillock and kydd could smell the scent of wild thyme and myrtle on the air it led down to a wider bay with a small village of fishermens dwellings by a beach pons held up his hand for them to stop there was no sound on the cool breeze beyond the distant bray of a donkey and laughter from one of the white stone houses the walk resumed a hundred yards short of the village pons growled something to the woman we wait she said here she added urgently moving into the scrub they crouched down kydds senses at full alert pons entered a brightly lit dwelling and emerged a few minutes later with an imperious wave the woman rose warily and gestured towards the village es grau a smokeblackened interior revealed it to be some form of taphouse but the conversations ceased as they entered kydd followed pons to a small room at the back which reminded him of the snug in an english hostelry sit kydd slipped into a chair next to bowden are we safe kydd whispered to the woman those people know were here here you will not find th spanish they are minorcan minorquin the girl said impatiently she wore a distinctive red cowl which she let down to reveal black hair swept back severely into a queue not dissimilar to the familiar tarry pigtail of the seaman the minorquin do not love those oo seek to master them then a brief wistful look stole over her as she introduced herself isabella orfila cinteswhen i a little girl you english sailor call me bella ltenant kydd an midshipman bowden kydd was reluctant to release his boatcloak to display his uniform coat beneath but he was stifling in the heat of the room that is ponsdon pons y preto carreras she threw the words at the sullen man opposite our leader she added pons snapped something at her he ask what do y want of him that the gran navy of englan send you to minorca kydd felt disquiet why had they not been told details by stuarts staff were they trustworthy and were they in possession of the secret of the invasionits time its place i volunteered t come he mumbled without their help his entire mission was impossible surely he would not have been put in contact with the minorquins unless he was expected to make use of them it was being left up to him to decide how much to reveal do ye know what is being planned for minorca planned isabella looked puzzled kydd saw bowdens anxiety and knew he was thinking the same thing but there was no help for it we mean t take this island from the spanish he said quietly an very soon youyou will come wi soldiers an ships aye an we need your help she stared at him then leaped up knocking the table askew god be praise que que pons seized her arm to force her round she replied in low urgent tones then pons stood to proclaim dramatically what sounded like patriotic slogans kydd gestured frantically for him to sit theres much t do before they come we are here t signal to our general where the spanish are an where they march to isabellas expression sobered that is ver dangerous she said darkly what is your plan there is a big hill a mountain called monte toro isabella said nothing her concentration growing intense we mean t climb up and see something stopped him going further all of minorca and there well set up a little mast an signal to th ships at sea she made no comment so he tried to explain further y can see these flags frm a long distance an send any message y like he pulled the chest over and threw back the lid then held up some of the flags you see that is your plan she said icily pons affected disinterest at the sight of the bunting it is you are all fools do you know what is up there on monte toro ive heard theres a nunnery a convent kydd said warily it is an you know else the army agree wi youa fine place for flags an signals they have their own post for flags guarded by th heavy dragoons so where is your plan now kydd tried to keep dismay from his face we will find a place out of sight o course somewhere up there on a roof where is your money in th box money she took a deep breath how you going to pay th soldier to look away while you wave yr flags kydd kept an obstinate silence his face burning you must if your ship can see th flags so can the spanish army her shoulders drooped how kydd had no answer then she looked up into his eyes ver well i will help you but first she went to the door and opened it juan she called loudly there was movement inside and a nervous potboy arrived carrying a jug and mugs on a tray when you english here before you teach us abou gin we learn well an make our own to hell wi all the spanish the gin owed more perhaps to myrtle than juniper but it had its own attractive character damn right kydd responded the darkness outside seemed all the more intense as they stumbled along a beachside track and crossed a small stream the chest was an irritating encumbrance and kydd felt the effects of the gin fall away he took off his boatcloak and uniform coat and tied them to the chest going in shirt and breeches alone what had become of his plan if he could not signal the invasion would certainly still go aheadand mens lives would pay for his failure it was only a little more than four miles to monte toro but no map could take into account the endless drystone walls of small plots of land the deep ravines in the limestone bedrock the sudden thick woods at one point pons stopped with a hiss of caution ahead was a moonlit clearing and beyond a dark tower we go one b one isabella whispered pons crouched low and scurried to the other side to disappear into the shadows he reappeared further towards the looming tower and beckoned hearts thumping at the unknown danger kydd and bowden complied kydd awkwardly humping the chest then isabella flitted across swiftly and they resumed the march they reached a road how far bella kydd gasped the chest was taking its toll of his strength dont stop here anyone is moving at night he must be bandido she went to help him with the chest but he brushed her away and crabbed across the road to the anonymous shadows of the other side it is not s far now mr keed she said we get to sa roca before the daybreak there we fin a new plan pons stalked on ahead at a merciless pace the terrain growing ever steeper and rockier the track leading through fragrant pine woods that pulled and snagged constantly it was more than an hour before they arrived the immense dark bulk of monte toro dominating aheada lone rounded peak that he had last seen from the deck of tenacious but whose brooding presence made kydds heart quail sir quite the ticket for signalling bowden said brightly kydd did not reply their hidingplace was well chosen a small shadow in the side of a craggy hill turned out to be a dank but secure limestone cave from the smell of its contents it was probably used for farm storage kydd let the chest drop thankfully as isabella found a small lantern we will return in th morning on your life do not show ouside sleep was a long time coming kydd had not counted on the presence of an army post on the summit rigging a makeshift signal mast was going to be impossible under their eyes and he despaired perhaps daylight would suggest a way the grey of dawn stole into the cave turning sinister dark shapes to ordinary dusty kegs and sacks it also brought isabella and a wrinkled old man with their breakfast of bread and onion soup this señor motta an this his finca his farm he want t help his beady black eyes watched them steadily as they ate while isabella waited impatiently and pons stared out moodily now what our plan she said as the last of the meal went down it was time to confront their situationand above all the vital question of whether he could trust her with the secret of the landingplace she was practical and intelligent and if anything was to be rescued of the mission it would have to be through her before he could speak she answered his unspoken question on monte toro is my brother josé he cook for the dragoons it was what kydd needed she would not have trusted him with that knowledge unless she believed in him and therefore in turn he could trust her there is a way you can visit him she added cagily but not wi your big box whats it like up there kydd countered thats t say how many soldiers where do they there are twentytwo soldier an five sailor t work the flags she said crisply they are in a fort an barracks not so big the monasterio gate are closed th nuns not interested in them now he just needed a reason to be up there and a hidingplace he was on his way back with a chance but without signalling flags on the quarterdeck of leviathan they would be expecting standard naval signalswithout flags and a mast to hoist them what use was it to get up there how do ye pass the soldiers is easyi wash th clothes for the soldier and is family she said i must take them upwhat soldier want to stop his washing then can ye tell me how we will get past em kydd asked easy as well you are cousin of josé you deliver onion an garlic to him on a donkey this young man not go but you cannot spik spanish cos you are idiot of the village can you be idiot señor motta will ave clothes for you mr kydd sir bowden said in a low voice our flags an ropes they look inside th box an we are betrayed she folded her arms no kydd knew there was everything to winif only his wits could come up with a solution but without flags to signal at the back of his mind something stirred flagsand something she had said the idea struggled for form and consciousness fornells addayaand the waiting fleet then it leaped into focus bowden he snapped i have an idea id be obliged should you help me t reason it through aye aye sir said bowden mystified they moved deeper into the cave for more privacy do ye agree that the idea took shape a plan was possible he explored further testing each part against bowdens loyal opposition he returned to isabella we have an idea heres what were going t do i wont hear you you if i dont know your plan how can i tell th spanish if they catch me there was nothing kydd could say to that she looked at him squarely jus tell mewhen you wan to be on monte toro before ten tomorrow we will be there there was one last matter my midshipman needs t return to the genral can pons will take im tonight in the cool of the morning kydd and isabella set out over the steep tracks towards the rearing bulk of monte toro dressed in the homespun of minorca a waistband of faded red with abarca sandals and a lowcrowned dull brown hat kydd led a donkey laden with onions in panniers strings of garlic bulbs round its neck and two laundry baskets they did not speak as they reached the base of the massive mount and began to trudge up the steep spiral road a thousand feet to gothe surrounding country began to spread out as they rose and the glimmer of sea appeared on the horizon further still and the limits of the horizon extended until even without a telescope the unmistakable winding shape of the bay of fornells became apparent the panorama of low rolling country out into the far distance was spectacular the gritty noise of a cart sounded behind kydd snatched a look and saw it was an army conveyance he let isabella chat on incomprehensibly she stopped to give a cheery wave to the soldiers who responded with catcalls they wound round the last few yards of the road and suddenly were on the airy summit a flat area with a squat square reddish fort and a line of barracks one side a white stone building the other well shuttered a hut and signal mast was atop the fort playing his part to the full kydd stood and gaped vacantly until isabella tugged angrily at him to move forward two sentries ambled across oye isabella para tenemos que registrarte a ti y la colada as isabella told her story kydd shrank fearfully from the men scrabbling to hide behind the donkey as the men fumbled among the onions in a perfunctory search laughing at his clumsy consternation el coronel dice que los ingleses están cerca y no quiere jugarsela they turned to the washing baskets kydd started to whimper in distress at their behaviour dejadlo en paz cabrones isabella shouted pulling them away they complied meekly while she comforted kydd with soothing words and firmly led him on at the sound of raised voices several people came into the courtyard the cook fat jovial and impatient to see what they had brought emerged from the barracks he fingered the onions doubtfully and inspected the strings of garlic they were apparently judged satisfactory the donkey was unloaded and led away and the cook promised to find a little something for the visitors after the long haul up inside the cooks quarters there was nervous chatter but kydds first concern was the room to his vast relief there was a large jalousie window facing north he looked out cautiously it was one of many in the outer wall whose face fell vertically from a dizzying height to the rocky flank of the mount in the next room there was a smaller window it would do he raised his eyes to the distance fornells was in plain sight and shifting to the right he saw the complex of islands and bays that was addaya perfect he would not be seen while he did the observations and the signallingit was all very possible isabella brought the cook forward mr keed this josé he shook hands aware of a shrewd look what do we do now mr keed the door was thick and had bolts but if they were discovered in their nefarious activity there could be no exit through the windowthey would be trapped my spyglass it was covered in sacking at the bottom of a washing basket he went to the window and settled down with a chair to seaward there was a bright haze this would conceal the approach of the fleet until it was about five miles offshore he hauled out renzis watch in only an hour or so there would be sudden alarm and dismay as the rumours of an english fleet took on an awful reality he must work fast methodically he quartered the country along each side of the narrow bay of fornells on one side of the entrance there was a mediumsized fort and on the other a town an army encampment was easy to see the regularity of the tents the glitter of equipment and even a caterpillar of men drilling he located and traced the road away from the base this would be the avenue for reinforcement or retreat then he switched his glass to addaya where he saw little military activity there seemed to be nothing but small fortifications and only one concentration of soldiery he searched for and found the connecting road finally he carefully scanned the countryside round and about for any evidence of defences in depth as far as a sharp seamans eye could tell there was none of significance as he had feared most troops appeared to be at fornells and would cause grievous damage to the landing there were some at addaya but not enough to indicate that they considered a landing there to be in prospect tensely he settled down to wait less than half an hour later a trumpet sounded urgently outside josé started and hissed at isabella they call th soldier to arms she told kydd kydd lifted his glass seaward but the bright haze lay uninterrupted in all directions he searched in other directions then realised it was probably fornells signalling the approach of a hostile fleet which he could not yet see in the haze kydd waited his glass trained out to sea until his heart skipped a beat as the gossamer shapes of first one then several ships appeared closehauled and standing steadily towards fornells the two s led the fleet further out he saw the frigates and in the far distance the transports there would be english soldiers aboard who before the day was out might owe their lives to kydds actions in the next few minutes isabella bring yr washing he had just rigged an endless loop of washingline passing out of one window and in the next ill have th red shirt yr ladys shawl an the pantaloons if y please a deft twist to form two bights and a clove hitch secured the shirt first by one corner and then spaced to the other the shawl and pantaloons followed then kydd hauled on his halliard the washing disappeared out of the window to hang innocently suspended along the wall outside he grabbed his glass and stared at leviathans mizzen peak until his eyes watered had bowden reached the flagship in time did they believe his improbable story minutes dragged there it was the answering pennant hoisted close up feverishly kydd hauled once more on his horizontal halliard to rotate the clothing inside around and out again the signal repeated the answering pennant whipped downhe had been seen near delirious with excitement he focused on what was next troops are concentrated at fornells m dear ill trouble you for th black bodice an that fetching yellow skirt the flagships quarterdeck was tense and silent ahead was the enemy coast the narrow entrance of fornells bay dominated by a fortress with a huge spanish flag flying defiantly a single massive peak was visible inland with a monastery or some such squarely on the summit duckworth stood with general stuart their expressions grim a gun from the fortress thudded defiance the sound and gunsmoke telling of a great thirtysixpounder or more the signal lieutenant of leviathan clattered down from the poop and saluted sir we have signals established from shore thank god said stuart what do they say quickly man er at the moment only that they have correctly authenticated then tell me when you receive anything useful the lieutenant returned to his post but was back just as quickly sir signal received enemy troops concentrated at fornells can we trust this demanded stuart it would mean postponing the assault and that im not prepared to do another signal sir negative and troops concentrated at addaya no formations at addaya that will do how far to addaya from here commodore but four miles say an hours sail we land at addaya as provided for it was hard for kydd watching a battle unfold yet having such a restricted role of activity they take no notice wailed isabella it was true far from moving away from fornells the two bigger ships moved closer followed by others kydds heart sank then in the flat image of his telescope he saw activity at the rear of the fleet ships were hauling their wind to the other tack moving back out to sea inland he saw a line of dust arising he focused on it it was a column of soldiers marching fast on the road to fornells bella quickth apron and that small curtain it would read reinforcements marching on fornells he took up his glassand his heart leaped they had not misread his signals the ships at the rear were the transports the soldiers and they were heading to addaya while the warships in the van made a feint against fornells to draw forces there it was all unfolding to those who had eyes to see it some ships advanced on the fortress others disappeared into the haze to reappear suddenly off the rockstrewn entrance to addaya boats hit the water and through his glass kydd saw them pass between two low islands and head for the shore one or two scattered guns opened fire but two frigates were in position and over the heads of the boats thundered in their broadsides there was no further firing kydd pounded his fist with glee and swung his telescope back to fornells there was chaos in the townno doubt news had reached them of the landings in addaya it gave him a piquant thrill to think that while the signal station above them was frantically passing the dread news his own signals beneath were having their contrary effect what was more significant were the soldiers now pouring out of the fort and flooding down the road where were they going were they reinforcements for addaya whatever this called for a negative and heading for fornells and kydd briskly plied his red shirt the bodice again and a womans shift when this had been completed he turned his attention back to addaya the experienced highlanders had stormed ashore and he could catch the glint of their bayonets as they spread out in the brush they were not meeting much resistance and kydd saw why the rough road away was streaming with soldiers in disorderthey were falling back not prepared to be cut off in a heroic last stand that would be a definite negative troops at addaya then now the road from fornells was streaming with men moving awayno question that these were reinforcements for addaya this was a negative then troops at fornells and suddenly kydd realised his job was done sirtheyre abandoning fornells or reinforcing addaya stuart was not to be stampeded the landings at addaya appeared to be well in handduckworth had a repeating frigate relaying news from therebut there was every reason to expect the spanish to throw everything into a savage counterattack the signal lieutenant reported once more sir theyre on the retreat from addaya stuart harrumphed and stalked up and down but there was no mistaking his look of triumph commodore duckworth however was not so easily satisfied he left the general moved to the lee side of the quarterdeck and called the signal lieutenant to him this is damned irregular sir i have not seen you refer once to your signal book and all the time youre advisin the general of the conduct of the war where is this shore station you say is passin the signals er i think mr midshipman bowden can answer to your satisfaction sir bowden touched his hat respectfully and explained mr kydd found it impractical to rig a mast and halliards ashore sir but conceived of a private code if youd take the telescope and spy out the top of mount toroyes sir more to the top of the outside wall at the endthere youll see his last hoist i see a spanish signal mast none else if youd look a little lower youll find hanging out the threeflag hoist negative at addaya i see nothing of the sort only yes sir a red minorquin shawl a black bodice and a blue pair of mens pantaloons explain damn you sir mr kydd reasoned that everything the general had to know could be sent by two significations the first location being one of fornells addaya or mercadal the other to be the military event being one of marching towards or massing at the location it requires then only a negative prefix to reverse the meaning and the code is complete and the flags we could not use our flags it would have alerted the spanish and as you can see sir the distance is too great to make out detail therefore he used colours in this way he could make use of anything as long as the colour could be distinguished red for negative white for marching towards blue for addaya yes yes i see most ingenious hmmi look forward to making further acquaintance of lieutenant kydd from his eyrie kydd watched marines make their way ashore in fornells they would take possession of the forts and the english would be established irrevocably ashore it was certain to be victoryand he had played a central part in it with a welling of contentment he raised the spyglass again to watch the consolidation at addaya we must go isabella said distracted kydd could not tear himself from his grand view and the thought of another night in a dank cave was not appealing he remembered that the next planned move was a march on mercadal close by if the english forces had reached so far already then it was more than probable they would reach the town and monte toro the next day he would sit it out where he was isabellaif y understandsid like t see how it ends can y ask josé if i could stay here tonight she left in tears of emotion and kydd resumed his vigil at his spyglass more men landed at fornells with a tug of pride kydd saw seamen rig lines ashore to land artillery pieces once there they passed draglines and began manhauling the guns along the roads inland the end could not possibly be in doubt brindemos por la victoria josés affable toast came as he handed kydd a glass of xoriguer thank yewhatever y said must say sir this is a rare drop y good self mr josé who the devil stuttered colonel paget in command of the approaching troops kydd was wearing his begrimed uniform recovered from the cave without cocked hat and sword ltenant kydd hms tenacious yr duty sir i make apology fr my appearance as you should sir the colonel replied eyeing kydd askance and may i know why you are not on your ship sir the spanish fleet at sea and not you hey hey sir ive spent several days behind th spanish lines an have not had news id be obliged if youd confide th progress of the landing i see well sir be assured were rolling up their rearguard in fine style and have this hour taken mercadal the spanish are retiring on ciudadelageneral stuart is in pursuit but has required me to take a fast column to lay against port mahon i am at this moment at the business of forming it up the spanish fleet sir yes yes paget said testily it seems they were sighted falling on us from the west and the commodore took all his ships to sea to meet em theres none still here mr kydd kydd ground his teeth and cursed his luck that morning while he had been cautiously making contact with the advancing soldiers tenacious was now possibly in a climactic battle that would decide the fate of minorca if this was the cartagena fleet they were in serious trouble sir what ships were sighted kydd asked urgently dammitfive six big ones i dont remember the colonel said clearly tiring of the exchange for kydd it was mortifying newsand left him stranded with no way to rejoin his ship but he could not stand idly by while others went on to face the enemy sir i do offer m services to ye mahon has a dockyard an big harbour and it would be very strange if there werent any ships there i could help ye secure em as prizes paget raised his eyebrows and no doubt put yourself in the way of some prizemoney kydd bristled but paget went on genially but youre in the right of it sirill need someone who knows the ropes to make sure the dons dont set the dockyard afire or any other foolishness right sir your offer is handsomely accepted do ask the quartermaster for something a little more fitting for an officer if you catch my meaning we move off at dawn in a startling mix of buff army breeches a navy lieutenants coat and an infantry cocked hat kydd went out to meet the seamen just arriving after manhauling the guns overland the pieces would soon be finding employment in laying siege to the walled town of ciudadela good lord above of what species of warrior are you sir said the young naval lieutenant in charge of them why in th uniform t be expected of the officerincharge o the naval detachment in the assault on port mahon kydd said loftily naval detachment the man said puzzled yes i mean t press half a hundred of yr men if y please a quick glance told him that at fifty men each on the dozen or so guns there were more than five hundred in all probably contributed evenly by each ship in the squadron including his own they could spare a tenth of their number press my men the lieutenant stared in amazement and began to laugh at kydds glare his mirth tailed away we must secure th dockyard board all ships in harbour and attend t any prisoners kydd said in a hard voice i dont think fifty men overmuch fr the task d you he looked past the officer at the weary men coiling down the draglines pulling off encamping kit and flexing tired muscles he strode over to them leaving the lieutenant to hurry along behind i say this is out of order sir you may not if i have t ask th colonel hell make it a hundred kydd snapped without looking back he had spotted dobbie from tenacious the stocky seamans face creased with pleasure as kydd went up to him sir never thought ter see yez again goin ashore with them dagoes dobbiei want fifty good men fr particular service in mahon seamen i must have knows the difference between a buntline and a bobstay an can be relied on in a fight aye aye sir have em mustered here for me in an hour there was one further matter he had to attend to there was every prospect of his meeting the enemy on the morrow and the quartermaster had offered him the loan of a heavy sabre or a token smallsword but neither appealed he went to an arms chest on the limber of one gun and helped himself to a cutlass this would be of use only in close quarters fighting but a defensive action was all that he expected for the seamen it was not the fine sword he had now grown used to but the heft and balance of the plain black weapon was familiar and pleasing and he slipped the scabbard into its frog settling it comfortably on his belt later that night after he had seen to his men kydd dined with the officers in their messtent it was both strange and comforting the singular appearance of the red check tartan of a regiment of highlanders with their arcane mess rituals and freeflowing whisky was another world to the ordered uniformity of a naval wardroom but the loyal toast was sturdily proposed and the same warmth of brotherhood reached out to kydd give ye joy of yr victory sir kydd acknowledged to the army captain sitting to his side the officer raised an eyebrow you think so why yes i know nothing of yr military affairs but t land and take a town seems t me to be a fine thing for such numbers the captain examined his whisky holding it to the light so the glass twinkled prettily it was fine done the landing ill grant but the general must have had inside intelligence to change the place of landing at such notice quite took the dons on the hop kydd glowed but now was not the time to claim recognition but then i dont envy quesadaan impossible task id say quesada their commander one can feel pity for the man his soldiery has rotted from too much garrison duty and theyre near useless and reinforcements all he got before you fellows cleared the seas of em was a couple of battalions of swiss the swiss kydd was hazily aware of the tangled complexity of allegiances in europe but had not heard they were at war with switzerland yes germanswiss mercenaries austrians took em prisoner then sold them to the spanish for two thaler a head not my idea of a bargain when we landed at addaya they were opposing us then your frigate let fly a broadside or two and in twenty minutes they broke and ran still runnin kydd chuckled in fact no we took a hundred deserters and told em that if they could bring in their friends wed see them right in the matter of employment genl stuart is thinking of forming up a foreign corps of some sort and now we have the lota thousand and more kydd agreed with rabble like that quesada could do nothing to stop the english then he remembered with sudden apprehension did ye see the spanish fleet at all if were beat at sea the fleet im not sure about that i did catch a sight of the spanish but they werent your big fellows only one line of guns frigates realised kydd with jubilation and last i saw of em was the gallant commodore haring off over the horizon tallyho after them with all flags flying kydd grinned so we cn sleep tight tonight but yr genral quesada has a mort t reflect on he has without command of the sea of any kind he cant get supplies or reinforcements nothing and hell never get the minorcans to fight for him so yed say weve won kydd said cautiously by no means quesada is off with the bulk of his troops to ciudadelatheir major town with city walls and fortifications a siege will be a tedious thing with no certainty at the end of it and tomorrow we march on mahon which is even more heavily fortified while we hold the country quesada will hold the townsand we cant wait for ever it was another kind of war but in the warmth of the evenings cordiality it seemed far removed yet here he was enjoying the regiments hospitality not only in the middle of enemy country but presumably on a battlefield with enemy soldiers perhaps creeping through the night whats out there i mean whats to stop th spanish coming suddenly while were enjoyin our supper kydd did not mean it to come out so nervously but he preferred the direct shiptoship fighting at sea where the foe was visible rather than the uncertainties of land well armies dont fight at night as a rule the officer said with only the glimmer of a smile but if the spanish see fit to counterattack in the darkpresuming they have precise knowledge of our positionthen first they must find a way to get past our vedettes and outer pickets before our sentinels can take alarm but even then you may sleep soundly i believe the brass baying of trumpets woke kydd before he had struggled into his clothes the stillness was rent by hoarse cries of sergeants and shouts of command from impatient officers as the camp came to life first light appeared as the soldiers bolted down their breakfast and prepared for the march buckling on equipment and loosening limbs the damp smoke of breakfast fires still hung about in the greyness of the predawn as kydd drew up his men to address them im ltenant kydd and this is th port mahon naval detachment youre not going t pull the guns any morebut you are going t march this is what th lobsterbacks call a flying column which is to say were going to move fast were heading fr port mahon an there well find a harbour and dockyard fit fr the whole o nelsons fleet but only if we take it from themthere could be quite a deal o fighting before were done but ive got no doubts about that with english hearts of oak by m side his hand dropped unconsciously to his cutlass hilt as he continued were not here t do the assault thatll be the lobsterbacks job an theyre good at it what well be doing is t wait until theyve got a breach and marched into the town then well follow and go to the harbour an set about any shipping we findnot forgettin the dockyard that the spanish dont start fireraisin there he regarded the men dispassionately lithe intelligent these were the skilled seamen who were achieving more at sea than any before them and he felt a deep pride so well be on our way this is kanes highway to mahon an it was laid by us eighty years ago now lets use it but they had to stand aside as the professionals formed up scouts clattered off ahead into the early morning and others fanned out to each side of the lineofmarch yet more galloped urgently backwards and forwards for some arcane military reason finally officers on splendid horses took their place at the head of their men and with a squeal and drone of bagpipes skirling and the rattle and thump of drums the column set off kydd had refused a horse feeling unable to ride while his men marched but after the first hour he regretted the decision it was good to swing along to the stirring music seeing the soldiers moving ahead economically and fast but he was unused to the discipline of the march and felt increasingly sore after five miles they reached the small market town of alayor the inhabitants watched them pass some with grave expressions others fearful on the far side they stopped for fifteen minutes rest the soldiers joked and relaxed some not even bothering to sit but the sailors squatted or sat in the dust a cheerful sun was abroad when they got under way once more there were no disturbances or threats of attack and after another five miles in a countryside of sinister quiet they were pressing close to port mahon a halt was called while the town was still hidden in the low hills ahead orange orchards and neat garden plots betraying its proximity but there was no sign of the enemy could it be that they were lying concealed waiting for the whole column to enter before springing their ambush the soldiers did not appear unduly concerned and kydd reasoned that as the detachment was only about three hundred strong it was more a reconnaissance in force than an assault and could withdraw at any time his worries subsided then his mind supplied a new concern was the main body for the real assault approaching from another direction the anxieties returnednot that he had any doubts about his courage but as an officer of rank what would be expected of him should the army beat to quarters he forced his eyes closed sir kydd opened his eyes and saw a youthful subaltern saluting him in the odd army fashion with the palm outwards colonel paget desires you should wait on him at the head of the column paget was at the centre of an animated group of officers each apparently with a personal view on recent events kydd took off his hat and waited for attention ah mr kydd developments he looked distracted and barely glanced at kydd scouts have returned they report that the spanish in mahon want to parley sir it could mean anything from abject surrender to an ultimatumor a spanish trick kydd told himself to control his sudden rush of excitement im inclined to take it at face value i shall go forward under flag o truce and see what they want i should be obliged if you would accompany me in case they try any knavish tricks concerning sea matters he glanced at kydd kindly remain silent during the proceedings unless you perceive anything untoward at which you will inform me never addressing the enemy do you understand aye aye sir paget heaved himself up on his horse which was patiently held by a soldier and get this man a horse for gods sake he threw at an officer as he looked down on kydds rumpled dusty appearance the little group of officers walked their horses down the road preceded by a mounted trooper holding a pennon with a vast white flag attached ahead in the distance a blob of white appeared resolving by degrees into a group which to kydd looked distinctly nonmilitary halt a trumpeter dismounted and marched smartly to the exact point of equidistance and sounded off an elaborate call there was movement among the figures opposite but no inclination to treat that kydd could discern they waited in the sun kydd could hear paget swearing under his breath his horse impatiently picking at the ground with his hoof at length there was a general advance of the whole mass towards them what the devil paget exploded stand your ground he roared back over his shoulder to his officers it was apparent that any military component of the spanish group was conspicuous only by its absence the florid garments and general demeanour of the leading members seemed more municipal than statesmanlike as they nervously approached tell em thats far enough paget told an aide ni un paso más the group stopped but a man stepped forward uneasily with an oldfashioned frilly tricorne in his hands words were spoken and the man regarded paget with a look that was half truculent half pleading sir this is antonio andreu alcalde of the councillors of mahon he wishes you a good day dammit tell him who i am and say im expecting three more battalions to arrive by the other road presently he desires to know if there is produce of the land that perhaps he can offer that you have come such a long wayred wine olives some oranges also tell him that our siege train arrives by sea tonight and before dawn mahon will be held within a ring of iron standing ready to pound his town to dust and rubble mr andreu mentions that minorca is famed for its shoes and leather harnesses which we english will have remembered from the pasti believe he is talking about our last occupation sir what does the man want for gods sake ask him sir said the lieutenant very carefully on behalf of the citizens of port mahon he wishes to surrender he what paget choked andreus face was pale he spoke briefly then handed up a polished box he offers up the keys to mahon sir but deeply regrets that he is not certain of the ceremonial form of a capitulation and apologises profoundly for any unintended slight taking a deep breath paget turned to his adjutant i cant take a surrender from a parcel o tradesmen sir it might be considered churlish to refuse they havent even got a flag we can haul down there are forms an conventions dammit an expression of submission on their part sir purely for forms sake tell emtell em this minute theyre to give three hearty hurrahs for king george they say sirer they say and what do they say sir and then may they go home at the head of his seamen kydd moved through the town they padded down to the waterfront past gaping women leaning from windows and curious knots of townsfolk at street corners most were silent but some dared cheers at the sight of the english sailors the dockyard was deserted there was a brig under construction but little other shipping that left only the boom set across the harbour further along helpful townsfolk pointed it out then found them the capstans to operate it there was little else that kydd could think to do it was a magnificent harbour with its unusual deep cleft of water between the heights where the main town appeared to be it was long and spacious its entrance flanked by forts out to sea were the menowar of the royal navy once more the two frigates put about and beat upwind outside the harbour the spanish flag flew high over the forts that made the harbour impregnable to external threat the army was going to have a hard time when it came to the siege boat putting offflag o truce sir the captain of hms aurora held up his hand to acknowledge it was a rare sight as the blockade around minorca was as tight as could possibly be still the diversion from duty would be welcome heave to if you please under sail out in the open sea the boat made heavy weather of it but came on stubbornly in sheets of spray as it neared he could see only a few figures in it it was one of the straightstemmed minorcan llauds that he had seen fishing here the boat rounded to the soaring lateen sail brailed up expertly as it came lightly to leeward aurora ahoy permission t come aboard hailed the deeptanned figure at the tiller in a quarterdeck bellow to the great surprise of the frigates company agreeably passing time in watching the exchange one to come aboard bosun the boat nuzzled gently against the ships side and the figure sprang neatly for the sideropes and pulled himself aboard correctly doffing his hat first to the quarterdeck and then to the captain he was a striking character strong in the frame and attractively open in the face he was nevertheless in a wildly inappropriate mix of english army and navy uniforma spanish ruse ltenant kydd sir late o the port mahon naval detachment t colonel paget his english was faultless if individual what may we do for you lieutenant the captain of aurora said carefully sir colonel paget desires y should not fire on th spaniards on any account but that ye proceed into harbour without delay i see i should sail my frigate under the guns of the fortress yonder and forget the presence of the boom across to the lazareto oh pay no mind t the boom sir weve just triced it in this hour are you not forgetting something lieutenant sir that fortress flies the spanish flag which i have observed unchanged these three days ahi should explain colonel paget came upon the town which surrendered a little precipitate before they could fin a military man yr flag flies above fort san felipe where the only soldiers are t be found the fort is in ruins havin been demolished by the spaniards t discommode us but the soldiers say they wont surrender until theyve found the kings lieutenant and get a proper ceremony meanwhile sir we have the possession and occupation o the whole port if yed kindly sail upon mahon directly the colonel will be obligedhe is anxious to make inventory of the ships and stores that have fallen into our hands chapter the ordered calm and routine aboard hms tenacious was a welcome reassurance of normality and kydd paced the decks with satisfaction his ship was now moored inside the deep emerald harbour of port mahon with the rest of the fleet watering parties were ashore in cala figuera kydd contemplated the prospect of an agreeable summons from the commodore in the near future it had been an extraordinary achievementthe entire island was now in english hands from the time of landing to capitulation no more than a week on their side without any loss and he had played what must surely be seen as a central part in the success sir if y please one of the smaller midshipmen tugged at his sleeve he turned frowning at the impropriety then softening at the boys anxiety to please aye mate o the watch sends his duty an the commodore would be obliged should you spare him an hour thank ye said kydd a little surprised at the informality he had been expecting something of a rather more public character but supposed that this was preparatory only after all while this was a commodore he did not have the standing and powers of a full admiral any form of honours would have to come from the commanderinchief admiral nelson still in naples his heart beat faster after reporting to captain faulkner in full dress uniform as befitting a visit to the flagofficer he was stroked across to leviathan in the gig thinking warmly that life could not be bettered at that moment the day before he had come back aboard and spent an uproarious evening in the wardroom telling of his adventure being heartily toasted in the warmth of deep camaraderie now dare he think it he had been noticed and therefore was on the golden ladder of preferment and success his instinct had been rightnelson was showing the way seize the moment when it came he was politely received by a flaglieutenant and conducted to the commodore in his great cabin ah kydd sit ye down i wont be long duckworth said waving kydd to a chair the commodore was writing a frown on his open face as he concentrated on the task he finished with a scrawl and put his pen down with a sigh ltenant kydd he said heavily i do believe that you should bear much of the credit for the success of this expedition from what i hear your initiative and courage did much to secure the safety of the force do tell me now what happened kydd began careful to be exact in his recollections for this would be a matter of record for all time but as he proceeded he became uneasily aware that he did not have the commodores full attention he fiddled with his pen squared his papers inspected the back of his hand somewhat put out kydd completed with a wry account of his boarding of the frigate and told him of the conclusion of hostilities but the commodore failed to smile duckworth stood may i take the hand of a brave man and a fine officer he said directly fixing kydd in the eye i see a bright future for you sir kydd glowed good day to you mr kydd the commodore said and took up his papers once more kydd hovered uncertainly what is it mr kydd the commodore said testily sir dare i say it but should i be mentioned in yr dispatches id be infinitely obliged if youd spell m name with a ykydd sir not like the pirate kidd there had been instances of promotion awarded for valour to the wrong officer entirely which regrettably it was impossible to undo at the admiralty duckworth leaned back eyeing kydd stonily the dispatches for this engagement will be written by another i haul down my flag tomorrow mr kydd at a loss kydd excused himself and withdrew i would have thought somethin a bit more rousin kydd said morosely not sure at all of what had been transacted in the great cabin adams was sympathetic and put down his book on the wardroom table they were alone and kydd had returned disconsolate from what should have been a memorable interview luck o the draw old trout youll understand that duckworth is out of sorts his mission complete he has to strike his flag and revert back to plain old captain now but his dispatches dispatches hes not the expedition commander tom stuart is and ive strong reason to know from a friend at headquarters that hes a man to seize all the credit that can be scraped together his dispatches will say nothing of the navyall we did was sally out to meet half a dozen spanish frigates which instantly put about and had the legs of us no creditable battle no mention for anyone i shouldve smoked it kydd said stuart was certainly the kind of man to dim anothers candle in order that his become the brighter so the general wont want th world to know that hed got special intelligence as would give him th confidence to stretch out an take minorca i fear that must be the case adams murmured i was present at th takin of port mahon kydd continued stubbornly dear chap any battle won swiftly efficiently and with the minimum of bloodshed must be a bad battle by any definition for your triumph and glory you need a good butchers bill one that has you bloodsoaked but standing defiant at the end tho many at your side do fall and we had the bad luck to lose not a single man youre bein cynical i believe adams shrugged besides m name must be mentioned once in high places in the navy must it not adams gave a small smile i should think not the successful practice of creeping abroad at night is not an accomplishment that necessarily marks out a future admiral as he strolled along in the sun with renzi on the road to mahon kydd brooded no doubt there would be other opportunities for dash and initiative but unless a similar conspiracy of circumstances came up how was he to be noticed duty was not enough he must show himself of different timbre from the others they had landed below george town es castell as it was now known from there it had been a precipitous pathway to the topthe harbour of port mahon was a great ravine in a high plateau opening to a capacious sea cove three miles long the town of mahon was perched along the top the skyline an exotic mix of medieval casements churches windmills and several inclined roadways to the waters edge a pleasant two miles of open country lay ahead wearing plain clothes in deference to the sensibilities of the inhabitants they passed through es castell a relic of past english occupation still with its paradeground foursquare in the centre and found the road west to mahon so grateful to the spirit renzi mused at sea there was a constant busyness even in the most placid of days the flurry of waves the imperceptible susurrus of breeze around the edge of the sails and the many random sounds of a live ship were a constant backdrop to life aboard it was only on land where a different quietude reigned that its absence was noticed kydds naturally happy temperament bubbled to the surface s many windmillsyoud think it norfolk or kent yet the soil is poor and difficult of cultivation i think said renzi as they passed tiny gardenlike plots and endless drystone walls a little further on the wafting scent of orange groves filled the air but there could be compensations in front of each white stone farm there was a distinctive gate of charming proportions an inverted v probably made from the ubiquitous wild olive wood the road wound round the end of a deep cleft in the cliffs a sea cove a quarter of a mile deep with buildings on the flat ground at its head kydd recognised it as the chief wateringplace cala figueraenglish cove the english ships tenacious among them were clustered there mahon could be seen ahead past a racket court in use by two rowdy midshipmen the houses by degrees turning urban and sophisticated the two nodded pleasantly to local people in their pretty gardens kydd wondered how he would feel if conquering officers passed his front door nevertheless there was more than one friendly wave several paths and avenues led from the one they were on and it became clear that they needed directions knock on th door kydd suggested after some minutes they heard que quiere a short man wearing round spectacles emerged suspiciously ah we are english officers er inglese kydd tried renzi smiled your italian does you credit my friend but what is more needed now goodness gracious me both turned in astonishment at the perfect english so soon butdare i be as boldyour honourable presence is made more welcome by your absence these sixteen year kydd blinked er may we ask if this is th right road fr mahon ah so many years have i not heard this word only the english call it marnthe spanish is mahon but we minorquin call it mao you see then you are certainly on the highway to ciudad maoforgive me it has been many years sadly though you will now find mao in the comfortable state we call siesta he drew himself up but gentlemen it would be my particular honour to offer you the refreshments of the road you are too kind sir renzi said elegantly with a bow they were soon seated in an enchanting arbour in a small garden at the front of a mediterranean white house all set about with myrtle jasmine and vines and with a splendid view down into the harbour the man withdrew and they heard shrill female protests overborne with stern male tones before he reappeared my apologies i am don carlos pina a merchant of oil of olive the officers bowed and introduced themselves a lady wreathed in smiles appeared with a tray murmuring a politeness in what kydd assumed was mahonese on the tray he recognised xoriguer and there were sweetmeats that had him reaching out ah those are the amargos if they are too bitter please to try the coquinyales here pina spoke to the woman who coloured with pleasure my wife remember what you english like the crunchy anisette indeed complemented the gin and lemon cordial but kydd had to say what was on his mind d ye please tell me sir why you are not offended at our bein here pina smiled broadly our prosperity is tied to the english when you left in eightytwo our trade suffer so cruel where before we trade with the whole world now by chance it will return im sure it will renzi contributed pina flourished the xoriguer i toast his majesty king georgeking george th three i hope he enjoy good health he added anxiously he is still our gracious sovereign renzi replied please gentlemen you may toast to the return of lady fortune to minorca renzi asked earnestly sir this is such an ancient island the moors romans phoenicianssurely they have left their mark on the land perhaps curious structures singular artefacts there is no end of them pina said brightly but there are also the navete of the talaiotbefore even the roman they build boats of stone no man know what they are we never go near he crossed himself fervently bobbing his head excellent said renzi and if you are interested in minorca good sir i recommend to your attention the town of migjorn gran in which you will find many learned in the ancient ways of our island kydd put down his glass and mao is not far ahead im delaying you pina said in consternation before you leave the abrazo to kydds embarrassment he was seized in an embrace so now you are for us the hermanito our ver good friend mahon bustled with excitement it seemed a declaration of open trade was to be gazetted immediately by the english and merchants scurried to prepare for prosperous times the dignified but sleepy town was waking up and the purposeful hurry of the population was in marked contrast to kydd and renzis leisured pace noble churches stood among a maze of busy streets an ancient archway glowered at the top of one and there were shops of every sort between lofty residence with balconies kydd was charmed by the little town which had in parts an almost english reserve on impulse he stopped as they were passing a handicrafts shop nicholas id like t take something o minorca back to m mother as a remembrance a piece o lace they entered the quiet interior of the shop it took a few seconds for kydds eyes to adjust to the gloom after the glare of the sun but then he saw the girl behind the counter er can i see y lacefor m mother he tailed off seeing her grave attention but she gave a delighted squeal you are engliss que suerte haberte conocido i always want to meet an engliss gentleman my mother she say if we are to make the cloisters by angelus we must step out said renzi sharply cloisters said kydd distracted we have much yet to admire brother tenacious was first to be warped across the harbour to the dockyard for survey she had suffered at the nile with her lighter framing and a worrying increase in bilge pumping was possibly the result of a shot taken between wind and water it did not take long to find the cause two balls landing not far apart below the waterline had damaged a run of several strakes they would have to be replaced with the ship canted to one side by capstans to expose her lower hull she was barely inhabitable and with the prospect of possibly months at the dockyard her officers quickly realised that lodgings ashore would be much more agreeable the best location was evident carrer san roc in the centre of mahon where fine townhouses in the english style were to be readily engaged a small but comfortable establishment with quaint furniture from the reign of one of the previous georges met the bill and kydd and renzi moved in without delay it was a capital headquarters for further exploration of the island renzi laid down his reflections on the culture and antiquity of iberia it is said that the western ciudadela is of quite another character he mused nursing his brandy suffered cruelly from the turks but still retains splendid edificesbut the people are of the castilian spanish and have no love for an englishman kydd picked up a dogeared newspaper and settled into his highbacked chair an i heard frm one o the midshipmen that t take away a boat and sail around the island would be prime theres snug coves an beaches all up the coast where then is your warlike ardour your lofty aspirations to laurels with our ship in dock little chance t find such but there are compensations kydd said with a private smile and raised his paper again oh renzi said nicholas i saw loves labours lost is t be staged tonight do ye fancy t attend at all well if we unfortunately the captain wants t sight m journals i must complete em but do go yself i beg actually this volume is an engrossing account of your hispanic in all his glory i rather fancy i shall spend a quiet evening here nicholas m friend you will do yr eyes a grievous injury with all this readin in th big church theyre presentin a concert o music especially t welcome the english why not go an enjoy this theres all yr favourite composers er pergylasy and i see i must renzi said flatly and kydd coloured later leaving for the concert he nearly collided with someone walking in haste he had last seen her at the lace counter kydd had to admit the forced idleness was not altogether an imposition he was seated at a table in a small taberna with renzi enjoying a good bottle of red wine and the fine view from their position at the top of the clifflike edge of the town into the glittering emerald length of the harbour yr good health nicholas he said complacently raising his glass a most underrated and priceless gift renzi murmured lifting his glass and staring into it er wha robust health in course brother worth more than diamonds and rubies this can never be bought with coinit is always a gift from nature to man which never asks aught in return just so nicholas but do you mark that barque comin around th point shes english this was a welcome sight in the mediterranean that before nelsons victory had been cleared of english flagged vessels a merchantman kydd said lazily and pulled out his little spyglass cautious master fat n comfortablewonder what shes carryin the vessel went into the wind brailing up and coming to a standstill lines were carried ashore by boat and in one movement the ship was rotated seaward again and brought alongside the landingplace near the customs house just below where they sat curious kydd focused on a colourful group on her after deck from attentions given they must be passengers and important ones at that the brow was quickly in place for their disembarkation before the sailors had even begun snugging down to a good harbour furl something about one of them however caught his attention unconscious cues in the way she walked the movement of her hands which he knew so well nicholasid swear it must be he jumped to his feet im goin down its cecilia a narrow inclined pathway zigzagged to the water and kydd hurtled down it then finally emerged on to the busy wharf cecilia ahoy he shouted waving furiously but an opentopped carriage drove away just as he came close he stared after it foolishly but a womans voice behind him squealed thomas is that you he turned to see his sister flying towards him my darling brother she said happily embracing him when she released him her eyes were glistening cecwhat are y doing here were to establish in minorca thomas lord stanhope is to treat with the austrians tobut why are you here kydd pointed across the harbour to where the ugly bulk of tenaciouss hull lay on its side this is now th home of the royal navy in the mediterranean cec and tenacious is bein repaired a disgruntled wharfinger touched his hat with one finger wherem they ter take yer baggage then miss thomasi have to go where can i see you again an its a shillun an hour ter wait for yez the arms were folded truculently here sis kydd pulled out one of his newprinted calling cards tonight its t be a rout fr all handsan youre invited the evening promised to be a roaring successother than renzi no officer had met kydds sister and all were bowled over he had to admit it cecilia was flowering into a real beauty her strong character now veiled beneath a sophistication learned from attending many social events in her position as companion to lady stanhope but what really got the occasion off to a splendid start was the discovery that cecilia had been in london when the news of the great battle of the nile had broken oh you cannot possibly conceive the noise the joy all of london in the streets dancing shouting fireworksyou couldnt think with all the din there were rumours for weeks before its true but you must know we were all in a horrid funk about the french all we heard was that admiral nelson had missed the french fleet and it was taking that dreadful general buonaparte to land an army on us somewhereyou cannot imagine what a panic then captain capel arrived at the admiralty with dispatches and the town went mad every house in masses of illuminations bells ringing cannon going off lady spencer capering in admiralty house the volunteers drilling in horseguards firing off their musketsi cant tell you how exciting it was under the soft touch of the candlelight her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes hushed the room and had many an officer looking thoughtful lord stanhope would not be denied and we left england immediately for gibraltar for he had instructions to establish in the mediterranean as soon as it was practical it wasnt long before we heard that minorca was takenand so here we are and right welcome y are cecaint that so nicholas his friend sat back but his eyes were fixed on cecilias as he murmured an elegant politeness she smiled sweetly and continued gaily thomas really it was quite incrediblein every village we passed they had an ox roast and such quantities of people supping ale and dancing on the green in the towns they had special illuminations like a big hn or an anchor in lights and several times we were stopped until wed sung rule britannia twice it was strangely moving to hear of the effect of their victory in his fardistant home country so jack tar is well esteemed now sis kydd said lightly cecilia looked at him proudly youre our heroes now she said our heroes of the nile youre famousall of you theyre rising and singing in your honour in all the theatres theres poetry ballads broadsheets printstheres talk that admiral nelson will be made a duke and that every man will get a medal theres been nothing like it this age i swear kydd hurried into their drawing room nicholas weve been noticed m friend this card is frm the lord stanhope expressin his earnest desire t hear of the famous victory at th first handthats us i believeat afternoon tea at the residency on friday so if this is a species of invitation dear chap then it follows that it should contain details of our expected attire the an heres a note from cecilia she says lady stanhope will be much gratified should we attend in full dress uniform it was odd on the appointed day to leave their front door and simply by crossing the road and walking to the end of the street to be able to present themselves at the door of lord stanhopes discreet mansion such was the consequence of the english propensity to stay together lieutenants kydd and renzi kydd told the footman it seemed that the noble lord could afford english domestic staff but then he remembered that stanhope was in the diplomatic line and probably needed to ensure discretion in his affairs they entered a wide hallway where another servant took their cocked hats kydd was awed by the gold filigree on the furniture the huge vases the rich hangingsall spoke of an ease with wealth that seemed so natural to the highborn he glanced at renzi who came of these orders but saw that his friend had a withdrawn preoccupied look they moved on down the passage my dear seaheroes both cecilia was in an ivory dress in the new highwaisted fashionwhich gave startling prominence to her bosom kydd saw with alarm they entered a drawing room and kydd met for the first time since very different circumstances in the caribbean the lord stanhope and his wife he made a leg as elegantly as he could aware of renzi beside him dear mr kydd how enchanting to meet you again the last time lady stanhope had seen him was in the caribbeanas a young seaman in charge of a ships boat in a desperate bid to get vital intelligence to the british government seaflower cutter in which the stanhopes had been travelling was beached ashore after a storm lord stanhope although injured could not wait for rescue and kydd had volunteered to take to sea in the tiny vessel your servant kydd said with growing confidence matching his bow to the occasion and mr renzi pray do take some tea cecilia the formalities complete they sat down kydd manoeuvred his delicate porcelain cup manfully privately reflecting on the tyranny of politeness that was obliging him to drink from a receptacle of such ridiculous size now you must know we are beside ourselves with anticipation to hear of nelson and his glorious triumph do please tell usdid you meet sir horatio himself suddenly shy kydd looked to renzi but his friend gave no sign of wishing to lead the conversation he remained reserved and watchful aye i didtwice he spoke t us of our duty and it was easy to go from there to the storm the longdrawnout chase the final sighting and the great battle itself at that point he saw cecilias intense interest and felt awkward but again renzi seemed oddly introspective and offered no help he therefore sketched the main events of the contest and concluded his account with the awesome sight that had met their eyes on the dawn and their rapturous welcome at naples well i do declare this will all be talked about for ages to come there can be no doubt about it pray where is sir horatio at the moment is he not with the fleet here no yr ladyship hes still in naplesy understand the king o naples has been uncommon kind t us in the matter of fettlin the ships an entertaining us after our battle and he tailed off as he noticed stanhopes eyes narrowing suspiciously hell probably be with us directly he sipped his tea although it was now tepid his admirals disposition was no business of his and he could not understand stanhopes disquiet now would be a good time for renzi to contribute a sage comment on the strategic implications of their victory but annoyingly he sat still as a statue staring into space with unfocused eyes er i think it has somethin to do with the admiral wanting t rouse em up to face the french an with the austrians our er friends t helpnot forgettin that the queen o naples is sister t the emperor he added weakly the late emperor stanhope corrected automatically but his frown had deepened and kydd felt out of his depth sir if yed be s kind can we know how th news has been received aroun the world certainly stanhopes face cleared yet first i could not forgive myself were i not at this point to express my deepest satisfaction in your change of fortune your conduct in the caribbean will never be forgotten by me and it must be to the countrys great benefit that your resolution and professional skill has been so justly recognised cecilia clasped her hands in smothered glee and kydd flushed i do also remember your particular friend he directed a meaningful look at renzi whose attention seemed to snap back to the present indeed sir renzis distracted look was replaced by urbanity i have the liveliest remembrance myself of past days not all of which have been tranquil relieved kydd let renzi continue it would seem however that we have been attended by a very welcome measure of success that should be a caution to all stanhope smiled grimly there are nations who have sought to find common cause with the french now they are obliged to gaze upon their great buonaparte stranded helpless a prime spectacle chuckled kydd do ye think hell last long he may flounder about win a battle or two against the indolent turks who inhabit that part of the world but the great sand deserts that ring him about will end his ambitions before long you can be sure kydd turned to renzi but his look of distraction had returned it was not in character and kydd felt unease which deepened when renzi did not appear to have noticed that the talking had stopped cecilia leaned across nicholas is anything wrong youre as quiet as a mouse renzi looked at her unhappily er today i received a letter he swallowed from my mother chapter renzi stared into the fire as it crackled and spat sending sparks spiralling up the inns chimney winter in england was a sad trial after the mediterranean he snuggled deeper into his coat and sipped his toddy his mothers letter pleading that for her sake he return had come as a shock his father was in such a towering rage at his continued absence that he was now making her life unbearable in halifax renzi had received a letter from his brother richard advising him that his brother henry was trying to have renzi declared dead so that he could assume the place of eldest son this had been easily dealt with renzi had immediately sent a letter to his father calmly setting out the reasons why he had chosen his term of exile and informing him of his elevation to the quarterdeck as a kings officer his fathers contemptuous reply had dismissed any justification of conduct based on moral grounds and had demanded he return instantly to answer for his absence renzi had decided to face him when tenacious returned to england but his mothers letter had forced the issue with the mediterranean quiet and his ship in the dockyard for some time there had been no difficulty in securing leave and he had taken passage in a dispatch cutter to falmouth then a coach to exeter and the bleak overland trip to wiltshire he was staying overnight in the local inn and had sent ahead for a carriage knowing that this would serve as warning of his arrival tomorrow he would return to eskdale hall the seat of the laughton family and the earl of farndon since king henrys day it had been nearly seven years and renzi had changed gone was the careless unthinking man who had dissipated so much of his youth and means on his grand tour and he was no longer the naive young fellow who had been so shocked by what he had encountered on his return that he had taken the moral course of selfexile for a term of five years his time on the lower deck of a manowar had shaped him hardened him now he looked at life with a detached farseeing regard there would have to be a reckoning however for as eldest son his situation was circumscribed by custom and law he felt the chill of foreboding the long night ended with a cold dawn and after a frugal breakfast renzi waited on the benches outside trying to let the sights and smells of the country enter his soul once more but the bleakness and mud were depressing eventually the carriage came into view its gleaming black sides spattered with winter grime the coachman and footman wore careful blank faces but the noble family crest on the door seemed accusing renzi settled into the cushionsdespite everything he could feel himself assuming only too easily the mantle of the highborn with its habits of hauteur and expectations of deference they reached the local village of noakes poyle where many of the estate labourers lived as they clattered through the cramped high street he caught sight of old shops the busy market besmocked agricultural workers respectfully touched their forelocks all conspired to peel away the years and thrust him back to what he had been out into the country again they turned into a road with an elegant goldfiligreed iron gate old lawrie emerged from the gatehouse grinning like a boy oi see thee well master nicholas sir he asked it was the first cheeriness renzi had experienced since he arrived the carriage pulled grittily up the drive which flanked by trees led to the splendour of eskdale hall he could see figures assembling on the front lawn the servants turning out to mark his homecoming he forced a composure the carriage began its final wide curve towards the house and renzi found himself searching for familiar faces friendly looks then saw his parents standing together at the top of the steps the carriage swept past the servants and came to a halt the footman got down and swung out the step renzi descended amid a deathly hush he went up to greet his mother and father his mother was set and pale her hands clasped in front of her the ninth earl of farndons granite expression showed no emotion father renzi said formally extending his hand it was coldly ignored renzi felt the old anger and frustration build but clamped a fierce hold on himself he bowed politely then turned to his mother who stood rigid staring at him as if he were a ghost then he noticed the glitter of tears and went to her holding her feeling her fierce embrace and hearing just one tearing sob before she pulled away and resumed her position next to his father for a long moment there was silence then his father turned on his heel and went inside his mother reached out and took his hands go to him nicholas she said her face a mask renzi followed his father into the dark woodpanelled main study close the door boy the earl snapped and took his seat behind the desk more usually employed for dealing with tenants behind in their rent renzi was very aware of how little provocation might set tempers ablaze his father barked an explanation if you please sir renzi took a deep breath i find i have nothing to add that i have not set out in my letter father dont feed me that flimflam about moral duty again his father roared his face red eyes glinting dangerously i want to hear why youve seen fit to disappear for years absenting yourself from your rightful place of duty to sir ive as lively a sense of duty as any sir youre a damned poltroon if you think theres an answer in running away renzi felt his selfcontrol slip he had taken to logic and rationality as a means of establishing ascendancy over his own passions and it had served him wellbut now he could feel building within him the selfsame passionate anger at his fathers obstinacy that had prompted him to leave father i made my decision by my own lights whether right or wrong it was done and cannot now be undone he forced himself to appear calm it were in both our interests to recognise this and address the future instead they locked eyes then unexpectedly his father grunted and said very well well talk more on your future here later renzi got to his feet but the earl did not go and make your peace with your mother nicholas he said bleakly she was waiting in the blue room shall we meet the rest of the family nicholas she said brightly they are so looking forward to seeing you they were assembled in the drawing room and renzi was gratified to see richard whom he had last seen in very different circumstances in jamaica where richard owned a sugar plantationthey exchanged a brotherly grin fourteenyearold edward had no doubt about a welcome and little beatrice shyly dropped him a curtsy a warning glance from his mother prepared him for his next younger brother henry are you keeping well tolerably tolerably was all the answer renzi knew he was going to get from that sullen young man and he turned back to the others nicholas old fellow weve missed you richard said breezily why dont we take a turn round the estate before we dine and see whats changed you dont mind mama as soon as they were out of earshot richard dropped the jolliness and looked at renzi keenly i hope you dont believe i broke confidences when i told mother you were safe and well and had taken to seafaring she did so grieve after you nicholas no richard it was kind in you i should have considered her more father was in such a fury when you lefthe swore he would whip the hide from you when you returned then when you did not he went into himself if you understand me mama dared not tell him ofof where you were the shame would have been too much renzi said nothing his time before the mast had been hard and the experience was burned in his memory but it was also the first time he had felt truly a man he had won his place in this world by his own courage skill and fortitudeand the depth of friendships forged in the teeth of gales and at the cannons mouth it was wildly at odds with life ashore and he had lived life to the full he would never forget it as they talked they passed so many things of his childhood remembrance the highwalled garden the winding path to the woodland park the pond where once he had ducked henry for impudence so much of his life was rooted here renzi supposed that he would dress for dinner his luggage did not cover more than travel clothing to his wry amusement the odd things he had left here did not fit his now strong spare figurehis father would have to take him as he was the meal began stiffly no one could ignore the glowering presence of his father at the head of the table renzi once more at his right hand fortunately richard sat opposite and took a wicked delight in teasing out amiable platitudes to the point of absurdity much to their mothers bafflement and their fathers fury but it eased renzis feelings henry sat further down pale features set eyes fixed balefully on his elder brother so you conceived it a duty to go on a boat as a common sailor then praise be that you have regained your senses and are restored to us renzi half smiled its said that sea air is a sovereign remedy is this why the king takes the waters at weymouth i have found it the most salubrious of all in the world henry smiled thinly no doubt of it nicholas do tip us some sea canti find excessively droll jack tars way with words so plainspeaking as we might say boys their mother reproved them in much the old way remember where you are i will not have bickering at the table uncharacteristically his father had made no contribution although renzi had felt his eyes on him when the cloth was drawn and the brandy made its appearance he spoke you others get out i want to speak to nicholas meekly they followed their mother from the room leaving the earl and renzi alone in the candlelight renzis father drew a candle to him and lit a cigar puffing until it drew to his satisfaction renzi watched not moving his brandy remained untouched help yourself my son his father rumbled and pushed the humidor across the table thank you sir but ive lost the habit of late renzi said carefully a cigarsmoking able seaman was such a bizarre concept that despite the circumstances he felt a smile tug at his lips suit yourself then he inspected the end of the cigar closely then opened with the first salvo i mean to hear your intentions sir youve come to your senses at last and have returned but ive heard no talk that you plan to take up your place here youre the eldest and one day eskdale hall goes to youbut youve shown no interest in the estate management tenant rolls income how do you expect to run the damned place without you know how the blue cigar smoke spiralled up into the blackness while his father fixed him with a glare of unsettling intensity sir as a sea officer renzi began it is not acceptable that i leave the ship without so much as a byyourleave there are forms customs of humbug youre no jackmehearty sailoryoure heir to an earldom of england which you seem to have forgotten i want you herenow when is it to be ii need time renzi said defensively to settle my affairs youll give me a date when youll present yourself now sir not when you see fit father i said i needed time impatience will add nothing to then dammit get on with it their talk did not stop until past midnight renzi knew that he was only delaying the inevitable of course he had been aware from childhood that in the fullness of time under the rules of primogeniture he was destined to be an earl and the master of eskdale hall it was natural it was expected and he had never devoted much thought to it his father had accepted his grand tour without a word the sowing of wild oats was almost expected of him then the swaying body in the barn and the burning shame of witnessing his fathers summary dismissal of the broken familys claims had changed him his highminded exile at sea however had had unforeseen results apart from the insights into human nature that the focsle of a manowar had provided he had found that much of his booklearning had come to life it had so much more meaning in the context of the sea and exotic shores how easily could he turn his back on it on the staircase candle in hand he knew there had to be a resolution he blew out the candle turned and tiptoed down again until he came to a small window the catch was still the same the window stiffly protesting but then his childhood escape route was open to him it was the work of moments to swing out into the night and down the matted ivy to the flowerbed a cold winters moon rode high and serene bathing the slumbering countryside in brightness he strode forward following the near invisible but wellremembered little path to the woodland letting the air clear his head he entered the woods a curious owl gave a low hoot and he heard scurrying in the bracken nocturnal animals surprised at finding him suddenly among them there was no avoiding the fact that his father wanted him installed at eskdale hall with no further waste of timeprobably because he wished to devolve management of the estate on renzi so that he could spend more of the season in london where he kept up the pretence of attendance at the house of lords nevertheless whatever the reason he must consider his retirement from the sea but his heart rebelled he had found himself on the ocean much as his friend kydd had done albeit in a different way he relished the paradoxical freedoms it gave there could be no care for the morrow when his actions were preordainedhe could not alter the course of the ship or wish it elsewhere so his horizon must shrink to the compass of that snug little world all else was in vain relieved of worldly fretting his mind could expand and soar in a way that was impossible with the distractions of land and now with the intelligent and worldly company of a whole wardroom of officers he could find an agreeable conversation at any time of the day or night and there was thomas kydd a friend like no other who had seen him through grave and wild situations in a voyage round the world now they must part kydd was growing confident and ambitious in his profession and would no doubt go on to achieve wondrous things while he his father was in robust good health and might haunt him for many more years to come renzi would be confined to the endless social round of the country where a major excitement was the arraigning of a horsethief it was gallingbut there was no middle way and it was becoming more than plain that perhaps his father was right renzi had used exile as a means to escape his situation the realisation stopped him cold was he indeed running away did he not know his own mind suddenly a shadow loomed dark against the moonlight and a blow thumped off his ribs as a heavy man brought him to the ground renzi twisted away and pulled himself upright seeing the silhouette of a raised cudgel he drove inside it cannoning into the mans stomach the man staggered back but when renzi stepped into a patch of moonlight he stopped is ut you sir master nicholas renzi took a breath to steady himself it is mr varney this will teach me not to creep about at night like a poacher you did right and i apologise if you were winded he came down early for breakfast the years of watchkeeping at sea had made late rising distasteful to him and he was surprised to see his father sleep well renzi thought he detected a sly undertone and answered neutrally as may be expected father attending the assizes today do you want to come whatshisnamejumpedup magistratewont do as hes told need to learn him some manners do you good to take in a piece of the real world renzi could not trust himself to say anything civil and remained silent come to any conclusions yet i want to be able to say something in the house about the rents bill at the february sessions if you take my meaning sir ive been plain with youthis is not something i can arrange immediately it takes and ive been plain with you sir my patience is wearing thin your boat will float without you on it damn it all all it takes is a date i can work to for gods sake renzi stood up boiling i find i must take some exercise he said thickly then left the room trembling he stalked over the straw and mud of the stables forecourt shouting for the groom prince the fine black gelding was still in his stall and miraculously remembered him the horse nuzzled his hand with a now greyfringed muzzle renzis eyes smarted as he swung into the saddle clopped noisily out of the yard then broke into a gallop on the long stretch of grass to the front gate he pulled up panting and wheeled about to take the long way round the boundary of the estate a coppice worker going to the woods looked up in astonishment mrs rattray fat and buxom stood at her cottage door and waved shyly further along chickens scattered with loud squawks ahead of him nearby lived the simple woodcutter jarge who had been told time and again to keep them cooped renzi felt a lump forming in his throat his canter dropped to a walk and his eyes took in the landhis land his tenants his people if he wanted them powerfully startling him with its intensity came the sudden knowledge that at that moment he did not he was not yet ready to leave the sea life in all its terror and beauty for this however comfortable and secure he could not he whipped prince to a gallop and screamed defiance into the wind then he became aware of the thud of hoofs out of rhythm behind him he snatched a backward glance and saw his father low on his horses neck striping his mount mercilessly renzi swerved aside and headed for a gnarled oak tree standing stark and alone in the middle of the field they dismounted without a word the earl tightlipped and dangerous boy i will not tolerate your peevish ways youll put your sailor days behind you and take hold of your responsibilities now damn you or ill know the reason why renzi took a deep shuddering breath he felt a lightheaded exhilaration a species of liberation no longer was he going to be in thrall to the redfaced tyrant before him he was different from the man he had once been and had seen far more of life than most sir you must allow that be damned to your arrogant posturing renzi was pale and determined he said nothing this seemed to goad his father who roared unless you see fit to return and find it in yourself to act as my son and heir i know someone who will so it had come to that renzi was tempted to dare him to do his worst but knew that once said his father would never take back his words i have told you that i cannot abandon my post damn your blood sir i will not take this but renzi had turned on his heel and led his horse away where are you going to come back this instant or iill his words were lost in a splutter as renzi walked away ill disinherit never fear sir ill do it the choking rage was fearsome but it settled the matter as far as renzi was concerned now the only way back was to grovel and beg and that he would never do he walked on the voice bellowed after him three months three months and if youre not returned i will go to law and have the title reverted i can do it do ye hear and i will do it god rot your bones chapter if theres any more o that lobster salad id be obliged kydd said lazily from the long seat in the sternsheets of the officers gig where he lay sprawled under an unseasonably warm sun no you shall not cecilia said crossly therell be none left for the others however more preserved sardine fillets it seemed were on offer the two midshipmen were ashore on the rocks of the little cove trying without success to conjure a fire to grill their fish and adams was out of sight inland the sun beamed and the plash of the waves was soothing do you not feel a pity fr genral buonaparte sis kydd teased that hes cast away in egypt with no hope o rescue him n his great army all alone in the desert i do not such a wicked man i hope the sun quite dries him up like a wizened prune kydds grin at his sisters pout broadened as he considered how things had changed for the better yeve heard were in leghorn now cecthats in the north of italy thomas im not ignorant an best of all our nel has stirred up naples enough that theyve marched north an taken rome our nel what we call admiral nelson the common sailors thomas not the officers they love him cec when we were chasin the french and everything looked so bad he called across his captains then started asking em if they were feeding the men enough onions and makes sure they get full measure o grog with wine he buys himself theyd sail through hell for himtruly and you cecilia pouted will i see you run after a man with one eye one arm the most junior admiral in the list you will cec kydd said nelson is th greatest leader i know and if he says that this is the way t do it why thats the way t do it there are some who are not so easily persuaded cecilia said archly who theyre jealous is all lord stanhope for one kydd paused stanhopes discreet position as a diplomat was mysterious and involved much travel but it was known his allegiance was to london alone his presence in minorca would not be coincidental what is he saying then well he doesnt even tell things to lady stanhope cecilia said but when he heard that sir horatio had caused king ferdinand to move on the french he was very uneasyand even the news that rome was restored didnt bring him to humour is that all well now nelson is a peer o the realmbaron nelson o the nile an theres talk that the king o naples is going to make him a duke doesnt that tell you what the world thinks of him he sat up and tested the holding of the little kedge anchor cec weve got the mongseers on the run everywhere theyre losin battlesand it could be he said with a sudden wrinkling of his brow that this war is going t be over soon sir william hamilton entered the room quietly nelson scrawling at a great rate in his peculiar crabwise fashion was at his desk by the window with its magnificent view of the bay of naples he was grey with exhaustion and his slight body seemed shrivelled but his expression nevertheless retained a fierce vitality is it true i fear so i have a letter from general mack in essence he cannot be sure of holding them even at capua its the very worst newsim sorry it had been so extraordinarily swift rome had been taken but the regrouping french had rapidly struck back vengefully striking south into the heart of the kingdom of the two sicilies and now it seemed that the austrian commander of king ferdinands forces mack with an army far larger than that of the french had contrived to lose every encounter with them so far nelson stared out of the window then said heavily our situation in leghorn becomes insupportable the grand duke must shift for himself our reputation would be irretrievably ruined should i didnt mean that nelson said testily i shall send a frigate should his household be put to hazard as it appears it will nelson threw down his quill got to his feet and paced the floor as if it were a quarterdeck charles emmanuel of sardinia escapes to cagliari now the grand duke of tuscany flees before his own peoplewhat kind of rulers are they and from london ive received only reproachesnever any soldiers how can i steady these cowardly wretches without english soldiers he stopped pacing i will leave malta to ball that is all i can retain of this shambles hamilton murmured sympathy but nelson interrupted general buonaparte to give the devil his due hes now crossed an impassable desert and kept his army together which is more than any man would credit now hes marching north into the holy land and could be anywhere god damn his french soul a young army captain covered with dust entered hurriedly and handed over a dispatch satchel sir from capua he saluted sir you might give thought to your safetynaples is in a rare state of disorder the people are terrified they are being abandoned to the french that the king will depart privily and thank you sir now go growled nelson unbuckling the satchel and scanning the single sheet he looked up slowly good god what is it mack has been defeated his army is now only a rabble more than two thousand have deserted hes lost communication with his rear theres nothing between us here and general championnets veterans nelson went to his desk and slumped into the chair he stared into space for a moment then picked up the papers he was working on and tore them up one by one when he had finished he looked up with an odd smile there is now nothing to detain us in naples you may wish to make your dispositions for leaving sir william hamilton opened his mouth but closed it again then said yes i shall be within call and left as quietly as he had arrived nelsons head drooped in despair the door opened again why whats this englands glory in a stew is e lady hamilton crossed to nelson whose face lit up the conqueror of th nile cast down for shame your ladyship has only to bestow a smile and i shall be made new again theres somethin wrong isnt there she said her hand on his shoulder nelson stood up as though to throw off her touch we are to evacuate naples i believe he said harshly that is to say the king and queen and their householdthey must not be allowed to fall into the hands of the french she went pale you meanwell we must o course but if outside from the cold corridors of the palazzo came shouts and the sound of people running she looked fearfully at nelson and the queen burst into the room siamo persi emma crossed to the frantic woman and held her stroking comforting shes hearin the tumbrels comin for her too she said the queens sister marie antoinette had been guillotined by the revolutionaries in paris non i preoccupare signora cara nelson ci sta con noi she added in spirited italian looking over her shoulder at nelson she said if were t do it proper its best we ave a good plan what are we to do admral there were ships enough vanguard lay at anchor in the bay with other warships and there were smaller vessels which nelson ordered to be prepared for the evacuation of english residents but no indication of the royal familys departure could be even hinted at as if on a visit of state sir william hamilton and admiral nelson made the short journey from the embassy to the vast palazzo reale palace to the kings of the two sicilies for centuries and a fortress in its own right your majesty nelson murmured bowing low to king ferdinand a repugnant figure with the rawboned build of a farm labourer the king had small sly eyes each side of a grotesquely long nose and gave a doltish impressionyet the safety of this monarch was nelsons prime duty do acquaint his majesty of our intentions if you please my dear emma hamilton was fast becoming indispensable with her warm practical handling of the royal couple whom she had long known not to mention her easy familiarity with the language it seemed there would be no difficulties from them as long as the queens hysteria could be kept in check nelson crossed to a window and pulled aside the curtain to peer out the waterfront was seething with angry crowds converging on the palace were not going to be able to get to the boats through that he said soberly even with a regiment of soldiers dont be fooled sir they love the king an would never ave a revolution emma came back that is quite true hamilton said the lazzaroni the common people adore their king its the lawyers and petty bureaucrats who see their opportunity at this time we must ensure that their loyalty is not tested by er their sovereigns precipitate flight sir horatio is quite right in his concerni rather fear we may find ourselves trapped here in the rich surrounds of the immense goldvaulted room they were as helpless as any felon in the local prison there is one course that we may consider hamiltons cool words were in english his warning glance at emma kept her mute it would be a coup beyond compare should the famous horatio nelson be taken by the french at all costs this must not happen i suggest that as we are english the mob will let us pass no nelson said crisply there will be another way to get them outat night perhaps we prepare for evacuation now troubridge will arrive soon and we shall conceive a plan together then might i recommend that the treasury be not left to the french it is reputed to be of several millions in specie alone there were also rich paintings hangings gilded carvings beyond countingbut these would have to remain only the state reserves could be taken darkness fell more crowds gathered below chanting and restless there would be no flight from the palace even at night troubridge arrived at last grave and polite he listened while nelson gave his orders then slipped away to prepare communications with the ships the chanting grew in volume and hamilton peeped out dare i ask that their majesties show themselves to the crowd the king and queen of the kingdom of the two sicilies appeared on the balcony of the palace to tumultuous applause bowing and waving held for an hour by the baying crowds before they could move inside pale and shaking we move the treasury to the embassy nelson snapped i want every cask and barrel that the kitchens can find and well stow it all in those the embassy in the palazzo sessa was conveniently on high ground at the back of the palace and before long gold ducats silver from a dozen countries and even gold sovereigns were being nailed into hogsheads and ankers emma loyally scrawling in chalk on each one stores for nelson the howls of the mob grew louder hamilton eased back the curtain again the streets were alive with packs of men some carrying torches others weapons theyre staying around the palace he murmured we dare not leave there goes ferreri he said and stiffened a figure in a dark cloak thrust across the waterfront road and began to board a boat not a hundred yards away the boatman gestured angrily shouting at the crowd ferreri was a valuable man to hamilton a royalist frenchman with a line to secrets within the jacobin underworld with horrifying swiftness the mob closed round him his french accent had triggered suspicions and he was dragged from the boat on to the quayside where he disappeared under a flailing pack they punched kicked and tore at the black figure until it moved no more then a rope was tied round one leg and the corpse was dragged over the cobblestones towards the palace leaving a slime of blood to glitter in the torchlight a maniac chanting started from the upturned faces below the balcony my god said hamilton they want to show the king what theyve done for him queen maria carolina dropped into a swoon the king made odd gobbling noises nelson turned to hamilton we have to leave now sir do you know the queen came to herself muttering strangely be quiet everyone emma listened intently then threw a triumphant look at nelson she says theres some kind o doora gate it connects her rooms to th old caves an passages under naples that could well be so said hamilton we know of the sottosuolo where the romans left underground catacombs and tunnels after excavating for tufo building stone huge voids some and artefacts have been found that date emma gave a twisted smile she says she hasnt told us before as shes always worried a thief might get to know of it an rob her in her sleep do any of these connect with the sea nelson demanded apparently most of them do yes hamilton said the sea nelsons cry was heartfelt to an englishman the sea was a friend a highway to freedom at which point he added hastily the molosiglio thats all i need ill get word to troubridge directly please to inform their majesties to prepare for their departure soon after midnight nelson stood grimly at the top of a dark stairway listening to the hollow sound of approaching footsteps a naval officer came into view blinking uncertainly in the bright light capn hope alcmene frigate sir with a party of men he said touching his hat well met sir shall we proceed aye aye sir light the torchesi shall go first nelson descended the dank stairs and paused at the bottom to inspect the seamen they were in their familiar sea rig and all had drawn cutlasses which gleamed in the flickering torchlight keep station on me he snapped drew his sword and plunged forward it was ghostly quiet in the ancient tunnels and stank of damp antiquity the flickering light fell on roughhewn tunnel walls and the black of anonymous voids the men hurried to keep up the only sound their footsteps and heavy breathing nelson was in front his sword at point from behind came occasional female squawks of protest but the pace never slackened a petty officer pointed to an open iron gate th entrance if y please sir beyond the stars glittered in the night sky alls well he hailed into the blackness and an anxious lieutenant appeared sir your barge is at the mole i shall not board until their majesties are safely embarked aye aye sir the lieutenant said reluctantly when the royal family arrived there were cloaks to conceal them and men to carry their belongings seamen stood guard on the short distance to the mole facing outwards with naked blades with heartbreaking sobs the queen clutching her baby was bundled aboard the admirals barge the king rigid with fear beside her were going t be jus fine sir emma said stoutly smoothing the distraught queens hair an lookin forward to a bit o sea air now arent we vanguard was soon in a state of chaos the royal family included young princes and princesses ministers ambassadorsany it seemed who feared the imminent catastropheall of whom had to be found accommodation as soon as nelson came aboard he had only one question of his flaglieutenant what is general buonaparte doing sir im truly grieved to say he has triumphed over the turks yet again at jaffa and with three thousand prisoners butchered in cold blood he is now unopposed sir jaffa was in the holy land far from the european war but ominously north of egypt and therefore in a direct path to constantinople and the trade routes east to india napoleon buonaparte had succeeded in breaking out of his desert prison and was now on the march north in a bid to outdo alexanders conquests and sir captain sidney smith begs to inform you that he is attempting a defence of acre just to the north with two sailoftheline chapter kydd stepped off the boat in acre ruefully contemplating the fortunes of war while he had succeeded in minorca he had failed to gain the notice he had sought but his part in the recapture of the island had ensured that when a lieutenant for service ashore in acre had been called for his name had been the first that was mentioned he had heard that the commander sir sidney smith was a daring unconventional officer who no doubt would welcome initiative and ambition tigre with tenacious and a hodgepodge of small fry was all that had been available to smith and he was going to try to hold on to this old town which lay directly in the path of the french advance north with a handful of troops and seamen to call on against an army of thirteen thousand with siege artillery and the legendary buonaparte at its head he could not last for long but if he could delay the french advance even for a short time perhaps the turks would take heart and make a defence of constantinople while the crew transferred his gear from tenaciouss pinnace kydd looked around it was a squarish walled town of immeasurable antiquity on a low westfacing promontory the goldenyellow stone walls were grey and gnarled with age crumbling towers and empty gun embrasures testifying to its dilapidated condition a tiny silted harbour to the southeast had been created by a mole but breaking water over rocky shoals offshore showed it was useless to larger ships the dry arid odour of sunbaked rocks was overlaid with the pungent goatlike smell of camels together with the heady aroma of spices and dried fish a small gateway opened and a marine sergeant came forward sah he said saluting smartly ltenant hewitt sah welcomes you ashore an would you come wi me kydd followed him through narrow streets swarming with people in every form of dress they emerged into a small square on one side of which was a building with a marine sentry on guard beneath a flag hanging limply inside a naval lieutenant writing at a desk looked up at kydds entry ah youre expected old fellow im hewitt third o the tigre he extended a hand and listened courteously as kydd introduced himself i expect youll be interested to know that this is pro tem the headquarters of our commander ashore and therefore our place o duty also kydds interest quickened duty ah that is our aggrieved leader being mysterious he means us to be in turn a duty officer ashore in his place we take watch n watch sleeping here where we can be found aggrieved why yesim amazed youve not heard the tale he was at toulon with hood in ninetythree personally setting the torch to near a dozen french sailotheline next he gets himself captured in a river action and is taken to paris there hes accused by our fine friend buonaparte of being an incendiary and is thrown into a condemned cell while they prepare a public trial but he made a daring escape before they could do the deed and now hes facing this same buonaparte again and vows he will make him smart for it hes really going t see out a siege against the whole french army said kydd it was bold and courageous but was smith imagining he could stand against an army of conquest with siege guns hewitt went on drily do not judge sir sidney by standards youd use on others hes unique completely fearless and most inventive in the arts of war youll find him different many dislike him for his ways as my captain ive found him amiable enough and hes devilishly well connectedhis brothers our top diplomat in constantinople and he takes his orders direct from the foreign office as plenipotentiary which has probably put our nels nose somewhat out of joint what are our orders then kydd said well both discover shortlyhes coming ashore to plan his defences hewitt looked at kydd shrewdly as i said make no hasty judgements hes damned clever and brave to a fault smith arrived promptly at noon fastidiously dressed he had made no concessions to their surroundings his uniform coat even bore the bejewelled star of some order kydd noted the delicacy of his grip as he shook his hand the sensitivity of his face conference now if you please gentlemen he led the way to an upper room with plain furniture scattered about and pulled a table to the centre there he spread out a large handdrawn map showing the land features that were necessarily missing from the familiar sea chart this gentlemen is the town of st john dacre as you can see walled around open ground without two sides to the sea two facing inlandhere at their corner is a large square tower it has good observation possibilities the locals call it the cursed tower he added lightly it seems it was paid for with judas iscariots thirty pieces of silver kydd was not interested in a biblical allusion sir yere thinking on making a stand against genral buonaparte here smiths smile vanished i most certainly am mr kydd can you be one of those wretched crew who cringe at the sound of his name i mean to show the world that he can be bestedand remember we have the sea at our backs kydd felt hewitts eyes on him sir with no soldiers itll be a hard job youre forgetting djezzar the ruler of this region he is providing three thousand of the best troopsanatolian albanian kurds africansand will reside within these walls while the french do their worst trusting us to effect its defence something of kydds scepticism must have shown for smith went on our object is simply to hold the town until relieved and i can tell you now that at this very moment a turkish army eight times the size of buonapartes is preparing to advance towards us not even the victor of italy may prevail over that there was the sound of movement and voices below ah he has arrived smith went to the window and stared out until an older officer with a deeply lined face wearing a uniform that kydd did not recognise entered smith turned and with a warm smile greeted him in a stream of mellifluous french gesturing first to hewitt who responded with a bow and murmured french and then to kydd who could only bow and mutter in english for those without the necessary accomplishment i will translate smith said this gentleman is lieutenant general the count phélippeaux an honourable frenchman of the ancien régime he is in the first rank of those learned in the arts of fortification and will tell us how best we may prepare for our siege kydds expression altered but smith mistaking the change went on set aside your concerns this was the officer who in the most handsome manner assisted in my escape from the prison cell in paris he has every reason to detest the revolutionaries you may believe mr kydd the conference moved forward quickly whatever else smith was clearheaded and energetic within the hour they had settled on immediate priorities with an unknown time before buonaparte appeared their defences had to be completed as soon as possible the most effective would be in the deploying of their two ships of force which amounted to the equivalent of a regiment of artillery each ship would be anchored in position so that it could fire down the length of one side or the other of the walls their line of fire intersecting at the end the open ground in front of the walls across which the enemy must pass for an assault could therefore be kept under fire the only problem with this was that shallow water with rocky shoals extended in places for several miles making it a dangerous and exposed anchorage for ships of size they would be firing at extreme range the count engaged in long earnest discussions with smith which smith summarised tersely it seemed that without effective artillery of their own they would be at a grave disadvantage they had to keep buonapartes siege guns at a distance or they would effect a rapid breach i shall land guns from tigre and tenacious with volunteer seamen gunners to serve them the men relish a jaunt ashore and i shall oblige them more discussion yielded their number and position things were looking up for kydd with seamen to command and a worthy task ahead there was every prospect of distinguished service smith stood and stretched theatrically at this point it would appear appropriate to involve djezzar pasha he began to pace about the room his hands behind his back i would have you understand the importance i attach to our alliance he alone has the men close at hand whom we need and without him we are lost now before we make audience allow me to say something of this worthy gentleman he is pasha of this region holding nominal allegiance to sultan selim in constantinople but has always been an independent spirit he glanced significantly at the other two officers in turn djezzar means slasher or butcher and it is an apt name when he was young he sold himself into slavery to the mamelukes and by sinister means made himself indispensable as an assassin until he turned his blade on his master he is cruel and has the morals of a polecat but is the ruler and will be accorded all possible marks of respect is that clear understood sir said hewitt kydd nodded then we shall proceed to the harem sir both officers said in astonishment all official business with djezzar pasha is conducted in his seraglio shall we go now with an increasing sense of unreality kydd followed smith through noisy ancient streets to a complex of buildings to the north and a tent surrounded by chattering arabs in a courtyard with palm trees and a fountain a tall man in a turban approached and bowed in the eastern manner to see his excellency smith said with practised hauteur this was the man kydd had been told who had recently won over the sublime porte in constantinople to secure a treatyhe would be no stranger to eastern ways they entered the tent rich hangings soft carpets riotous colour unknown tonguesit was all an exotic wonder to kydd to one side a man sat crosslegged and others stood round him obsequiously the man whom smith indicated was djezzar rose wellbuilt and mature he wore the full burnous of the desert arab and carried himself with dignity a diamondhilted dagger at his waist smith bowed deeply and kydd hastened to do likewise smith spoke in french to djezzar and the four then retired to the interior where they all sat crosslegged kydd refused a bubblepipe but hewitt accepted out of curiosity kydd looked furtively about for ladies of the harem but disappointingly saw none smith conversed urbanely and at length with djezzar whose harsh booming voice had a hard edge of authority kydd leaned over to hewitt whats the drift he whispered asking for men to build up the fortifications hewitt replied in a low voice and about the turkish cavalry promised to us there was a snarl and impassioned words from djezzar he says he told them to go out and attack the enemy and not to return until they had done something worthy of his notice the audience had apparently been a success on the way back to their headquarters smith made light commentary on the sights approving the purposeful hurry of gangs now setting about clearing detritus and rubble from the walls labouring at the stonework shoring up weak bastions in their campaign room smith looked in satisfaction at the map as he made corrections and notes so far so good he said briskly el djezzar is proving most cooperative and im sanguine that if we do our part we shall have a good chance of delaying the french long enough for the turks to bring them to battle there is much to doi shall be returning aboard tigre i want those guns landed before sunset and placed in position without delay your orders are here he produced a slim sheaf of papers in essence they require you to act for me ashore djezzar pasha has been notified that you may do so in my name therefore you will acquaint yourselves thoroughly with my orders so that nothing is overlooked he considered for a moment then said we have no reliable knowledge of the french advance it might be prudent to begin a regular reconnaissance south until their presence is detected one of you will take a boat away at dusk for this purpose so we have our orders an our task is tolerably clear i only hope we can get away in time you are not confident of a favourable outcome hewitt responded coolly are you i know my duty i believe hewitt said stiffly fr me kydd began and thought better of it then lets be started wheres suleiman the translator weve been promised he turned out to be the tall man at the seraglio er mr suleiman i want t see the serangwhatever youd call th chief of the workers on the wall theres not a moment t lose the first gun from tigre was landed at the mole soon after midday a heavy twentyfourpounder laid along the thwarts of a launch and its two tons of cold iron swayed ashore by improvised sheerlegs a guncarriage followed then boats with powder and shot some with stores and rum casks soon after the grinning faces of dobbie his close friend laffin and others arrived in tenaciouss cutter volunteers all ready to man the guns that would soon face the great napoleon buonaparte their twentyfourpounder which had come earlier in the launch was manhauled through the streets and into place dobbie youre gun captain here therell be a frenchy along presently as will tell ye where er youll best direct yr fire there would be no looming enemy ship to fire into presumably it would be columns of men or random waves of attackers he ignored the puzzled looks of the men at the word frenchy the tenacious gun was mounted at the end of the wall where it met the sea to the south and commanded the open ground in front of the town now being broken up to form a discouragement to attackers kydd let his gaze move across the littered landscape wild fig trees and hovels had been levelled out to lineofsight of the nearest high ground some quarter of a mile away beyond that was the anonymous dry scrubby country that stretched inland to distant purple hills it would be from this direction that the army of napoleon buonaparte would come kydd watched dobbie dispose his men in imitation of shipboard handspike and crow to hand he had ensured that there was a semblance of a magazine along the inside of the wall and gave orders for the safe handling of powder and shot but he was becoming uneasy in this unfamiliar world and hoped their withdrawal would not be long delayed it had been in a similar siege on land at calvi that nelson had lost the sight of one eye to the splintering stone of a ricocheting shot hewitt had concluded his gun dispositions at the other end of the wallthey could now converge fire and judging from the chattering fascination of gaping onlookers they were giving heart by their presence they met later back at their musty headquarters for a snatched meal we get marines tmorrow kydd said through the last of his lamb stew t use as we please orders are strict enough in the matter of sentries id far rather trust a leatherneck on sentrygo than a turk if you take my point i do an i notice that were on watch an watchdays on an split the nights alternately agreed kydd lifted his cup in acknowledgement the wine was dry and resinous but pleasant enough hewitt looked disapprovingly at the china cup but drank and the dusk patrol thats fr me kydd said quicklythe chance for some seatime was not to be missed it was also an opportunity to show smith what he could do then ill take the first watch aye hewitt seemed moody distracted kydd sensed that he was having misgivings rum sort of place kydd tried ye can see how old it is old you might say that said hewitt bleakly this is canaanthat is to say the phoenician lands from centuries before rome and thats the road to nazareth over the hillsst paul was here and this was the very place st john of acre where richard the lionheart and the crusaders marched against jerusalem its been fought over by all the tribes of man for thousands of years and now we are come to add our blood kydd would not be depressed this was a passing strange and unusual task for a sea officer but it was also the best and only chance in sight for notice and advancement laffin get a boats crew tgether for me coxn an six the launch under sail and ill have the thirtytwopounder carronade shipped in the bows there was no harm in being well prepared a boat action could be the most brutal form of combat at sea ready in half an hour if y please he examined the charts with hewitt communications with the south were a road following a fertile strip along the sea at the edge of the desertif the enemy were to come they must choose between the coast road and a long swing inland from the interior to reach the gates of acre ill press south t this mount carmel kydd mused ten miles or so theyll come along the coast roads my guess mount carmelelijah discomfits the prophets of baal two kings something kydd could not bring it to mind this was half a world away from the boredom of the sunday service in guildford town where the dry words of a preacher speaking of the holy land bore no resemblance at all to this arid country the samaritans even christ passed by here on his way to jerusalem um thats rightan im takin a carronade in case they have gunboats out do ye keep a watch fr gunfire as will be yr signal theyre abroad he left hewitt to his biblical musings and collected his sword belt from the corner he favoured a shoulder carriage to spread the weight leaving the belt loose for a brace of pistols his fighting sword had a satisfying heft and in the warmth of the lateafternoon sun he strode down to the mole laffin the hard petty officer kydd remembered from his duel in canada touched his hat at his approach also in the boat was the lofty poulden forward at the stubby carronade and several other tenaciouses along the thwarts a stout enough crew he thought with satisfaction pistols an cutlasses in th arms chest sir laffin said immediately he boarded the big launch and settled in the sternsheets leaving laffin the tiller well shove off now if y please kydd told him the soft westerly meant they did not even have to ship oars as the gaffheaded main was hoisted ill have th running bowsprit out with jib an staysl i believe the carronade would not bear forward while this was rigged but it would add considerably to their speed and could be struck in a hurry if need be the boat left the mole slipped past the roiling white of the manara rocks then headed out to sea to preserve an offing before shaping course south it was most pleasant kydd had to admit the sun sinking out to sea in shimmering splendour warmth still in the air and in the other direction the low nondescript coast taking on the wistful indigo of evening along the endless virgin sands was the startling white of breakers the purple of far mountains now a deep ultramarine olive gardens and small clusters of the flattopped dwellings were dotted along the shore several times figures stopped watching them curiously the cheerful splash of their passage and the occasional grunted conversation of the men lulled kydd into a reveriehe pulled himself together what did a great army look like apart from thousands of bayonets he had no idea but knew that if he saw one his duty was to get the news to smith with the utmost urgency the bay curved round at one place he saw classical ruins enough to make renzi starebut he was not present he was in distant england resolving his personal life a string of camels plodded along the skyline kydd idly counted nearly a hundred on the dusty road with their riders in flowing desert cloaks looking as if they had stepped out of a picture book of his childhood he followed their advance their riders rhythmically jerking forward as though in a boat in a rough seajerking surely a desert bedouin had a more comfortable style of riding he looked about quickly laffinput about an go beyond that spit o land they had passed a tiny headland no more than a small twist of sand the boat went about smartly and returned the way they had come as soon as they were out of sight of the riders kydd said urgently set me ashore an stand off n on until theyre past then collect me the boat scrunched into the fine sand beyond the point and kydd leaped off scurrying to get into the fringing grasses of the sand dune he crouched waiting there were no sounds of sighting or pursuit but he kept very still at length came the soft chinkle of a camel harness and the murmur of voices on the evening air a delicate unknown but haunting fragrance warred with the dry pungency of the desert and the nearer salty sand of the duneshe flattened among the reedy grasses rigid with concentration he felt the thumping of camel feet through the ground as they drew nearer the voices were louderand it was not arabic that was being spoken but french it seemed to take for ever for the camel train to pass he heard muted laughter sharp words and an occasional snatch of song above the rustle of shuffling feet and the leathery slap of harness finally the last one passed cautiously kydd raised his head they were receding along the road without looking back he delayed for a while longer then slid down to the beach and waited for the boat load with canister he growled at poulden as they shoved off there was no doubt in his mind of what he should dothe sound of the cannon would be as good as a personal report to smith of their presence the launch leaned purposefully to the wind they passed the camel train once more the riders took no notice of the little sailing boat offshore kydd chose his move carefully if the boat took the ground they could expect no mercy from the enemy riders at a stipple in the line of dunes ahead he doused the sails and took in the bowsprit using oars to rotate them shoreward out kedge he snapped the little anchor plummeted and bit and the line tautened over the transom he paid it out to allow the boat to nose close in the deadly carronade trained steadily on the shore still the camel riders did not take alarm in the uncertain light and against the setting sun it must have seemed a fishingboat the line of camels came on some heads turned curiously as they bear poulden kydd growled an make it count there was a great army following behind and he had no compunction about the blood he was about to spill but his heart beat faster as the train of camels passed the cold black muzzle the carronade crashed back in its slide the gunflash nearly blinding in the fading light the effect on the column was instant sleeting balls tore into them and with squeals and screams it dissolved into panic one riderless camel fled back down the road as others shed their mounts and scrambled in terror over the dunes hoarse cries of command mingled with shrieks poulden reloaded and laffin deftly lined up the boat for another crashing discharge in total disarray the camel train was no more still dark forms and wildly scrabbling men and animals all that were left kydd recalled from the map that inland there was nothing but saltmarsh the french would find themselves trapped secure the gun he ordered they had made contact with the enemy and alerted the defendersthere was no glory in useless bloodshed smith arrived late for the morning conference and wasted no time so buonapartes advance guard now has a bloody nosewell done mr kydd he grinned without humour we can expect therefore that theyll abandon the coast road and swing inland to come at us from the north theres no time to lose were nearly complete with the fossethats our surrounding ditchand all the gunboats i can find are anchored here in support he bit his lip regrettably it would appear that the muhammadans have got wind of buonapartes behaviour at the siege of jaffahe induced the garrison there to surrender then took them all down to the beach and slaughtered the lot had the coldblooded gall to use bayonets to save powder now half our own mussulmen are streaming out of town and heading for the hills unexpectedly he smiled but this means that those who remain will be staunch were well rid of the restuseless mouths to feed so we expect buonaparte on our doorstep directly i have given orders concerning the illumination of the wall in the event of a surprise attack and other matters do you both ensure they are carried out he was interrupted by a messenger unfolding the dispatch he chuckled grimly from tenacious good news indeed for once in fact magnificent news dancing a jig and flourishing the paper aloft he grinned boyishly at the dumbfounded officers this will take the shine off the morning for mr buonaparte tenacious fell in with a french convoy off mount carmel and took ninenine o the beggars mark you kydd and hewitt politely murmured their surprise but smith continued and the best thing about it is those were buonapartes entire siege train he has no ammunition no heavy gunswere reprieved gentlemen unless he gets another such we have a chance kydd felt an unworthy envy he could visualise the convoy within sight of safe harbour and then a shipoftheline no less appears from round the point boarding parties are sent away in every boat seizing vessel after vessel all under the helpless eye of the french army ashore count phelippeaux will be exceedingly satisfied with this mornings workwe shall mount the guns ourselves and pound em with their own metal smith concluded later in the morning there was a blurring of the horizon to the northeast a broad ochrous veil of dust rising from the countless thousands of a great army kydd climbed the narrow steps inside the cursed tower to see for himself his pocket spyglass added details of the serried glitter of bayonets columns of dusty blue coats cavalry vast numbers of wagons light guns more columns in its creeping menacing unstoppable progress it was a sinister sight it would take some time yet to reach them but when it did it would clamp a vicelike grip on acre before an overwhelming assault kydd went cold as he considered the larger scene and realised the stakes could hardly be bigger buonaparte was a ruthless gifted general there was no reason why he could not complete his march north by taking constantinople from the weakened turks then he would stand astride the route to india and the world only one thing was in his way acre if he bypassed it on his thrust north he would then have a port in his wake through which his enemies could pour troops to fall on his rear at any time even in his ignorance of military affairs kydd could see that this would be intolerable while acre still stood buonapartes triumphant advance was halted he had no alternative but to throw everything he had into its destruction kydd descended the tower stairs slowly this was no longer a simple duty in a faroff land it was now the crux of the whole war against the french and he had been called to the fore at this critical hour acre must be held a sea mist over a calm sea was lifting as kydd made his way back to the headquarters but the road out of acre was full of people some on donkeys or camels others in wooden wagons all hurrying away from the doomed town smith was still at the headquarters crisply ordering the disposition of the captured guns kydd took up the order book to make sure he was aware of any changes in addition to sentries there were outlying pickets who would be the first to catch sight of the siege army they would retire quickly and sound the alert a small force of gunboats would patrol to seaward from now on not only to give warning of hostile naval forces but also to deny the attackers any seaborne supply hewitt returned from his inspection of the northern flank with tigres gun propping his sword in the corner and wiping his brow ready to hear smiths latest news ah now gentlemen let me apprise you of some intelligence that has come my way it appears that while tenacious dealt ably with the convoy four vessels escaped these it turns out are sailing barges laden with stores for the army i dont have to tell you if the enemy is denied these he will find it hard to forage hereabouts kydd could see where it was all leading sir where are they in the port below mount carmel which is haifa theres no doubt it will require a bold cuttingout expedition if we wish to take them from the enemy three boats enough sir kydd said casually a smart operation would at the very least mean a mention in dispatches i would think so smith said with satisfaction the little flotilla set off in longboats and cutters in the last of the daylight kydds boat in the lead the other two under a senior midshipman on either flank in all there were sufficient seamen to fight any reasonable waterfront opposition and work the captured vessels out to sea he had studied the charts haifa was a small haven a lengthy quay enclosing an inner harbour if the barges were alongside this quay on either side it would be a straightforward matter but if they were further in it would complicate things the bay of haifa was calm a quartermoon gave adequate visibility and there did not seem to be any other shipping about apart from the lateen sails of the ubiquitous trading feluccas nevertheless things could happen quicklyhe felt once more for the comforting presence of his fine fighting sword there was every prospect that this night it would taste its first blood the land was dark and anonymous occasional lights flickered but nothing to show the presence of a great army they had diverted inland kydd reasoned and were probably close to taking up their positions around acre his resolution firmedtheir action would bring results out of all proportion to their numbers and justify risks they approached the end of the bay the bold bluff of mount carmel easy to make out the small port of haifa was at its base kydd strained to see into the harbourthere were some lights but not enough to reveal the situation and the quartermoon was now veiled in high cloud keep together he hailed to the others the barges were probably inside the long quay but where the further in they were the longer they would be under fire as they sailed out with their prizes but on the other hand there did not appear to be formal defencesin fact there were neither gunboats at the entrance nor soldiers guarding the quay could they be so lucky closer there were no sudden shouts or signs of alarm tense and ready to order an instant retreat kydd took his tiny fleet round the end of the quay and into the inner harbour the barges came into viewat the far end rafted together probably to unload in the morning into the tall warehouses that lined the wharf it was quiettoo quiet the cheery splash of their passage could be heard echoing back from the tall stone of the quay the waterfront buildings were in complete darkness the nearest lights in the small town on the slopes above he could not see anything of concern but the silence was unnerving kydd felt uneasy with the long passage they were having to make up the harbour if they had encountered opposition even just wellplaced muskets on the quay and the inner shoreline they would not have been able to penetrate more than yards towards their prizes so close to were they on each side barely two hundred yards away kydd looked about for the easiest way to board one or two curious arabs glanced their way and on one of the barges a curious head popped up red cutter t larbd longboat th other side kydd called quietly to the other boat crews they would fall on the barges from each side working inboard the order was barely uttered when kydds world tore apart a single hoarse shout came from somewhere then the crash of muskets screams and violent movements in the boat slammed into his perception the stroke oar took a ball in the head and jerked before slithering down his oar flying up and tangling with the next a shriek came from forward a man rose then fell over the side kydds mind snapped to an icy cold ferocious concentration the firing was coming from behind and it was coming down from the upper storeys of the warehouse and the quay the soldiers had done well to lie concealed while the boats with their lower line of sight had gone right past them the trap well sprung there could be no return the way they had come kydd realised bitterly that the source of smiths intelligence had also betrayed them to the other side there was only one course the barges he bellowed there was just a chance that the enemy would be reluctant to fire on their own vessels it was only twenty or so yards a dozen frenzied strokes a young seaman clutching his cutlass was struck in the throat by a musketball with a splutch that sounded curiously loud above the general uproar he fell forward kicking into the bottom of the boat with a strangled bubbling gouting blood kydd could feel the constant slam and thud of bullets into the boats side as he fought the tiller to counteract the wild slewing as more oarsmen were hit the boat thudded woodenly into the side of the outside bargeits freeboard was lower even than that of the longboat take cover on board he yelled clambering over the side to the deserted deck others crowded after him on deck he drew his sword for the first time in deadly earnest and ran forward any hopes that the french would slacken fire on their own ships were proved falsethe lethal whup and strike of bullets continued about him with no diminishing there was no cover on the upper decks of the ungainly barge and with its hold full there was no shelter there either with a wrench of the heart kydd saw that the other boats had loyally made the longer distance round to the other end of the rafted barges in accordance with his last orders and the sailors were clambering up white faces and bright steel in the moonlight go fr the warehouse he had to buy time they rushed forward and over a rickety gangplank to the wharf panting hard kydd dashed to the doors of the nearest building he drew his pistol shot off the padlock and swung the door wide inside a musket fired and he saw two or three soldiers frantically reloading maddened seamen got to them and slaughtered them in an instant the rest of his men threw themselves inside and the door was slammed shut the darkness was lit only by a single lantern kydd shouted at a petty officer to search out any remaining enemy hiding in there and tried to force his mind to a cool rationality he had probably about thirty men left far too few to stand up to a regular army force and only a handful of muskets most seamen were equipped for standard boarding with pistols and tomahawks and of course a cutlass their main task was to get sail quickly on the prize peeping through cracks in the door he could see the aimless drift of their abandoned boats and worse out of range he could detect enemy soldiers assembling for a rush on them there was no more time his men seamen he had known through long night watches out on the yardarm in a gale at a cannon in the titanic battle of the nile were looking to him to make a decision take firm action and save them a lump grew in his throat as cold desolation flooded in trapped in an old warehouse with soldiers closing in they could only burst out and meet the enemy in a last desperate standor was it time to call a halt to the killing and dying slowly he turned to face his men i do believeits not m duty t throw away yr lives he said thickly hang out somethin white if y please there was a rustle and some murmuring but no argument a seaman shinned up to a high barred window worked through it a white waistcoat then shook it awkwardly a single voice called loudly several times kydd could not understand the words but their import was plain open th door he said then stepped outside the voice called again from out of the darkness this time in a more commanding tone ltenant kydd royal navy he replied and waited the soldiers advanced warily their muskets trained on him they stood in a semicircle while a french officer in high boots and cockaded hat stalked forward jexige votre reddition he snapped kydd had no idea what he had said sir i ask terms fr my capitulation he said wearily you surrender ees it the officer said smirking what are yr terms sir kydd repeated stiffly terms you surrender you safe your lifes you not then he shrugged very well we er surrender it was done cest excellent lieutenant he held out his hands kydd was at a loss to understand then he realised he unbuckled his fine sword still unblooded and gave it to the officer bitterness threatened to choke him as he watched the man put the cherished sword under his arm then turn to give the orders that must send them into captivity chapter kydd was imprisoned in a former office above some sort of trading floor two sentries stood guard outside as far as he knew his men were below crowded into the odorous basement room he had seen briefly as he mounted the stairs there was an echoing quiet in the barely furnished room which contained a table two chairs to one side and some untidy rubbish in the corner a palliasse had been thrown on to the floor with a grey blanket moonlight entered through the window which was barred ironically to prevent entry rather than exit the view outside was limited to the slab side of another building kydd had no idea where he was he crossed to the palliasse it was going to be a long night using an old seamans trick he thumped it several times in the centre with his fist and saw dots scrabbling in the indentation he kicked it aside and sat moodily in a chair he felt shame at surrendering giving up in the face of mere musket fire when at sea he had stood firm against decks of heavy cannon it was hard to accept in a service where hauling down ones flag was a rare and final humiliation his mind raced over the events probing mercilessly for evidence of stupidity neglect cowardicehad he done his duty as a kings officer to the full would he be able to stand before a courtmartial and swear he had done all that was possible hot accusing images of men screaming at their deathwounds flooded in did the survivors blame him what did they think of him as an officer what did he think of himself but he was torturing himself to no purpose he fought down the whirling thoughts but his feverish mind found a new tack these soldiers were the same troops who had recently taken out three thousand surrendered men and massacred them on the spot would they do the same with them it made little sense to guard and feed them in the middle of a fullscale siege and probably smith would not have heard of their fate the night passed slowly for kydd full of phantoms and dread of the unknown with the first grey light came another question what lay in store for the dayfor the endless time that lay ahead smith had endured years in a paris prison before his dramatic escape escape but as soon as the thought had flowered it died kydd had no mysterious friends to help him no funds and above all he could not abandon his men to the french army he vowed to share their fate whatever it might be a breakfast of flavoured rice and gruel arrived but it was not until the morning sun had come to full strength that he received a visitor the officer who had accepted his sword in surrender ah bonjour mon brave he said gesturing to the guards to wait outside he took a chair and sat i am lieutenant dinfantrie cadoux an you are lieutenant keed nestce pas he smiled of ze shipozeline tenacious kydd remained silent the french could only have known this if his men had been interrogated alors eet is of no consequence do you know monsieur zat you are famous no then let me tell you ze great general napoleon buonaparte imself knows of you e wish to offer is condolences on your misfortune but regrets e cannot receive you at zis moment e is engaged on an important matter kydd said nothing no doubt buonaparte had heard of him his capture would have been quickly reported by the triumphant officer in charge but whether the general had any real interest in him he very much doubted ze general wonders if you can be of service to im e would be much oblige eef you are able to assist im with is unnerstanding of ze geography of akker for zis e wants you to know zat e will be grateful very gratefuleef you unnerstan me no he said defiantly cadoux drew his chair closer msieuryou do not comprehend one does not refuse ze generals politeness did i not express mysel sufficiently he tried again then frustrated at kydds lack of response he stood and left the day drew on clearly the defences of acre were of vital interest to the french and there was little they would not do to secure the intelligence kydds capture must have seemed a godsend his stomach was in a knot and he could not bring himself to eat he wondered what his men had been given but seamen were inured to poor food when victualling declined and would probably eat whatever was put before them he paced round the shabby room trying not to think about what must follow his stubbornness the sun gentled into evening and cadoux returned he entered slowly his right hand concealing something behind him kydd went cold if this was the end he would not go meekly lieutenant keed you are a very fortunate man kydd tensed then cadoux whipped out his beloved fighting sword from behind his back you are to be exchange general buonaparte graciously agree you may return to your ship he bowed elegantly and proffered the scabbard as though kydd had absentmindedly left it behind hesitating in disbelief kydd reached out for his sword another figure entered the room smiths secretary true enough sir the man said drily as soon as he heard sir sidney sent me to genral buonaparte flag o truce youand your menare to be exchanged for two frenchmen we hold if youd come with me down to the quay fortunate id say you were damn lucky kydd smith in his cabin in tigre did not seem to share kydds relief at his deliverance you know that youve cost me my only two french captives of worth with a sigh he stared through the stern windows buonaparte taking up his positions bombarding me with demands to turn over the town to him immediatelyi can do without these distractions he turned to kydd now pray tell me sir what the devil happened kydd swallowed sir there was no sign o the enemyhe mustve lay down atop the quay no doubt in the event you couldnt be sure perhaps you should have first thought of sending a man to peer over the top kydd held his tongue and your retreat whatever possessed you to go to ground in a warehouse why did you not put about immediately and return he added in disdain i lost five men just in making fr the barges kydd said the firing coming frm behind i wouldve lost far more going against em until i got t open water he felt smiths scorn at his words and added forcefully someone tipped em off an that can only be yr precious source of intelligence thats as may be lieutenant but ill trouble you to keep your temper in my presence smith said acidly sir in war casualties are inevitable ill have your written report before sundown if you please i imagine youll want to get back to your ship now nosir if you will oblige me i should want t go back ashore an finish the job very well smith said with a slight smile let it be on your own head sir hewitt looked up from some arab dish he was eating off a chipped plate well i cant say that i find your good self unwelcome he went to the window see there he indicated to the northeast just out of range a city of grey tents in three main blocks regular as a chessboard was springing up row by row and covering the terrain facing them ive been watching em and i believe we are looking at general buonapartes headquarters in the centre with the engineers to the left and artillery to the right kydd took his telescope and slowly traversed the ridges i can see em he said in a hard voice any word on th relief army smith heard that the turks are taking time to mass a huge force one thatll outnumber buonapartes by far we just have to resist until it arrives kydd lowered the glass do ye know what we cn expect next according to the count theyll establish their advance lines within range of us first then theyll push forward and start their parallelsthat is trenches matching the line of our wallsand its from these that theyll begin digging saps deep tunnels direct towards us the idea is to bring up guns near enough to pound a breach in the walls his expression hardened if a practicable breach is made its customary for the defenders to seek terms if they insist on fighting its equally customary for the attackers to put the entire population to the sword without mercy what does he say are our chances hewitt shrugged im going t see my gun kydd said and left him to finish his meal the experience of being captured possessed by the enemy had shaken kydds confidence and although smith had not directly criticised his conduct how could he be sure he had done everything possible in that situation in a black mood he made his way through the malodorous alley to the corner of the wall where the tenacious gun was sited it was fully in place complete with wooden runners cunningly inclined upwards to slow the recoil and help bring the gun back to the firing position dobbie stood to greet him and touched his forehead good ter see you again sir an black bess eres all ready n correct fer your inspection he slapped the long muzzle of the big gun affectionately some seaman artist had embellished the sides of the carriage with an heraldic ribbon bearing the name kydd looked at dobbie closely he had not been on the cuttingout expedition but would know about it however his face showed only honest satisfaction at his return its going t be a hard fight before its over kydd said then felt uncomfortable that he had perhaps sounded pompous and affected aye sir but wem ready fr when the beggar shows imself at last dobbies gun crew had prepared faultlessly handspikes and rammers neatly against the inner parapet powder cartridges stowed in a case out of sight below when it starts i want every man t wear a cutlass even when working th gun kydd said ill see about pistols he looked out over the broken ground theyll be moving t their advance lines afore longthen youll have work t do there was no point in waiting about so he walked back slowly to the headquarters dont much fancy kicking my heels here hewitt said shall we go to the cursed tower and see what there is to see the antique square tower stood at the corner of the wall they climbed the old stairs to the top room and hewitt trained his telescope towards the french encampment busy enough he grunted and brought it further round ah what do we have here well welli do declare he passed the glass to kydd do you mark the mound to the noreast that is richard coeur de lions mound now tell me what you can see there was general activity around the mound but at the highest point a solitary group was looking directly towards the tower in the centre in plain dress contrasting with those on each side stood a single figure even at that distance kydd could sense a presence a maleficent will general buonaparte he said in a low voice and handed back the glass in the same view he had seen a dozen or so big fieldpieces being hauled forward across the uneven ground on all sides there were ominous signs of encirclement entrapment in its slow but certain progress it held a deadly fascination that night kydd paced along the walls this ancient foreign land was not the right place for a sea officerhe was completely out of his element but he had accepted this duty and it was here that he would prove himself or dobbie and his gun crew lay about their post some were sleeping others spun yarns much as they would in a night watch aboard tenacious kydd nodded to dobbie and passed by at four points along the walls watchfires blazed throwing ruddy light over the open ground he looked out into the black of the night aware of the line of marine sentries placed within sight of each other along the walls the turkish and arab troops chattered noisily together within the wall the seamen were there only as gunners and it was these soldiers who would repulse any assault they seemed outlandish with their turbans and scimitars and were an unknown quantity in close combat but kydd would lead them and the marines into battle the seamen would act as a reserve if fighting came down to close quarters his thoughts were rudely interrupted as a musket went off near the centre of the wall then another out in the darkness at the extremity of the light thrown by the watchfire he could see the suspicion of a moving shadow then several more he ordered the oil fire lit which flared up with a satisfying whoomf caught in the sudden light scurrying figures darted about muskets blazed up and down the parapets the first shots of the siege but with little effect cease fire roared kydd it had probably been a reconnaissance party spying out the terrain his men had achieved what they wanted there would be no more french creeping about at night he gripped his sword they knew what to expect in the morning at dawn buonapartes cannonade began during the night his guns had been drawn up in a breach battery directly opposite the cursed tower and they opened up in a continuous roll as the light strengthened through his feet kydd felt the vicious thump of solid hits some stray balls tore through the air above him while others struck noisily but ineffectively off the slope of bastions and casemates he could distinguish the deep smash of twelvepounders above the more strident eightpounders and the bark of lesser pieces before their own artillery replied their siege mortars were now turned on the besiegers antiquated bronze guns of djezzars own and most satisfying of all the twentyfours landed from tenacious and tigre dobbie needed no special instructions he laid the gun calmly himself then sent ball after ball into the french positions making them pay for the privilege of coming within the range needed for their own guns kydd could see the earth parapets before the enemy guns flung aside leaving broken muzzles pointing skywards but the ancient cursed tower built at a time before modern iron guns suffered the french had correctly estimated it the weakest part of the wall and concentrated savage fire upon it under the remorseless battering the masonry started to crumble then fall for five hours it endured bombardment before the last french gun was destroyed the facing wall of the tower was now a gaping ruin kydd left the gun and hurried to the scene the tumbled stonework had left the lower part of the tower a dusty cave a wide pathway to the interior of acrea breach in their defences among the babble of excited turks kydd caught sight of phelippeaux clambering over the fallen rubble if the customs of war were to hold they should now treat for a capitulation and withdrawal or later suffer the carnage of a sacking but if they did what would be the fate of this brave and resourceful royalist frenchman as the dust settled all sounds died away in the enemy direction then came the thunder of massed drums the chamade a demand to parley a white flag appeared above the enemy earthworks and waved to and fro then a single figure appeared standing erect with the white flag on a banner staff kydd noticed that smith had arrived next to him the figure began a rigid march towards them stumbling occasionally on the broken ground at a point within shouting range the man stopped and demanded something in french smith stepped forward and replied with a bow and mild words the man came on he was an officer of proud bearing with scarlet sash and feathered cockade his eyes flickered rapidly from side to side as he marched gawking onlookers made way for him as he stalked through the breach he halted then began a staccato tirade but was interrupted with a gesture from smith who turned contemptuously to hewitt speaking in english the rogue came without a blindfoldhe thinks to come as a spy he turned back to the officer and barked a command turkish soldiers seized him and dragged him away well thats settled smith said id be obliged mr kydd if youd give a reply to mr buonaparte on my behalf with your twentyfour aye aye sir the die was cast buonaparte would never forgive the insult the breach was stopped up hastily with baulks of timber and rubble at noon there was a sinister movement across the whole width of kydds vision unseen trumpets blared at each end of the line colours were raised and drums began their volleying summons to the flag kydd looked along the wall to the soldiers at the ready obviously frightened they were calling to each other and looking about them as if to escape kydd brandished his sword and strode down the walls this steadied them to a degree but then the skyline erupted into a mass of advancing troops buonapartes finest who had defeated a hundred thousand mamelukes in an hour at the pyramids been victorious at the siege of el arish and butchered in cold blood the survivors of the jaffa siege firing wildly many turks and arabs broke and fled kydd shouted himself hoarse and some hesitated but most tumbled off the parapets and ran kydd returned hastily to the gun shaken dobbie and the others acknowledged him calmly and a surge of feeling for them came over him grape then canister he croaked with renewed determination there would be time to get away only two shots before the french were upon them smoke was obscuring his view but he could make out the advance guard running in front they carried scaling ladders and equipment and close behind were their armed supporters the sheer numbers appalled kydd dense masses of troops that faded into the distance all tramping forwards in an unstoppable wave even over the bodies of those who fell in his gut he felt the terror of the helpless the main wave was going against the cursed tower and their closepacked ranks quickened as they drew nearer their swords and bayonets rising and falling with a terrible glint the final battle for acre would be won or lost at the tower he hurried to the breach and saw that it would never stand a determined assault kydd stood there with bared sword waiting for the onslaught he sensed others forming up behind him filling the breach with their bodies and suddenly felt exhilaration a curious exaltation that he was alive and a man on such a day the first wave of the assault reached middle ground then came to the final distance then above the tumult of battle came an avalanche of thuds seconds later the entire front of the attacking army crumpled whole columns were slapped to the ground or flung skyward and military formation dissolved into panicstricken scrabbling offshore tenacious and tigre delivered their ferocious broadsides again their shot rampaging the length of each wall and converging in front of the cursed tower in a welter of blood and corpses nothing could stand against what amounted to whole regiments of heavy artillery and buonapartes assault crumbled most turned to flee to find the rear of the army still pressing them forward others stormed on heroically but when they came close to the walls they discovered phelippeauxs fosse a ditch twelve feet deep that made a mockery of ladders intended only for the height of the wall rallying the turks ran back to the parapets and threw grenades and heavy stones into the ditch which quickly turned into a killing ground trumpets sounded distantlythe retreat kydd realised he looked down into the fosse those surviving abandoned by their own army held up their hands it took main force to prevent the turks killing the prisoners who were led away by marines it was a galling blow for buonaparte cheated of an easy victory by the same navy that had destroyed his hopes for an oriental empire he could no longer expect to take acre in a frontal attack sliding his sword into its scabbard with a satisfying snick kydd watched the last of the assault wave scramble to the rear he was still breathing deeply aglow with the intoxication of battle on a scale he had never seen beforeand he had been ready he turned and made his way to the gun but although the columns were repulsed in such disorder cooler regions of his mind told him that buonaparte would not be thwarted in his march to glory at sunset kydd left the headquarters where he had been in conference he had been grateful for the activity the days events had disturbed him in a manowar there were casualties and he had seen his share at the nile but he had been unprepared for the scale of slaughter in a land battle hewitt was on the first watch and he must try to catch some sleepbut could he close his eyes on the images of blood and death his evening walk took him to the tenacious gun one of the seamen whom kydd remembered only as a reliable member of the afterguard was sitting on the guncarriage with his grog can singing to the others in a low and compelling tenor the topsails shiver in the wind the ship shes bound to sea but yet my heart my soul my mind are mary moored with thee kydd stood transfixed in this harsh and unfeeling land away from the clean simplicities of a sea life these sailors had brought their world with them and were drawing strength from their ageold customs he turned to go but his seamans instincts had pricked an alert and he faced back sniffing the wind since morning it seemed it had backed a full three points he had no barometer or other instruments but he felt uneasy the dawn came and as he had suspected the winds were more in the north a cooler touch to them after the dry warmth of the desert khamsin the giant bowl of the deep blue sky brassy with sunlight and usually innocent of cloud apart from playful tufts was becoming overcast kydd climbed the cursed tower with hewitt nothing in the french camp gave a clue to buonapartes plans but hewitt seemed unusually reserved winds gone to the norard kydd said if youd been in the eastern mediterranean as long as i have you would have your concerns it could soon be a norwesterly hewitt told him kydd nodded gravely any wind of force from the northwest would place tenacious and tigre on a lee shore anchored as they were as close to the scattered rocky shoals as was possible they would have to weigh and proceed to sea to make an offing until it was safe to return and while the ships were away they could no longer maintain their broadsidesbuonaparte would have his chance i hold to my small hope that buonaparte is as much a seaman as my sainted aunt betsy and will not in anticipation plan a descent and will be caught offguard is that too much to pray for hewitt said the wind strengthened it blustered and the first raindrops fell soon curtains of rain squalls were marching in from seaward laying the dust and forming myriad rivulets in the drab yellowishbrown dust but turning the dull iron of cannon to a lustrous gleam those who could pulled on rain slicks others endured the squalls passed but behind them the wind set in from the northwest hard and cold stand to all hands get on th wall kydd roared driving wet and bedraggled turks to their stations an assault would come it was certain it was only a question of when they stood to for an hourthen two hewitt had been right as dusk approached it was certain that buonaparte was not going to mount an assault that day now everything depended on the weather if the wind shifted back during the night the ships could return but if it stayed in the same quarter the defenders of acre would face an assault with the dawn came the wind relentlessly in the northwest before the day was out they would be fighting for their lives and smith was still somewhere out at sea in tigre and could play no part it was entirely up to themselves the enemy came without fanfare a sudden purposeful tide of attackers the defenders guns blasted defiance but without whole broadsides from the ships there was no deterring their deadly advance kydd lost no time in placing himself at the breach now choked with hastily placed timber and rubble on the tower above him the muskets banged away but against such numbers they had little effect then a deep rumble sounded the front ranks faltered kydds heart leaped if the ships had returned they stood a chance but a crash gave the lieit was a thunderstorm as the french bore down with scaling ladders to throw up against the walls from the fosse blustering and chilling rain squalls came the open ground grew slippery with sticky yellow mud firearms were useless in such conditions yet still they came onhurrying lines the dull glitter of wet steel a sea of anonymous faces and a continuous shouting roar the first wave reached the fosse ladders were thrown down awkwardly but phelippeaux had designed well the width of the ditch did not match the height necessary to reach the parapets and the ladders ended in a tangle of bodies and bloody corpses the first breathless frenchmen arrived at the breach hard brutal faces in sketchy blue uniforms bright weapons the cutting edge of buonapartes will pistols banged out and they scrambled over the rubble to close at last with the defenders kydd braced himself his sword warily at point a soldier reared up with a short carbine and threw it to his shoulder aiming at kydds face it missed fire but he hurled it at kydd yanked a long bayonet from its scabbard and came at him used to the confines of shipboard fighting kydd whirled away and his blade flashed out and took the man squarely in the side he fell and was immediately trampled by another whose bayoneted musket jabbed at kydds face he dropped to one knee and as the man lurched forward he lunged for his bowels the sword ran true and the man dropped with a howl but his fall jerked the weapon from kydds hands on his knees he scrabbled for it desperatelybut towering above him was a giant of a soldier before the man could plunge his bayonet down bloody steel shot out of the front of his chest with a squeal the man half turned as if to see who had killed him then toppled trapping kydd under his wet carcass struggling to move kydd felt the body shift it was heaved aside to reveal the grinning face of suleiman his curved ottoman dagger still dripping red kydd shook his head to clear it the fighting had moved down the rubble and into the ditch he picked up his sword and looked about rain now hammered down in earnest on his bare head and his eyes stung with a salty mix of sweat and blood the wellsited guns from the ships were still tearing great holes in the waves of attackers a musket ball slammed past his cheek with a vicious slap of air but he could see that the rain and mud were severely impeding the assault in the fosse grenades and infernal devices thrown at the hapless survivors exploded loudly in bursts of flame and smoke kydd saw a skull split and crushed by a heavy stone flung from the upper storey of the cursed tower the attack was faltering then as quickly as it started it faded leaving kydd trembling with fatigue atop the rubble of the breach he stepped inside the tower out of the rain and wiped his sticky sword on a body he looked at the now bloodied and muddy weapon then slid it neatly into its scabbard it had proved its worth there would be a reckoning when the weather abated there would be no rest at the tenacious gun the men sat exhausted on the ground heads in their hands dobbie looked up wearily with a smile of recognition got em beat again sir he croaked kydd could not trust himself to say the words that lay on his heart and ended with a gruff no chance o buonaparte getting what he wants while theres a tenacious in th offing it seemed to serve for several of the gun crew looked up with pleased grins dont know where ill find it but theres a double tot fr you all when i do at the headquarters he found hewitt slumped in his chair staring at the wall with the map of operations spread out before him that damned relief army had better show itself before long or were a cooked goose aye said kydd and searched for words of cheer we came close tdaybut doesnt it tell us that buonaparte is getting impatient running scared that he throws his army at us without he has a planan in this blow hewitt looked up an odd expression on his face pray see things from his point of view before now he has taken the strongest fortresses in europe defended by the most modern troops what does he see here in acre an ancient decaying town ruled by a bloody tyrant and defended by a ragged mix of sailors and orientals no wonder he thinks to sweep us aside quickly and get on with his conquests hes tried he has not yet but ill wager hes already sent for a second siege train to pound us to ruin even with our wonderful ships supposing he is not at this moment up to some other deviltry remember he made his name at toulon at the head of the artilleryhe is no stranger to such works they worked together on the defences hewitts halting translations of phelippeauxs schemes of fortification serving for them both they divided between them the main tasks hewitt consulted djezzar on matters concerning labour for the works and kydd saw to the lines of supply from the victualling stores and magazines to the gunsbut always many other details demanded their attention the winds blew themselves out and veered more easterly as the rain cleared with the first blue sky all eyes turned to the french encampment for signs of a new assault but the sodden ground remained impractical and to the cheers of the defenders the two ships sailed back cautiously to take up their positions once more smith came ashore immediately and energetically visited all parts of the old walled town demanding particulars of each he finished at his headquarters well done gentlemen he said with satisfaction yet i would rather you had kept a better eye on djezzar pashahe is a man of decided opinions concerning his enemies and i have just learned that in my absence he seized thirty of the prisoners had them sewn into sacks and thrown into the sea including our french officer spy i shall have to be firmer with him in the future and now i have news good news believe me you will be happy to learn that the turkish relief army in galilee has left damascus and is even now on its way south a mighty army indeed seventyfive banners of mahgrebi infantry and albanian cavalry two hundred janissaries dalat and field cannon mamelukes and kurds beyond countingnear eight times buonapartes numbers they march fast and will reach the jordan in a day or so then he must fight or retreat and abandon the siege i believe he will fight and in that case he will be obliged to divide his forces it will be an interesting time for mr buonaparte kydds heart lifted perhaps in a few days he could return to his rightful place in tenaciousthe warm fellowship and ordered sanity of the wardroom there was other news bedouin fighters were joining from the countrymore exotic fighters to prowl the walls with their flowing robes and wickedly curved knives and it seemed agents in india had discovered that buonaparte had told the sultan of mysore the scheming tippoo sahib to prepare for a victorious host that would descend on his country from persia in the footsteps of alexander however we have a more immediate worry count phelippeaux has confided that he believes the french have begun a sap a mine protected from our ships gunfire they are tunnelling towards us from their forward trenches and when they are under the wall they will explode a great charge to bring it down kydd and hewitt exchanged a glance in one stroke another dimension of war had started while they walked and talked above french engineers were driving their unseen mine ever closer in a single instant they could be blown to pieces sir does he know where it is how far its gone kydd wanted to know no doubt about ithe has seen an advance parallel grow earthworks and men go down into it the closest trench to the cursed tower is there anything we can do hewitt looked drawn and tired the usual in these cases is for us to countermine to drive our own pit towards theirs and stop them kydd shuddered he could not conceive of a worse scene than in this black underground the breaking through into an enemy mine and the savagery of hacking and stabbing in such a confined space that must follow there was no attack that day or the next it was becoming clear that buonaparte was not going to risk another frontal assault in the face of the ships broadsides and was either biding his time while his sappers did their work or was away deploying his forces to face the turkish hordes it gave smith hewitt and kydd precious time to repair and regroup one thing they could be sure of which kydd kept close to his heart they would never starvethe little feluccas bringing food ensured that it was something their enemies could only dream of without command of the sea on the following day smith brought grave news gentlemen i have to tell you now the turkish reinforcements are beaten outnumbered many times that devil buonaparte won a victory over them at mount tabor in canaan theyre fleeing north as fast as they are able and we can expect nothing from them now may we then know your intentions sir sidney hewitt asked in a low voice without any relieving force in prospect their main reason for holding out was gone slowly but surely the mining was reaching their walls and a victorious general buonaparte was returning with his booty and no threat in his rear to distract him when the news got out who knew how it would be received an evacuation was the only real course left we stay smith said calmly to yield up acre is to hand buonaparte a highway to constantinople and the world while we are still here he dare not proceed further with us in his rear therefore our duty is plain it was the cold logic of war we bend every sinew to defend ourselves every man to bear a hand in doing whatever count phelippeaux desires in the article of fortifications we send away any who cannot hold a weapon let there be nothing left undone that can help us resist the tyrant hewitt got to his feet and reached for his sword then we had best be about our business mr phelippeaux has the idea to place a ravelin outside the walls i have no idea what species of animal this is but i look forward to finding out goodday gentlemen kydd looked nonplussed outside the walls certainly we raise an earthworks on each flank of the wallthis in the shape of an arrowhead pointing towards the cursed tower each will contain a twentyfourpounder and they will have an unrivalled field of fire when they play upon the approaches to the breach building these ravelins in the open would be a bloody affair kydd mused and i desire you sir to attend to our port im sure theres much that can be done to dismay the french take what you need and tell me about it afterwardsand thank you mr kydd a brass eighteenpounder was found and in consultation with the gunner of tenacious mounted on a platform high up in the lighthouse this gave a deal of grave joy to the seamen who were employed to rig complicated sheerlegs parbuckles and all manner of tackles to raise the long gun to its final eminence when finished the height provided a most satisfying range into the french camp kydd turned his attention to the mole here was a potential hostile landing place remembering his first success in the dunes he moored a barge there with spring cables to bow and stern a thirtysixpounder carronade was mounted in it the ugly muzzle capable of blasting hundreds of musket balls at any who were brave enough to attempt a landing there were fishingboats gunboats every kind of small fry why not use them capable of clearing the shoal water inshore they could render the entire southern approaches impassable by soldiers each craft could be equipped with the smaller guns of the ships anchored offshore then spaced close around the walls ready for immediate service at any point when dusk brought a halt to the work kydd returned to the headquarters smith had the map laid out and courteously enquired what steps he had taken kydd told him puzzled that hewitt was not present as was their usual practice when setting the night watch smiths expression did not change im grieved to say that lieutenant hewitt was gravely wounded in the discharge of his duty and has been returned to his ship i have asked for another officer kydds heart went out to the dry sensitive hewitt who had suspected from the first that his own blood would join that of others in the history of this ancient holy land therefore i will assume the first watch smith said in a controlled tone aye sir may i ask if the ravelins they are secure and their guns will be in place tomorrow kydd tossed in his cot the endless striving the bloodletting and the knowledge that under the ground a mine was advancing that would end at any moment in a deadly explosionall this and the exhaustion of days and weeks facing the worst that the most famous general of the age could throw against themwas bearing down on his spirit at daybreak he went to the parapets to scan the distant french encampment with his signal telescope there were no signs of untoward activity perhaps today would be quiet at breakfast the new lieutenant was announced kydd lifted his eyesto see renzi standing there have i lost m reason in the sunor is it you m dear friend he cried lurched to his feet and gripped renzis hand he broke into a smilethe first for a long time renzi greeted his friend warmly and kydd brightened why nicholas but i had hoped you were safe in england he said how is it i find you in this place o misery and leave all the sport to your own good self renzi said lightly besides i am only returned these two days and seeing this is set fair to be the most famous siege of the age i could yet find myself noticed they paced slowly along the scarred walls of acre renzi blankfaced as he learned of the perilous state of the siege and the imminent return of the victorious buonaparte did your visit to yr family go well kydd asked after a space renzi had said nothing to him before he left other than that a family concern required his attention they walked further before renzi replied quietly it was a matter involving a decision of great importance to my future and i confess it is not yet resolved kydd knew his friend to be one who cared deeply about moral issues and worried at them until he had drawn all the threads into a satisfactory conclusion perhaps this was one such instance should you wish t debate a little nicholas that is kind in you dear fellow but the nature of my dilemma does not readily yield to the powers of rational philosophy then i shall no longer speak on it kydd said firmly renzi would come out with a fully reasoned decision when he was ready and at the moment they had other more pressing concerns did i mention renzi said in quite another voice that our good chaplain peake comes ashore shortly knowing his extreme distaste for the effusion of blood i tried to dissuade him from this charnel pit but he is a stubborn old horse he considered for a moment and added do bear him with patiencehes been aboard an anchored ship for an age while he knows that there are men here dying without comfort and he devoutly wishes to do his duty in some way the morning conference opened with the news that buonaparte was drawing close and the dismaying intelligence that because he no longer had to look to a threat from inland he could bring up and deploy every resource to the one objectthe reduction of acre this then is the climax smith declared buonaparte has all his forces present and if he cannot triumph over us with these he never will i recognise this as our supreme moment my intention is to deny him his victory and to that end i am stripping our ships of every man that can be spared and bringing em ashore to fight gentlemen we shall not be beat it was crazya few hundred seamen a handful of ships guns and the turks and arabs who could at best be only a few thousand against the might of buonapartes army we must hold smith went on i have word from constantinople that a turkish fleet is on its way to us and troops are summoned from rhodes we have but to hold and were assured the final victory he felt for a satchel under the desk and swung it up taken from a french supply vessel yesterday see what our devilish friend is up to now inside were leaflets renzi picked one up to all christians i am come to deliver you at last from the unholy practices of the muhammadans smith grimaced and the other am the defender of the true faith the infidels shall be swept away you see very well i will not stand in the way of such devout protestations i will have these delivered to christian and muhammadan alike however the muslim will read that this general is a champion of the christians while the christian will read it was the same buonaparte who bore away the pope to captivity chaplain peake came ashore by one of the boats streaming in with the reinforcements an unmistakable figure kydd went to meet him and was struck by the peculiar mixture of reverence and disgust playing on his features mr peake ill have you know we expect hourly t have the french about our ears an this will not be a sight for eyes as cultured as yr own sir i beg and have me sit on the ship in forced idleness hearing the dread sounds of war at a remove knowing there are wolves in human clothing rending each other have a care sir kydd said tightly such words arent welcomed here if you wish t remain youll keep yr judgements to yourself peake kept his silence but his expression was eloquent kydd sighed be aware i have nobody t look after ye mr peake they all have a job t do keep away frm the walls siryoull find th wounded in the town and er the djezzar will not welcome instruction on the conduct of his harem good luck mr peake rawson and bowden found their way to the headquarters and saluted smartly our orders sir rawson said his eyes straying to exotic sights the bedouin with their swaying camels and veiled ladies fierce turks with scimitars and turbans the ruin of bombardments do you stay here until you understand th situation if y please kydd made room at the table where the situation map lay open then i shall want ye to take position inside the walls here and here at opposite ends with a parcel o pikemen and cutlasses theres a breach at the cursed tower here where weve been takin the assaults if the french get through an into the town you close with em from your side clear bowden looked absurdly younghis hat was still too big but now there was a firming of his shoulders a confidence in his bearing one more thing leave aside yr dirks an ship a cutlass this is mens work andand remember what youve been taught and er good luck kydd left for the guns with a sinking heart the french encampment had swollen and rumour had it that the unorthodox druse sect was siding with the french against djezzar pasha to settle old scores now hundreds more were against them hurrying along the wall kydd placed his men alternately with the turks and arabs if some broke and ran there was a chance the seamen could hold for a time but there were among their ranks some whom kydd had seen fighting like demonstheir harsh cries had stiffened the others he could not suppress his forebodings it was possible that he might not survive to see the night and what of these men who had to take his orders as an officer and obey whether wise or illconceived they had no choice would his orders be lucid and reasoned or would he in the chaos of the moment waste their lives along the wall he saw renzi shouting to the gun crew in the redoubt nicholas ii just wanted t say the best o luck to ye he said gruffly holding out his hand i have a brace o the best claret waiting fr when we get back an we shall enjoy em together renzi looked up with the familiar halfsmile in the event it will he was interrupted by a shattering roar from the bowels of the earth a gust of superheated air threw them to the ground and showered everything with debris as it settled kydd picked himself up dazed and choking on the swirling dust the mine had exploded one half of the cursed tower lay in rubble and there was an opening in the wall wide enough for fifty men abreast to march into the town t the breach bellowed kydd it was crucial to meet the inevitable assault with as many as could be mustered until more effective resistance was ready he dropped from the wall to the top of the rubble and faced outwards his sword ready several seamen with boarding pikes and cutlasses joined him then turks and arabs with their daggers and scimitars others arrived until there were a hundred or more the horizon rapidly filled with soldiers advancing towards them more massing behind a dismayed murmur spread through the defenders kydd raised his sword give em a cheer mlads he shouted above the increasing noise the seamen raised their voices and encouraged the turks gave their harsh warcries the attackers came on in a headlong charge the numbers beyond counting the other ships guns mounted in the ravelins opened up grapeshot ripped into the attackers from to seaward came the heavy rumble of broadsides in enfilade which tore into the advancing mass at appalling cost even before the first had reached the rubblestrewn fosse the retreat had sounded and the grim marching had turned into a disorderly scramble out of range of the merciless naval guns they left the ground before the walls a wasteland of pain and dying with new dead joining rotting corpses wild dogs howling and tearing at the bodies a sickening odour of death catching in the throats of the defenders kydd felt a hot hatred for napoleon buonaparte and his towering ambition to conquer at whatever cost a tide of anger that took him above his exhaustion and anxieties and left him only with a burning determination to thwart the man stand fast he bellowed theyll be back his voice broke with emotion but he did not care they would stand until they were victorious or were overcome but the midday sun beat down without a sign of the enemy kydd stood down half of the men and sent them for rations and an hours rest smith came to observe the breach coolly taking notes ill send you all the help i can mr kydd he said scanning the wasteland beyond the walls they have to defeat us of coursebuonapartes very reputation and the future of the world rides on this in less than an hour the drums beat again and trumpets pealed the pas de charge up and down the lines but with one difference this time it was the grenadiers in full array leading the assault buonapartes finest troops at the advance edge they came on steadily marching with standards held high in their distinctive redplumed hats and long muskets aslope they were a different calibre of soldier the first shots from the ravelins found them men fell but they closed ranks and marched on the anchored ships opened up with a massed thunder tearing into the columns like a scythe still they advanced all along the parapets every man that could hold a musket blazed away the noise was horrific and smoke hung over the battle as a pallbut the grenadiers still came on at the breach kydd braced himself then someone jostled him from behind and he caught a glimpse of renzi moving up to his side palefaced but with a steely resolution i do believe dear fellow were in this together he said with the ghost of a smile flourishing his blade the first rank of the grenadiers carried pikes and as their moustachioed faces became distinct kydd gripped his sword and prepared for what must come in the last few yards they levelled their weapons and broke into a trot coming at them with a fierce snarl kydd tensed in theory the same principles must apply as with boarding a ship in the face of a pikeget inside it and the man was yours with a vicious lunge at kydds eyes a darkfeatured grenadier hurled himself at him kydd swayed just enough to avoid the pike yanking the man forward by it to his waiting blade but another dropped his pike and drew his sword kydd snatched out one of his brace of pistols and pulled the trigger in the mans face whirling to meet another who was coming in low he smashed his pistol down on the mans head but at the same time felt the searing burn of a bayonet under his arm wildly he spun about for his next opponent but saw only an unstoppable flood of soldiers pressing forward through the fierce musketry and explosions of grenades thrown from the walls renzi was backed against one side hacking and slashing at two soldiers kydd threw himself at one his sword taking him in the back his victim let out an animal squeal and a fountain of blood renzis blade flashed out at the other and transfixed him but he had seen something behind kydd and with a shout he pulled out his sword and made ready kydd realised what had happened and wheeled about but the man had disappeared back into the mêlée retire renzi shouted above the guns and death screams retreatto the second line of defences phélippeaux had preparedwas the only course the press of invaders was so great that they were jostling each other in their eagerness to break through fall back kydd roared in agreement edging round the jagged end of the wall and gesturing with his sword seeing the remnants of the breach crew disengage or be swept aside he turned and ran to the inner linean improvised parapet of rubble on each side and loopholed houses on the far side he vaulted over and crouched panting a shout of triumph went up from the grenadiers as they found themselves flooding into the town it was taken up outside the walls and excitedly echoed back from the advancing columns stand yr ground roared kydd seeing the pitiful line of defenders wavering get em while they dont know where they are the second line of defence a square a hundred yards distant inside the breach was crude but effective temporarily containing the invaders the french milled about unsure of where to head next penned in and without a clear enemy some tried to climb over the rough barrier but had to lower their weapons to do so and were easily dispatched more pressed in through the breach to add to the confusion and were met with musket fire above it all kydd could hear the crash and thump of heavy guns outsidethe battle was by no means over suddenly his eye was caught by a flutter of colour from the top of the cursed towera french flag had replaced the english the citadel that dominated the town had fallen to the enemy now it only needed them to expand their toehold in the town and they would be unstoppable acre would be buonapartes before sunset then a harsh alien braying sounded from the breach kydd stared trying to make out what was happening through the smoke and dust inwards from each side of the breach hurtled a whirling frenzy of men in gold turbans and flowing trousers all flashing blades and demonic screams they fell in a murderous fury on the french grenadiers pouring in the two sides met in the middle of the breach and as the grenadiers gave way they joined togetherone line facing outwards another inward these were bosnian chiftlicks sent by sultan selim from his personal bodyguard smith had kept them for just this occasion with a surge of hope kydd saw how they had severed those penned inside from the support of their comrades outside they had a chance he rose with a shout finish the bastards he kicked at a nearby seaman move yrselves we have a chance if we move now several looked at him as if he were a madman get off yr arses an fight he yelled hoarsely and leaped over the parapet into the dismayed frenchmen who now saw that they were in effect surrounded their cohesion as a military unit demolished seamen rose up and joined kydd in the vicious fighting that spilled out but now there was a change in the spirit of the invaders turning to retreat they found their way barred ululations of triumph became howls of terror for the turks now had the enemy at their mercy and flooded into the area from all sides slaughtering and mutilating without mercy kydds battle rage fell away at the sight and he stood back with bloodied blade as the last of the interlopers was hacked to death and the area cleared up to the breach the line of chiftlicks facing out capered and menaced with their strangely curved weapons at the demoralised columns which fell back into the fire from the ships guns kydd pulled at the sleeve of one gesturing up at the cursed tower and making suggestive motions with his sword the mans eyes were glazed uncomprehending as though he was drugged then he grinned fiercely shouted for others and rushed for the gaping ruin the wavering column began to disintegrate buonapartes brave grenadiers had broken and they fled out of range of the merciless broadsides in a sauve qui peut every man for himself trembling with emotion kydd watched them flee but suddenly a dark round object soared through the air to thump at his feetand another grenades his heart froze but they were the heads of frenchmen who had had the misfortune to be stranded in the cursed tower and found by the chiftlicks his gorge rose as much at the sight as at the sickening repetition of killing he left the line and stalked back through the breach there were now only corpses and those picking over the bodies but where was renzi at last he saw him standing bowed at one corner of the killing field relief chased dread as he crossed over to him nicholas you there was a tear in his friends eye in a low voice renzi pointed to a body and croaked mr peakehe must have got lost he cleared his throat and continued of all i know he was a man of conviction of courage and did not fear to stand for the cause of humanity over the worlds striving for vanities a gentle man and the world is now the poorer for his loss kydd walked away leaving his friend to his grief sirsir bowden raced down the steps of the parapet mr smiths duty and if you should cast your eyes to the norwest you shall see such a sight as will fill your heart kydd mounted the steps to the top of the wall and looked out to sea on the horizon perhaps a dozen miles off was a cloud of sail sprawling over most of the west the turkish fleet sir they were savedbuonaparte was thwarted deliverance meant cessation of this madness all kydd could think about was his little cabin aboard tenacious and the precious benison of sleep he snatched bowdens telescope and saw about nine warships the rest transports presumably with soldiers thats them sure enough he grunted something made him raise the glass again the image had suffered from the glare of the sun on water but it was plain now that the whole fleet lay becalmed helpless there would be no quick end the first guns started and others until the whole enemy line seemed to be alive with the flash and shock of artillery no longer were they battering at the fortifications now they aimed at random cannon balls explosive shells incendiary carcassesall fell on the town of acre setting alight houses mosques camel stables tenements screaming women ran about the streets buildings crumbled and burned kydd got hold of dobbie get all th men behind the wall an on their hunkers ironically the walls were now the safest place to be and following his example many rushed to flatten themselves against the inside of the wall sir why i dont know dobbie m guess is that buonaparte knows that if he cn break into acre afore the fleet arrives hes won some sort o ruse to rush us in the confusiontrickery of some kind for sure aye sir then well stand to th gun by yr leave sir thank ye dobbie the guns pounded all afternoon it was not until dusk drew in that the cannonfire slackened and finally stopped for want of aim kydd peered through the breach at the darkening countryside now being speckled by the light of campfires there would be no more suicidal assaults but what deviltry would they meet tomorrow the turkish fleet still lay distant offshore unable to come to their help if there was another mine or if the renewed bombardment set fire to the town he resumed his pacing at the breach his mind a turmoil after the day dobbie came up with laffin stand down th gun sir yes id get yr sleep while you can who knows what well be facing tomorrow sir dobbie turned to go but some trick of the light the last of the sunset touched the top of the cursed tower and kydd noticed the french flag still hanging limply atop it on impulse he told him afore ye turn in douse that frog rag and bring it t me dobbie touched his forehead and loped off emerging on the top of the ruined tower there appeared to be some sort of difficulty which kydd guessed was that the flag halliards had been shot away dobbie lifted a hand to point up to the flag and began shinning up the bare mast an easy feat for a seaman at the truck he tugged on the flag until it came free and stuffed it inside his shirt then he slid down the mast awkwardly and disappeared inside the tower he emerged from its base and stumbled towards kydd the flag outstretched a look of grim concentration on his face kydd stepped forward in concern but before he could reach him dobbie fell face forward to the ground and lay still the victim of a sharpshooter in the outer shadows with a hoarse cry laffin pushed past kydd and dropped to his knees next to the unmoving dobbie no he screamed blindly holding up a bloody hand and staring at it hes dead an its you y gloryseeking bastard he choked at kydd kydd keeled over into his cot shattered in mind and body the death of dobbie and laffins accusation brought an unstoppable wave of grief and emotion he tried to fight it but the weeks had taken their toll a sob escaped him it had been a cruel taunt kydd knew only too well from his time before the mast that a gloryseeker as an officer was worse than an incompetent inevitably resulting in mens lives sacrificed on the altar of ambition he could understand laffins reaction but how could he say that his order to dobbie to take down the flag and bring it was only so that he could present it to smith as a tribute for what he was achieving but was this more of a general indictment were his actions in leading from the front during the siege seen by the lower deck as an ambitious bid for notice to their cost was he in truth a despised gloryseeker kydd tossed fretfully in the close air of the little room above the headquarters his motivations in stepping forward into danger at the head of his men were he had believed those of duty and understanding of their desperate situation but could there be within him a hidden impulse to glory and ambition and what kind of leader was he his capture along with that of the men who had trusted him still smarted in him for it had been only by the greatest good luck that smith had had french captives on hand whom buonaparte had needed what was being said at the mess tables when they took their grog what judgement was being passed on him perhaps he would be perceived as an unlucky weight around whom men seemed to get themselves killed and indeed many had since the siege of acre had started kydd knew that this was at the core of himself as an officer if the seamen regarded him as square and true they would follow him through anything if he was seen as a gloryseeker he might one day find himself alone on an enemy deck he could not sleepthe torturing thoughts rioting through his mind made it impossibleand when the marine private arrived at midnight to call him for his watch he almost welcomed it renzi was below at the operations table staring at the map with its lines and erasures enumerating the many assaults and savage encounters they had endured so tired the friends spoke little more than a few words and after the customary handover renzi left for his room above kydd had the watch until dawn if it was quiet it was usual to stay at the headquarters where any could find him but his heart was so full of dark thoughts that he told the sentries gruffly he would be at the wall hearing the burr and chirp of night insects he paced along the parapet past the occasional sentries next to watchfires out there in the vast unknown velvet darkness their mortal enemy lay and plotted their destruction in the other direction was the inky sea and anchored offshore tenacious and tigre the warmth of golden light from the wardroom windows and clustered lanthorns on their focsles so redolent of the sea life but at the same time so remote from kydds place of trial he continued pacing the cool breeze bringing with it the everpresent stench of death overhead the calm splendour of stars in the moonless heavens what would they face tomorrow if the guns kept up their bombardment there would be ruin and panic the only course would be evacuation and a suicidal rearguard action his mind shied from the implications he heard someone approach in the stillness it was laffin the seamen had no night watches the man had no reason to be about at that hour cn i talk if y please mr kydd his expression was indistinct in the gloom what d ye want its bill dobbiesir if ye want to say youre grieving fr him then ill have you knowso am i he were m mate sir kydd waited warily we was twoblocks since e came aboard in halifax e was appy n did well in tenacious e didwanted t make gunners mate but didnt ave is letters an so i learned him this was by no means unknown but spoke of a deep friendship born of common hardship which kydd recognised with a stab of feeling has a wife in brixham an a little girl laffin why are you telling me this kydd said sharply the man hesitated then straightened sir i wants ye t know that i was hasty wi me words when i called ye a aye well thank you fr telling me an i think as how y should read thisn comes across it while i was makin up his gear t give to his wife he held out a paper then disappeared into the darkness kydd went to a watchfire and realised with a sinking feeling that it was a letter back in the privacy of headquarters he took the lanthorn across to the table and smoothed out the paper the writing was strong but childish kydd remembered that in canada not much more than a year ago dobbie had been obliged to make his mark on the ships books the telltale sign of illiteracy my sweet mary it began a letter home to his wife anuther day in this godblastd hole whi the bedoo like it i dont know for the lif of me it was hard to continuehe felt it a violation to read the precious words that would be all that the woman would know of her mans thoughts and feelings before kydd wondered why laffin had wanted him to read this i hav saved for you my dearist mor than eihtgteen gineas to this date i doant know when wi will return it is a hard time wi are having but my dear it wuld make yuo smil to see the rare drubbing we ar giving the frogs and we not lobsterbaks but jack tar kydd felt his eyes sting but he kept reading wi will win sweethart there is no dout of that yuo see we hav the best men and the best oficers and yuo may beleive that like sir sidny and mr kidd who i hav seen miself with his fine sowrd at the breech in the wall he giv hart to us all to see him alweys there he is a leson in currage if we see him in charg of us wi will allways tak after him wher he tell us to go the rest dissolved in a blur of tears any torturing doubts were now behind him for ever sir one hour t dawn renzi was fully awake but politely thanked the marine who touched a taper to a little oillamp he lay for a few more moments then with a sigh of resolution threw off the single sheet he had barely slept and wondered at kydds stamina after the much longer perils and hardships he had endured something had spoken to him during the night a tendril of presentiment reaching out that the day would see a culmination of all their striving for himself renzi had no doubts when it chose to strike death could come in so many waysdisease shipwreck a round shot it really was of no consequence what was of importance was the manner of leaving life with courage and no regrets in the mirror his face looked back at him grave but calm he raised an eyebrow quizzically and silently acknowledged that there was one matter trivial in the circumstances but a loose end that his logical self insisted should be resolved to satisfaction if only to impose a philosophic neatness on his life to this date it was the decision in the matter of his fathers demand that he take up his place as eldest son and heirapparent to the earldom the stakes were plain if he acceded he would be in the fullness of time the earl of farndon and master of eskdale hall if he did not his father would have no compunction in taking the legal steps necessary to disinherit and disavow him in the succession therefore in this hour he would make his decision before he and kydd went together to meet the dawn and all it would bring he knew too well the argumentshis life at sea had opened his eyes to the human condition and made all the more precious the insights he had gathered on his adventures this would cease the vapid posturings of society were a poor substitute then there was the undeniable fact that he had matured in the face of calls upon his courage fortitude and skillshe had become a man in the true sense of the word and had about him the society of others who had been equally formed where would he find these on a country estate no he was deluding himself if he was honest the true reason was that in essence he wanted excitement before security stimulation before tranquillity change before monotony the sea life his instincts were telling him that he should refuse his father but was this the proper course he must examine the consequence could he foresee his life as a disavowed son of the aristocracy he was content to continue with his persona as renzi he had means a small enough competence but his needs were little as a sea officer he valued his books far beyond a fashionable lifestyleit would be sufficient this therefore should be his decision why then was he not convinced of it at heart he knew that there was one looming consideration that forced the issue one that his father had used against him without realising its power to move him his duty it was his obligation and responsibility to prepare himself to inherit the earldom and no consideration of personal preference or taste could be allowed to take precedence therefore this was his proper answer his determination no the passion in his outburst surprised him hypothetical the argument might be yet it was not a natural conclusion it had been forced upon him and with rising excitement he saw another path of reason that led to a different decision the true meaning of his duty was not solely to his father or even to his family it was to the wider community to those who would depend on himtenants families the estate men of business it was to the caring husbandry of the land the enlightened management of the estateit was to descendants unborn would he make a worthy earl to them all or would he be a crabbed uninterested and ultimately miserable aristocrat of the species he had seen so often before no indeedhe would leave the title to henry and may he have the joy of it a shuddering sigh overtook him a burden had been lifted that had weighed on him since he realised his fiveyear exile had turned first into a blessing then a fear that it must all end and he would be compelled to return to the claustrophobia of a sedentary life he was free at last he buckled on his sword in a glow of deep satisfaction renzi found kydd alone at the top of the cursed tower staring into the void of the night even now delicately touched with the first signs of light brother he said softly but he could not find the words befitting this time of supreme trial that lay so close for them both instead he held out his hand which kydd took solemnly neither spoke as the dawn broke after the ladies had withdrawn the gentlemen settled comfortably to their brandy and port replete after as fine a dinner as ever had graced the table at no the guests looked appreciatively at the prime minister as he raised his glass a splendid repast as always addington said affably noting pitts evident contentment and if i might remark it improved upon only by the intelligence you have disclosed to us tonight indeed pitt said with satisfaction and the damnedest thing it was too at dawn smith and his doughty mariners stand to expecting to fight for their lives but what do they see nothing but an empty landscape our glorious buonapartecrept away in the night gone does this mean that buonaparte is finished at last umm we shall see we do have intelligence thats unimpeachable for oncei can tell you in confidence that we took the singularly aptly named la fortune at sea and aboard by extraordinary good luck we found the generals dispatches to paris he smiled boyishly and in them he tries so hard to find a victory in his ruination that i nearly feel pity for the man now he has to explain to france how his grand design for glory and empire has failed how the fine army that he led to victory and conquest across all europe is now lost to plague and starvation in the deserts of syria and also why he has cynically abandoned his men to their fateit seems he seeks to flee secretly to paris pitts smile widened but when he arrives the hardest task he will face is to explain the fact that the army he vastly outnumbered yet who defeated himfor the very first time on landwas not in the character of the military at all but common sailors authors note it is one of those happy coincidences that tenacious was first published in the year of the bicentenary celebrations of nelsons great victory of trafalgarand a time when we had the opportunity to value anew the achievements of such a great sea leader this book is dedicated to sir horatio nelson when i began the kydd series as i plotted out the general content of each book i knew my central character thomas kydd would meet nelson at some time no writer in this genre can tell of the stirring events in the great age of fighting sail without being aware of nelson at the centre but it was not trafalgar that i selected for this first meeting it was at the battle of the nilein my mind nelsons finest hour in the course of my research for this book my admiration for nelsonwhich was already considerablehas increased immeasurably he was undoubtedly a true genius as a leader of men but he also had a great humanity and such respect for the lower deck that he insisted on adding common seamen to his coat of arms in terms of background historical material for tenacious i was spoiled for choice it was a time of titanic global stakes if the nile or acre had been lost we would have seen napoleon dominating a world which would have been very different today and it was a time of deeds so incredible that they may seem like fantasy but are notnelson personally saving the king and queen of naples at cutlass point minorca taken without the loss of a single manand above all the astonishing but littleknown fact that napoleon was first defeated on land not by a great army but a ragtag bunch of sailors as usual i do not have the space to acknowledge all the institutions and people i have consulted in the course of writing tenacious but there are a number to whom i owe a special debt the national maritime museum holds priceless material on the thrilling nile chase much of which is now going online in minorca roy wheatley and his charming wife mary took kathy and myself under their wing when we were there on location research the admiralty hydrographic office at taunton could not have been more helpful in sourcing charts of the time including one of the actual maps used in the siege and my deep thanks are due to my wife and literary partner kathy as well as maintaining a strict and professional eye on my developing manuscript she has contrived to become my reality manager keeping the intrusions of everyday life at bay to enable me to fully immerse myself in the eighteenthcentury world i write about it is a source of great gratification to me to know that so many of you share my passion for these fascinating times and i look forward to sailing with you for many books to come
