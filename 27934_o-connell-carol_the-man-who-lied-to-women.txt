carol oconnell the man who lied to women the man who cast two shadows the second book in the kathleen mallory series prologue rain rattatted on the plastic hood of her slicker she could feel the drops but not hear them she had come out this morning without hearing aid or bifocals her landscape was dream quiet and blurred free of the small marring details of candy wrappers and cigarette butts the smell of wet dog fur hurried past her she was slow to focus on the animals rump before it had gone off the path and up the steep incline of grass clotted with bushes now the dog was jerked sharply at the neck by an unseen hand and airborne in a backward somersault squinting for clarity cora realized the dogs leash was caught up in the brambles the animal freed itself with a panic of yanks and pulls then scrambled up the slanted earth disappearing over the rise cora tucked in a windwhipped strand of white hair and became invisible again her hunters green slicker blending in with all the plant life not yet turned to the gray spectrum of deep december she looked down at her watch she should leave the park now she knew that but an inviting procession of empty benches stretched out along the path ahead drops of water waxing on their green paint she sat down on the first bench minding the old bones which reprimanded her for taking them out in the rain but she argued with the bones it was only the rain that made her feel safe in the park she reasoned that muggers would not work in foul weather nor did she believe them to be early risers her bodys closing remark was a stab of arthritis as she bent her arm over the back of the bench and rested one hand on the wood a moment later she felt a trickling sensation on her wrist a dark spot was crawling about on her white crepe flesh she bowed her head until the crawling spot on the back of her hand was within a few inches of her nearsighted blue eyes she sucked in her breath over long yellowed teeth it was a carrion beetle a longlived insect whose vocation was the desecration and desiccation of corpses but surely this tiny undertaker had come too soon there were rules of nature to be observed while an old woman still drew breath perhaps the insect had become confused by the unseasonably warm weather no matter the beetle would have to return for her another day and now a second creature entered her narrow field of unblurred vision its eight legs in crawling pursuit of the beetle oh this could not be happening this particular arachnid was bound by law to die in autumn and be eaten by its children the spider had overstayed its life it did not belong in december and now the unnatural lawbreaker was within an inch of its prey the beetle ah but this was too much violence so early in the day the elderly naturalist flicked her wrist and sent the beetle flying far and wide of the spiders jaws at her sudden movement the spider stopped then turned and crawled away all eight hands empty the serenity of the morning restored cora stared out across the widest part of the lake gray mirror of the sky slowly her gaze drifted inland to the narrow leg of water close to the path more like a pond it was still and stagnant darker here and beyond this pond and darker still were two large shapes near the waters edge two black umbrellas talking if she knew the stance of conversation and she did the taller umbrella had long legs of tan and the shorter umbrella had blue legs now the bluelegged umbrella was backing away the tall umbrella shot out one white hand to fetch blue legs back to him again cora smiled young lovers they must be and now she deduced that it was a covert meeting the tall umbrella shifted and turned showing a flash of white face as he spun round to see if he was seen he held fast to blue legs who pulled back wanting to leave him now gold hair shone bright against black as her umbrella tipped back and flew from her hand upending itself in the pond its handle sticking up as a sailbare mast it turned slowly then twirled faster and faster in a sudden rush of clean rainwashed air the tall umbrella stooped low was he retrieving something from the ground yes and he brought it up to blue legs face and then obscured coras view with his umbrella as he danced blue legs in a half turn it must be a gift he was giving her thought cora squinting blue legs must be pleased with it for she had ceased to resist the tall umbrella stunned she seemed leaning against him now not struggling at all something bright and red adorned the gold hair flowering to one side of blue legs face as they completed the half turn not dancing any longer but standing still and close a prelude to a kiss cora looked down at her watch well they would have their privacy for she was already minutes late she rose up on aching legs cora was turning away from the lovers as an umbrella was falling to the ground and two large hands grasped the head of blue legs cora was seconds down the path when the fingers were entering the bright curls when the golden head was twisted sharply unnaturally setting blue legs free of the constraints of minutes and seconds as the living understood time chapter december her fixation with machines had its roots in the telephone company nets which spread around the planet the child had only the numbers written on her palm in ink written there so she could not be lost all but the last four numbers had disappeared in a wet smudge of blood over time she had learned to beg small change from prostitutes the only adults who would not turn her over to the social workers she would put the coins into the public telephones and dial three untried numbers and then the four she knew if a woman answered she would say its kathy im lost when she was seven years old she could duplicate the tones of the public telephones by whistling with perfect pitch to open the circuits for longdistance calls and she had learned all the international codes she could also whistle the telephone out of its change and so the telephone network fed her small body and her fixation the constants of a thousand calls were the simple message and the last four digits of a telephone number all these years later there were still women around the globe and all its time zones all haunted by the disembodied voice of a child who was lost out there in the cyberspace of the telephone company detective sergeant riker of special crimes section knew nothing of kathy mallorys origins no one did she had arrived in the life of inspector louis markowitz as a fullblown person aged ten or maybe eleven who could be certain about the age of a street kid and her history belonged to her alone the inspectors wife helen markowitz had washed the child and discovered something remarkable beneath the patina of dirt a waterfall of clean burnishedgold hair was parted to expose the glittering green eyes the painfully beautiful face of delicately sculpted angles and hollows and the full red mouth kathys intelligence had seemed like an excess of gifts fourteen years later according to the homicide report of detective palanski she was lying dead on an autopsy table just the other side of the door sergeant riker pushed through the door and into the shock of cold air a pool of bright light surrounded the metal table the carts and instruments which included the incongruous carpentry tools of drill and saw he looked down at the partially sheeted body a young doctor stood by the table masked below the eyes and wearing green scrubs and rubber gloves they had met previously over other bodies the pathologist nodded to riker recognizing him as less than a friend but more than an acquaintance the younger man turned his face back to the microphone suspended above the body as he continued to intone the list of statistics welldeveloped female approximately twentyfive years old as riker bent over the corpse the overhead lamp highlighted every silver hair and deepened the lines of his sleptin face and suit wound and bruising to lateral forearm a defensive wound so there had been a struggle blonde curls framed a porcelain face he squinted past the dried blood of the head wound and the damage done by a feasting of maggots and beetles it was the wrong face wound to the side of the skull he pulled back the lid of one eye which had lost its roundness and gone all cloudy still this eye was not and never had been green his own eyes went to the roots beneath the curls not blonde roots not kathy body inches in length this young woman was not as tall by five inches but she was slender like kathy and the same age bones of the cervical vertebrae are broken riker was slow to regain control over all the muscles in the face and throat that could prevent a burnt out iseeneverything rummy cop from crying like a man who still had feelings after thirtyfive years on the force he closed his eyes detective palanski is a damn idiot said a familiar voice behind his back riker turned to face the chief medical examiner dr edward slope was pulling on a pair of rubber gloves a green surgical mask hung free beneath his cragged and deadpan face all the anger was in the mans words slope had also known kathy in her puppy days the resemblance isnt close enough to make them sisters palanskis a kid said riker who said this of everyone under forty and its not like he worked with her every day the hands are crushed no blood loss injury sustained after death riker opened his notebook and pulled out his pen he kept his eyes away from the woman on the table bereft of her sheet exposed to the lights the eyes of men the cold air the body was found in the park four or five blocks from mallorys neighborhood on the upper west side the victim was wearing a blazer and blue jeans just like mallory and mallorys name was on the tailors label dr slope was staring down at the corpse kathy mallorys eyes are so green they shouldnt be legal how could palanski confuse the color of her eyes with these pale blues he wouldnt have touched her eyes said riker he was scared of mallory even when he thought she was dead he was scared of her rigor mortis is still present in the neck and jaw dr slope moved closer to the table nodded to the younger pathologist and picked up a clipboard which dangled by a chain now he turned back to riker what have you got so far coffeys got a preliminary report from the west side squad the me investigator on the crime scene estimates the time of death at yesterday morning between and an entomologist is working on the bug larvae maybe they can narrow it some your man figures the body was moved within an hour of death all that was written on the page of his notebook was the word bugs riker didnt have to look directly at the woman to know what was being done to her the young man with the mask and the knife was making the first incision crossing from shoulder to breastbone and then on to the other shoulder his blade describing a v in peripheral vision riker saw the next slice the downward motion of the knife hand cutting the body open from the breast to the mount of venus the smell of blood mingled with urine and feces he could hear her liquids running into the holes at the sides of the table palanski was the first detective on the scene he figures the park for a dump site and what do you think riker could be i dont know weve only got grass stains on the clothes maybe he did her in the park and then dragged her deeper into the woods so he could have some privacy while he was working on her hands and that sound just now was the first of her organs dropping on to the scale a lung or maybe it was her heart that fits said slope no blood loss with those wounds the hands were smashed up after death i cant see you pulling prints on this one the medical examiner slid an xray out of a large manila envelope and held it up to the light the blow to the head wouldnt have killed her her neck was snapped after he stunned her fractures indicate a heavy blunt object like a rock could be by the direction of the bone fragments id say he hit her from the front with the object in his right hand no bruising on the throat he probably used both hands to break her neck by twisting the head are you staying around for the report i dont know said riker since its not one of our officers this one goes back to the detectives on the west side its nothing special crimes would have an interest in evidence of a recent abortion more of her organs were dropping on to the scales three times he counted the cold slap of soft tissue on metal riker kept his eyes nailed to his notebook i think dr oberon said there were defensive wounds on the arm slope picked up the arm and bent closer to it no more like a restraint bruise the bastard had a strong grip on her arm large hand too oh and be sure to tell palanski im going to sick mallory on him hes ruined my morning i dont see why i shouldnt have him destroyed without looking up from his notebook riker knew that the organs of her torso were all accounted for the younger pathologist was moving to the head of the table to make the long incision which would begin at one ear and stretch along the top of her crown to the other ear then the man would pull the flap of skin down over the face of the girl who was not kathy it was done quickly with the sure strokes of a butcher now riker listened to the saw slicing into her skull a minute more and her brains would hit the scale his pen hovered over the notebook as that minute dragged by and then it was over she was gutted and ruined because the woman might have been kathy the killer had touched him in his soft places kathy mallory had crept into those soft places as a child and grown up in them later in the day he would soak his despair in scotch but not drown it it would be waiting for him in the morning with his hangover tomorrow the two of them despair and headache would be married to one another and sitting at the foot of his bed when he awoke to a new morning or maybe it would be afternoon and then they would get him for all the days of her suspension from the force the beautifully tailored lines of her blazers had been uninterrupted by the bulge of a smith wesson revolver she might have passed for a civilian but for the uncivilized green eyes she was settled deep into the wellpadded brocade of an eighteenthcentury couch in a warm patch of afternoon sun one slim bluejeaned leg curled under her but the running shoe never touched the material helen markowitz had raised her to respect furniture whether it be the antiques which filled this office with the colors of persian rugs and stainedglass lamp shades or the cruder appointments of nypd talk to him mallory said effrim wilde who knew better than to presume he might call her kathy or kathleen on only a few years acquaintance or even ten the long slants of her eyes were only half open as she turned her face to effrim i hope the kid isnt possessed by the devil she said she glanced at charles i really hate that charles butler smiled broadly effrim wilde smiled not at all effrim was a rounded silhouette in the soft diffusion of light from the wide center window dwarfed by the tall triptych of arched glass panes he might have been taken for an altar boy and not a man in his middle fifties the aging cherub face was crowned by wavy hair more salt than pepper now charles its a fascinating problem nothing fascinating about it said charles its garden variety fraud charles coveted effrims pug nose for his own was constantly reminding him of its size and length charles could look nowhere without looking over it or trying to see around it or noting the shadow it cast on every wall he was not a handsome man he knew that and he had long ago come to terms with the realization that strangers took him for an asylum escapee perhaps because of the large eggshaped eyes and the undersized blue marbles that rolled around the vast white surfaces giving him the look of having been taken by surprise give it up effrim im not dealing with that kind of nonsense he said rising from a queen anne chair and inadvertently looming over the smaller man at sixfour charless looming was unavoidable it isnt nonsense charles i have the data the russian or the chinese never mind im not terribly impressed with either those experiments have never been duplicated to my satisfaction im not buying it why dont you fob the case off on malakhai malakhai the debunker i thought he was dead no hes in retirement now but i dont think a small boy will cause him any undue exertion he wont charge you much for fifteen minutes work charles turned to mallory malakhai is an old friend of the family he toured europe with cousin max when he was a practicing magician this was all a bit before your time charles im not concerned about the expense said effrim good not that he needs the money shall i call him absolutely not every case he ever worked on became a sideshow what we want here is discretion were talking about a little boy a very troubled little boy are we charles rose on the balls of bis feet smiling pleasantly i thought you were sucking up to the boys father because he controls a grant committee it is that time of year isnt it when the think tank passes the hat i only deal with legitimate gifts measurable gifts levitating objects thats not a gift effrims eyes rounded in mock incredulity that charles would not see things his way but then charles saw effrims every expression as a mockery of honest sentiment effrim you know the boy is a fraud hes not levitating anything and its no good appealing to mallory shes not overly sentimental about small children little old ladies or dogs nor does she believe that inanimate objects can fly without a physical activator and the proper term is psychokinesis well you would know the technical jargon better than i said effrim waving his hand in the expansive gesture of concession i stand corrected thank you and if the boy levitates food its called a food fight thank you charles now charles watched the mechanics of effrims small smile the downcast eyes the aggrieved sigh for those who were not yet enlightened and he knew his old friend was regrouping for another assault this child has been through a terrible emotional ordeal said effrim in the tone of brothers and sisters let us pray his mother died when he was only nine years old and fourteen months later his first stepmother died no good effrim psychokinesis is not my field effrim rolled his eyes up in the manner of the insipidsaint school of fourteenthcentury painting your field is discovering new gifts and finding applications for them is it not this child is in the gifted category in other areas you know his iq is somewhere between yours and mine and theres some urgency to this his new stepmother is badly frightened it seems hes been applying his gift in a rather terrifying way one long and slender arm led by five red fingernails stretched across the back of the couch as mallory was roused from lethargy so the new stepmother is the target charles watched effrim mentally stepping back to reappraise mallory as a possible ally estimating the location of her buttons what pressure to push them with and which buttons to avoid this was effrims special gift his art i do hope not said effrim with exquisite insincerity hes been moving sharp objects around charles filled mallorys empty glass with dry sherry a look passed between them and in that look a small conversation took place in which he begged her not to encourage effrim he next offered the decanter to his good friend of many years whom he would not trust with the silver effrim if you believe the boy is in trauma wouldnt it be better to refer him to a psychiatrist probably not said mallory answering for effrim how many shrinks fall into the genius category if its fraud and the boy is that bright he could put it by the average peabrain charles looked her way his smile dipping down on one side to say i begged you not to do that she was avoiding his eyes and further ocular conversation he found it interesting that she would take effrims part when she was so suspicious of the man shed had a good instinct there how did the mother and first stepmother die she asked effrim so it was only the body count that interested mallory he should have guessed that she was bored with the partnership when her suspension was over he would lose her to special crimes section he had nothing to offer her no dead bodies no puzzles quite so interesting as murder effrim was looking into his glass reading his next line in the sherry it was tragic really tragic the boys natural mother died of a heart attack odd because she was so young at the time only twentyeight he looked up to gauge the effect of the hook on mallory but her face was devoid of emotional cues he stared into her eyes for too long and became unsettled by them turning back to his glass he spoke to the sherry and then his first stepmother committed suicide she didnt leave a note mallory lifted her chin slightly her eyes were all the way open now charles stared at the ceiling oh good job effrim thats quite a run of bad luck in one family said charles only for the women said mallory well take it she didnt look to charles for confirmation not that he minded it might keep her from cutting the cord of mallory and butler ltd for a while but the break was inevitable nypd was unlikely to allow her to moonlight any longer there must be limits to what she could get away with effrim was edging toward the door right effrim best to hit and run ill send over a check for the retainer effrim said and then for his most stunning trick the wide cheshire smile lingered on after the door was closed behind him mallory was rising off the couch running shoes lighting on the floor at the edge of the carpet ill chase down the life insurance angle ah just a minute mallory we were asked to evaluate the psychokinetic activity not the family history youre kidding right right lunch theres nothing in the office fridge no there wouldnt be now that he thought of it she had trusted him with a shopping list he had used the back of it to jot down two telephone numbers and used the whole of it to mark his place in a book but he had forgotten to use any part of it for shopping lets go to my place they walked across the hall and into the apartment that was his residence here an eagleeyed mrs ortega saw to the contents of the refrigerator out of pity for the shoppingdisabled charles today the cleaning woman had left a note on the refrigerator door attached by a magnet it was a diagram of the kitchen showing all the war zones where she had set traps for the mouse he felt sorry for the rodent so great was his confidence in mrs ortega mallory was ensconced at the kitchen table the kitchen was his favorite room the walls were lined with racks of spices and agents for tenderizing flesh and instruments for torturing vegetables slicing dicing and boiling them in oil he was now in the process of covering the table with refrigerator finds mallory was picking over plastic containers packages of meat and no less than five colors of cheese and putting together original creations of sandwich mania on his final trip back from the refrigerator he offered her a new discovery in pickle labels you were happier in special crimes werent you when markowitz was alive she said opening the jar and sniffing then approving the contents with a nod working with coffey isnt quite the same if i go back ill be stuck in the computer room forever he was really pissed off the last time i saw his face hell never let me out in the field again i thought this suspension was just a formality it is when you shoot a perp youre relieved of duty while the civilian review board investigates the case but you didnt kill the mugger and he did beat and rob that old man coffeys got a different way of looking at things so you dont want to dissolve the partnership no it never occurred to me but that doesnt mean i wont go back to special crimes when my suspension is over and now she checked her watch and reached up to turn on the small television set on the kitchen counter it was time for the news and she did like to keep up on the citys death rate but there are department regulations against moonlighting arent there yes there are and what of it said her eyebrows on the way up the news show was reporting the daily carnage with a video window on the death clock of times square as the statistics of the dead were read by the newscaster the numbers on the giant public bulletin board changed before an audience of a thousand cars and pedestrians and the millions more who preferred to view cheap spectacle on television i hate that thing she said watching the change of electronic digits which kept the national score of death by guns the death clock but mallory i thought you of all people would appreciate computerized death it makes homicide so neat and efficient she said nothing her face shut him out resolving itself into a cold mask this was his only clue that he had erred why did he persist in the belief that he might ever learn to anticipate her who knew what went on inside of mallory and how could he not go on wondering charles was staring at the television set but his mind had strolled across the hall to the office where she stored her computer toys of course keeping the partnership had its practical aspects here she had freedom from the supervision of anyone who might recognize her equipment as the electronic equivalent of burglary tools this word just in said the news broadcaster calling charles back to the kitchen and the moment now he was looking at mallorys face on the television screen we have a bulletin the broadcaster was saying a police officer has been murdered in central park the victim is sergeant kathleen mallory daughter of the deceased inspector louis markowitz who gave his own life in the line of duty details of the murder are being withheld pending further investigation charles looked across the table at the living solid threedimensional mallory as though he needed to verify her existence needed to be sure his eyes were not in error before he could doubt the veracity of television suppose she had not been with him when he heard the news they watched in silence much channel changing told them other news programs were also carrying the story and now the phone was ringing in concert with the doorbell the first of the condolence calls he supposed mallory went off to answer the door as he picked up the phone hello charles this is riker dont you ever pick up the messages on your answering machine riker is this about the report on mallorys death yeah said riker im calling from the medical examiners office weve been trying to track down mallory all day is she there could you put the little corpse on the phone mallory walked back into the kitchen followed by dr henrietta ramsharan of apartment a henriettas dark hair fell soft and loose around the shoulders of her denim shirt she wore her afterhours faded jeans and the confusion of the eyes which came from having the door opened by a dead person lieutenant jack coffey was sitting at his own desk but the desk was in inspector markowitzs office though louis markowitz was dead the old man would always be in command of the special crimes section and this would always be his office jack coffey counted himself lucky that the paychecks were made out to himself but just now he was thinking of markowitzs daughter kathleen mallory palanskis report was sitting on his desk replete with the crimesite preliminary faxed over from the west side precinct the fax photos were dark but the light hair shone through the grainy shadows and he could make out the outline of the slender body in the familiar jeans running shoes and blazer he only waited on the positive identification from a friend of the family to complete the report no doubt sergeant riker would pull the pin after this one markowitzs death had hit the man hard mallorys death would be too much coffey turned off the lamp and braced his hands on the desk as though a man of thirtysix needed this solid crutch to rise to a stand he stared at the bulletin board on the back wall of the office and wondered if a little water on his face might make him feel less dead who could get so close to her that the bastard could hit her that way no one it could not be but the evidence was sitting on his desk in black and white and her pretty face was all over the television on every channel and when he found the cop who leaked it to the media one head was gonna roll ah mallory if he could have her back for a few minutes he would risk the sarcasm and the look that would neatly snip his balls for caring if she lived or died sucker her eyes would say he could almost see her standing there he even imagined that he could smell her perfume it was time to go home where the bottle was he turned oh christ he grabbed at the door frame and missed too slow with shock to fall immediately and catching himself on the second pass at something solid which was the chair his stomach shot up and then slammed back to where it belonged mallory stood in the doorway her gold hair was backlit by the office lights beyond the door and coming up behind her was a fluorescent washed out riker i know said mallory you thought it was me in the morgue well mallory said riker he did and he didnt the lieutenant heard you were dead but he knew youd be back after sundown riker ambled into the office behind mallory and tossed his report on the desk one beverage and two different types of food stains graced the front page coffey was staring at the report and looking for his voice as she sat down in the chair by his desk and stretched out the long legs that went on forever riker dragged another chair up to the desk pulled out his notebook and leaned over to flick on the lamp on the rear wall mallory was casting the reassuring shadow of a living woman coffey lowered himself into his chair he was fighting down the gut flutters one hand resting on his stomach as though he could kill the internal butterflies by smothering them this way the corpse was wearing a brown cashmere blazer that was tailored for you mallory riker looked at his notebook and nodded to her that was confirmed by your tailor on nd street according to palanskis report youre the guys most memorable customer can you explain the blazer ease up coffey told himself she was not a suspect softening out of the interrogation mode he added its the only lead we have youll find rikers cigarette burn on the left sleeve she said and not softly at all i got rid of it you trashed it no i gave it to anna kaplan rabbi kaplans wife she collects clothing for the homeless he looked down at rikers report reading through the orange sauce stains and one stain that damn well better not be beer according to the mes report this is the body of a wellnourished female in her midtwenties no indication that she was homeless no head lice no bedbugs he left out the feeding frenzy of maggots and beetles that would help to determine the time of death in the scavenging cycle of insects so mallory shrugged talk to palanski see what else he botched besides the id on the corpse what have we got so far her question was well within the purview of a crimes analyst he needed her back how to get through this without antagonizing her without falling into the inevitable round of oneupmanship which she always won he scanned the lines of rikers report we know she had an abortion within ten days of death the first wound was a frontal assault to the head he was facing her that could mean it was personal someone she knew outside of that weve got nothing said coffey no witness no weapon it was raining yesterday morning said riker tapping the early homicide report on the corner of coffeys desk the rain would have washed away any physical evidence if heller couldnt dig it up it wasnt there the weapon could have been a rock and that rock is at the bottom of the lake if the perp has half a brain and thats assuming she was killed in the park we know the body was moved after death we dont have an officer involvement said coffey if youve got nothing more to add to this report im bouncing it back to the west side squad tonight mallory sat well back in her chair eyes halfclosed looking nearly harmless with no prints itll take them a month to id that body maybe longer or never itll be a low priority case so if the park was only a dump site theyll never find the kill site theyre gonna blow it i suppose you could do it better and faster and yes he could see that was exactly what she thought you want me to i want you to go back to your damn computer room im still on suspension and im considering a better offer mallory rose from her chair and in the next instant he was looking at the back of her as she walked out of the room you know shes right said riker leaning over in his chair checking the door to be sure she was gone out of earshot the west side dicks will lose it the perps gonna get away with the murder it happens nothing i can do about it give this one to mallory her job description is crimes analysis and computers not fieldwork but she has worked in the field unofficially and only because i had a shortage of warm bodies if she wants to make it official she has to go through the paperwork and put in some time with a partner now who could work with her and youre forgetting this case is another precincts headache well technically its still the property of special crimes why not give it to mallory just give it to her close your eyes and dont ask her a lot of questions like markowitz did when she broke six laws a day breaking and entering other peoples computers cutting corners bypassing timeconsuming channels and warrants proving invaluable i should just let her run her own private police department is that the idea riker yeah but markowitz didnt want her to work the field he all but padded the walls of that computer room he spoonfed her every detail of a case i always thought he was wrong in that riker lit a cigarette without asking if coffey minded coffey minded but bit it back hed grown accustomed to this game they played needling within parameters that stopped just short of insubordination and he had not yet thanked riker for failing to call in the false id from the morgue all this time she could have been learning fieldwork so she could survive out there said riker exhaling a blue cloud of smoke now it occurs to me that shes got her own way of surviving and it might be a better way its a waste of talent to keep her in the computer room it was letting her out of the computer room that got her suspended that was a righteous shoot you know better than that riker if shed killed the perp id have no problem with that but mallory wanted to play with him whose call is that are you telling me that pack of idiots on the civilian review board ruled against her the review board commended her on restricting her use of force to shooting a gun out of a mans hand but then theyre civilians arent they im the one whos got a problem with the shooting the perp aimed a gun at mallory she shouldve put that bullet in his heart but if shed just killed him where would be the fun in that no comeback riker coffey mentally scratched one point for himself but the big score would be in getting the last word now ive got a backlog of cases and shes not replaceable on the computer thats it coffey shuffled the papers on his desk and then bowed his head to read them had a more sensitive human been sitting in rikers chair he would have recognized this signal of dismissal he was still seated when his superior looked up from the paperwork coffeys glare was wasted on riker who seemed preoccupied with his own thoughts riker catch up to mallory and tell her the suspension is terminated riker nodded but remained entirely too comfortable in his slouch to be going anywhere very soon if you dont give mallory something more interesting shell walk he said spilling out his words with the smoke in an economy of effort shell keep the consulting partnership with charles that setup is illegal as hell and its gonna stop or ill take her badge said coffey trying the lie out on riker first and wondering how mallory would take it you cant scare mallory he hated it when riker was right if the department ever did enforce the regulations on moonlighting there wouldnt be three cops left to guard the city are you volunteering to play wet nurse riker mallory doesnt need me for that she doesnt need any human being on the planet she came that way when she was a kid real selfsufficient little i thought markowitz was your friend riker are you trying to give that dead man a heart attack by putting his kid in the line of fire if she hadnt been his daughter he would have used her right he would have been ruthless about it riker deposited an ash on the carpet the whole world was rikers ashtray why should i give her this one the guy is brutal hes a psycho coffey held up the morgue photo and riker turned his face to the floor first he smashes the womans skull in and then he turns her head till her neck snaps how is mallory going to if youre afraid shes gonna shoot him in the hand i think shes learned her lesson riker lifted his shaggy head to face coffey with something approaching serious feeling give her a chance he then shrugged his shoulders to show that this business really meant very little to him and now coffey realized it meant a great deal to riker you know shed have absolutely nothing to go on thats what she likes about it said riker the first time you said that her little monster eyes lit up like green candles its enough to make you believe in hell all we know about the perp is that hes dangerous to women and you want me to give him to mallory sure give a dangerous lunatic to the baby to cut her teeth on shes perfect for this one how do you figure while coffey waited on an answer he looked down at the report on his blotter and picked up a pencil to initial it riker slumped low in his chair and put his feet up on the desk coffeys pencil snapped in two you know riker drawled through the smoky haze even in the early days markowitz took a lot of pride in mallory he used to brag on her all the time he said it wasnt every father in the neighborhood who had a kid with the psych profile of a sociopath chapter december he had seen the magic bullet again in dreams he had watched its slow float from the mouth of the gun to his gut watched it penetrate his flesh and make the blood fly on his way to the bathroom rikers bare foot knocked an empty beer bottle to one side he never felt the hard connection of flesh to glass so vivid was the dream in front of his open eyes one day the booze would get him killed his reflexes would not kick in when he needed them to save his sorry life awake or asleep the magic bullet was always floating in the air just ahead of him but he and the bottle were an old married couple now and he preferred the dream of the bullet to the vision of spiders which had come with his last attempt at divorce from alcohol how many years had it been thirteen years at least that he had been going through withdrawal strapped to a bed of delirium tremens on the day kathy mallory crawled through the window of the clinic which did not allow children to visit by the front door the little girl had hit the floor in her rubbersoled shoes and the eerie stealth of a born thief for one slow blink the strange child had blended well with the tableau of spiders which crawled all over his body the sheets and the walls the largest of the spiders dangled from the ceiling madly spinning its silken line dropping ever closer to his face in an aerial ballet of eight black dancing legs and then it danced upon his eyes while his arms were bound by thick leather restraints the spider get it off my eyes he had screamed at mallory who was kathy then years later when she joined the force she would forbid him to use her given name young kathy had come close to the bed peered into his eyes and pronounced them free of spiders and then she looked at him with such contempt she was so close he could see his own bugsize self twicereflected in her eyes he had turned to the larger mirror on the hospital wall the better to see what she had seen his face bathed in sweat awash in fear and twitching a slick of vomit trailed from his mouth to his chin he slowly nodded his head in agreement with kathy he was so pathetic even spiders would not live in his mind with him any more he remembered thanking god that helen markowitz had taught kathy not to spit indoors he could see it was in her mind to do it when she looked down at him instead she had only turned around and left the way she had come disappearing through the window then small hands were gripping the sash closing the window behind her making no sound and leaving no trace of her unlawful entry after that day after all the spiders had fled for a more upscale mental disorder than his own he had not been successful in giving up the bottle but made a point of never again losing face with kathy the unpitying brat had ended his days of public fallingdown crawlinghome drunken binges as drunks go he had become semirespectable rarely stumbling never reeling any more even through his sunglasses the light at the level of the sidewalk was painfully bright he opened the passenger door of mallorys small tan car and climbed inside he leaned toward the windshield lowering his scratched green shades and squinting at the panorama of his neighborhood so this is morning dead silence from mallory he had kept the punctuality freak waiting while he dressed and shaved he was anticipating her slow burn as he shrugged down deep into the upholstery smiling affably tying his tie he waited for the sarcasm instead she gunned the engine ripped the car away from the curb and laid a streak of hot rubber on the street leading away from his apartment building riker grabbed the dashboard thinking this might keep his brains from sloshing around in his skull and stop the pain of the hangover okay mallory its gonna be a long day play nice the car slowed down to a lawabiding pace and her voice was deceptively civil when she said the uniforms came up dry with the doormen on the upper west side she didnt live in that neighborhood nobody could make the photographs so she had started without him what else might she have been up to it was only in the morning most days he would just be opening his eyes at this hour and only thinking about rolling to the floor and if he landed with enough momentum maybe continuing on to the bathroom in the tone of you got this coming to you kid he said if youd had a few years in fieldwork youd know how hard it is for most people to id a corpse from a morgue photo even one without a damaged face a mother could make the id in a heartbeat and maybe a close friend could do it but a doorman no way so we still dont know that she didnt live in that neighborhood mallorys expression in profile might read the venom of im going to get you for that or the merely sarcastic yeah right he was pretty confident it was one of those two things where are we headed he ventured testing the atmosphere between them going to brooklyn no she said ive been to brooklyn anna dropped the clothes off at a collection center the center trucked them into the main clearing house in manhattan annas bundle went to a womens shelter in the east village so were going to a shelter mallory i gotta go along with coffey on this one i just dont see our jane doe in a womens shelter ive already been to the shelter the cashmere blazer wasnt on the inventory somebody lifted it at the warehouse thats where were going now how do you know it wasnt lifted at the shelter oh stupid question she had turned the place inside out and probably alienated every a friend of annas runs that shelter she opened annas bundle herself no blazer so we go to the clearing house and talk to everybody who handled it ten minutes rolled by on the road in companionable silence that was one bright spot of doing time with mallory she made no small talk if she opened her mouth it was to take a swipe at him or make a point when they pulled up alongside the warehouse he picked his own words with careful timing he put one hand on her shoulder before they entered the building mallory no cowboy shots this time out i backed you with coffey but he was right and you know it if you gotta spend a bullet you do it right and you do it clean okay schools out they passed through the lobby in a testy silence and rode up to the third floor in a gray metal box the size of a coffin the elevator doors opened on to a single room the length and width of a city block irregular corridors made of stacked packages and bundles extended far into the illusion of converging parallels dust hung in the air around the forklift shuttling back and forth down the wide center aisle picking up cartons as numbers were called out over a bullhorn in the hand of a man with bandy legs and a beer belly mallory flashed her badge and fell into step with the man as he walked in the center aisle grimy light from neverwashed windows gave the place a secondhand look to go with the smell of the clothing riker had worn such clothes as a child and he could never lose that smell he followed behind mallory pulling out his notebook the bandylegged crew chief was alternately calling out numbers from his clipboard and carrying on a conversation that mallory was not listening to no one would touch one of those bundles said the crew chief whos gonna risk a job for a crummy secondhand rag riker smiled he guessed the rag in question had set mallory back at least nine hundred dollars if not more nothing but the best for mallory helen markowitz had seen to that beginning in the early days when riker was still allowed to call her kathy but despite the designer wardrobe helen had lavished on the child kathy had gone everywhere in blue jeans tennis shoes and tshirts today that wardrobe only varied in the tailored gray wool blazer that bulged on the left as a warning that she carried a large gun in a shoulder holster and she had traded her canvas tennis shoes for the most expensive leather running shoes god ever personally cobbled who handled the bundles when they came in she asked couldve been any one of eight guys said the crew chief and then called out in the amplified scream of the bullhorn get them out here all eight of them look honey im always happy to cooperate with the cops but i aint did i ask you for cooperation get them and now riker could see that the crew chief was from the old school no woman was going to dress him down and get away with it the man turned on mallory with all the indignation of a pit bull lips parted to a display of teeth and then something in her face shut his mouth perhaps he had just remembered that he had come out this morning without a weapon he cleared his throat lifted the bullhorn and barked off the names the men came out of all the stacks with clipboards and pencils sweat and curiosity leers for mallory and puffs of cigarette smoke they fell into a ragged line as she looked them over like a prospective buyer the leers dropped away and riker watched discomfort settle in there was shifting of feet and the small talk of eyes between them one man was sweating more than the rest and his adams apple had a life of its own mallory seemed to like this one with the red hair and freckles now she kept her eyes on him alone his shoulders hunched and his head lowered as he made himself smaller his muscles were tensing bunching through the thin cloth of his tshirt mallory turned to riker and lifted her chin a bare quarter of an inch she looked back to the redhead riker circled around to the right as mallory moved forward the redhead balked and ran riker reached out to grab the tshirt and missed and now mallory was pounding after the man and riker jogged behind her in the dust kicked up by her shoes jimmy the crew chief screamed come back here you jerk its only a secondhand sports coat but jimmy was out of earshot jimmy farrow was running as fast as he had ever run from a cop and hed outrun a few he looked back to see the old guy turning red trying to keep up but the woman was almost on top of him every time he chanced to look over his shoulder she was right there four feet behind and not even breathing hard her blazer flapping open to expose a very big gun oh christ was she grinning she was she stayed with him through the narrow streets then across all the lanes of traffic on wide houston and over the courtyard wall of an apartment building in the west village he made the leap of his life and hooked his hands on a fire escape he hauled his body up and climbed the metal stairs as he gained the next landing he looked down through the grate she was nowhere in sight he was looking up to the landing above when he was grabbed by the hair and pulled backward where did she come from a kick to the inside of his knee and he was off balance falling to the grate of the fire escape rolling to the edge blood rushed to his head as he was leveraged over the side and dangling arms waving in circles he was looking down at the sidewalk three flights below twisting his head to look up through the grate he could see her holding the back of his jeans and kneeling on his legs he stopped struggling if she let go he was gone she could dump him any time she wanted to so you stole the cashmere blazer and she eased off his legs and let him hang a little lower the jacket he screamed thats what this is about that stupid sports jacket you stole it right he saw the pavement come up a few more inches to meet him a winter breeze chilled the sweat on his body and made him shiver yeah i did it okay didnt she like it what crazy bitch what does she want yeah she liked it she liked it just fine he wondered if he might be rightside up after all and it was the world that was upside down the old cop was down below snagging the ladder for the fire escape and lowering it down to the pavement the old guy took his sweet time walking up the stairs like it was nothing to see some poor bastard hanging in midair and pointed headfirst toward the cement damn cops mallory dont do this to me said the old guy you dont want coffey on my ass do you and the woman said he wont complain i can do anything i want with him you drop him and thats three days of paperwork she loosened her grip he dropped lower okay okay screamed jimmy farrow i already told her i did it let me up he was being hauled up by four ungentle hands when he was rightside up and sitting down the old guy took out his notebook you wanna make a statement kid is that what youre telling me yeah okay my grandmothers social security check got screwed up this month a neighbor bought her groceries for a few days till my mom could replace the money i just wanted to give amanda shes the neighbor i wanted to give her something it was my grandmothers idea now let me get this straight said the old guy pen circling over his notebook first you give amanda the blazer then you killed her and your grandmother made you do it oh god theyre both nuts i didnt do anything to her i just gave her the sports jacket were you very close to amanda no i go to my grandmothers building twice a week to sweep out the halls my grandmothers the super but shes not up to slopping all those floors and stairs any more what a good boy you are said the old guy now about amanda i see amanda in the hall now and then thats all she and my grandmother were real tight talk to the old lady the old woman was waiting for them on the front steps of the building jimmy farrow stood between two uniformed officers on the sidewalk his head bowed and his hands cuffed behind his back riker climbed the steps behind mallory and watched the old woman looking from mallory to her grandson lips slightly parted in disbelief police said mallory showing the id card and shield youre mrs farrow this is your grandson the old woman nodded her eyes blinking rapidly riker looked back to the sidewalk the siren on the squad car had scattered most of the hookers like roaches but now one came weaving back too jazzed on crack to be afraid i want access to amanda boschs apartment said mallory do you have a warrant the old woman asked automatically that was predictable to riker it was a neighborhood where such a phrase came tripping to the tongue spoken even before that alltime favorite i didnt do it shes dead said mallory you think i need a warrant nicely worded kid and the denial in the slow shake of the old womans head was also predictable such a thing could not be said mrs farrows eyes she pulled her thin sweater close about her neck as though that would protect her from mallory she retreated two faltering steps mallorys long reach put a photograph in the old womans face is that her is that amanda bosch ease up mallory we dont want to kill a taxpayer mrs farrow stared at the image of the dead woman and crossed herself another protection failed her as mallory put her face in the old womans face is that her yes yes its amanda bosch mallory made a note and riker knew her meticulous report would read that positive id was made at am that would make a department record for a corpse without prints they followed the old woman up the stairs and down the hail to the apartment at the end of the second landing mrs farrow fumbled with the lock but finally managed it when the hand with the key ring came back to the old womans side the keys jingled with the trembling riker entered the apartment behind mallory mrs farrow hovered on the threshold for a moment and then melted away down the hall the first thing he noticed about the apartment was that it was clean from where he stood he could see through the sparkling galley kitchen and into the room beyond it spotless smelling of cleansers and powders all cleaned up for company or had the place been cleaned up for blood traces and prints the inside doorknob gleamed he looked down and moved his head to see it from every possible angle there might be latent prints on it but he doubted it even mallory was not so neat that she wiped the prints from her own doorknob when she left her apartment he called through the open door to a uniformed police officer standing out in the hall with jimmy farrow looks like this might be the original crime scene ask the old lady if you can use her phone to call the techs waste of time said mallory bending low to approve the polish of a small table every surface was gleaming very neat if our guy gets off on a psycho defense i may hire him to clean my condo markowitz had raised her right she touched nothing hands jammed into the pockets of her jeans as they continued the routine walkthrough into the next room the back room was tiny with only space enough for the single bed and the personal computer she knew better than to touch it but her hands pulled out of the pockets the moment she saw it from now on she would have no interest in anything else she did not have her fathers mania for small details the door to the closet was ajar rikers eyes adjusted to the dim light within until he made out the outline of the oldfashioned wooden cradle on the floor so amanda had purchased a cradle for the aborted baby and then put the cradle away out of sight when the child was cut out of her he looked away he perused the bookshelf and found style guides and reference books one on how to prepare a manuscript another on writers markets in this room too all the surfaces were cleaned in the better light of two windows he could see the scallops of sponge marks high on the wall had there been blood on the walls had amanda managed to do some damage to him before he killed her well that tears it he said turning to mallory who was reading the label of a computer disk on the console shelf this has to be the crime site and the bastard wiped it clean he spoke on blind faith that she might be listening to him you know this may be the end of the road kid she was pacing back and forth in front of the computer she could hardly wait to get at it he knew she was only holding off for a technician to tell her what she already knew it had been wiped clean she was ignoring everything else in the apartment not the old mans style markowitz always had his investigators bring him every damned detail they could fit into a notebook or a plastic bag she was letting every detail go by a uniformed officer appeared in the bedroom doorway theres a crew in the area they can be here in about fifteen minutes to a half hour thanks martin said riker if mallory approved the cleaning job it was a certainty they would find nothing she had called it a waste of time and she had called it right twenty minutes later heller the senior man in forensics was sharing mallorys opinion he stood in the center of the bedroom his slow brown eyes wandering over every polished surface and wincing as heller pulled on his rubber gloves the nod of his head sent another technician to the kitchen a third man was already at work in the front room a ricochet of flashbulb light found its way to the back of the tiny apartment heller brush in hand turned to the small nightstand by the narrow bed no do the computer first said mallory i need it perhaps another man with hellers years in the department might have bridled at a direct order from mallory who was younger than hellers youngest daughter he only nodded taking no offense and set his kit on the floor by the computer a uniformed officer filled the bedroom doorway your keystroker brought this over he handed mallory a leather case she opened it to display a set of delicate tools and boxes of disks she turned to hover over heller as he worked with the black powder dont get that crap in the keyboard said mallory and watch the vent you dont want it dropping in the vent riker had never seen heller work so fast anything to appease mallory and when he was done he couldnt get out of her way fast enough im going up to talk to the old lady and the kid said riker right she was on to the computer now he was dead to her as were the technicians who worked around her as riker was closing the door behind him heller was working on the nightstand and bitching about the perp being a goodhousekeeping fanatic forgetting that only four feet away from him sat just such a fanatic and she was armed dont bag that said mallory to heller as he was trying to ease the card file off the small table next to the computer i need it its a client list all the people she did research for you got your own tweezers in that kit heller asked looking down into her case of tools she looked up at heller did he think she didnt know how to handle evidence no he was just doing his job markowitz had always coddled and petted heller even when he was giving the man fits checking out details within details and she needed this man dont worry about it heller if his prints were on it he wouldnt have left it behind she moved her chair to one side of the screen here look at this heller bent down to look at the lighted computer screen of white letters on a blue field it was a list of names he looked back to the exposed first card in the spindle you see all the information on the first entry matches that card youre looking at an electronic copy of the card file someone logged on to this computer at least six hours after bosch was killed whoever cleaned the apartment cleaned up the computer too he deleted this file i brought it back with a utility program if i get lucky that card file wont be an exact match to the computer file you think the guy might have removed his own card id bet even money on it why would he delete the list if he wasnt on it heller was nodding as he accepted a plastic evidence bag from a technician he scribbled his initials on the label and turned back to face her were done here mallory i cant tell you much the guy was tall hes got a long reach up that wall how do you know he wasnt standing on a chair you can follow the track of the sponge along the wall no stop and start motion to move a chair he was walking along the length of the wall id guess his height at sixone to sixthree and hes a thorough bastard were taking the rugs and the mattress into the lab if there was any blood well find it we pulled a few prints off the shoes and the belts the prints probably belong to the victim he looked up to the marks high on the wall nobody that tall could have such small finger pads heller seemed to be casting for words anything else you wouldnt hold out on me would you heller the guys weird he said at last heller leaned down and pulled out a drawer from the nightstand near the bed it was empty the contents had been bagged he turned the drawer upside down and held it out to her the pine scented cleaning solvent was still strong on the wood he cleaned all the exterior surfaces of the drawers said heller now thats weird and its not like there was a blood bath here there wasnt id get flecks at least with the light and the spray but nothing the guys just weird you mean im looking for a psych profile based on a cleaning job could be i saw something like this ten years back maybe your old man told you about it the crime scene was already as clean as this one they caught the bastard when he came back to the site to clean it again there was a detective in the apartment when the perp showed up with rubber gloves a bucket and a mop they should all be so easy thats all i got and thank you heller prompted the ghost of markowitz who sat in an overstuffed armchair inside her brain thanks heller she smiled again and made a show of taking the tweezers out of her tool kit and carefully pulling back each card on the spindle matching it to the files on her screen heller and his men were gone when she was into the hs missing was the card on betty hyde according to the retrieved computer file hyde was a gossip columnist with a large syndication mallory didnt need the file to know that the woman also did television spots on an evening news program her residence was the coventry arms an upscale upper west side condominium gold the address was a sixminute walk from the site in the park where the body was dumped a quick perusal of the electronic calendar told her that betty hyde used amanda boschs factchecking services on an irregular basis the notes on parties indicated something more social in the relationship mallory recalled the face of betty hyde from the gossip columnists regular fiveminute news segments hyde was vicious in her reporting of private lives the woman would make a better victim than a suspect when mallory was done with the list only the columnists card was missing from the hard copy the address had to tie in next she went into a set of hidden subfiles the security would be chimpsimple to crack but why would bosch need that kind of lockout on a home computer was there someone else spending time in this apartment it would hardly be betty hyde whose tastes were radically different judging by the address of a multimilliondollar condo the computer was asking for a password mallory flipped through her software array with the eye of a burglar viewing her selection of prybars and glass cutters she selected a disk and started up the program to bang down the door with a crashing cascade of every variable on a password it was book which unlocked the door and now a novel came tumbling out well that fit nicely with the books on writers markets and the style guides which lined the bookshelves and which were not part of a researchers trade no youre absolutely right mrs farrow said riker she shouldnt have talked to you that way but you see she lost her father recently and she just hasnt been the same since actually there was no difference at all in mallory oh that poor child said mrs farrow mallory was never a child riker sat back in a wellpadded chair upholstered in roses and there were roses on the wallpaper and in the pattern of the rug roses even trimmed his coffee cup he smiled at the old woman who lived in the apartment over amanda boschs i understand youve been having problems with your social security checks yes jimmy steals them and cashes them i thought that was why you arrested him his mother usually makes it up to me but this month she was a little short im not pressing charges i never do amanda came up with groceries and helped me out with my medication i told jimmy if he didnt pay amanda back i would put him in jail not that i would you understand so what does he give her a secondhand sports coat with a cigarette burn on the sleeve do you know where jimmy was on that morning my grandson was right here in this apartment his father dragged him over here to apologize to me at six in the morning my son works nights you see gets off at five well when his wife finally told him about the check he went crazy my son did and mrs cramer shes my neighbor down the hall oh shes such a sweet woman every morning since my last heart attack mrs cramer comes by to check on me before she goes to work at the hospital well she was here when jimmy and his father came by you can ask her shell tell you the same then we all went to mass together and sat down to breakfast at my sons house my son drove me home at noon riker looked at his notebook it tied with what the kid had told him he didnt take the old woman for a good liar her eyes gave away every thought every fear and your grandson was never out of your sight the whole morning no father ryan will tell you hell remember he was shocked to see jimmy in church she looked down at the hands in her lap a collection of arthritic knots wrapped around a square tin box what are you going to do with my grandson ill have a man drive him back to the warehouse no charges no she pried open the box and rewarded him with sugar cookies i have a few more questions about amanda said riker with one hand in the tin i still cant believe shes dead she was so young amanda was a good gentle person i cant the rest of her words were too weak to find their way out of her throat she was suddenly very tired and it showed in the slump of her back and the sag of her shoulders id like to talk to some of the neighbors said riker maybe theyll remember seeing amanda with a boyfriend hard to figure isnt it pretty young woman like that one and no man in her life amanda had not started that baby without a man although it was the christmas season riker required a few thousand years of distance from miracles the old lady was keeping something back well the neighbors wouldnt know said mrs farrow theyre all workingclass people in this neighborhood theyre out of the building during the day and all in bed at a reasonable hour so they wouldnt know and you never heard the guy downstairs on a weekend i bet well no she hunched her thin shoulders and her chin dropped to her chest she fixed her startled eyes on the carpet at her feet understanding now what she had given away riker smiled and regarded the old woman as though she were made of precious stuff you know said riker i dont like to speak ill of the dead either but i dont think amanda would mind and i know you want to help us find the killer dont you so you figure the boyfriend is married right amanda never talked about him and he only came in the afternoon when no one was at home but you heard them downstairs you heard them together and oh what she had heard said the nervous fidgeting of her fingers about the cookie tin she would not meet his eyes mallory scrolled through the lines of the novel looking for anything out of place any sign of a damaged file the fire escape window was at her left beyond the glass pane she heard a baby crying and then the soft thudding on the glass she turned to the window not a baby she was staring into a pair of slanted eyes as green as her own the cats fur had been white but now it was grayed with dust and dirt and one ear was torn and bloody amanda bosch must have been in the habit of feeding the stray tough luck cat youre on your own she turned back to the computer and continued the scrolling scanning the lines for gaps and odd characters gleaning a little from the plot one of the main characters lived in an expensive condo on the upper west side now that fit nicely with the missing file card bearing the address of betty hydes condo the fictional man was a married cheat better and better the cat would not shut up mallory looked back to the window and tried to convey by narrowing eyes that the cat must stop and right now or she would dispatch it to kitty heaven the animal misunderstood its own eyes narrowing to the slits of i love you too then the cat was on its hind legs pawing at the glass with mewls of let me in now now now mallory raised the sash but before she could terrorize the small animal it slipped under her arm and into the room depositing cat hair on the sleeve of her blazer in passing it ran through the galley kitchen and into the front room she shrugged what the hell bosch was dead the apartment was tossed let the cat steal what it could it was nothing to her it began the mewling again mallory looked at the cat with a new idea for making it shut up a rare change of heart caused her to abandon that solution the cat would have enough problems out on the street without a fresh injury she watched it hook a paw in the closet door and open it after a brief search it was out again and sniffing the floor it came back to the bedroom to rub up against her leg the plaintive meowing ceased and the soft roar of purring began mallory repressed the urge to kick it she pushed it off with her leg and now the cat went to the bookshelf and knocked out the bottom cartons of computer ribbon to pull out the catnip toy not a stray mallory got up and walked into the galley kitchen she looked in the cupboard all the dishes were neatly stacked but one seemed out of place a bowl sitting on the dinner plates over the blue ceramic glaze the word nose was printed in gold letters the cat was staring up at her and now she noticed the long gray marking around the muzzle a shading she had taken for dirt it had the comic illusion of making the cats nose seem long and bulbous nose was well named it was mewling again mallory put one hand on her hip drawing back the blazer to expose the bolstered gun forgetting momentarily that this gesture would have no effect on a cat the cat stood up on its hind legs and twirled in a circle dancing with delicate practiced steps done with dancing it sat quietly staring at the bowl in mallorys hand and now the small animal had been further reduced in her eyes the only thing a cat had going for it was the refusal to do stupid pet tricks this one had copped out she opened a can of tuna guessing food would keep it quiet the cat ate as though it had been starved she went back into the bedroom and set the printer to spit out the cuedup files and now she checked the closet and looked down at the cradle on the floor a cradle for an abortion she walked into the bathroom in the closet under the sink was a long plastic box the kind used for kitty litter it was dusted with black powder but there were no prints the killer had cleaned the litter box this apartment was not the crime site she knew that after a careful inspection of the other closets she sniffed the insides of the closet doors for the familiar odor of the recent cleaning he wasnt cleaning up after a breakandenter this was a place where he had spent a lot of time he was the one amanda bosch had locked out of her subfiles her novel she might have done that if he figured prominently in the book but he had left the card file behind how convoluted was he of course he had to leave the addresses of the clients for the police so they wouldnt have to go looking on their own maybe asking for public assistance on the evening news it fit the park site where the body was found was only a few minutes walk from hydes condo it was the address he was hiding now she went over the rooms of the apartment with greater care details said markowitz from the room inside her brain which she had outfitted with his favorite chair a rack of pipes and a pouch of cherryblend tobacco details she went through the canned goods in the kitchen pantry two cans of fish but no pet food well some people were a little strange about animals now she found the vacuum in the living room closet and pulled it open the bag was gone heller would have taken it around the insides of the vacuum cleaner she found cat hair the cat was rubbing up against her leg again depositing more hair it stood up on hind legs soft paws on her jeans mallory bent down and picked up the cats paws no claws not an outside cat and that would explain the torn ear and the rest of the blood such a cat could not survive on the street the animal had escaped when the killer returned or did he throw it out for a reason the cat had eaten its food with ravenous hunger and now the bowl was licked clean it must have gone without food for a long time that would fit if the killer had returned to the apartment the day of the murder the last date on the computer log riker had never expected to see mallory with a cat in her arms cats were the natural enemies of the compulsively neat it had already deposited a mess of white hairs on her gray blazer and most surprising the cat was still alive she set it down on the carpet beside her the cat rubbed up against her leg shedding more fur and yet she didnt kill it whos your friend the cats name is nose he lives here oh yeah he bent down to pet the cat it shied around to the other side of mallorys legs so what else have you got this isnt the crime scene she said pushing the cat off with one leg and uncharacteristic restraint the original crime scene is in the park the perp lives in that neighborhood not likely hed drag a dead body home to dump it thats where she had a meeting with him a meeting you got that off the computer no it rained that morning and theres no umbrella in this apartment she had something on him so she met him in the park and threatened him how do you figure that she was a freelance researcher and factchecker it fits so she threatened him and he killed her he panicked and ran later he came back dragged her deeper into the woods and worked her hands over with a rock to get rid of the prints that bought him the time to come down here that night and clean up the evidence of a relationship with the victim he lives at the coventry arms im betting hes married and hes over sixone so what have you got riker smiled and slowly folded his notebook into his coat pocket the kids story checks out he followed her into the bedroom the floor was littered with rolling sheets of paper which were still pouring out the mouth of the machine on the shelf below the computer she scanned the sheets until she found the one she wanted and ripped it free of the rolling paper he read the list of names first he deleted this client file then the jerk only took that one client address out of the card file bosch did occasional work for a gossip columnist betty hyde they also had a social relationship so you figure hyde is tied to it no hyde hasnt used boschs service in two months maybe amanda was in the neighborhood picking up more work from hyde no look at this she ripped another sheet free of the roll this is her production schedule theres nothing on her calendar for hydes projects theres even a note saying hyde is out of the country i checked it out with the paper and the airline shes due back in the country this afternoon look at the billings on these accounts bosch logged in all her time she never worked weekends and she never made pickups for the past two months all her work was messengered in and out of this apartment but the perp lives in the same building as hyde the fool only took one card away yeah he lives in that building he didnt want the police coming back to that address asking questions its like he left me a map when coffey hears this hes gonna scream like a woman in childbirth its a little out of your neighborhood kid but you know the kind of people who live in that building helen grew up in a building on that block her sister alice still lives there its good you got those kind of connections kid youre gonna need em if you step on any toes in the coventry arms i didnt know helen came from money helens people were well off but not wealthy its an odd mix in that neighborhood you can have a woman on social security living in the same rentcontrol building with a society matron hows your aunt alices building situated you think she might give us some space for surveillance i dont think so i only met her once and she didnt like me how could she not like you whats not to like she was closed to him now lost in the scrolling action of the computer which continued to spit paper so how come you never got along with helens folks i know they didnt like markowitz but you aunt alice just took a sudden dislike to me when i was a kid she hasnt spoken to me since what had mallory done to aunt alice rikers notebook lay open in his hand as he looked around the doctors private office the room was thick with the scent and the green of living plants some with delicate blooms the doctor was also on the delicate side and riker pegged him for a gentle soul who trapped houseflies and released them out of doors he felt sorry for the poor little bastard in the white coat who was explaining to mallory that he could not violate amanda boschs privacy be she living or dead the doctor would not tell her if amanda did or did not have any sexually transmitted diseases there was a principle of confidentiality here which he could never violate mallory was tensing and riker guessed the doctor could not read the warning signs this poor mans career of sensitivity to women and their gynecological problems had not prepared him for this she was rising to a stand too late doc mallory slammed the autopsy photograph down on the blotter in front of the man startling him she leaned across his desk and pressed him deep into the cushions of his chair without laying a hand on him not raising her voice but ticking off the syllables in the even meters of a live time bomb mallory said look at what that bastard did to her these were not the pretty photographs the uniforms had shown to the doormen the shots with the head wound and the damage of insects this was the autopsy aftermath the hardcore obscenity of a woman hollowed out like a bloody canoe mallory never mentioned that a pathologist had done this she let the good doctor run the course of his imagination which was draining his face of blood bringing him to his feet and leading him to the door of the washroom mallory settled down in her chair to wait out the noises of a man retching splattering his lunch over water and porcelain her arms crossed and her mouth slanted down on one side to say she had expected more fortitude from a medical man when the doctor returned to his desk he sat down slowly in the manner of one who had just aged thirty years and had suddenly become careful of his brittle bones his soft white hands grasped one another for comfort he was mallorys creature now did you know the father of the baby no she wouldnt talk about him i had the idea he was probably a married man i want to know if any sexually transmitted disease could have been a motive i dont have all damn day to wait on lab results from the me no nothing like that i tested her for everything at her request no disease of any kind the pregnancy was compromising her health but that was due to a physical defect of the uterus is that why she had the abortion it was therapeutic i have no idea why she aborted the baby she wanted that child more than anything in the world she had enormous difficulty conceiving because of the physical abnormalities it was a chance in a million her pregnancy you did the abortion no it was done in a city hospital she went into the emergency room complaining of bleeding and cramps i got there as fast as i could it wasnt a hospital where i had privileges and before they would even let me see her it was over it was done by a bad doctor with a cutrate education she was butchered the doctors eyes slid over to the photograph on his desk as though he had second thoughts on the definition of butchery after the abortion there was no possibility of another pregnancy no amount of corrective surgery could have repaired the damage done to her when was the abortion done it was one week ago today she cancelled two appointments with me and i never saw her again i called and left messages she never called back so she miscarried is that how it started no there was no miscarriage you think she tried to abort herself no of course not nothing like that but the fetus was definitely in danger she hadnt slept for days or eaten there was an enormous amount of pressure on her what kind of pressure i dont know when i saw her that night at the hospital she wouldnt tell me what had brought it on i dont know what the emotional trauma was the doctor in attendance had given her the option of saving the baby he said she screamed at him no cut it out of me the fool never took amandas emotional state into consideration he just went ahead and cut her what kind of trauma would bring on the bleeding and the cramps oh something that would cost her peace of mind and sleep bed rest was important it isnt unusual for some women with her medical profile to spend the entire pregnancy in bed give me the reasons why she might want to get rid of the baby said mallory i know she wasnt a hardship case ive seen her bank account maybe there was some disclosure about the babys father or his past something that made her revolt at the idea of bearing his child she was just entering the second trimester of the pregnancy i have no idea when she told the father about it he may have recently disclosed some genetic problem but you would have done tests for that right she wasnt a good candidate for amniocentesis it was a very delicate pregnancy id need a pretty good reason to put a needle into the womb to extract the necessary fluid but amanda never mentioned genetic problems or any other problems she was a very happy woman before she lost the baby can you think of any other possibilities women will abort in cases of rape of course that wouldnt apply here but its the fact that the man is so repugnant to them that makes them abort the issue of a rapist the emotional trauma could have been caused by any number of things but it would have to be something horrible to make her abort her child the doctors face was set in real grief i liked amanda very much his eyes strayed back to the autopsy photos he reached out and pushed them off the edge of his desk the bank account you mentioned that was the down payment for a house she wanted a house with a yard for the child to play in at the end of the day in coffeys office which was still called markowitzs office riker was saying and the perp gets mallorys goodhousekeeping commendation coffey turned to mallory did forensics turn up anything hellers team found a cap gun in the building trash bin he thinks its tied to boschs apartment he got prints off it no said mallory thats why he thinks its tied the toy gun was wiped clean its a replica of an old sixshooter i didnt know they still made cap guns like that only a few companies do said riker looking down at his notebook but that wont help this one was manufactured thirty years ago it might have belonged to the perp when he was a kid you think he tried to scare her with it could be said riker you gotta wonder about a grown man who keeps his toys a baseball with a mickey mantle autograph sat on the desk between them coffey smiled with no trace of ruffling no rising to the bait riker shrugged what have we got on motive anything she had something on him and threatened him said mallory he panicked and killed her where is this coming from mallory she was a researcher and a factchecker he was the father of her child you dont know that or did she if he was the father of her child it would make sense for her to check him out said mallory so she must have turned up something it fits no holes in it but its a lot of supposition isnt it unless you were holding out on me you wouldnt do that would you of course she would he looked to riker and gave the man credit for not rolling his eyes no im not she said but coffey decided she was seconds too late in saying it so you made an id on the corpse good job mallory but the coventry arms address is flimsy i cant interrogate these people based on what youve got not without getting harassment complaints from the governors personal guest list weve got zip for physical evidence if the park is the crime site the lack of an alibi for the six minutes it takes to do a murder wont hold up in court weve got a twentyfourhour period where he could have gone into boschs apartment he didnt even need to do the cleanup in one block of time so we question every male in the building and where does it get us i cant do that just because theres a card missing from a file we dont know that bosch didnt toss out the address card herself maybe she dropped hyde as a client she didnt toss the card there are also cards in the hard copy file for inactive clients this woman never tossed anything except a halfcreated baby its not enough to bring anybody in im not asking you to bring anybody in you could move me into the building said mallory one of those apartments has to be vacant somebodys out of town somebodys relocated so you think you can move into a sublet or a vacancy without alerting the suspect were still getting calls from people who think youre dead because they saw your face on tv i know hes tied to that building if i cant flush him out ill never get him you cant catch them all mallory the killer is in a circle that overlaps with bosch and hyde and there are notes on a social relationship with hyde this woman might have introduced them or maybe bosch and the killer met while she was visiting hyde i know hes tied to that address youre sure that hyde doesnt figure in this i can place her in australia on the day of the killing no way she could get back in time shes over sixty and she wont fit the height requirement but its her name on the missing card hired talent maybe the mo wont fit a pro hit but all hit men start out as amateurs it wont fit at all amanda bosch had a personal relationship with her killer she went to the park that morning to meet the perp the murder wasnt premeditated no weapon was brought to the crime scene he used a rock and his hands why dont we invite miss hyde in for questioning we could do the interview as a request for assistance no i dont want to alert anybody to the death of amanda bosch the rest of her clients are in midtown and the village area her only connection on the upper west side was that building it was only the address the perp wanted to hide mallory youve got nothing solid you dont know that he lives in the coventry arms i know where he lives because i know him he spent a lot of time with the body working her hands over making pulp out of them he took his time after he got over the initial panic he was comfortable in that place it was close to home coffey slid a folder across the desk it had hellers initials on it hellers backing you up on the park as the original crime scene howd you talk him into going back they found the blood splatters on the underside of kicked over rocks by the water he was in here half an hour ago says you authorized the overtime that also backs up the coventry arms as the perps residence he took the card to keep us from tracking her back to that address get me in there get me something solid then well talk about a surveillance nest if you wont do anything else to help me at least dont release the name of the victim if im going to flush him out i need that edge you got my word nobody gets the name yeah right thanks she said and the words for nothing remained unspoken and hanging in the air for minutes after she left the room mallory stopped the car in front of the coventry arms and let the engine idle the centuryold building was fortresslike and forbidding the stucco edifice was dotted with window lights that blazed and lesser lights that only glimmered gables and plantchoked balconies relieved the flat plane of the building and the long line of its roof and ivy twined up the walls far past the nightblack leaves of ancient trees the character of the windows varied from squares rectangles and circles to the great arch of the center piece of stained glass this window might have graced a cathedral but the brilliantly colored imagery was older than the church she worked out the ancient mythology in the glass the years spent at barnard had not been a total waste of time the figure of the woman in the window must be the goddess of spring she was being carried in the arms of her lover the god of the underworld as he raced toward the edge of a cliff the lovers were frozen forever in this act of murder and suicide as they hurtled full tilt toward the edge of death gateway to hades and home the entrance to the building was the stone mouth of a behemoth narrowing to a set of doors studded with copper ornamental friezes in addition to the requisite doorman there was a security guard on duty tonight a recent adjunct to the age of rock stars and their buildingstorming groupies she had a badge in the back pocket of her jeans she could enter the building any time she wished talk to whomever she wished she had the power but she couldnt use it not yet and she couldnt sneak in coffey had been right to reject the surveillance nest but for all the wrong reasons it was better to go in with a blaze of neon lights it was only the covert things that people found suspicious she drove past the coventry arms and toward the less famous building at the end of the block she had visited this place only once in her life yet her memory of it was vivid in every detail she doubleparked the car as she always did it was easier for her to fix the parking tickets on the computer than to mark the car for the meter maids she handed her business card to the doorman when he asked whom she had come to visit and whom she might be are you mallory or butler miss tell her its kathy her niece not strictly true her adoption had never been formalized she had refused to answer questions about her past or her parents without a trace on relatives the paperwork could go no further she had kept the legal status of a foster child and there was no such thing as a foster aunt but though there were a lot of mallorys in the world alices only sister had only one child named kathy the man replaced the house phone on its hook he held the door open and his smile was wide aunt alice must be generous with her tips the night man at the desk was settling his own telephone on to its cradle and nodding tactful understanding of mallorys importance here as she passed through the lobby this was a place not of extreme wealth but of quiet money the lobby furnishings were good but not museum pieces the passengercontrolled elevator ran with the smooth hum of good maintenance on her first visit there had been an elevator operator she remembered looking up at the man from her height of ten years old she rarely saw such people any more it was the humanexpendable age of automation the elevator doors opened on to a floor of deeppile beige rugs the walls were papered in stripes of sedate taste she didnt need the apartment number memory led her to the door at the end of the hall on her toes she could not have reached the brass lionshead door knocker the first time she had come here with helen the maid the same maid opened the door and stood back to allow her to pass into the foyer mallory followed the woman down the hallway and here perception was altered again this hall had seemed miles long when she was a child they passed by the music room and into wider space the dimensions of this room had changed only slightly it was not quite the grand ballroom of a childs memory but close bricabrac covered every table and family photographs hung in clusters along every linear foot of the walls she would have bet good money that not one stick of furniture had been moved in the past fourteen years it was all dark wood and drapes of crimson and shadows filled the corners light glinting in reflection off some candy dish of silver some ornament of gold the photographs and portraits went back many generations so helen had told her on their only visit she remembered very little of that afternoons conversation alice had looked very much like her sister and the strong family resemblance was also in the aged face of helens mother but that old womans skin was then already graying with the thing growing inside her the same thing that would kill helen years in the future the adults had bored her until they got on to the subject of markowitz then she had listened her small hands balling into fists markowitz might be a cop but he was also her old man she had risen off her chair in a burst of angry energy helens eyes had pushed her back down her small hands folded on her lap once again and the child who had recently been dining from garbage cans neatly crossed her legs at the ankles as helen had taught her to do so this is the best louis could provide you with said helens sister alice whose voice had been on the rise for too long and by young kathy mallorys lights it was too loud a voice to be using on gentle helen markowitz not even a tie of blood but someone elses castaway child something out of the gutter helens mother had been quiet up to this point and then the old woman stood up with difficulty leaning on her cane and waving off the maid who rushed to her side enough she said imperious in her tone threats in her eyes alice whats done is done alice began to rise lips parting and as helens mother had waved off the maid she waved alices mouth shut but too late the damage had been done helen was crying tears streaming down her face kathy had gone after helens sister with the propulsion of a bullet shooting her face to within an inch of alices in a rush of menace low tones working up from the gut words carrying real weight and hatred she said if you ever make helen cry again ill cut you at the knees you cunt dont say cunt dear helen had said then appearing behind the child and shunting small arms into the sleeves of a new winter coat as they followed the maid down the long hallway kathy heard helens mother laughing uproariously she had tried to turn and go back with the intention of beating the old woman to a pulp but helen had restrained her with helen it usually took no more than a look or the lightest pressure to contain the small and continuous storm that was kathy mallory fourteen years later mallory was back helen was four years in the ground and she was looking into helens eyes in the ruined face of alice i thought you were dead said alice well im not said mallory are you disappointed aunt alice but i heard it on the evening news she said as though she had caught mallory in a lie well no matter its a bit late to be calling isnt it and i mean that on several levels i guess it has been a while said mallory i saw you at markowitzs funeral on the day they had laid the old man in the ground she had looked up to see alice a ghost of helen in her likeness hovering near the open grave when she had looked back again the ghost was gone i thought helen wouldve wanted a member of the family there said alice i thought she would have liked that she would have thank you you havent changed so much since you were a little girl but then you never looked like a little girl your eyes were always more like an adults what a disturbing child you were violent rude uncivilized mallory said nothing took no offense it was all true i know where you live now kathy only a few blocks from here isnt it that condominium must have been very expensive and i imagine the maintenance fees are rather high why are you here you want money i suppose i dont need money then what do you want alice leaned forward with a new intensity a sudden burst of light in the watering blue irises what could you possibly want from me her voice was rising wavering in the high notes close to breaking you took my sister away from me did you know she never spoke to me again did you know how much i loved helen alice rose out of her chair the effort seemed to tax her was alice dying of the same cancer that killed helen she looked thin and weary alices supply of venom was exhausted she sank down to the cushion of the chair and deeper she cried and mallory waited it out neither offering aid nor withdrawing only waiting for it to be over with why did you come what do you want from me i need your help the coventry arms has quite a mix of people these days the rock stars have loud parties and so do the political people said the old woman who must be in her late eighties theres a television personality in the building and an actor said the old womans husband who had been introduced to mallory as ronald rosen mrs rosen nodded its true in my day they would never allow theater people in a nice building in your day hattie said her husband gangsters were the aristocracy of the west side the old man turned to mallory when i was a kid we came up out of hells kitchen same as your mothers people what a time to be alive when i was a boy i ran errands for owney madden the duke of the west side i saw two of his men shot down in the bootleg whiskey wars mallory was drinking tea out of a fragile china cup and facing the elderly rosens residents of the coventry arms alice leaned over and replenished the tea from an antique silver pot so youre helens daughter said mr rosen you must take after your fathers side mrs rosen kicked his shoe and he knew he had said something wrong but not what apparently it didnt matter for his wife resumed her goodnatured smile we watched helen grow up in this apartment didnt we alice said mrs rosen though we didnt see her but three or four times after she married louis markowitz i was at her funeral whats it been alice three four years since helen died mrs rosen turned back to mallory i saw you there i didnt want to intrude i spoke to louis markowitz in the reception line he seemed like such a she shot a look at alice oh but im going on is mallory your married name asked mr rosen who was again shown the error of his ways by a kick from mrs rosen who undoubtedly knew the facts from alice this is so exciting said hattie rosen just like television do you want us to use assumed names good idea said mallory and ill need a letter for the concierge something to explain why im living in your condo of course said mr rosen and we should say something about it to arthur hes our doorman i dont like lying to arthur stick with the truth said mallory but keep it simple tell him youre leaving on urgent personal business and im a friend of the family ill take care of the lies did i mention that ronald snores asked mrs rosen we have separate bedrooms my condo is a two bedroom with a view of the river and a hour doorman said mallory are there a lot of people in your building with personal computers everyone has a computer now even us said mrs rosen they wired the entire building for an electronic bulletin board my wife uses the computer said mr rosen what do i know from computers so whats to know you only have to know where the onswitch is you push a button and voilá theres the bulletin board for the building you leave notes for the building management and the super arrange for dog walking vacation notice you can even do your banking from the computer if youre online with your bank now dont you be afraid of it dear its only a machine and the directions are written on the door of the console youll pick it up easy oh and the girl who cleans comes once a week she has her own key but you can trust her with your life sarah i think ronald is that her name sarah i can move in tomorrow yes but we have to be back in ten days for my cousin bitsys golden wedding anniversary weve invited a hundred people dear you understand now about your condo its wired for cable tv when the arrangements for the exchange of apartments had been completed when the rosens had gone and she and alice had said their strained good nights mallory was on her way to the door passing slowly through the rooms of the apartment where helen had grown up taking in each detail she passed near the grand piano which was covered with a tapestry throw and photographs perhaps fifty in small ornate frames all the faces were childrens the portraits to the rear were dated by the clothing and in front were the children only recently come to abide on the piano mallory found helens photograph as a girl it was placed toward the back with the children who had grown up and grown old she picked it up and stared at helens young face she was setting the picture back in its place when her hand froze and her eyes locked on a frame in the middle rows she recognized her own likeness staring out of the sea of brandnew eyes it was a school photograph taken a full year after the visit her own portrait had neither pride of place nor was it hidden but fit well into its proper station among the generations the family chapter december riker made his way up the stairs of the animal hospital and into a wide waiting room the size of an auditorium a pet shop smell mingled with odors of cleaning solvents and a cacophony of barks and chirps emanated from every row of seats pet owners crooned to their jiggling meowing howling carrier boxes others clutched leashes holding back dogs who would rather be elsewhere the human noises were choruses of poor baby and all its variations these people perhaps a hundred of them were serious animal lovers so what was mallory doing here despite the crowding to standing room only mallory had half a row to herself the cat sat on her lap and tried to lick her face she stared down at the animal with perfect understanding and the desire to go on living the cat ceased its attempted licking and curled up on the legs of mallorys jeans one ragged ear was drooping the point of it all but severed the bird people cast their eyes nervously over the cat and hugged their carrier cages the dog people were holding their leashes with a death grip more than a little put out that mallory had not disguised the cat as a box rules of etiquette were clearly being violated here and they were not rules that helen markowitz could have imparted to mallory for theirs had been a house without pets riker watched her for a minute more she was detached from the cat but the cat was very attached to her he could hear the purring four rows away now mallorys head turned slowly until she was facing him staring into his eyes a worldclass spook that kid was and he blamed markowitz for that there had been a limit to the kind of games one could play with a child who was not a child the games markowitz devised for her had developed ricochet vision and he believed she could feel the rise in temperature when one more live body walked into a room she nodded to him he moved past a dog and a parrot another dog a lizard and ten empty seats to sit down beside her he looked at the cat who only looked to mallory so you think the departments gonna pay for the vets bill damn right the cats a witness hey this is riker youre talkin to the cat knows the perp and the perp knows the cat i think youre pressing your luck kid her eyes said dont call me kid coffeys not too thrilled about the condo switch might have been good politics if youd run the idea past him first its none of his business where i live well he had an interesting point amanda bosch was your age your style maybe she was a little shorter but youre definitely the perps type i know that mallorys face moved in tandem with the cats face two pairs of slanting eyes stared at him it was too early for a drink what name are you using my own name risky isnt it i only say that because your pretty face has been all over the television as a dead woman and a cop odds are hes seen you if he hasnt somebodys gonna mention it to him good just wait till he sees the cat you dont know who he is youll never see him coming im not dealing with professor moriarty here hes a man who knows as much about computers as a secretary maybe less hes a liar who got caught out and hes the panicky type she leaned down to the canvas bag at the foot of her chair and extracted a manila file holder this is the list of tenants and their stats he took the file and opened it letting out a low whistle as he scanned the names of credit card companies insurance companies and financial institutions well this would explain the redness in her eyes shed been up all night breaking into computer banks and then shed probably been wading through that mess of paperwork pulled off amanda boschs computer maybe five or six hundred pages she had neglected to mention in the apartment inventory how did she get the us army info it sometimes took him a week or more to pull personnel files whats with the military service records physical stats height and blood groups mallory we didnt find anything to type his blood group he doesnt know that he drove himself nuts cleaning that place the things he cleaned he doesnt sleep nights wondering what we might have found he was looking at a list of units with more than fortyfive names crossed off what are the cross offs most of them wont meet the height requirement and i crossed off all the single men and women and the married man who made a fortune in software hed know you can delete a file but you cant erase it hed know the files could be restored cross off the apartments owned by corporations with threeday turnover my perp was new york based then the vacant apartments are crossed off what ive got left loosely fits the profile what about this writer eric franz hes single isnt he he held up her fax of the vehicular accident stats dated to late november his wife died more than a month ago the affair with bosch started before that a year or so isnt that what mrs farrow told you and bosch was more than three months gone with the baby before she aborted a hungry looking sheepdog had made three rows of progress towards mallory and the cat his owner an elderly woman regained the leash and dug her heels into the linoleum to bring the dog to a choking halt got any favorites yeah i put stars by their names four of them dont keep regular hours that would leave them free for afternoons with amanda the sheepdog was gaining ground again slowly dragging his owner behind him riker and mallory exchanged glances if you shoot the dog kid you better kill the owner too if you let the old lady live shell sue the city commissioner beale wont like that apparently the cat had never seen a dog before nose was sitting docile on mallorys lap only mildly curious about the large frenzied animal which was coming to eat him riker resumed his reading mallory had a question mark by the name of harry kipling a penciled note read connection to kipling electronics that name might give coffey a few bad moments high profile suspects were the worst with any luck kipling would prove to be a computer freak and thus beyond the pale how did you get a blood type on kipling theres no army record she looked at him for only a moment and he understood that this was not something he would want to know and now it began to dawn on him that local hospital records must be a piece of cake after cracking the us army computers oh shit said riker he was staring at two more high profile names on the list one was a recent appointment to the us supreme court and his senate hearing was in progress another name was that of a prominent tv reporter who now had his own talk show every afternoon these were two of the four bearing stars in the column when he looked up again the crazed sheepdog had left the floor and was hurtling toward the cat one of mallorys long legs was already curling back to kick the beast into the next world the door to charless private office was closed on the low voices of moderate conversation mallory set the large canvas bag down on the desk in the front room the cat stepped out of the bag and rubbed up against her arm as she opened the drawer to check the answering machine for messages charles objected to the sight of modern conveniences among the antiques of another century and so she worked around him by hiding them out of sight he was still unaware of the security system she had installed she was that good at wiring she pushed the cat away and pressed the button to hear coffeys voice saying i want to talk to you the minute you get in the minute you got that mallory yeah right a womans scream pierced the door to charless private office the cat flew off the desk she was through the door and into the next room with her gun drawn as a mans voice was saying justin dont the only woman in the room was taking the quick breaths of hyperventilation her eyes bulged and her shoulder blades were nearly even with her ears her face was pale and she was shaking violently all but her hands which gripped the arms of the chair in the manner of a rocket pilot preparing for a maiden launch the man had turned from the boy and was barking at the woman now for christs sake sally pull it together its only a damn pencil it seems to like you sally said the boy who sat between them why dont you just give the pencil a name and take it for long walks in the park thats enough out of you said the man to the boy mallory looked down to the offending pencil lying in the womans lap and up to nothing sinister but the woman was staring at it as though it might be a living snake mallory turned she had heard the gentle rocking before she saw the vase teetering on the edge of the bookshelf the vase fell she shot out one hand to catch it only a few inches above that section of hardwood floor not covered by the persian rug now the man was yelling at the boy again justin i told you to stop the boy shrank back from the man he turned to look over his shoulder at the vase in mallorys hand and then at her gun as she replaced it in the shoulder holster the woman with the fear of pencils was covering her mouth only charles was not agitated he was calmly watching all of them i didnt do it said the boy he didnt topple the vase said charles trains pass under this building all day long the vibrations sometimes move objects around that vase was very close to the edge mallory stood behind the small family and stared at charles with naked incredulity hands clasped behind his head he leaned back in his chair and smiled at her as though seven thousand dollars worth of fifthcentury crockery had not nearly smashed into worthless shards the trains didnt make the pencil fly said the man in even tones which implied that charles might be only half bright no they didnt may i introduce my partner mallory she walked over to the desk and faced the small family while charles made the formal introductions to the riccalos she checked out the boy first justin riccalos blond hair was slicked back and his lips were parted to display two prominent front teeth the total effect was that of a wet rabbit with freckles he could only be eleven at the outside he was a basic nerd in training wearing the requisite plastic protector in the front pocket of his shirt all lined with pens and mechanical pencils his feet were tapping the floor anxious to be gone even if it meant leaving the body behind them electricblue eyes danced in a rocknroll of whats over there and now whats over here and what might be up on the ceiling sally riccalo the highstrung brunette had been introduced as justins stepmother mallory could almost hear the tension humming through the womans thin body as though she were wired up to a wall socket mrs riccalo perched on the edge of her chair now brown eyes wide and pleading dont hurt me to everyone who looked into them the father robert riccalo was a former military man that much was in his closecropped haircut and the squared shoulders the man was standing at attention while sitting down he was so large in the torso he towered over the woman and the boy but not charles to whom towering came naturally and apologetically when the boy faced his stepmother his neck elongated and his eyes gave away some joke hed told to himself a nervous giggle was rising up in his mouth the military man put one heavy hand on the boys slender shoulder and caused it to dip with the weight when justin looked to his father his head tucked in like a turtle and all the while the blue eyes danced to alternating rhythms of fun and fear now the boy lifted his face to mallorys and a conspiracy of eyes began in silence i know you each face said to the other though she and the boy had never met charless eyes rolled back and forth between them saying just a moment have i missed something here another appointment was scheduled for the next day and the small family trooped out the father leading the charge woman and boy following behind as his foot soldiers when the door to the outer office closed behind them mallory turned on charles hefting the vase in one hand about those trains thats not the original its a cheap copy i rigged the vase myself and it was the trains he walked over to the bookcase and picked up a wooden kitchen match this primed one edge of the vase toward the natural pull of gravity any vibration would have knocked it down i just wondered what the boy would do and it startled him with the normal reaction time justin has good reflexes but he denied all blame for the pencil and the vase thats odd you know he insists hes not doing anything thats not consistent with the profile of the average psychokinetic subject and well it makes the whole thing more interesting maybe hes not the one whos doing it theres a problem with the logic he didnt take credit and yet he didnt seem frightened by it like hes used to seeing things fly around the house almost bored by it well try and work it out before wife number three goes down okay mallory bent over the canvas bag on the desk in the front room the cat poked its head out from under the desk whiskers twitching testing the air for screams and other loud noises with more assurance it exited the underside of the desk and looked up at charles tilting its head to one side as though the bandaged ear was weighting it that way hello said charles bending down to pet it the cat wriggled out from under his hand it only had eyes for mallory it rubbed up against her leg and she pushed it away the cats a material witness now ive already been through this with riker you laugh and i shoot you its like that what happened to the cats ear i didnt do it can you keep the cat for one night im trading apartments with the rosens today i cant take it back to my place of course mallory pulled the cats litter box out of the canvas bag and then two tins of fish his name is nose just keep him out of my office i dont want any fur in my computers ill take him back to my place thanks so apart from the flying objects how did the interview go you know which one of them is doing it if its not the boy i dont know she pulled a file out of the bag the first mrs riccalo died of a heart attack but now that ive seen her husband i have to wonder how much stress she was under and how much it would have taken to push her over the top heres the hospital file she handed it to him and he hesitated for that moment when people are trying to decide how dirty an object might be before they touch it perhaps he was wrong to believe that every computer printout she gave him might be purloined you stole it right right she said but not this one the second file she handed him had the nypd stamp on the cover he scanned the information which detailed the suicide report on the deceased second wife of robert riccalo he flipped through the threepage report well the files list the suicide as a nonsuspicious death i may change that why when you go through the suicide files you find most jumpers are men women are less messy and there was no note they usually like to get even with their loved ones on the way out did the first two mrs riccalos have anything in common they were both professionals and carried the normal amount of life insurance through their employers but that doesnt mean there wasnt another policy or two im still working on it sally riccalo is also carrying insurance through the financial house where she works as a systems analyst according to her resumé she and robert riccalo worked for the same company ten years ago when the first mrs riccalo was still alive interesting we started out with a rather simple problem of flying objects you dont think murder is a bit of a stretch this early on i suppose the insurance beneficiary was robert riccalo hes also the beneficiary of wife number three but isnt the spouse usually the beneficiary yes but its usually the wife who collects so now ive got one heart attack one suicide and wife number three looks like shes ready to explode she wouldnt get that upset over one pencil what else has been flying her way lately oh a pair of scissors some bits of glass whats the fathers take anger disbelief only the stepmother seems to be a believer he accused the boy of moving the vase he sounds like a believer to me no the stepmother is the only believer in the paranormal mr riccalo probably thinks the boy is doing it by trickery one of them is are you sure it was your pencil that flew at her excuse me charles youre a disgrace to max candles memory the art of illusion is not genetic having a magician in the family tree doesnt vouch for talent in the rest of the bloodline you have a whole damn magic store in the basement you could make an elephant fly with all that equipment not really max had some brilliant illusions but his specialty was defying death it was malakhai who could really make things move through the air and nothing as clumsy as a flying pencil he was the greatest illusionist who ever lived malakhai the debunker well debunking the paranormal frauds came later in life after he retired from the stage before you were born malakhai did an act with his dead wife you seem skeptical no really she was his assistant his dead assistant oh yes it was only after she died that she went into the magic act with malakhai when she was alive she was a composer and a musician what did he do have her stuffed no she never appeared to the audience in the flesh it was always understood that she was there and yet not there dead but not entirely gone if you follow me well after the audience got comfortable with the idea that she was not only invisible but dead things began to float through the air as she handed him one thing and another hed fit in nicely with our family of the flying pencils so thats why malakhai got into parapsychology oh no hes the sworn enemy of parapsychologists every time they think theyve discovered paranormal ability he drops by to blow them out of the water and expose another scam are you thinking of calling him in for this one for flying pencils hardly and it probably wouldnt be a good idea to disturb him malakhais in his seventies now he and louisa are living in quiet seclusion louisa thats his dead wife if you cared less for computers and more for classical music you would know her name louisas concerto was her only composition but it was brilliant no classical collection is complete without it the concerto was played during every performance oh it was no act on the stage perhaps i should have mentioned that no malakhai lived with her talked with her slept with her he only created the flyingobject illusions in the act so the audience could see her too and this guy this loon debunks the paranormal yes as madmen go hes quite functional he always owned to the fact that he created his own madness he knew there was no supernatural aspect to louisa yeah right how did he get so crazy well louisa died very young she wrote this splendid concerto and then she died hed known her since she was a child and he couldnt quite let her go so he reconstructed her again please he recreated her from memory from intimate knowledge of her its been done before but the practice has been limited to remote asian monasteries the documented succubi created by monks were fashioned of pure imagination malakhais creation was based on a living woman that was one difference he knew louisa so well he knew what her response would be in every given situation then he constructed a faithful model of her and after a while he could not only hold conversations with her but see her and touch her it was a feat of immense concentration you see it has to be fanatically faithful to the living woman to react in the same but its a trick an illusion a great illusion and of course delusion but it was a piece of art as masterful as platos dialogues and a lot of us do it to some small extent dont you sometimes wonder what markowitz would do or say in certain situations she turned her face to the window and he mentally slapped himself silly for crossing the line into her personal feelings for he was one of the few who believed she might possess them another distinction between malakhai and the monks was that they called up their illusions and sent them away louisa was malakhais constant companion she still is mallory turned back to him and he watched the busywork of her good brain through the static distraction of her eyes but this malakhai hes definitely crazy right oh yes definitely but it takes quite a good brain to go quite that crazy when you consider the amount of concentration necessary to maintain a threedimensional delusion and when he talked with her she answered the way she did when she was alive even if the question was new oh yes perversely truth and logic were the glue of the delusion she couldnt respond in any way that was untrue to the living woman could you do it could you have a conversation with a dead woman malakhai and louisa grew up together what she would say in any given situation was predictable to him he knew her mind her most private thoughts i dont know anyone that well certainly not you mallory would you have to be crazy to create a thing like that you would have to possess at the very least the insanity that goes with falling in love a woman once told me that people in love were certifiable i believe that malakhai reached across all the zones of reason to bring louisa back now thats the kind of love insanity is made of he may be insane but hes also brilliant and rather charming whenever i stayed with cousin max malakhai and louisa would come to dinner did the dead woman have a good appetite as a child i was never sure there was always magic going on at maxs house they would set a plate for her and pour the wine and during the course of the evening the plate and glass would be emptied the food and wine was probably spirited away in moments of distraction i knew that but part of me always believed in louisa did you ever try the threedimensional illusion delusion no why would i why would anyone want to cross over that border except for love she was reaching down into the canvas bag and then he noted the hesitation of a second thought as her hand pulled back empty now she turned to him i wish i had amanda bosch back for just five minutes the lady by the lake i presume yes i think ive got a motive she said bending again to dip into the bag she pulled a manuscript out and sat down behind the desk riffling through the pages extracting one paperclipped section i pulled this off boschs computer by the logon time this is the last file she ever updated shes been working on this book for almost a year its a novel but i dont think its all fiction art is lies that tell the truth who said that youre the one with the computerbank memory eidetic memory and it doesnt work like a computer i cant crossindex things the way you do with your machines here cut to page of chapter seven go to the last paragraph remember she updated this the day she died he looked down at the page and read he was leaving again going through the litany of each thing he had to do all more pressi you liar you liar you liar you liar you liar you liar i see what you mean said charles its not a part of the text more like an emotional outburst at the keyboard right i caught that as i was printing out the file i only had time to scan pages here and there checking for file damage its almost seven hundred pages im pretty sure my perp is in there in detail but youre the only human i know who can read at the speed of light i just dont have the time could you take a look at it and make notes on the parts that ring true of course charles seemed only to be glancing at the pages of the manuscript as he turned the sheets one after the other yet he was reading every word and catching mallory in a lie he had noted the redness of her eyes and now he found the reason for it in the indents of thumb and forefinger which marked the base of each page she had read before him after a few minutes cursory reading he looked up at her i wonder what his lie was shes characterized him as a married man from the onset so that cant be it it wont be in the manuscript im guessing she caught him in a recent lie thats an interesting possibility you think he might have been cheating on the woman he was cheating with that wasnt it i think the only use she had for this man was getting pregnant but then she aborted the baby ive got a problem with a lie as a murder motive but its all ive got amanda bosch was a professional researcher she might have done a background check on him its a reasonable assumption since hes the father of her baby so she caught him out in a lie well that wont narrow the field by much there are as many categories of lies as there are people too bad your old friend malakhai cant reconstruct amanda and ask her what the lie was if i dont wrap this up fast the perp will get away with her murder when you finish with the manuscript just leave it in my office all right but i wouldnt count on this too much if i were you i dont think a writer draws on life to a greater extent than an actor does when he fleshes out a role the actor doesnt act his life and i suspect even when a writer does an autobiography he doesnt write his life and this last bit of type the liar lines you call an emotional outburst who is she screaming at if not the character in the book all right ill read it with that in mind are you going to the poker game tomorrow night of course the poker game was the highlight of his week he had inherited his chair in the game from inspector louis markowitz and with that chair came three friends each new friend was something precious to him as though in the gathering of people he could make up for a life of isolation in academia and think tanks if i didnt show up for the game theyd expect me to send them a check for the usual losses thats only fair i suppose i wouldnt want them to suffer financial damage by my absence charles one day ill sit down with you and teach you how to beat those guys at poker but that would not be today she was ticking off items in a notebook and even at half the rooms distance he could see a great many unchecked items yet to go he turned to the window and looked down to the street two floors below actually rabbi kaplan says my consistent losses speak well of me did he tell you why what and ruin his reputation spoil the good name of kaplan the cryptic no i think im supposed to work it out his eyes were still on the street below following the progress of a familiar figure in a shapeless winter coat he turned to face her all right you know dont you the rabbi was complimenting your honesty charles poker is a liars game tomorrow night i want you to get something off slope and duffy and now she made a check by one more item which must have been himself i gave both of them shopping lists things i need to get without going through coffey or riker you know mallory there are other police officers on the force besides yourself they tend to think of themselves as members of a team yeah riker has the same idea there was an edge to her voice more impatience than anger he thinks hes my coach here charles would have liked to have said something in rikers defense for he liked the man very much but there were perils to giving even the appearance of choosing any side but hers in all their conversations he seemed always to be seeking safe ground with her why dont you come to the game with me rabbi kaplan speaks highly of you as a born card shark i cant i was barred from the game when i was thirteen a key was turning in the lock and as the door opened the hose of a vacuum cleaner preceded the small dark head of mrs ortega this precluded charles asking any personal questions like what in gods name did you do to those people to get barred from the poker game mrs ortega stopped suddenly eyeing the cat perhaps with a view to skinning it and making a purse of the pelt in her oftexpressed view as a professional cleaning woman the only good fur shedder was a dead one the cat rubbed up against mallorys jeans and now that mrs ortega associated the cat with mallory she looked at the younger woman with surprise and something less than her former respect for a fellow believer from the church of immaculate housekeeping mallory handed the woman a twenty dollar bill with the silent understanding that she knew the cat fur would make extra work mrs ortega pocketed the bill and cast a kinder eye on the cat the buzzer went off loud and irritating mallory put up her hand to stop charles on his way to the door okay who is it riker he said without the usual split second of hesitation he opened the door and there stood riker in all his slovenly glory mallorys jaw jutted out charles could see she wasnt buying this no way could he have known who was on the other side of the door she too could recognize the polite light buzzer style of henrietta ramsharan of the third floor and the sharp raps of the musician on the first floor but riker had no style in any sense of that word not in any aspect of his life hi charles said riker he nodded to mallory and made an exaggerated bow to mrs ortega who screwed up her face and walked into the next room muttering something which might have been damn cops you called charles to tell him you were coming and when said mallory to riker then she looked at charles for confirmation not believing for a moment that he couldve known by any other means charles smiled and shook his head there were limits to what he could discern from knocks but in truth riker had never called him he had seen the sergeants arrival from the window and now he had his first breakthrough in the art of poker as he decided not to enlighten her his mind was racing on to new hopes of being the big winner of tomorrows game as riker was settling into the deep padding of the couch riker pulled a crumple of papers from the inside pocket of his overcoat and spread them out on his lap in an attempt to smooth out the damage the first page was a map of the park with yellow lines drawn in two areas he looked up at mallory who was still glaring at charles heller pinpointed the exact site where amanda fell the guys a genius he took soil samples down to the department of agriculture the dirt in the wound was full of microscopic critters that wont live in the shadow areas of the wooded patch where we found amanda riker dangled a cigarette from his lip and fished his pockets for a match heller says hes gonna write a monograph and give you half the credit mallory so you ready to take a look at the crime scene now what for she picked up the sheet with the yellow markings i can read a map hey mallory im just along for the ride okay but most of us like to swing by the crime scene maybe take a look at the place where the victim died waste of time i read the report forensics been over the ground and probably ten or twelve cops with big feet what am i gonna see you never know kid a match sparked in his hand the flame died in a cloud of exhaled smoke dont call me kid mrs ortega returned to the front room and was plugging in the vacuum cleaner riker smiled at the woman you know mrs ortega we got a suspect here youd really appreciate all we know about the bastard is that he lives in a luxury condo and he can clean an apartment like a pro then he wasnt born no rich kid huh rich kids arent raised right you can tell if they earn their money or get it the easy way mallory knows from clean she turned to charles now your mother never let your feet touch the ground you had livein help when you were growing up how do i know that you dont know what steel wool is or what its for i can always tell when you clean up after a meal in the office kitchen and when its mallory mallory was raised right but this man who was raised right is a killer said charles in a somewhat defensive tone so you think mallory carries a gun for ballast in the wind mrs ortega leaned on the vacuum hose and wagged her finger at charles you can always tell the rich kids born with money if the husband or the wife splits they go off their feed for a week you can tell how upset they are by the stock of booze and pills but if the cleaning woman leaves them their whole world falls apart they go back to living like animals so chances are your guy wasnt born with money mallory was nodding as the woman said this mallory deferred to mrs ortega in all things regarding cleaning solvents and the chemistry of stains mrs ortega might be the only human mallory ever deferred to you can tell a lot about a persons character from the way they clean and what they keep said mrs ortega waxing on in a rare philosophic mode you know said riker turning to charles i asked mrs ortega to clean my apartment about a year ago she made the sign of the evil eye and turned her back on me now i figure im lucky she never saw it a gray log of ashes fell from his cigarette and crumbled down the front of his suit as his arms shrugged out of his overcoat i dont have to see your apartment riker mrs ortega cast an appraising eye over his rumpled suit and scuffed shoes youve got at least three bags of garbage piling up in the kitchen the sheets havent been changed in a month and there are beer bottles under the bed there might be two clean dishes in the cupboard youre real comfortable with spiders and youre seeing a woman tonight three heads turned to mrs ortega how did you know about the woman asked riker this morning you used a can of cheap spot remover i can see the powder rings around the stains from here you dont usually get that fancy mallory nodded her respects to mrs ortega and headed for the door to her private office i have to pack my equipment ill be back in a few minutes its good to see you again sergeant said charles can i get you a cup of coffee is it still morning no then ill have a beer the vacuum cleaner was moving slowly toward them sucking conversation out of the air when mrs ortega shut off the machine and turned to the quieter activity of dusting charles handed riker a cold beer what mallorys doing is rather dangerous isnt it im surprised youre going along with it she has to do it this way charles theres no evidence no weapon no witness no motive everyone who can hold a rock has the means the crime scene is six minutes from the building even the doorman has opportunity you see the problem if she cant flush him out and fast he gets away with murder charless brain was backing up in the conversation no motive did he say was it possible that riker had not seen the manuscript that lay on the desk between them as rikers eyes were settling on the ream of paper some malloryguided instinct prompted him to call the mans attention away from it you know markowitz wouldnt like this at all youll be close by her all the time right like i said charles im only along for the ride she doesnt need me shes not a kid any more and she didnt need anybody when she was one he slugged back his beer but louis always credited helen with helen could only see the good in kathy even when it wasnt there i remember how happy helen was when lou started bringing kathy into work after school it was the only way he could keep the kid from stealing new york but helen was only thinking about the positive role models of police officers apparently she was right and five days a week the kid was surrounded by offthewall murders when other kids were out playing games didnt mallory ever play games with other children she used to play with markowitz now she plays alone what sort of games did she like i asked her once when she was maybe thirteen what was her favorite murder is the best game she says i went all clammy it was the way she said it i asked markowitz if he thought the kid was capable of killing oh yeah says markowitz like id asked him if kathy could pitch a curve ball that doesnt tell me why youre so confident that she can flush the killer out without getting hurt if the suspects in this condo werent uptown taxpayers with good lawyers wed sweat the pack of them now when mallory gets the perp there wont be any lawyers around hell be under more stress than hes ever known hell flap his mouth with cameras rolling the creeps always talk even after we read them their rights they lie but they talk they trip themselves up if we dont rush this perp if a lawyer gets to him in time to shut his mouth we lose him no evidence no case it has to be quick she has to flush him out fast and trip him up or he gets away but the danger the biggest danger is that she stumbles over someone elses dirty little secrets you got the same percentage of scum in the coventry arms as you do in any tenement building charles picked up a photograph that had wafted to the floor from rikers small pile of papers who is this amanda bosch but she looks nothing like mallory how did the mistake well she was alive when this shot was taken even i had to look at the body twice after the bugs had been at her have you notified her family yet theres no family alive to notify mallory liked that less chance of a leak what will happen to her her estate whatevers in her bank account will go to the city tax office the landlady will sell her stuff for back rent or put it out on the street shell get a grave that no one will ever visit and then shell be gone from the face of the earth or maybe not mallory could make her famous the cat sat down between them ignoring both of them and picking at the bandage on its ear charles was reminded of something louis markowitz had said living with mallory was like having a wounded animal in the house the building had been made to last and so it had well into the twentieth century and showed no signs of falling down at the cusp of the twentyfirst dark wood beams and stucco facing rose for ten stories the old west side mansion would fit well with a gothic horror story riker put down the heavy boxes to pant for a moment mallory had just slipped the doorman a hundred dollar bill the kid has style riker wondered how she was going to bury the money in the department expense account as mallory talked the doorman smiled continuously lips parting ever wider until they threatened to escape the margins of his face im expecting amanda bosch to drop by do you know her on sight oh yes said the doorman who was called arthur miss hydes friend pretty young woman with sad eyes i know her now the smile wavered is she all right why do you ask she was acting very strange the last time i saw her when was that maybe four or five days ago she never came to the door she just sat over there very quiet like she was waiting for someone he pointed to the wrought iron bench twelve feet from the entrance i thought it was a bit odd because miss hyde was out of town ive never known miss bosch to visit anyone else in this building then after a while miss bosch stood up very quickly she seemed agitated for some reason and then she ran away very odd indeed what set her off no idea miss i was busy then opening the door getting a cab for a tenant people were coming and going do you remember which people no i dont tenants visitors children and dogs most of the tenants have dogs riker was picking the cartons up from the sidewalk when mallory turned her head quickly eyes fixing on an empty patch of sidewalk across the street now what was that about he wondered if it was not too early in the game for her to be watching her back the murderer lived in this building and only he would make the connection between mallory and amanda bosch but it was a woman walking fast toward them on this side of the street he put the carton down again as a small brunette with nervous moves was looking up at mallory and asking forgive me for following you could i speak to you privately for just a moment mallory nodded to the doorman who closed the door the two women moved up the sidewalk and beyond the range of his hearing the brunette was a tangle of loose wires her hands were flying mallory said a few words to the woman and the brunette shook her head eyes rolling in their sockets like startled marbles then the woman clutched her bag to her chest as though to fend off a weapon she backed off a few steps and hurried down the sidewalk to a waiting cab mallory strolled back the carton was hoisted into the air once more the doorman had shut down his neon smile the moment mallory turned her back now it was blazing again with the dazzle of every tooth exposed and youre my new best friend was in his eyes as they passed by him and into the lobby the lobby atmosphere was piped in from another century while mallory handed a letter to the concierge on the other side of a carved wood desk riker looked around at the hanging tapestries and the oil paintings the elaborately patterned rugs had to be a years salary each plush green velvet wrapped the couches and chairs in conversational groupings a woman passed through the lobby wearing dark glasses on this overcast day to say im a celebrity and youre not a bank of stainedglass windows lined one wall patches of crystal and colors of brightness beneath the arched center window was a mural of running deer running blind into the cruel joke of the blank wall adjacent to the painting now the concierge was leading them to the elevator it belonged in a s blackandwhite movie an iron cage of scrollwork bars on the door and an interior of gleaming wood with inlaid designs and parquet floor they were handed into the care of an elevator operator and rode up watching the floors drop away from them and each one was different from the last the iron door opened on the third floor and they walked down a hallway lined by soft glowing bulbs that would have been gaslight in the last century the carpeting on this floor was an oriental pattern and the walls were papered in money riker guessed he knew a good wallpapering job when he saw it and money sat on a small table in the hallway a vase holding a fortune in freshcut flowers the scent of roses followed after him as mallory fit her key in the lock and opened the door to the rosens apartment he put the cartons down on the tiled floor of the entryway okay mallory the woman downstairs now what was that about sally riccalo she followed us over from the office shes a client with an interesting idea that her stepson wants to stab her with a flying pencil that doesnt sound like charless style i thought he only handled the academic bullshit so whos whacked her or the kid too early to tell she looks scared enough what did you say to her i told her to get out of town and she said no he looked around at the rosens front room and wondered how the rosens were reacting to the spartan simplicity of mallorys apartment in the front room was a museum of family photos the family was everywhere eyes of the children in the eyes of mothers and fathers grandfathers and on and on and there was a toy some child had left behind on the couch the fish in the large aquarium swam in quick schools of tropical colors a small sticky palm print lay on the glass alongside the print of what must be the nose of a grandchild or greatgrandchild the only element out of character with this comfortable room of overstuffed furniture and silk flowers was the eye of the computer lit and looking out through the partially opened doors of an oak cabinet while mallory went exploring riker opened the cabinet door wide and peered at the screen inside the door was a simple instruction guide for computer illiterates like himself he pushed a button and the screen became a slow scrolling information sheet on scheduled maintenance and now a notice of the tenants meeting to be held in the rooftop facility this last item was tagged with an urgent business label and a request for full attendance at the meeting more notes scrolled by mentions of packages held at the lobby desk and the minutes of the condo boards last meeting the tap on his shoulder made him jump mallory stood behind him smiling gotcha the games went on the old man had taught her that one too for a heavyset man markowitz had made even less noise than kathy when he crept up behind her by the time she was thirteen the old man could no longer do that she had surpassed him in the creeping game between markowitz and mallory he sometimes wondered who had been the worst influence on whom i found a room to set up in she said he picked up the cartons and followed her into a small library he settled them on the desk and she began to unload the computer equipment and the mini cam the wiring and the works he couldnt put a name to only the wiretap equipment was recognizable and he averted his eyes from this knowing there was no warrant markowitz had not taught her this far from it the old man had remained mechanically inept and computer ignorant until the day he died the less markowitz had known about what she was up to with her machines the more secure he had felt in the nypd pension plan mallory stepped off the elevator at the penthouse level she had traveled only a few steps into the room when heads began to turn she was wearing the black suit she had worn to her fathers funeral the skirt provided a rare outing for her legs displaying athletic calves and wellshaped ankles tapering above high heels a dozen pairs of eyes male and female followed after her as she passed through the gathering of perhaps forty tenants she paused now and then to admire a few of the art deco pieces scattered about the rooftop facility and generally disapproved of the clutter of objects on pedestals and sideboards but every travesty of decorators was forgiven when she lifted her face to the skylight which spanned the whole of the wide room a waxing moon kept two stars for company a filmy cloud raced across the glass gaining on the moon then killing its light death becomes you my dear said a cultured dulcet voice ive already heard that one today said mallory turning to look down at a woman with black hat and a face that was pushing sixty not in the wrinkles but in the pulledback skin of the toomanyith facelift i suppose youre going to tell me how well preserved i am for a corpse the older woman smiled a thin line of crimson lipstick youve got a smart mouth for a dead cop and now the voice betrayed roots in hells kitchen when gangsters ruled and the woman went up one notch in mallorys estimation im betty hyde mallory kathleen mallory isnt it formerly of nypd currently of the consulting firm mallory and butler ltd youre staying in the rosens apartment for the next ten days while your own condo is being redecorated theyre old friends of your family and you have their proxy to vote on the swimming pool in the basement i have spies everywhere my dear but mallory counted only two spies the concierge knew she had the rosens proxy and arthur the doorman had been fed the rest of the story and you sell gossip mallory countered your column is syndicated in fifty papers around the country you have a fiveminute spot on channel two news youve lived here for the past fifteen years you have a fullsize pool table in your apartment and you change young men the way i change my blue jeans you should pay your spies better miss hyde they have no sense of loyalty the woman widened her smile into a brilliant grin call me betty everyone does i like your style my dear may i call you kathy no even better well miss mallory just mallory amanda bosch gave me your name as a reference she handed the woman a card and betty hyde read the words aloud discreet investigations i love it our clients are government departments and universities mostly research projects and evaluations do you have anything nice to say about bosch if we hired her services shed be working on sensitive material i trust her with highprofile information but i dont trust anyone with the really good stuff i do that research myself i had the impression she hung out with you from time to time well she does or did rather shes cut back on her activities for the past few months i used to take her to parties when i go fishing for young men i need good bait she attracts men nearly as well as you do and in return you introduced her to the right people yes are any of the right people here tonight anyone else who could vouch for her betty hydes mouth curled up on one side in the attitude of all right lets assume i believe this charade mallory took stock of that attitude and parried with a smile to say yeah lets just assume that i took amanda to several gatherings in this very room i imagine shes met quite a few of the tenants i dont know which ones might have used her research services shall i introduce you around and perhaps later you might accompany me to another party mallory was looking over the smaller womans head her eyes fixed on the man standing by the long buffet table i think i recognize judge heart from the senate hearings mallory nodded toward a tall man graying at the temples and wearing a welltailored black suit he dwarfed the thin woman who stood next to him her grayblonde hair was pulled back in a severe bun at the nape of her neck yes thats him and thats his wife pansy see the invisible strings she can never get more than three feet away from him mallory did have the impression that he worked the woman like a puppet every utterance from his mouth called the womans face up to his with a smile that was too quick too wide betty hyde said in a lower voice when you get closer tell me if that isnt a bruise under her makeup youre kidding i thought he was riding into the supreme court nomination on his womens rights position yes amusing isnt it if i could nail him as a wife beater id do it in a hot flash if you hear anything its worth gold my dear mallory they live in the apartment above yours any screaming the sounds of a womans soft body bouncing off the wall id be interested in anything like that hyde stared up at the younger woman and her smile became a tight line as she shifted her weight from one foot to the other in the uncomfortable dance of waiting on mallory for a professional gossip that drawn out silence would be like sunlight to a vampire ive already surmised that your condo isnt being redecorated said hyde and amanda bosch is not taking on any new clients if anything shes tapering off i understand its a difficult pregnancy hyde smiled again and smiled mallory from the school of never volunteer anything continued to stare down at hyde her face gave away nothing hyde stopped smiling and each woman squared off against the other making measurements and mental notes staking out the air between them with wires of tension hyde gave in first never mind the research projects youre a private detective right its a logical career move for an excop am i right mallory shrugged and hyde showed all of her teeth now that youve moved into the private sector let me give you a few helpful hints she entwined her arm in mallorys and led her back to a corner of relative seclusion where only potted ferns gathered mallory people in your trade carry professional habits into what should be passing for social life you dont ask questions you interrogate you sound like a cop just smile a lot these people love to talk about themselves so youre working on a case weve established that much and we can definitely place it in the money set cant we did amanda put you on to something as if i thought youd tell me i also know how to protect sources if you get my meaning i think we can do business miss hyde call me betty over there by the elevator isnt that moss white the talk show host yes and the tan is real he just got back from a week on location in california what day did he come back this morning scratch that one which one is harry kipling that one said hyde indicating a goodlooking man black hair blue eyes and tall hes charming but aside from his looks hes not remarkable his wife is really miles more interesting there she is see that woman over there by the bookcase angel kipling is a crime against nature all trolls are supposed to be short shes as tall as you are you mean that middleaged woman with the bad hair ive always liked the phrase a woman of a certain age the tall man with her who is he the blind man thats eric franz hes blind scratch that one too yes angel took away his dark glasses and the cane because she thought it might make him fit in better with the normal people hes terrified of her so of course he never puts up any resistance i think were all afraid of angel shes one of those people who learned table manners late in life she asks rude questions like how old are you how much money do you make and are those your own teeth its hard on the nerves a bit like a farting gorilla ripping through your peace of mind once a week or so you never do get used to it mallory looked back to harry kipling its hard to see her and the husband as a couple because harry is so ridiculously goodlooking because angel looks like she escaped from a hole in a grimm brothers fairy tale you might have something there makes you wonder what she has on him i like the way your mind works mallory since youre digging around anyway dear you might want to share with a new friend harry kipling is he one of the heirs to kipling electronics no should i be wondering what these men have in common whats his story the usual thing he lives off his wifes money and fobs himself off as an investment counselor i doubt that he handles any of angels money i believe she gives him an allowance all the charge accounts around town are in her name now you have to watch out for angel she was misnamed shes the heiress to kipling electronics her father started the company and then he named it after his soninlaw harry took angels family name it was a condition of the prenuptial agreement if you took more of an interest in gossip youd know that whats his real name no one ever cared enough to wonder if youre thinking he might have an interesting past i doubt it angels father would have had him checked out and even checked behind his ears oh hit the floor mallory here comes the troll she probably saw you looking at her husband did you bring a weapon dear in fact she had left her gun in the apartment angel kipling was crossing the floor in a straight line of terrible sure purpose as she neared them betty hyde backed up slightly unconsciously mallory didnt the kipling woman had a poor understanding of personal space now her face was entirely too close and matching mallorys eyelevel from a height of fiveten plus high heels i understand youre a friend of the rosens said angel kipling is it true they keep a baby shark in their apartment she looked down at the older woman oh hello betty betty hyde nodded to angel and went through the introduction of not miss mallory but only mallory mallory could not take her eyes off the hairs extending from angel kiplings upper lip they were long like a cats whiskers but not symmetrical the body was a potato attached to toothpick legs and sausages for arms the crown of her head was an interesting mix of three failed experiments in hair coloring striping brown at the root into blonde and then black a wealthy woman with doityourself hair interesting so tell me miss mallory what do you think of our building just mallory its an historical landmark you know lillian russel the oldtime actress kept an apartment here so diamond jim brady could visit her on the sly and dylan thomas threw up on this rug added betty hyde angel kipling looked down as though there might be a recent stain she turned back to mallory let me introduce you to my husband the troll put up a hand with one pudgy finger extended as though she were flagging down a taxi or a waiter from across the room harry kiplings body assumed the stance of attention and hurried toward her do you have children asked angel kipling no i dont do you oh theres peter but hes away most of the year the tall man entered the small circle of women harry this is miss mallory shes staying in the rosens apartment while theyre out of town i heard hattie rosen was going to the mayo clinic for cancer is that true miss mallory kathy right just mallory and how did angel kipling know her first name perhaps angels spies were as well paid as betty hydes angel kipling turned to the tall man with the dark hair and the cobalt eyes i was just telling kathy about our building harry kipling was more than goodlooking his shoulders were broad giving him the aspect of an athlete good babymaking material what was he doing with the troll if he had married for money he could have done better i use your wifes computer chips said mallory im afraid i wouldnt know a computer chip from a potato chip investment is my line his voice had a smoky quality and it was seductive in the mellow notes betty hyde took mallorys arm and smiling at the kiplings she led her away saying you were staring too long at harry dont turn around i think youre his type of course hes a little old for my tastes i never touch a man over thirty and hes almost forty no dont turn around im watching his wife shes drawing a bead on you if looks were bullets youd be on the floor and bleeding from a hole between your pretty eyes excuse me said harry kipling catching up to them sans angel who had gone back to terrorizing the blind man didnt you die on television the other night acting said mallory oh youre an actress said kipling i thought you were a police officer said moss white the talk show host who had suddenly appeared at kiplings side white was the stuff television executives swooned over the mouth was full and sensual and the softness carried into the liquid brown eyes he was born for television so youre an actress said white god they didnt get anything right did they i wonder if we could discuss a guest appearance on my television show it might be good for your career just a spot where you tell the viewing audience what its like to be declared dead by the media they thought you were dead when they found you in the park right she turned slowly to harry kipling who was arranging his features into a pianos worth of white teeth his face had a rugged quality that made moss white seem almost feminine by comparison betty was pulling her away again and they were drifting across the wide floor toward judge emery heart the candidate for the supreme court nomination moss white has an accent said mallory england or australia indiana he spent six weeks in london four years ago hes been talking that way ever since moss is a quick study i paid a hundred an hour for my accent and it took me years and now mallory and hyde were standing before an austere man who might have stepped out of an ad for middleaged upscale clothing judge heart may i present mallory the wellknown television personality the judge gave off the unmistakable odor of a good politician the smile was instant and the brown eyes were intent forgive me i dont watch very much television miss mallory what sort of program do you have i was only on for five minutes i played a corpse the smile faltered for a moment while the judges appraising eye was reassessing her importance in the scheme of things now the smile was back with full force well they say there are no small parts this is my wife pansy mallory turned to the small anxious woman at his side and yes there definitely were strings that tied her to her husband isnt that right pansy the judge prompted no small parts the woman nodded automatically stiffly she smiled too quickly and the sudden display of teeth was startling in the context of her eyes and yes there was a bruise below a heavy layer of makeup do you have family with you miss mallory asked pansy just mallory no do you well rosies been gone for a while oh dont get me started i cry whenever i think of our little rosie shes such an angel emery taught rosie to shake hands didnt you dear rosie is such a clever little thing isnt she emery and she can sit up and beg rosie is a dog said betty hyde after drawing mallory away with explanations of introductions promised elsewhere i think i worked that out said mallory now let me introduce you to our resident pulitzer prize winner betty hyde paused by a bookcase to retrieve a pair of dark glasses and a cane hes marvelous with a cane in his hands i just thought id give him a sporting chance to run for it before angel comes back i wonder why he doesnt deck her unfortunately eric was well brought up i thought you might find him interesting hes one of my best sources people think nothing of what they say in erics presence they seem to lump all handicaps into one taking him for deaf and learning disabled too now betty hyde placed one hand gently on the mans arm to announce herself hello eric id like you to meet mallory a new resident how do you do said eric franz the mans voice was cultured but in this crowd that told her very little about his background the lack of cane and glasses had the opposite effect of aiding the blind franz to blend in here was a man with eyes out of focus and staring at nothing betty hyde slipped the cane into one of his hands and the glasses into the other in the tone of conspirators he asked whats between me and the door four people i never cared for hit them with the cane if you can manage it dark glasses in place he made a courtly bow to mallory missing her general direction by two feet its been a pleasure he walked across the crowded floor with the confidence of a sighted man and hit no one on the way out and there was time for mallory to wonder if he wasnt navigating entirely too well and how he had been blinded and how much insurance money had been involved and if he had carried insurance on his dead wife he isnt all the way blind you know said betty he spots fakes and sharks in the dark all the survival skill necessary to make it in new york city mallory knew harry kipling was watching her she could see his dark hair in peripheral vision and saw his head turn as she crossed the room with betty hyde she turned back to look at kiplings wife who was following her husbands every move there was an expression of bitterness in the womans eyes now all things flashed across the womans face hate anger suspicion and hurt not a happy marriage i know the lawyer who drew up their prenuptial agreement said betty hyde nodding to the kiplings they have one child the estate passes over the mother and goes to the son when he comes of age ive only seen the boy once i havent seen many children today most of the year you wont see any children at all children from this building are a new class of wealthy homeless people they only come home from boarding school during the holidays but if you really dislike your children you can pay the school extra to keep them away from you for the entire year do the hearts have children judge heart has one child by another marriage a daughter ive never seen her in the flesh only in publicity photos that ran in the sunday supplement before the senate hearings i suspect they rented the girl for the photo sessions is there anything wrong with her like drug addiction shoplifting oh mallory thats so common among this group i wouldnt stoop to writing about it could there be another reason why you never see her something radically wrong with her you mean something like a lockaway child an embarrassment in the public eye thats an interesting angle leave it to me dear ill get back to you its something you can only dig out of the right people you wont find it on any records not with the money behind the judge and the blind man eric eric franz no he and annie never had any children unless you count the guide dog and the dog is such a sweet animal it would be hard to believe it was annies natural offspring a bad marriage it was no great love affair her idea of sport was to rearrange the furniture so hed trip over it and eric used to tell their friends that annie was feeding him dog food now that was his idea of a joke but she probably did she had a great sense of humor he was a late visitor to the kitchen and alone he pounded his hand on the cutting board and a bowl of fruit jumped and tilted over rocking its apples to the table that bitch she knew what he had done and what he was she knew things an apple was still rolling on the board red as her lips were red he held the ripe fruit in one hand and fumbled in the drawer for a paring knife he stabbed the skin and watched the juice flow out he stabbed it again and again and now he sliced off the skin in slow peels imagining the screams emanating from the mutilated fruit in his hand bitch all women were bitches she was sitting in the rosens library facing her computer screen it had taken five minutes to break into the guts of the building computer system so much for security now she scrolled through the files on the tenants and made notes on access routes to bypass all but three computers she set up a dummy screen and in the area of personal messages she typed her own message tailored only by the three different names and otherwise the same if her suspects didnt check the bulletin board tonight they would do so in the morning once the computer was accessed again the fake board would disappear with no trace of tampering she picked through the buildings list of fax numbers two of the suspects had fax machines that would come in handy after a glance at the building schematic for the best route to the basement room where the phone lines were located she picked up her flashlight and telephone kit thirty minutes later the elevator operator was carrying her up and out of the basement the iron cage stopped at the lobby floor a boy got on the elevator he might be fourteen years old if harry kipling had played around his wife had not the boy had the same blue eyes and black hair the same stocky build as the father and now the boy was looking her up and down his slow widening smile was more of a leer she stared at the boy in the wordless disbelief of youre kidding right the boys face went to a high red color and he got off on the next floor though it was not where he lived she wondered if womanizing might be genetic she continued on watching the floors drop away looking up through the iron grille of the doors she saw the tip of the white cane at the blind mans feet eric franz was standing by the elevator when the doors opened on the rosens floor as she stepped out of the elevator he inclined his head miss mallory ive been looking for you oh im sorry its just mallory right right she said after a hesitation it was your perfume said eric franz in response to the question she was about to ask he shrugged and smiled when you lose your sight nature gives you another gift a heightened sense of awareness betty hyde tells me you have an interest in the judge so do i also professional i work for a research group i assume she told you that too yes she did but my interest in the judge is personal im curious about an old incident being blind has its drawbacks you know theres always missing information on some level take the day the medical examiners people showed up for the death of old mrs heart the judges mother are you saying it wasnt a natural death supposedly it was a heart attack maybe it was but i did wonder when the police detective came a half hour later i was in the lobby when he said to the doorman just the one word homicide that wouldnt make sense if she died of a heart attack it is interesting isnt it and now i expect youll want me to describe the police officer mallory smiled yeah right he was tall and thin and as though franz had read the expression on her face he hurried on to answer her next unasked question he made long strides he knocked into me i remember saying to him what are you blind i never miss an opportunity to use that line when he knocked into me there wasnt much bulk to him he apologized and judging by his accent he was originally from brooklyn oh and he wore too much aftershave it was a very expensive brand and his coat was made of leather you mentioned the me investigator oh that man was already up there in the judges apartment the hearts family doctor was there too i was sitting in the lobby waiting for a friend who was detained in traffic all of them trooped past me the detective could only be palanski palanski again he was the closest thing nypd had to an ambulance chaser the mouse crept silendy across the kitchen floor mindful of the giants blue pajama legs its small eyes were filled with the reflected crumbs of a golden croissant it snatched up the bread and scurried back to its hiding place beneath the refrigerator where it sat feeding in the dark insanely pleased with itself charles watched the cream bubble over a blue gas flame and wondered how many days the mouse might have left in this world mrs ortega had tried repeatedly to murder it with traps to break its back with a broom and to poison it so far the savvy city mouse had eluded her with supernatural skill and gained charless respect but mrs ortega was also a mythic creature in her own right however quick the mouse might be mrs ortega was sure to be close behind it broom held high the mouse was as good as dead the coffee dripped its rich brown juices down into the carafe the heady aroma wafted high up to the fifteenfoot ceiling of the kitchen and beyond the appreciation of the mouse and the man charles carried his coffee into the front room and set it down beside the bulky manuscript he cleared his mind of all but the task at hand one thing became clear to him in the first twenty pages of text if amanda bosch was the female character she had no capacity for selfdelusion he ceased to speed read and slowed down to a human pace for this was very human material amanda awaking from a bad dream and finding it there beside her in her bed the male character of the novel seemed not to know or care about the rules between men and women when they became lovers the woman wondered why he came back time and again he showed so little interest in the affair once the conquest of her had been made the excuses he gave to explain his infrequent need of her were insulting yet she did not end the affair telling herself it was better to be touched by this cold and dispassionate man than never to be touched at all this she realized must be what it was like to feel as a man did when he separated the act from the partner she never asked about his wife fearing that he had never felt anything for her either nor for anyone he could make love to a woman better than any man she had ever known yet he did not like women when they were together in warm weather and cold the bedding would always be soaked with sex and sweat they went swimming in the fluid off their bodies plunging down and rising up in the water that streamed off their flesh he would make her come first insisting on it manipulating her body and when she came he took a technicians pride in this job well done there was a perverse coldness in the very heat of the act he would be dressed when she came out of the bathroom where she had been emptying out his sperm and flushing it away to the sea she would watch his back as he walked to the door reciting the litany of excuses not turning to say goodbye and never a kiss as though to teach her not to set too much store by this attachment which was detachment she would strip the wet bedding off the mattress and lay it out to dry in the air the heat of july the first time and the winter now it was better than nothing she told herself knowing it was not charles looked away from the manuscript to a clear place on the wall beside his chair eidetic memory called up the photograph of amanda bosch which riker had shown him only once his vision was a perfect reproduction even to the smudge and crease at the upper lefthand corner of the print her sad eyes stared at him the expression was in the very shape of her eyes a sadness fashioned in her mothers womb he felt that he knew amanda bosch so well he might have had a dialogue with her and predicted the answers to nearly every question if he only had her back to life for a minutes work but only malakhai could have pulled off that stunning trick to blend the device of dialogues and the illusion of a woman with uncanny unerring faithfulness to life he had often thought of malakhai over the years the elderly magician and his strange creation what a mad idea and yet the manuscript did promise an exquisite problem in mental construction it could be done the manuscripts narrative was no mere imitation of life it was amandas mind at work with only the manuscript and the photograph the old man could have done this but the old magician was insane and far from here in mind and body it was a lunatic idea and he must let it go he turned back to the manuscript but the face of amanda would not leave him eidetic memory had called it up and his minds eye could not send it away it swam over the text his thoughts ran strongly with malakhai now as he stared into amandas eyes oh malakhai how do you like your last days old man are you still in love with louisa still crazy and does that dead woman share your bed tonight he stared at the telephone with one call he might have an audience with the greatest magician who ever lived cousin max had said there was none better cracked brain or no what would he say to malakhai excuse me for presuming on family connections but i have a small problem with a dead woman of my own how do i go about becoming as mad as you are or am i half the way gone already he shook his head slowly from side to side this was no kind of dabble for an amateur in the art of illusion he must not forget what the mental construction of a succubus had cost malakhai who was a master he turned back to the manuscript it was that time of night he supposed when mad ideas seemed the most wonderful he was an hour into his reading when a noise called his attention away from the pages he was unaccustomed to company at this hour he had forgotten about nose now he watched the cat a scant few inches from his slippers the fact that nose was declawed had hampered the animal only slightly a small brown mouse had wriggled free of the clawless paws only to be captured more firmly in rows of sharp white teeth charles silently rooted for mouse the cats teeth crunched down on small bones the mouse cried it was not a squeak the tiny animal was crying the cat looked up at him very mallory in the color and the aspect of its eyes he reached down with the good intention of taking the mouse away to kill it quickly the cat emitted a low warning growl and the tail began to switch and threaten as his hand hovered near the mouse back off said the cats eyes its my toy not yours angel kipling gathered the quilted silk of her robe closer about her person as though the room might be cold it was not she sat before the computer transfixed by what was written there in the personal message file she could see her husband in the reflection of the dark screen behind the green letters a tiny replica of harry floated toward her from deep inside the box of glowing letters now she could feel the heat of him standing close behind her chair angel whats wrong oh nothing harry she continued to stare at the screen at last she said its a personal message i think it must be for you she rose from her chair and walked slowly in the direction of her own bedroom where she slept alone she turned to see him bending over the computer monitor reading the message which filled the scrolling screen and repeated endlessly you liar you liar you liar you liar he only wanted to be where the cat was not feeding on the mouse he unlocked the door of the office across the hall from his residence and at the touch of a button the reception room filled with soft colored light from antique shades of stained glass the ancient woodwork of furniture and tall arched window frames gleamed and lustered he wandered into the back room which was mallorys office and another planet the wall switch filled this room with harsh light bright as day and brought him rudely and solidly into the age of electronics machines gleamed and stared at him with dead gray terminal eyes the beige metal knights of the new order formed a row of perfect symmetry a wall of manuals faced a wall of equipment and no speck of dust dared alight in this place for fear of mallory the neat the corkboard which lined the rear wall was an even more ruthless departure from his own world of antiques and all things civilized if murder be mallorys religion the ghastly collage of this wall was a shrine to amanda bosch a madonna without a child when had mallory accomplished all of this did she never sleep there were photographs of amandas apartment her person and samples of her handwriting mallorys precision in the neat placement of every item was overridden by the softer personality of amanda the shot to his heart was the picture of the old wooden cradle amanda had purchased for her unborn child he looked at the autopsy photos and looked away the crime site photos were more palatable but every artifact of the death had become intensely personal for now he knew this woman as few people could have known her in life the best of the death photos was centered on the board the damage to the skin of her face he overlaid with a memory of the photo riker had shown him when she posed as a living model he superimposed the rosy live flesh over the white and the dead when the living image lay over the death mask it had the unsettling effect of the photographic woman suddenly opening her eyes his mind did a little dance and jog away from reality and then came back to it with caution tripping all the way falling now as the wound to the side of her head bled through the double image he winced at the living expression juxtaposed with the clotted blood the brown blazer she died in bore the drippings of the wound in a great bloody stain draped over one shoulder she was smiling that bothered him he found he could alter the smile to a more appropriate expression and still be true to the likeness now her facial arrangement seemed only friendly and slightly inquisitive what now it asked he held this new image of her for too long so long that it would remain in memory for years he scanned the items of the apartment inventory and found a bottle of her perfume on the list he found it again in the photograph of her bathroom counter she wore the scent of roses the perfume bottle bore the logo of an old and prestigious house he remembered seeing a bottle of that scent among the sequined costumes and the makeup boxes in the cellar where the illusions of maximillian candle were stored her husband was staring at the computer screen when she walked into the room pansy heart came up behind him softly noise of any kind irritated him over his shoulder she read the words you liar you liar you liar the words filled out the entire screen she looked up to the slot at the top of the screen which labeled this file as a personal message he turned on her his face was red with anger dont you ever sneak up behind me again she backed away quickly stilling the hand that rose almost of its own accord when it sensed an oncoming blow but he only turned his face back to the screen he pounded on the console and sent the books and papers flying she knelt on the carpet and began to crawl on all fours retrieving every fallen thing get out of here he yelled get out she backed away from him still on her knees then stumbling to a stand now scurrying off down the hall as she entered the bedroom she was met by her own reflection hurrying toward her she stopped before the fulllength mirror and fit her fist into her mouth to keep from crying out loud when had she dropped so much weight with her hair pulled back the way he insisted she wear it and with the new thinness of her body and now that expression of a hunted animal she had come to be a living likeness of judge emery hearts dead mother the braille printer scrolled out the message filling sheet after sheet with two damning words eric franz sat very still eyes fixed on a scene inside his head a horror movie that never ended a bright snowfall cascaded by the wide front window large flakes illuminated by the buildings exterior lights he turned from the window and ripped the scrolling sheets from the printer and now it snowed outside and inside as he created his own small storm of white flakes of paper being torn into ever smaller bits he worked in the dark his hands were full when he returned to the front room of his apartment charles unloaded his small cache on the coffee table of the ingredients for making a woman rikers contribution had been half a pack of cigarettes left behind this afternoon according to the medical examiners report on mallorys wall amanda had been a smoker there were no cigarettes on mallorys meticulous inventory amanda might have given up the habit when she knew she was pregnant but her manuscript was filled with imagery of smoke matches struck in the dark when she woke alone to hug her knees and rock her body and hold herself in her own arms through the long night into a morning of filled ashtrays and dust motes swirling in the blue smoke and the gray light cousin maxs contribution had been the bottle of rose scent from the old wardrobe box in the basement old malakhais louisa had gone everywhere in the scent of gardenias amanda bosch had gone about in roses he called up amandas face on a patch of wall the eidetic images of life over death which were fixed in memory now what was malakhais recipe he should have started with a massive head injury like the one malakhai had sustained in the korean conflict such a wound was definitely concomitant with all the most bizarre aberrations such as the stigmata well if he had no physical trauma he certainly had his own injuries to the heart and the mind and perhaps this was mallorys contribution to the unholy stew next on the list would be the years of malakhais solitary confinement in a korean prison cell the terrible isolation he had suffered emerging finally from that cell with a phantom louisa charles reflected on his own years of isolation a sprawling university campus was as close to the sixfoot square cell as he could come he thought of his years of being the freak child among the tall students ten years his senior and then came the years of isolation in the sheltering womb of effrim wildes think tank before making his escape into real life and his own consulting firm for most of his life he had been a thing apart an alien in a culture of socially adept people all of this would nearly approximate malakhais isolation from the world but he neednt go back so far in time there was the ache of loneliness each time mallory quit a room another contribution thank you mallory if anything should happen to mallory she could never be reconstructed as malakhai had done for louisa as he would attempt to do for amanda bosch no one had access to mallorys thoughts and feelings nothing must ever happen to her oh fool he had forgotten the music the concerto had been a prime ingredient in malakhais creation of louisa in childhood it had been the trigger of his own imagination his copy of the concerto had been worn to shreds but the music was so much a part of him he had never thought to replace the recording there was an old vinyl record in the basement somewhere as well as the old turntable for that period of technology ah but wait if amanda bosch was to be a mental construct perhaps he should practice first with the music he had only heard the piece a thousand times in his life now he had all the ingredients of malakhais madness the music the scent and the loneliness yes he could manage it he lit one of rikers cigarettes and set it to smoking in the ashtray he concentrated on amandas face recreating the image he had composed in mallorys office the pictures of life imposed on death and now the eyes of amanda bosch stared into his own photographic memory assisted him with every detail of those sad eyes she had only the flatness of any photograph he could call up for he was no malakhai but even in this poor translation she was compelling the eyes communicated much of her even in the poverty of only two dimensions mystery was there and profound loss and now with an inner ear he searched for the notes of louisas concerto he had been a child of seven the first time he heard the work performed as the overture to malakhais performance of magic and the madness of dead louisa cousin max had taken him to the show as a treat for his birthday he could find many of his own features in his adult cousin but max had been a handsome translation a nose not so great and eyes with a more normal proportion of white to the colored bits he and cousin max had found the way to their seats by the glow of flickering candle footlights the conductors baton was rising as they settled down to the red velvet chairs in the concert hall there had been no gentle beginning to louisas concerto the instruments had welled up and rocked him with an explosion of opening chords and the music rolled over him powerful and eerie then calmer subsiding into echoes of music within the movement metaphors of empty corridors the music rose again to crash down upon him with a passion and then at the most unexpected moment there was a lull bleeding into an empty silence that caused angst among all the listeners it was a vacant space which the ear strained to fill with echoes from the refrain echoes that were not heard except in the mind it was a true vacuum and the imagination of every independent listener had rushed to fill it with phantom notes to end the terrible unbearable silence and then the real music of solid instruments had resumed with an intake of breath which emanated from every quarter of the hall relief from the audience that they were not lost the music was back and flooding over them making them all new again as though they had been cleansed not by fire nor by water but by passage through the void the curtain rose and the music had begun again in accompaniment to the magic act malakhai had created louisa on stage as a real presence then he sent her out into the audience and here and there a gasp was heard as one person and another imagined that louisa had touched them the scent of flowers was everywhere for a time and then it was gone away into the dark of a childs imagination and this time in the void the magic silence where the listeners placed the phantom notes rather than endure the emptiness there he had heard a woman screaming long after the hall had emptied of its audience and only the concerned stage manager remained cousin max had sat in the front row holding the hand of a badly frightened child max had once told him the best of music kept to the natural rhythms of the heart louisas concerto had been such a piece he had the basic structure of it now and he strained to find the subtle places where louisa had placed the most delicate constructions he sat still for an interval of time which might have been an hour or four and finally he had recreated the music note for note just as he had heard it that first night so long ago and in that void louisas genius had created within the music he recreated the scream just as he had heard it as a child but not to the same effect now he welcomed the sound of another voice even a scream to fill the empty space he had come to recognize as loneliness he lit another cigarette to replace the one whose coal had gone dark the smoke spiraled and wafted around his face without odor or sting to the eyes he could only smell the roses perhaps the perfume had been a mistake the scent in the small gold bottle retrieved from the basement had the life span of all things with living ingredients it filled his senses with the tainted aroma of decayed blooms which had died long before young amanda was born the strains of the concerto were in his mind in vivid detail interior music corridors of sadness and then amanda she was only the two dimensions of his calledup photographic image but there was a palpable energy to the woman before him expressive eyes could create that illusion in any number of dimensions now in the manner of adding pinches of pepper and dashes of salt he put the liquid and gleam in the soft blue eyes and he gave her a luster of mallorys sungold hair which could thieve light from shadow ready now he leaned forward amanda the photographic image bowed its head in response it was more like a sheet of paper bending to force an awkward attempt at animating the flat image of a dead woman why were you killed amanda she responded with mallorys voice he created it for her with only the silk of mallory and not the sarcasm only the soft notes for amanda and with this voice amanda said he lied to me her soft mouth had opened and closed in a succession of jerking photographic images a poor approximation of life a bad joke on god there was a wounding to the eyes as though he had offended her and he had his eyes went away from her and she died off to the side of peripheral vision im so sorry he said to no one for there was no one there not amanda certainly nor even her afterimage any more what a grotesque puppet show this had been how pathetic was he he capped the perfume bottle but the death of killed roses hung in the air when he passed into the other rooms it hung in memory this smell of death and when he was in his bed and most vulnerable hands and feet bound by sleep floating helpless in the dark amanda came back all the night long and all about his dreams fresh young roses were being killed even the small sleeping buds still closed in tight balls of soft petals they were also dying chapter december for a full minute charles butler had been standing by the door listening to the scuffle of shoes in the outer hallway by the lightfooted pacing to and fro he knew his visitor was a small person and just now somewhere between acute hearing and zen he detected the sound of someone standing on one leg and then the other he politely waited until his visitor had resolved the hesitation and the door buzzer sounded charles opened the door with his smile already in place a genuine smile for he liked small children hello so youve come early a full hour early yes said justin riccalo rocking on the balls of his feet im supposed to meet my parents here my piano lesson was canceled and i didnt know where else to go not home was it possible he wasnt welcome there as though the boy had read his mind he said i dont have my own key i could go somewhere else im sorry dont apologize i was just on my way to the basement id be happy to have some company do you like magic tricks justins response was not what he had anticipated the rocking ceased as though his store of nervous energy had escaped from a hole which had suddenly deflated the boy he was a slender child and if he deflated any more he would be altogether gone do i like tricks mr butler is this your subtle way of asking me if i can make a pencil fly not at all i think youll like the basement with only the lift of one slight shoulder the boy made it clear that he didnt care one way or the other charles locked the office door and they walked down the long hall toward the exit sign which led to the staircase the boy looked back over his shoulder to the elevator and charles explained that stairs were the only way to the lowest level and he hoped that justin didnt mind the walk justin trudged along at charless side walking as though his legs weighed fifty pounds each one apparently stairs were a novelty for a child raised in a luxury highrise when the door opened on to a spiral staircase of black iron justin held on to the rail and leaned far over the side he seemed hypnotized by the winding metal bright lights glared at him from bare bulbs at each floor and twisted the shadows of the curling iron awesome said justin approving the tortured shapes of light and shadow this is a great old building you havent seen anything yet charles led the way and the boy followed reluctant hesitance gone from his steps so what are we going to do down there sir you have some kind of spook meter you want me to stick my finger in no nothing that sophisticated usually i just sit around and talk to the subject sometimes we do written tests what kind of subjects do you specialize in ufos nothing that entertaining sorry in my work the subject is always a person with a unique gift i find a way to qualify it quantify it and then i find a use for it lots of people are overdeveloped in some area of intelligence take my partner mallory she has a natural gift for computers computers are only mechanical devices justins pronouncement had the peal of middleaged absolutism anyone with a manual can operate one well mallory doesnt need manuals she does things the designers never thought of you would not believe the things she accomplishes at a computer oh wait perhaps mallory was not such a good role model for a small child but your partners gift already has an application yes in most cases i find people with gifts that have no apparent application and i project the area theyll do well in then i find them a place in a research project sounds dull doesnt it but it creates a window for developers of new technology all right mr butler do you want to start without my parents oh no this excursion is just for the fun of it i was on my way down here to look for an old record album that belonged to my cousin he was a magician maximillian candle have you ever heard of him no you wouldnt have its been a very long time since he was on the stage are you interested in magic you didnt say they had reached the last floor and charles was working the lock on the door once inside he felt at the top of the fuse box for the flashlight he clicked on the beam and motioned for the boy to follow behind him they made their way through a canyon of shadowy boxes and crates old furniture and picture frames he trained the flashlight beam through a myriad of draped furniture ghosts of castaway items boxes and mazes of trunks and cartons the pleated back wall was a paneled screen which ran the length of the basement charles inserted a key into another lock and this wall began to fold back on itself a gigantic silent accordion the cavernous space beyond was dimly lit by a wide back window high up on the basement wall the bars on the window were mallorys work as were the pickproof locks installed throughout the building she would have put bars on every window if he had allowed it it had taken a long time to explain to her that he would rather be burgled than jailed in his own house now the beam of his flashlight shone on a collage of bright satin and silk gleaming through cellophane wrappers sequins and rhinestones sparkled through the dust of garment bags which hung in a wardrobe trunk a portion of the room was obscured by a large firebreathing dragon on a tall ricepaper screen a rack of sturdy shelving lined one wall with satin masks top hats a silver doveload giant playing cards ornate boxes and small trunks each containing its own magic if it was the boy who made the pencils fly this might be the outlet the world could use a little more magic ill have a light on in another minute charles touched one finger to the top of a glass globe and the orb came to life glowing with eerie pulsations as though light could breathe in and out he turned back to the boy whose attention was focused elsewhere oh thats cousin max how do you do said the boy to the severed head which perched on the wardrobe trunk justin looked from charles to the waxwork it looks like you i only wish he died when i was about your age charles removed the head from the trunk and held it in one hand it stared back at him with lifelike eyes and the expression of amazement max always wore when he lived cousin max saved my childhood for me how magic he was a wonderful magician of course the greatest magician who ever lived was malakhai he did an act with a dead woman a ghost sure mr butler i think i see her coming now no really her name was louisa she died when she was only nineteen she was one of those people i was talking about with extraordinary gifts that louisa malakhai louisas concerto apparently youve learned something at school no i try not to learn anything at the tanner school its too risky im not sure they know what theyre doing my first stepmother used to play louisas concerto did you know her louisa i mean well yes and no do you know why she named the concerto after herself was it like a selfportrait in music thats not bad justin in fact its a good theory but she had given the concerto another title it was malakhai who changed it after she died so youre familiar with the music not really i only played the album once after my stepmother died it was an old record that you played on a turntable like like like in the olden days yes its probably on disks now but what we had was the record my stepmother the crazy one who killed herself she loved that album she used to listen to it all the time did you like it i never heard it all the way through she played it when she was alone shed turn it off if anyone else was around or shed listen with the earphones she said the concerto was haunted haunting no haunted she said she could hear someone moving around in the music crazy huh anyway after she died i was playing the record and dad ripped it off the turntable and destroyed it with his bare hands when i backed out of the room he was breaking the pieces of it into smaller pieces was it the screaming both man and wife had heard in the music in that magic empty space a different effect was worked on every ear once he had heard louisa screaming another time after he had fallen into puppy love with the phantom woman he heard her laughing but all of that had taken place in the stagedark atmosphere of a magic act the air had been primed for the imagination to make whatever it would louisa died young the concerto was her only composition all that malakhai had with him when he came walking out of the end of the korean war he used it as the theme of every performance performance with a dead woman yes an invisible dead woman she handed him objects and did everything an assistant would do when she handed him a prop you watched it float from her hand to his you never saw her hand yet you believed thats how good the floating illusions were tricks wires and stuff ah but malakhai also knew how to create terror now he had justins full attention he sent louisa into the crowd members of the audience swore they felt her passing by them the brush of her dress the rush of air some recounted the scent of her perfume how did he do that what kind of gadgets did he use there were no physical devices involved by the time he sent her out among them they had come to believe in her the whole audience actually its easier with a lot of people mass hypnosis to psychosis the more the better you can do quite a lot with that much energy in the room but no one really saw her yes and no he described her in such great detail i can see her now she wore the dress she died in it was blue but for the red bloodstains how did she die no one ever knew that was part of louisas mystery some people said malakhai had killed her other rumors had her shot for a spy it was all very romantic when i was your age and younger i was in love with louisa so you were as crazy as malakhai i suppose i was and youre right malakhai had gone insane its truly amazing what people will do for love to keep it to kill it or avenge it and some people even die for it in the distraction of his compartmentalized brain charles speculated on what amanda had done cut it out of me she had said to the surgeon she who loved children she had cut out the child that was barely begun so i gather said the finished child who stood before him now that falling in love is not the bright side of growing up charles smiled the love of a child also leads to pretty strange behavior at times the things people will do for their children or to their children yes theres that too amanda why did you cut your baby away from you now he dragged his brain back to the case at hand had justin been abused was that the link mallory saw in the boy there was something between them and he had his own common cord with the boy justin riccalo did not have the conversation of a child so he too had been raised among adults and shunned by the children who would have provided him with the bad habits and speech patterns of the normal boy which charles had never been either he located the old record turntable leaned down and blew away the worst of the dust now where were the records ah there they are he pulled the crate of old record albums out from under a table sat down in the dust and began to sort through them the boy hovered over him always in motion even when he was standing still so justin when the pencils arent flying how do you get along with your stepmother i dont know her very well i had the idea that your stepmother had known your father for quite a long time i think they worked together once im not sure i think my real mother was alive then i didnt know her very well either pardon i was at school most of the time i started the usual progressive school crap when i was four my parents realized that farming me out to afterschool programs was more costeffective than a nanny and less paperwork some nights i dont get home till eight or nine oclock how did malakhai make those people believe louisa had touched them the audience did it to themselves they only had to know she was among them to complete the illusion right down to imagining the tactile sensations you think my stepmother is filling in the illusions but the pencil the pencil was not her imagination but after the trick is done the imagination takes over in malakhais act all the real magic was in louisas music charles slid the record out of its ancient cover and with the practiced handling of the audiophile from the age of dinosaurs and turntables he slipped it on to the spindle justin sat down on the backs of his heels nervous energy made it seem that he was set to spring to push off from the cement floor and into flight you can get that on cd you know so you said hush listen the volume was set too high when the music rose up in a tidal wall the large room was dwarfed by it too small to contain it charles lowered the volume to a normal setting but the concerto was undiminished louisas raw talent defying laws of physics to increase the power of her music in the lower registers of sound this was truly magic and now charles was lost again in childhood memories of louisa in the blue dress with the red stains the bloodstain turned his thoughts back to amanda bosch and the events of last night louisa and amanda became entangled in his mind out of old childhood habit his eyes closed as the music rolled over him for louisa was always created in darkness justins stepmother had described the music well it was haunted someone did move through the music and in the empty space this time she was crying before the music could swell up again on the other side of the void he opened his eyes and looked down at the boy who was doubled over justins hands were pressed to his ears what do you hear in the void justin and now charles was also frightened amanda bosch was standing over the boy she was rounded out in all three dimensions of his selfinduced delusion wearing the bloodstain on her brown blazer and the wound at the side of her head she was reaching down to the boy curled at her feet charless hand flashed out to knock the needle off the track the record made a screeching noise as the needle tore across its surface ripping the vinyl skin and ending its song amanda was gone well if it isnt the homicide dick to the rich and famous riker grinned when he saw detective palanski a beanpole in a black leather jacket and dark glasses palanski must think he was a damn movie star wearing his shades indoors the detective was sticking his pointy finger in the face of martin a uniformed officer with orders to keep everyone away from jack coffeys office well no hotshot from the west side was gonna take that from a uniform said the jabbing finger in patrolman martins face it didnt register with palanski that martin was a decade younger more athletic that he was squaring off planting his feet like a boxer not liking the finger in his face not liking it at all the young patrolman was holding his own bit of turf with a confidence lent him by jack coffey who was in the habit of backing up his people to his credit coffey had even backed mallory when she was dead wrong riker walked up to the duel of i outrank you versus i dont give a shit he tapped martin on the arm and nodded him away martin backed off to the door of coffeys office and folded his arms palanski turned on riker with the wrath of an unnaturally tall nineyearold my captain wants to know why your lieutenant is keeping this homicide case the stiff in the park you got no officer involvement you dont know that said riker pulling out a cigarette and searching from pocket to pocket for matches could palanski have gotten wind of the coventry arms angle yeah that was it now that the case was high profile he wanted it back to cover ass on the botched job at the crime scene there was no other explanation for a cop asking for more work when there was no shortage of dead bodies and open cases the stiff wasnt mallory said palanski i know that much but you didnt know it when you rolled the body riker lit his cigarette and let the barb sink in he knew it had to be palanski who leaked the premature identification to the press information was currency in new york city and he figured palanski was too ambitious and on the edge of dirty if not gone over he dressed too well for a cop supporting a wife an exwife and two kids riker only supported the bottle and he could not afford the pricey salon where palanski had his hair not cut please but styled so palanski if you thought it was mallory maybe the perp did too palanski lowered his sunglasses and leaned into rikers space youll have to do better than that riker im not buying it and wasnt it just a little strange that palanski had been the first one on the scene when amanda bosch was found a quick check of rosters had confirmed that the man was off duty that morning palanski must believe that uptown territory of wealth and fame was his own private preserve i could have mallory talk to you if you like said riker smiling amiably at this man whom he loathed no i dont no problem its her case you just tell her why you want to take it away from her listen up riker i dont well if it isnt the devil in drag here she comes now palanskis eyes did a little dance and his head snapped around to see what might be coming up behind him mallory was indeed walking toward them and growing larger in the reflection of palanskis dark glasses in place of her sheepskin jacket a long black coat whipped around her heels and riker noted she was wearing her formalwear black running shoes today what had mallory done to palanski he must ask her sometime she was still advancing on them never mind said palanski turning back to riker ill tell my captain you think its tied to one of your operations hell buy that and palanski had managed to get all of that out as mallory came abreast of them and stalked past with only a nod to riker leaving behind a suggestion of anounce perfume palanskis head swiveled after her when mallory was four steps beyond them and her back safely turned palanski made the sign of the cross to ward off evil which could not be killed by bullets mallory stopped suddenly as though this little act of heresy had been spoken aloud she turned on one heel to face the man down and palanskis finger froze at the last station of the cross riker shook his head slowly he had known mallory for so long and he knew her not at all in her kiddy days markowitz had once described her as a short witch with the eyes of a mob hit man all these years later she still had the eyes of a killer innocent men jack coffey among them had stared into those eyes and thrown up their hands in surrender assuming there must be a gun she only stared at palanski for a moment before turning around and walking on but his face paled as though she had found a way to suck the blood out of him without the necessity of sinking in her teeth riker looked down at his own spread hand and wondered if a drink might stop that tremor jack coffey sat back and counted noses mallory was her punctual self not a second before nor a second after the hour and dr john j hafner was late what have you got mallory harry kipling lied on his credit application at the bank hes trying to get credit in his own name the banks keep turning him down because he keeps lying everybody lies to banks thats penny ante what else have you got he lies on his tax returns he files as an individual and not with his wife irs nailed him for an unreported income last year and he has a growing stash of capital in a foreign bank coffey covered his face with one hand i hope were doing the background checks quietly translation you steal the information right you never talk with humans only machines right yeah real quiet he had to wonder whose computer she was accessing now had she found the back door to internal revenue he would never ask it might come in handy one day the ghost of markowitz was laughing at him as he framed this thought wasnt corruption just awfully damned easy when mallory was involved and the other suspects whatve you got now four altogether im down to maybe three my perp is tall harry kipling is sixone im afraid to ask how tall the judge is sixthree and hes in the running if you screw up with judge heart youre going to be lying under an avalanche of influence and calledin favors you know that what have you got on him he beats his wife oh great just great the presidents handpicked champion of womens rights shoot me mallory shoot me now fits well doesnt it if i may interject dr hafner the nypd psychologist and the mayors golf buddy walked into the office with no knock and no apologies for the lateness coffey glanced up at hafner who went everywhere in the same insipid smile that said i have all the answers and you dont a wife beater fits this case better than you know said hafner unbuttoning his suit jacket and pulling on the legs of his pants a prelude to sitting down without creasing his expensive suit the tailoring and material were rivaled only by mallorys long coat and blazer hafners glasses were sliding down his nose they always did that hafner was always pushing them up always picking imaginary lint from his clothing and tapping his feet and coffey was always resisting the urge to lean across the desk and swat the man each time he had to suffer one of these appointments how was he going to keep hafner from annoying mallory how to get mallory to play nice as long as the mayors close friend was in the same room the judge is a supreme court candidate said coffey smiling pleasantly i dont want him to fit you useless pompous little twit hafner adjusted his glasses you will note that amanda bosch carried no purse no wallet i dont think it was stolen from the body ive looked at the inventory of the apartment her credit cards and drivers license were lying loose in a drawer and she had no purses whatever women usually own a number of purses one for dress one for get to the point said mallory it was an order hafner pushed his glasses up and the constant smile was even more patronizing as though he thought this was an unruly child he was dealing with this lack of a purse is significant in the interpersonal dynamics of the relationship people who dont carry identification on their persons lack identities of their own a woman of low selfesteem would gravitate toward a man who was habitually abusive to women according to mrs farrow said mallory leaning in for the first shot bosch stopped carrying a purse after she was mugged three years ago the robbery report is on the record i sent it to you with all the rest of the paperwork do you read the reports we send you and there are lots of women who prefer pockets to purses coffey watched hafners eyes drop down to note that mallory did not carry a purse now hafner was scrutinizing her face evaluating mallory like a specimen his eyes were gleaming as though he had discovered a unique life form he had dr hafner said coffey in his best damagecontrol tone do you think hes likely to kill again oh definitely he may have killed many times we dont know that this is his first murder i dont think hell be able to stop himself coffey was thinking bullshit and mallorys eyes were framing stronger language go on dr hafner said coffey you idiot personal friend of the mayor or no the immaculate condition of the apartment is an example of ritualistic compulsive behavior the ultimate cleansing such compulsively neat individuals always have severe personality disorders coffey concentrated on mallory her lips parted for her this was tantamount to an emotional outburst and now he wondered what hafner would make of mallorys compulsively neat and wellordered environs the computer room was spotless and kept that way by a civilian keystroker who feared for his life if dust should settle on the computer equipment so you think our man would fit the profile of a serial killer said coffey highly probable and i would be very interested in the formative years of all the suspects hafner was staring at mallory as he said this was there trauma abuse abandonment maybe a history as a runaway coffey sat back and studied hafner the man was just too damn fascinated by mallory openly examining her face as though gauging the effect of every word on her hafner pushed his glasses up again the cleansing ritual may go hand in glove with compulsive punctuality coffey leaned forward punctuality where was that coming from perhaps hafner had seen mallorys computer room after all and more hafner could have accessed mallorys psych evaluation which had been mandatory following the discharge of a weapon in the line of duty this was not about the suspect this pumpedup twit thought he was going to play with mallory to bait her like a lab animal coffey looked to mallorys face and he could see that everywhere he had gone with this idea she had been there before him coffey sat well back in his chair and well out of the loop let the twit fend for himself whatever she did to hafner he had it coming he communicated all this to her with the slight inclination of his head sick him mallory perhaps a visual aid would be useful she said her voice assuming the soft deceptive notes of a civilized member of society coffey watched her gun slide easily from the shoulder holster and then he ceased to see it in the lacuna which was part of the cops blue wall of silence he was blind to the gun no the damn cannon not a policeissue revolver but something that made substantially bigger holes listen fool said mallory bringing her chair closer to hafners closing for the kill and not a neat kill either the gun that coffey could no longer see was in her hand this was a spontaneous act she said in even syllables the weapon was a rock you had that information she raised the gun touched the metal with one long red fingernail and the revolving chamber swung out of the armature her voice rolled on in velvet octaves which contrasted sharply with the deadly thing in her hands hafner was a study in rigidity a black fly whined past his head he seemed not to notice the glasses slid down his nose he did not correct them he didnt bring a weapon to the crime site said mallory he didnt plan to kill bosch that morning when he did kill her he panicked and ran it took him more than thirty minutes to get his nerve back you would have known that if youd read the me note on the body being moved she emptied the bullets into her lap and then inserted one bullet back into the gun and swung the chamber into place with a click the fly landed on hafners cheek he never moved to swat it he never moved at all she smiled coffey was fascinated by hafners new role as mallorys mouse the fly whined off and landed on the wall beside hafners head i figure he was more your type hafner comfortable in a controlled situation prone to panic when things got out of his control like when he used that rock she pointed the gun at the fly crawling about on the wall the barrel was aiming over the bridge of hafners nose she fired hafner jerked backward the click of the empty chamber had the effect of an exploded bomb a wet stain was spreading out from his crotch it took seconds for the man to adjust to the fact that he had not been hit and need not fall down that he had merely wet his pants the fly was gone coffey stared at the bare wall with wonder had the fly winged away or was it lying at the baseboard dead of a heart attack she dangled the gun for a moment and slowly brought it back to rest in her lap the barrel carelessly pointing toward the sweating man in the chair close to hers coffey could hear the man breathing the glasses greased with sweat slid further down hafners nose off his face and landed on the floor at his feet he didnt stalk her he knew her well said mallory thats why he came back to destroy her fingers her prints he figured it would buy him the time he needed to clean the apartment to get rid of his own prints a learning disabled twelveyearold could have worked that one out she leaned forward now holding the gun casually her arms propped on her knees her gun seemed only incidentally pointing toward the doctors crotch youre an inept jerk arent you hafner she was nodding her head slowly and he mimicked the motion nodding his own head in agreement his eyes twitched back and forth between her face and her gun and youre not going to submit a bill for this crap are you she shook her head slowly from side to side and in this way she worked hafners head in the same motion good you can go now hafner never moved or blinked thank you for coming by dr hafner said coffey in the manner of a wakeup call rising dismissing the mayors close personal friend he was averting his eyes from the dark stain on hafners trousers he was not seeing the gun which he had never seen sliding back into the holster now coffey was smiling at hafners back mallory was going to get clean away with this what were the odds that hafner would ever tell anyone she had made him pee in his pants the man was not quite out of the door when mallory was rising to her feet saying im getting my own shrink the departments paying for it with what i just saved you on that idiot sit down im not done with you yet before she could give him any grief coffey said i dont care what kind of a busy day you have planned sit she sat he had learned a lot from riker anything passing for a polite request would have been considered a sign of weakness lets start with the cap gun heller found in the trash if its tied to the perp then he might have premeditated the act its possible he used it to threaten her into a private location to kill her it was a shut up mallory you only take the bits and pieces that support your pet theory you cant know for a fact that he didnt plan to kill her the real facts are barer bones hafner doesnt know i have no use for hafner ill sign off on your own shrink but you open up to the possibility that the perp planned the kill and maybe hes killed before and what about motive she caught him out in some kind of a scam is that the story you want me to take to the district attorney she was a researcher if youve got the skills to check out the father of your baby you do it she got something on him if she could find it i can find it you dont even know that he was the father of the baby you see what youre doing no she didnt see didnt hear he was talking to the air you underestimate a perp and youre dead youre hanging out there on your own and that took guts or maybe not perhaps she was merely fearless and it was that which would get her killed the lack of a healthy sense of fear are we done no theres just one more thing be careful you dont shake out the wrong tree mallory you may have more than one of them coming after you i can see the lawsuits piling up now charles sat back in his chair and waited out the family ritual of robert riccalo admonishing the boy and the woman he didnt like riccalo the man craved a spotlight and a stage so he could strut up and down all morning and display his mind his maleness his ruthlessness and then after lunch he would want to rule the world the mans eyes were black water god only knew what was really under the surface and god had probably shuddered and looked away quickly only checking briefly to maintain his reputation for omniscience now the man was leaning close to justin denying the child any possession of personal space the boy turned to the woman no help there sally riccalo always avoided looking directly at justin and that was interesting justin this nonsense will end the man was saying booming threatening the cat was backing away to a corner of the room nose didnt like robert riccalo either charles smiled at justin and the boy seemed to take a little heart from that mallory walked in and all conversation stopped the cat trotted up to her eyes fixed on the one it clearly adored mallory cut the small animal dead with a look in tacit understanding the cat backed up a few steps to sit down and love her from a safe distance the purr was audible all over the room the purring stopped when the square wooden pencil caddie on the desk began to rock the cat was under the couch before the caddie fell over on its side a fury of color flushed robert riccalos face his hand gripped his sons arm and the boy winced with the pain not so fast said mallory walking over to the desk it was a command and riccalo seemed stunned to see his hand obey her as it released the boys arm and fell back to his lap mallory picked up the pencil caddie and righted it were accustomed to objects flying around the office arent we charles and now a pencil came flying out of the caddie and aimed at charless throat mallorys hand shot out and intercepted it charles swallowed well some of us are more accustomed to that sort of thing than others oh fine now mallory had added flying pencils to her private arsenal it happens all the time mallory was staring at the boy who only showed curiosity she walked behind charless chair and another pencil flew out of the caddie and neatly into her hand nothing to it the boy was showing no reaction any more apparently he had grown bored with airborne pencils so it is a trick said riccalo turning on the boy with a look which promised something nasty when they were alone again not necessarily said charles but you see so many things in the area of psychokinetics can be duplicated with illusion thats why its so difficult to test for a gift its going to take a while is all my partner meant by that demonstration he looked up to mallory willing her to nod and smile in agreement fat chance said her eyes he turned back to riccalo were looking for something we can test come back after christmas and well get into this in more detail when goodbyes were said a new date set and the riccalo family was through the door and gone charles turned around to find mallory standing close behind him and this was another trick of hers which unsettled him there was never any warning noise of footfalls sometimes he wondered if she just liked to see him jump outside his skin for a second or two nose trotted into the room to sit at her feet when mallory was around he could at least keep track of the cat by the purring mallory ignored the sound of the small contented engine and settled into a wingback chair with dancing queen anne legs she nodded to the couch beckoning charles to sit down with her arent you going to ask me how i made the pencil fly no let me guess all right he was smiling as he sat down every now and then i see a street vendor who still sells the wonder widow a black rubber spider on a nearly invisible nylon string when the vendor works the string it looks like the spider is crawling along by itself when a large crowd gathers he makes the spider fly to the face of a victim who invariably screams and then buys ten of them did you ever have a spider like that mallory nodded riker gave me one when i was a kid he said it was a souvenir from his last round of the dts and if i liked that one he knew where he could get a million more so you took a nylon thread from a stocking attached it to something sticky but not too sticky maybe a small bit of tape dusted with lint or talc then you attached this sticky sliver of tape to the pencil when you jerked the thread the pencil was aloft and the sliver of tape came loose so whoever picked up the pencil would find no evidence of the method you maneuvered the direction of the pencil by angling the thread around my chair right so now at least we know how its being done a kid could do it mallory youd make a terrible paranormal investigator when i accepted the case i let go of my preconceptions just because you duplicated the flying pencil that doesnt mean that was how it was done this type of investigation must be conducted by gathering facts and with no preconceived ideas about guilt or method youd make a bad cop charles while youre dicking around with empirical evidence someone is going to get hurt or dead now you see youre doing it again you develop a hunch and hang the evidence damn anyone who gets between you and your preconceived solution charles watched the cat curl up in a patch of sunlight at her feet however youre probably right about one thing theres an unhealthy dynamic in that family i have no idea which one of them is doing it well yesterday the pencil flew at the stepmother thats something it is easiest to make the pencil fly in your own direction isnt it though mallory had rather neatly sent a pencil toward his own throat i wouldnt rule out the stepmother but with two women down it seems more likely that shes the new target either that or she wants to frame the boy but for what reason what a mess what are you complaining about you started out with a set of suspects and a walking talking victim i had to work at the park murder solved it yet yeah right she said rising to a stand and placing one hand on the hip of the blue jeans the soft material of the blazer falling back from the gun when is henrietta coming before he could respond the cat stood up on its hind legs charles watched nose turn gracefully in a perfect circle and then another from mallorys expression he gathered she had seen this trick before i think youre supposed to give nose a reward when he dances he might have been trained that way the dancing is in the novel he walked over to the reception room desk pulled the thick manuscript from the center drawer and quickly thumbed through the first chapter here he taught my cat to dance seems he did that during a fourday weekend early on in the relationship you cant take a work of fiction literally of course but the cat does dance four days i thought it took longer to teach an animal tricks especially a cat not if you know what youre doing and you dont mind being ruthless with the animal i expect he withheld food from nose mallory turned her back on the cat who was dancing still well he doesnt have to do that for food any more the cat dropped softly to ground as though she had commanded him so mallory you were also right about the manuscript its a matter of weeding the truth out of the fiction listen to this when new york is covered with snow its beautiful for all the minutes before youre mugged shot in the crossfire of a drug war run down by a drunk attacked by a psychotic who has forgotten to take his medication sued by your landlord threatened by the tax collector bullied by the mouthy neighbor bitten by the pet pit bull surprised by rats running across your path with fullgrown house cats clenched in their teeth divebombed by pigeons infested with mice and roaches shorted by a payroll clerk when the baby comes i will take her away from here to a safe place where its beautiful all the time the baby is in the last few chapters of the book the female character doesnt seem to have any emotional involvement with the man the child is everything to her all she cares about mallory nodded the baby might argue for harry kipling or judge heart theyre both fertile maybe i should scratch the blind man off the list youre not serious a blind man he was blinded on the job he was working for a newspaper then huge settlement i understand your love of the money motive for this was her fathers influence at work on her markowitz had loved this motive best but the man is blind charles i always took you for the politically correct type i hope youre not suggesting that blind people are too handicapped to kill right along with the rest of us a blind man would never have returned to the crime scene hed have no way to know who might be watching suppose he panicked and did the murder and then an accomplice came back and cleaned up after him seriously no i dont think a blind man did this youre an expert on gifts tell me about the gifts that come out when a man loses his sight oh thats a myth said charles the blind do not have more acute senses of smell and hearing if thats what you mean they merely have fewer distractions without the sense of sight and theres more dependence on the other senses so they tend to pay more attention to them does he have a seeing eye dog yes everyone in that building has a dog it is true that blind people are less likely to walk into plateglass walls the cane or the dog prevents that a good dog will also watch traffic and lead the blind away from obstacles the dog is the truly gifted partner in the relationship what about a really good adaption to blindness well some people do make an art form out of it they look directly at you when you speak to them trying to create the illusion of being sighted eric franz doesnt do that but he does come across as the bastard child of sherlock holmes and mrs ortega with his acute senses bullshit and he can find his way across a crowded room without touching anyone with his cane interesting i think so so im keeping him now ive got a blind man a wife beater and a beautyandthebeast combo charles stared at his hands he had his own beautyandthebeast problems he looked up to the antique mirror by the couch no his own story would be beauty and the clown her reflection moved behind his own that incredible face did not belong in the same gilded frame with his own ridiculous ensemble of features and if he didnt get to the barber soon his longish wavy hair might take on the character of a clowns fright wig he turned to face her and waved one hand toward the door near her chair would you mind opening the door for henrietta and only now the buzzer sounded mallory stared at him one day you must tell me how you do that when henriettas working shes nearly as punctual as you are shes joining us for lunch mallory opened the door to the psychiatrist from apartment a today henrietta was dressed in her work clothes a neat tailored suit and soft pastel blouse charles left them to the business of the park murder and wandered into the kitchen the cat followed him knowing this was the place from whence all food flowed mallory had stocked the office refrigerator anew with all the makings of sandwiches he pulled out a tray neatly prepared with every imaginable condiment cheese and meat henrietta walked into the kitchen as he was bending down to feed the cat a piece of pastrami in the last twentyfour hours he had learned a lot about the cats likes and dislikes hey nose how are you asked henrietta charles looked up the cat did not ten minutes later charles and henrietta were seated at the kitchen table drinking coffee to the music of purring which originated at mallorys feet mallory stood at the chopping block on the counter slicing cheese she looked down at the cat and seemed to be weighing the knife in her hand against the cats potential value charles turned to henrietta and asked can you explain why the cat is so attached to mallory nose wont dance for me and im the one whos been feeding him does the novel tell you how the cat was trained no i just assumed it was food nose may have been trained with pain and it could also be tied to visual cues what happened to the cats ear i didnt do it said mallory setting a plate of four varieties of cheese on the table alongside the rest of the sandwich makings it happened when nose was loose on the street the vet said the cat was otherwise well cared for charles nodded if the female character in the novel is amanda bosch i dont see her allowing the cat to be tortured her lover trained the cat to dance in four days said mallory if we can believe the novel said charles to his immediate regret mallory didnt like that he could feel the tension crawling toward him from her side of the table he filled henriettas coffee cup the novel was started over a year ago signs of abuse might be gone by now then most likely the cat dances to avoid pain henrietta was loading her sandwich with pastrami its like child abuse the child may cling to the abusive parent thats why i wondered about the cats ear mallory bears a general resemblance to the victim shes probably triggering a memory charles took a string of beef from his own sandwich and dropped it into noses open mouth but surely the cat knows its owner from mallory the cat returned to its steady occupation of shedding fur on mallorys jeans animals can respond strongly to visual cues said henrietta i got my own cat from an animal shelter i was walking by the cage and the cat went berserk paws reaching through the wire crying nonstop they told me the cat did that every time a woman with long dark hair walked by so i went there for a dog and came home with a cat it was instant love same as with mallory and nose what else is in the novel mallory asked pushing the cat away from her with one leg love apparently always being onesided with her nothing that would isolate one of your three suspects said charles he doesnt particularly like women though he likes to make love to them i dont suppose that helps much i have no idea what the lie might have been theres no clue in the manuscript all three of the suspects could fit the profile of liars said mallory and theyve all got something at stake judge heart has a career to consider other nominations have failed because of reefers and illegal nannies if she dug up something in his background it wouldnt have to be much to cost him the appointment harry kipling has a rich wife and a brutal prenuptial agreement eric franz was with his wife the night she was killed in the traffic accident he might have had something to do with that so what have we got asked charles a novel we cant use in court and no physical evidence there was nothing else turned up at the park site hellers the best if he cant find another forensic detail no one can well theres the cat said charles but unless you think we can train nose to bite the suspect on the leg in open court the cat is worthless no it isnt mallory was staring down at the animal with an expression that gave her nothing in common with animal lovers i can use the cat and the book to flush him out the tricky part is where i get him to incriminate himself any confrontation with this man is dangerous to you said henrietta if your theory is correct hes demonstrated his willingness to kill in order to protect himself mallory seemed unimpressed so the perp im dealing with doesnt have the nerve of the average psycho it was a oneshot crime to cover another crime all fear and panic you cant know that said henrietta it doesnt matter that the murder wasnt premeditated he may have killed her a thousand times in his fantasies he may be someone who knows her only as a service person a maintenance man and you cant tell a sociopath from his appearance or public behavior this man may very well have a dangerous pathology and still pass for a normal member of the community a sociopath cant pass for normal not with everyone well yes he can henrietta said with rare insistence no said mallory with finality he cant charles watched the sudden shock of understanding come into henriettas eyes as she realized she was talking to someone with an inside view so now that weve established what he isnt said mallory how much weight can i put on a lie as motivation if i went into the lives of all the tenants in that building i could dig up something on every one of them what kind of lie pushes that kind of button he panicked once i want to make him do it again it would depend on the lie said henrietta a persons entire life can be structured on lies what kind of buttons should i push how do i scare him into talking fear might make him close up better to get him angry a disclosure in anger is worth more if we can assume he taught the cat to dance we might consider control issues here its the fount of the hatred of women and the most violent crimes against them in that case getting caught in any lie might have set him off which would you say was most prone to lying as a pathology everybody lies said mallory surely not everyone said charles no charles you dont but then you cant lie can you you dont have the face for it wait i take that back theres the vase you rigged thats a lie by omission isnt it its a common test situation and a lie by omission ill bet helen never lied well helen only lied out of kindness but she was kind to a lot of people markowitz never lied oh sure he did he lied like crazy the old man was the best ive heard him lie to the mayor the commissioner he lied every time he held a press conference he lied all right everybody lies as she carried the cat down the sidewalk between the garage and the coventry arms she caught sight of the doorman reading the newspaper a cab pulled up and arthur quickly removed his glasses tucking them into the fold of the paper which lay on the shelf beneath the house phone arthur was smiling and opening the door of the cab when mallory slipped through the door as she passed by that shelf she flipped back the fold of the paper bifocals an ugly little man who was too vain to wear his glasses in front of the tenants interesting she walked over to the wide lobby window which overlooked the sidewalk another tenant was walking toward the building as moss white the talk show host came abreast of the bench twelve feet before the door to the building arthur put on his wide smile well at least the mans field of vision included the bench where amanda had been sitting the day before she died thoughts of amanda bosch rode up in the elevator with mallory what had the woman seen that day what had upset her and made her run off and how much value could she put on arthurs testimony if she needed him in court she and arthur must have another little chat and soon when she walked in the door of the rosens apartment she had the feeling that there was someone else close by nose felt it too the cat in her arms ceased to purr it was kneading its clawless paws into her coat looking everywhere something in the bedroom was being moved now she heard the sound of the vacuum she walked into the room to see the cleaning woman who must be the rosens sarah oh hello miss the woman switched off the vacuum and now mallory heard the sound of the flushing toilet in the bathroom the door opened and justin riccalo was standing on the threshold and looking up at her he began a small smile it died off as mallory turned her back on him to face the cleaning woman i hope its all right miss said sarah he was standing out in the hall waiting for you he needed to use the bathroom it is all right isnt it sure now she looked at the boy again lately he was always in her mind on some level she felt a tie to him without being able to name it as though they had been through something together it nagged at her this feeling which occurred each time they met a bizarre and twisted notion approaching dèjá vu she knew where he had been for she had been there before him well im done in this room said sarah coiling the cord around her vacuum cleaner mallory and the boy continued to stare at one another in silence until the cleaning woman had shown herself out of the bedroom how did you get past the doorman justin i walked in behind a man and a woman i guess the doorman thought i belonged to them how did you know i lived here i looked it up in the phone book no said the slow shake of her head that could not be the vacuum cleaner began to drone and toil across the carpet of the front room okay i was with my stepmother when she followed you the other day so that was you she had felt him but not seen him the stepmother had not explained the watcher who had occupied the space on the opposite sidewalk a space which had been empty by the time she had turned round i gave the elevator man your name and he took me to this floor i ran into the cleaning woman in the hall she was just going into your apartment i told her you were expecting me now he seemed to be waiting for praise she let him wait he jammed his hands into his down parka and rocked on the balls of his feet as he looked around the bedroom with its frilly fourposter canopy bed the chintz and the bricabrac its not what i expected of you all his confidence ebbed away in the ensuing silence mallory was listening to the hum of sarahs vacuum cleaner mrs ortega always cleaned one room at a time and the front room already had the furniture polish and ammonia smell of a finished job the boy opened his mouth to speak mallory moved one finger up to silence him he closed his mouth and turned to the sound of the vacuum in the next room when the vacuum stopped and the front door finally closed on the departing sarah he said ive got to talk to someone but no one will listen to me ill listen if youre straight with me has your stepmother missed any nylon stockings recently how did you know did she accuse you of taking it not yet i found a mangled stocking wadded up in my dresser this morning i didnt take it and i dont know how it got there what was the connection she felt to the boy something old half a memory he was a liar that might be part of it when youre ready to tell me the truth about whats going on ill help you you think im making the pencils fly you and everyone else why what do you really know about me nothing only what my father tells you oh i know a lot about you justin i know youre smart enough to figure out how the tricks are done but you wont tell will you either you do the tricks yourself or youre afraid of your father or both or maybe your stepmother is doing it maybe you keep quiet about it because you like the idea of driving your old man straight up a wall she looked at his clothes and his unmarred pink face his unskinned knees his running shoes were not new but they werent dirty either youre a loner you have no friends no sports to play he stood very straight shoulders pinned back you attended a military school good guess his head was nodding and youre holding out on me if these stunts with the flying objects are your doing im gonna find you out you got that what reason would i have to do it you dont know everything you dont know that all my mothers money was left to you in trust and your father controls the trust he controls me too so youre ratting out your father is that it you know if id been in your place i would have targeted your old man that bastard wouldnt have lasted six seconds with me he is a bastard i really worry about my stepmother mallory only stared at him in silence to tell him she knew he was lying again okay said the boy shes a dweeb what was your real mother like she was like my second mother and my second mother was like my third she was afraid of everyone and everything my father has a type each one is a copy of the last one was your real mother afraid of you too the boys hands dove deeper into the pockets of his parka she watched the frustration welling up in his eyes and it was in the hunch of his shoulders and the rabbit teeth pressed down on his lower lip frustration growing and growing finally culminating and escaping in a sigh the cat padded into the room it started toward her she looked at it once to warn it away nose stopped a respectful distance from her and sat down beside the boy now two pairs of eyes were on her both needy dont let the cat out when you go she said and turned her back on both of them leaving the bedroom to walk down the short hallway to the den where her computer was waiting too bad the cameras hadnt been running maybe she should run a continuous tape against the possibility of another intrusion when she was not home the front door closed softly charles let me fix you a drink no really have one with me effrim wilde opened the dark glass doors of a chrometrimmed cabinet to gleaming glassware and a fully stocked wet bar eleanors forbidden me to drink alone she says it leads to alcoholism he turned his back on charles as though the recipe for whiskey and soda might be worth guarding eleanor came back yes said effrim rimming each glass with a twist of lemon and a loving smile she felt guilty about abandoning me to my cigarettes and whiskey and good food shes a saint that woman this past weekend i didnt have a single meal that didnt taste like lowcal library paste he handed one glass to charles and carried the other to his own chair which put three yards of plush carpet and four feet of dark glass desktop between them the office had been recently redecorated the walls were a sickly yellowgreen how did effrim stand it of course he only spent a few hours of the day in this place the rest of the time was spent in threehour lunch seductions of grant committee chairmen and other sources of funding the lines of the furniture were sharp every surface was cold metal and glass the four wall hangings all done by the same brutal hand were abstracts of angry red shapes and a nervous manic energy of black lines not effrims style this private office said more about eleanor than effrim does eleanor know youre dabbling in bad magic acts so you pegged the boy for a fraud effrim feigned surprise but not well i hope the experience hasnt been entirely worthless its not entirely done with i need some data from the research group ask my assistant hell get you whatever you need i suppose youre shopping for a little something in the line of flying objects you were right about the russian data and the chinese their methodology is a bit lax isnt it i want the chinese data on the succubus experiments is the boy branching out no but hes led me along another line of investigation i thought you were put off by the bizarre stuff anything in particular charless memory called up a page from a journal and displayed it on the wall by effrims head he scanned the lines theres an experiment with an asian monk who created a succubus under lab conditions i want that one his profile fits the stigmatic the succubus in front of witnesses was seen to bruise the mans flesh come back to work for me and ill get you all the cuckoo material you like you still get the lions share of funding from sources like riccalos employers in addition to sitting on grant committees mallory tells me his other duties include real estate scams which bilk the elderly ah but no arrests indictments or convictions by new york standards this makes him a model citizen oh charles we just never seem to agree on the institutes funding do we im stealing money from the bastards company i should get a community service medal but i can be flexible come back to work for us and ill track down alternate funding thanks i think ill just take the succubus material and run youre losing your mind out there among the tiny brains but id be willing to trade any four good brains at the institute for whats left of yours come home charles come back inside where you belong ill triple your project funding i dont think so its cold out there charles by out there effrim included all of real life beyond the isolation of the think tank charles surmised that effrim had daily anticipated his prize freak would return home beaten by the ordeal of making his way among people who found him eccentric and out of sync with the rest of them which he was will we be able to give a good report to the boys father the boys father could very well be orchestrating this i dont trust riccalo and i have my doubts about you too an hour later charles was seated in his own front room and closing the file of succubus material so it was true there was a link to the stigmata phenomenon exhibited by fanatics the mental aberration of the succubus could work its effects on the body as well as the mind in the darkening room a memory from his childhood came back to him in striking detail which included the succulent brown flesh of a roasted fowl it was a goose and it held a prominent position on the white lace tablecloth spread with fine china gleaming silver and candlelight malakhai was seated at the dinner table beside the empty chair which beloneed to louisa the adults had been drinking wine and laughing with one another accompanied by a lively recording of mozart the small child he had been was staring at malakhai in the moment when louisa kissed him he had seen the imprint of her lips on the mans face charles had rubbed his eyes with small hands but not rubbed away the kiss which made the depression the contour of her lips in malakhais flesh well amanda bosch had created no physical phenomena yet she was merely an image like a holograph so he had a way to go before he became truly damaged amanda was not solid stuff and he was not yet mad hed only made a clever moving picture an odd extension of his eidetic memory right the red light was flashing on the system alert box so the judge was using his fax the rewiring diverted the fax to her own machine it was an application form for a new bank card she scanned it into her computer and reset the type with a few alterations after the lines for name and address she typed in her own questions then she copied the letter for harry kipling who also had a fax machine now that she was getting to know them she could tailor the terror to fit the man what should she do to the blind man according to the building super his computer was rigged for a braille printer but did he use it she typed his message into the personal files im right behind you can you hear me can you see me can you see the purring at her feet annoyed her she looked down at the cat her eyes matching threats with the cats contented slits and now a crash came from the kitchen she felt for her gun and the cats nose went up as it tested the air for what it could not see gun drawn mallory walked into the kitchen and found the floor near the table littered with shatters and sparkles of glass and water she checked every closet and room and then returned to the kitchen she felt along every wet inch of the table top searching for any small object which might do the job of the wooden match charles had used to prime the vase in his office there was nothing well the boy was smart but not supernatural so the glass had simply fallen the unbeliever knelt down to the tiles with a dustpan and swept up the glass and then mopped the floor and carefully wrapped the shards of the glass in plastic a barrage of soft thuds came from the next room when she walked in the cats body was arched ears flattened eyes round it had knocked the bowl of fruit on to the carpet an apple was rolling toward nose and the cat was backing up on tender feet as though the carpet might be on fire mallory snapped her fingers at the cat to get its attention the cat ran the length of the room and leapt into her arms another trick she put the cat down again and snapped her fingers once more and the cat was in her arms what else can you do she dropped the cat and crawled along the carpet picking up the fallen fruit the cat stayed beside her loving up against her mewling for some small attention anything at all mallory poured the wax fruit back into the bowl nose licked her hand and she drew it back now she scanned the carpet and its recent proliferation of white cat hairs houseproud helen markowitz would never have allowed an animal in the house yet she had fed every stray that came through the yard and for ten days of winter a mongrel had lived in their garage lapping up leftovers and licking helens hand and adoring her with its great brown eyes helen had shown young kathy each scar of abuse on the animals pelt you can learn a lot about people from their animals said helen she had learned so much about the mongrels owner that she made no attempt to find him helen lost the tag on the dog collar and found another home for the animal with a family on the next block its not the dog who is lost helen had said the one who abused this animal is lost helen had never used the words of kathy and markowitzs shared vocabulary dirtball scumbag scumsucker the bastard who had split the dogs pelt with kicks and broken its ribs he was only lost to helen everyone has a dark side helen told her when the dark kills off all the light of the soul this is a lost person small kathy had figured naw hes a scumbag and she knew the dogs former owner deserved a few kicks to his own ribs her young sense of justice was very dark and it had an elegant simplicity that was not much changed over the years but for helens sake she had tried to behave as though the light shone for her too mallory reached out one hand and gently stroked the cats head helen wouldve liked that the cat closed its eyes in contentment duty done she quickly withdrew her hand wiped it on the leg of her jeans and left the cat sitting in the middle of the living room its eyes wide open now and looking everywhere for the vanished mallory the amanda bosch file had an honored place in the top layer of the mess on rikers desk he was rumbling through the contents of a lower drawer fingers grasping what he thought were recent park site photos but he had gone down too far in his haphazard method of filing and now he held the snapshots he had taken at kathys graduation from the police academy there was helen markowitz smiling broadly not realizing the cancer in her body was already planning to cut her life short in one more year markowitz had never really recovered from the loss if not for kathy he might have followed helen years sooner it had always angered riker to think back on helens death and how quietly she had gone to it sedated unprotesting the hospital gurney wheels had whispered markowitzs wife into that sterile operating room and only the body had come wheeling back to them she had slipped under the surgeons knife and slipped away there should have been more noise to mark the event in low tones the doctor had told markowitz and kathy how sorry he was unspoken were the words the shows over and so markowitz and kathy had sat together on a cheap plastic couch in the terrible silence of that waiting room two unimportant people in the aftermath of an event which had not been properly called to an end it was a play which tapered off to a mumble and had no curtain to tell the audience it was time to go home riker understood what kathy meant when she had turned to him then and said this is a ripoff it was now someone was standing before rikers desk not wanting to interrupt a thought only politely waiting with just the minimum of shuffling noise to announce himself riker only knew one person who was that polite it was no surprise to look up into the smiling face of charles butler and this was another reminder of an old friend markowitzs smile had no such loony aspect but as with charles one tended to smile back regardless of grim thoughts and small heartaches pull up a chair charles you waiting around for mallory no jack coffey invited me in for a little chat about amanda bosch he probably thinks mallorys holding out on him she probably is but then to be fair coffey holds out on mallory and i hold out on both of them were a very dysfunctional family we three you didnt rat her out did you of course not so mallory was holding out what can i do for you charles coffey tells me it was your idea to give this case to mallory may i ask why because of amanda bosch when a kid dies young like that one there ought to be some fanfare you know sicking mallory on the perp was the worst thing i could think of doing to him but its dangerous if shes right about him she only has to flush him out if shes wrong she may have to shoot him youre not worried about her no he lied because he really liked charles but the way shes going about it she might as well we cant put anybody in jail without evidence sometimes we know who did it and we cant touch him people do get away with murder i wont tell you how often but it happens now im betting this bastard doesnt get away from mallory ive got a hundred bucks riding on the kid but shes hanging out there like a target she is a target shes a cop and she wont give it up either if youre thinking shed be safer with you in civilian life just get rid of that fairy tale this job gives her a rush now shes got a lock on this case and shes flying and what can you offer her charles nothing i know that charles stared at his shoes for a moment but youre looking for court supportable evidence against this man her methods arent strictly within the law are they i know shell break rules to get him and this is what ive come to im following markowitz down the slow path of corruption im copping to it okay you can have me arrested for it suppose she gets caught breaking the rules what about her career then charles you must know how markowitz used her i know the old man liked you and he trusted you but i dont think he shared much of the department dirt if we did everything by the book the results would look pretty poor mallory could get things for him impossible things he never asked how many laws she broke in a day what she got by illegal means wasnt evidence nothing admissible in court but it was stuff markowitz could use to finesse a perp into a nervous breakdown mallory knows things about this killer she has undertheskin intimate knowledge when shes done with him hell think she was there in his pocket when amanda bosch went down mallory will get him im counting on it she is a thing to behold shes a breakable human being like the rest of us charles weve all fallen into that trap shes so young isnt she just a kid of course you want to protect her that perfect unlined face eyes like an angel charles was still nodding in agreement as riker leaned forward and shook his arm to call him back to the real world the scary one that mallory inhabited riker raised his voice to say shes got the coldest eyes ive ever seen she gives normal people the shakes even if they dont drink as much as i do she packs a monster gun and you dont shes a great shot and you probably couldnt load a gun without an owners manual now riker leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on the desk as he watched charles trying to make logic work in tandem with the blind psychosis of having fallen in love with kathy mallory hed had occasion to wonder if mallory understood how charles felt about her he was inclined to think she knew it and used it in a softer voice he said im glad you stopped by charles i hope this little talk has put things into perspective as charles pulled up in front of robin duffys house he nearly put the car up on the curb so startled was he by the lights of the menorah and the christmas tree in the house across the street the former occupants of that house louis and helen markowitz were dead robin his host for the evening was standing in the warm light of an open doorway charles crunched new snow as he crossed the narrow band of earth which lined the recently shoveled sidewalk he hurried up the flagstone path to the door and his hand was grabbed in a warm handshake robin had been louiss neighbor for more than twenty years done with hellos charles turned round for a last look at the house of bright holiday lights robin grinned lifelike isnt it together they walked into the warmth of robins house and the smell of pine needles warring with floral air freshener i cant get kathy to sell the place robin was saying as dr edward slope stood up from the card table to clap charles on the back kathys the only upper west sider with a summer home in brooklyn said edward i think she enjoys being perverse but its not like she ever uses the place said robin she never comes by any more so i try to make it look like someone lives there lou put up a christmas tree every year since kathy came to live with them it didnt seem right with no christmas tree a hanukkah bush rabbi david kaplan corrected him as he entered the room from the kitchen carrying a tray of sandwich makings louis swore to me it was a hanukkah bush it does make the house look like a family lives there said charles staring out the wide window of the front room i trimmed the tree with the original ornaments from that first christmas said robin and the ornaments kathy stole from the department store asked edward slope as he cut the deck of cards well said robin who had been louis markowitzs attorney as well as a friend helen went back and paid for those so technically never mind said edward pull up your chairs gentlemen robin tell him what else you did to the place the four were seated around the card table picking up the dealt cards and swapping mustard for mayonnaise passing around meats and pickles slices of white bread and slices of rye the caps of beer bottles were pinging off the table top as robin delivered a lecture on the technical intricacies of electronic lighting devices i bought timer lights for the lamps in all the rooms he said as he threw down one card in hopes of drawing a better one the lights go off and on automatically at different times i rigged the kitchen light to go off at thats when helen usually finished cleaning up robins really into this said the medical examiner dealing out robins card and two for the rabbi the harvard law school graduate finally found a set of timer lights with directions he could understand my favorite is the light that goes on in louiss den after the evening news is over its that window under the gable said robin pointing his beer bottle toward the picture window of his living room to indicate the dark gable of the house beyond the glass now he picked up his new card and fit it into his hand charles had no way to know if robin had bettered his hand any the mans face gave away nothing yet everyone seemed to know what was in his own hand edward laughed out loud when he raised the ante on a bluff folding his cards in humiliation charles stared out the window at the row of blinking colored lights which trimmed the porch roof of louis markowitzs house you know for a moment i thought mallory had done it the lights you mean as a gesture of sentiment edward was studying charless face over the tops of his cards perhaps checking for signs of a fever charles nodded and edward looked to the ceiling charles im telling you this as a friend youve got to let go of this strange idea of the gunslinger with a heart of gold im a doctor you can trust me on this one she has no detectable heartbeat she loved helen rabbi kaplan perused his cards and his sweet smile dissolved into the mask of the veteran poker player okay you got me there she even loved louis in her bizarre way edward folded his cards this speaks well for a heart said the rabbi laying down his cards next to robins splayed hand and simultaneously raking in the first pot of the evening robin the electric menorah in the window was a nice touch robin was dealing the next round of cards as charles was asking was she raised in both religions kathy has no religion said edward as he gathered up his cards we think she works for the opposition the way you talk about her said the rabbi shes not a criminal the hell she isnt edward slammed his cards down on the table now she thinks im going to steal for her she wanted me to raid my investigators personal notes and give them to charles too many leaks in the department she says you know shes just bypassing jack coffey coffey should be grateful she works around him said robin if he learned anything from markowitz hed never want to know what she was doing youre doing him a favor edward pulled a fold of papers out of his back pocket and pushed the wad across the table to charles these are the investigators notes no police request would have turned them up if an investigator gives his notes to a case detective he can wind up spending a few days in court defending things that were just idle thoughts and speculations its a bit like reading a diary charles was looking down on a straight flush the other players followed edwards suit and folded how did they always know the four quarters in the pot might represent his only win of the evening did you find anything interesting not really she wanted a report on the death of judge hearts mother i told her we dont send me investigators for a natural death if a doctors in attendance she said look again turns out we did send a man out but it was the mistake of an inexperienced dispatcher i also found er hospital records for injuries to the old woman two broken bones were set in a oneyear period old bones break easily theres nothing solid there tell her im not going to move for an exhumation on judge hearts mother until she gets real evidence of foul play you tell her that charles robin duffy put an envelope on the table by charless hand thats the dirt on eric franz its a transcript of the court session for the traffic accident that killed his wife the franzes were having an argument at the time of the crash but according to witnesses he didnt help her into the path of the car if thats mallorys angle he was at least three feet away from her throughout the argument and right up to the moment the car got her i would have thought shed be more interested in the accident that blinded franz said charles she was said the doctor eric franz was blinded in an accident three years ago the settlement was in seven figures there was no apparent restoration of sight immediately following the corrective surgery and he changed doctors before the next exam was scheduled i have no idea who the new doctor was his records were never forwarded is it possible that his sight was restored at some later date the surgeon gave an possibility but it wasnt in eric franzs favor there wouldnt be much point in faking it said robin he was definitely blind when the court awarded the settlement even if the surgery had restored his sight he wouldve kept the court award and his wifes life insurance benefit was donated to charity id say the guy is squeaky clean i dont know where kathy thinks shes going with this one so charles said edward do you know why kathy didnt drop by to pick up her own dirt she said she couldnt come tonight because she was barred from the poker game edward smiled is that the story she gave you shes not here tonight because she wants to be legally one person removed from these records smart kid said robin with some amount of paternal pride she learned that trick from markowitz no time lost with warrants no paper trail for opposing counsel to follow but she was barred from the poker game wasnt she the other three players stared down at their cards there were no volunteers why was she barred from the game robin raised his head im still holding a grudge from her kiddy days markowitz used to bring her along if helen was going out for the evening the kid used to win so big markowitz had to buy her a little red wagon to carry home all the loot the rabbi turned to charles her biggest win was thirty dollars in a pennyante game the legend grows charles shuffled the deck and dealt the first card to rabbi kaplan what was the real reason rabbi charles such suspicions the second card was dealt to the doctor i knew mallory would be a bad influence on him and the third to the lawyer she cant play its not fair the little brat was born with a poker face charles sat in polite silence holding on to the rest of the cards and waiting on a better answer okay said robin kathy was attending a private school a girls school with young ladies who had never played poker kathy taught them the game charles dealt out the second round of cards she was bringing home three bills a week when helen and lou were called in for a little chat with the principal said edward and now all the cards were in play we thought it was great robin rearranged his hand the kid was champion poker material and we took a lot of pride in that but it upset helen and worse said the rabbi hardly looking at his cards edward folded his hand and pushed the cards to one side of the table lou didnt want kathy thrown out of school so he took the fall for her he told the principal it was a bad joke that had gotten out of hand and kathy couldnt be expected to understand that what she was doing was wrong after hed put the idea in her head louis was a gifted liar said robin he was so good that helen bought the lie it was the only rift between helen and lou ever kathy knew it was her fault but she didnt understand why and you know it was a semihonest racket it wasnt like she marked the cards or anything she was just light years ahead of every child she fleeced said edward you never knew helen you dont understand how it was between her and lou they held hands under the dinner table they sat up and talked until two in the morning so suddenly said the rabbi theres silence in the house helen believes that louis has damaged kathy louis was devastated but he went on taking the blame for kathys racketeering kathy felt the rift between them the terrible silence she came so close to understanding the difference between right and wrong but then it slipped away from her said edward but she wouldnt play poker again said the rabbi kathy barred herself from the game it was her version of penance you credit her too much shes a heartless little monster she corrupts every edward was interrupted by the loud jangle of the telephone robin answered it and handed the receiver to edward when the doctor put down the phone he turned to charles my wife says kathy left a message on our answering machine shell pick up the folder herself kathys coming here yes when eightthirty its five past that now said charles odd shes never late by even one minute oh god the lights said robin kathy doesnt know about the lights and she was never never late they turned in concert to the window mallorys small tan car was parked at the curb it was edward slope her greatest detractor who flew out the door without his coat to fetch her he was down the flagstone path before the others could rise from the table now three men congregated in the open doorway unmindful of the chill night air charles stared at the back of the man running across the street later it would hurt him to remember this small event with such great clarity but there was a crystalline quality to a cold winter night even from the distance of a roads width no detail was lost to him not the line of her cheek nor the lamplight on her hair nor the terrible stillness the eerie quiet only broken by the footfalls of the doctor there was mallory alone on a small field of new snow but for the frost of her breath on the air she was a statue in blue jeans standing in the yard of the old house across the street she was staring in the window at the christmas tree and the menorah and now her face turned upward as a window came to life on the second floor where louiss den was slope came up behind her and put his hands on her shoulders his voice was low near a whisper she never moved nor spoke to him but only stared at the secondfloor window so entranced was she by the light an expartner was like an exwife even if the partner had been a man which peggy was not most definitely not he missed her sorely since her early retirement via a bullet in the lung he missed her though he saw her at least once a week as though a night in the bar were a sacrament rikers eyes were on peggy as she left him to run her white rag over the wet ring on the mahogany and pocket the change left by the last customer age had hardly touched her but only because she fought it off her hair was dyed a honey blonde to cover the gray and her figure was only a little fuller at the hip and thigh in the dim light and from the distance of the other end of the bar she had changed not at all oh all those years ago when she was young and he was younger when he was still sober most of the day when peggy packed a gun and a shield now that was a time the matron draped on the stool next to his might be the only civilian in the bar tonight the woman had that soft look and she was staring at him with the disapproving eye of a taxpayer even in peripheral vision the civilian was annoying him with her waving arms the woman was making a damn point of waving the smoke away from her and she had to reach into rikers own personal piece of the bar to do that did you know that secondhand smoke kills nonsmokers good said riker the woman picked up her purse and moved to the other end of the bar and peggy came back to him with a broad smile and a fresh beer so where were we riker the early warning signs right the early warning is in the money area that would be a natural for mallory have her check the credit card accounts for favourite bars and restaurants a gym membership is a good giveaway they like to keep in shape for the new one is the guy buying his own underwear something with a little flash thats another one if theres so many signals how come the wives dont catch on they do the husbands arent too quick to spot a cheating wife but the wives always know what the husbands are doing even when they come in here and tell me that for years they had no idea they knew what was going on they knew from the beginning its the blind spot that wont let them acknowledge it that damn blind spot theyre staring straight at it they can describe everything around it but they dont see it ah peggy i cant buy they rationalize it away the amount of rationalization these women do is in direct proportion to what theyve got to lose with no kids and no mortgage a woman can be pretty cynical about a cheating husband with eight kids she will sit down with the man and help him work out the lies she can believe in riker pulled out his notebook a silver ornament on a chain was entangled in the spiral it freed itself and dropped to the bar peggy picked it up so whats with the star of david youre an episcopalian no im not im an alcoholic ah riker youre dreaming those socialclimbing dreams again if you want to be an alcoholic you have to go to meetings she handed him the sixpointed star okay im a drunk with aspirations he stared at the star in his hand lou markowitz used to carry this around with him mallory thought i might like to have it you sentimental slob thats what mallory calls me but she doesnt think im sentimental his pen hovered over the notebook okay markers for the runaround husband suppose hes not a regular cheat suppose its a firsttime fling hell start changing his habits maybe he walks the dog without being asked four times or he takes up a new sport for two like tennis look for outoftown trips that dont match up with his job description late hours at the office as a change in routine is he a good liar oh they all think theyre great liars but the wives have probably caught them in more lies than they can remember its a pity you cant just ask the wives and a pity that most of them wouldnt tell you in rikers notebook it said only dogwalking so riker you think mallorys right about the perp he panicked and ran i think she underestimates him she thinks the guy is a wimp whod run if a mouse screamed he liked it when they screamed but he loved it when they howled bitches all women were bitches did she think he would not recognize her as an enemy how transparent and stupid she was he stood in the shower and let his hatred of her wash over him with the water she was the enemy he stepped from the shower and water pooled at his feet as he rubbed a clear place on the glass he stared at the mirror until his eyes seemed to float independent of his flesh what intelligence lay therein what quickness of thought thoughts running to the color red but that insect in the background of his reflection crawling on the tiles it marred his serenity better step on it quick he did and each time he did this his enemy screamed and died he beat her face in as he beat his pillow and then wondered why he could not sleep when sleep did come his dreams were all of death angry death now the cancer of hatred was all waking and sleeping he was complete and invincible mere humans had never proved a match for cancer there was no cure with one long red fingernail mallory tapped the wad of papers which had traveled from edward slopes hand to charles and thence to her she stared into the troubled face of a young investigator from the medical examiners office the man would not meet her eyes his hands were worming around his coffee cup which had grown cold a waitress was standing near them mallory waved her away slope doesnt figure youre dirty but i do i know how much you have in your bank i know every transaction in your stock portfolio and i know your salary your old man never ratted on anybody no he didnt he just transferred them to hell most of them quit they decided theyd rather live than do hard time in death precincts i know that because i did the computer work for him and what i did to them i can do to you and more i can send you to a worse hell than early retirement on a partial pension ease up kathy a memory of markowitz cautioned her if you scare them too much on tke first goround they go for a lawyer you dont want that she sat back in her chair i just wanted to give you a little something to think about over the holidays give you a little time to go over your notes on the coventry arms visit merry christmas ill get back to you real soon nice touch kid said the memory of markowitz which would not go to that part of the mind reserved for the dead pansy heart lay in her bed watching him rise and walk back into the bathroom she was imagining for a few moments of quiet horror that her husband crawled along on eight legs she was quiet for all the bathroom noises and the sheet rustling and the click of the bedside light switch she sighed in the dark and wondered if he heard and then she felt she could breathe again breathe but not sleep not till she heard his own regular breathing and knew he would not wake until morning and even so she lay awake until the exhaustion of fear overtook her in the dark angel kipling looked up as harry walked into the kitchen his face was still dazed from sleep he hovered in the doorway as though debating whether this was safe ground or battle ground between coming and going she nailed him with the first shot so what have you done now harry nothing said harry kipling opening the refrigerator and pulling out the leftover chicken from dinner she stared into his smiling face and she wanted to hit him with a closed fist pansy woke with a blow to her head it was not a sharp blow but glancing in the dim light of the bedroom she saw the fist flying in the air and her hand moved out to fend it off it fell back to emerys side she turned on the bedside lamp and the pearls of night sweats glistened in the light the longish hair was an aureole of gray spreading on the pillow around a face of eyesclosed anguish emery wake up the brown eyes snapped open and looked into hers she detected a wince and she shrank back as if from an unkind word he had trained her in that behavior much the same as the dog had been trained and what had he done to the dog and why did he have to lie about it what had he done having a nightmare emery were you dreaming of rosie or your mother yes a nightmare i look in this hole and its alive with maggots and im going into it its all coming undone whos doing this to me if pansy had believed in ghosts she might have had an answer for that it was the face of emerys mother she saw in the mirror across the room and it was her own face the bouncer and the bartender each had the frowzy redhead by one flabby arm and even so she was giving them trouble as they led her out the door the two large men had loud hollered words with the woman on the sidewalk and out of betty hydes earshot hyde looked around her noting the rodent droppings on the floor definitely not an a rating from the board of health reminders of her less accomplished relatives were on the faces of every drunk at the bar her glass had lipstick stains from the previous customer the slatternly waitress had actually seemed amused when she complained but a dollar bill had bribed the girl back to the table with a clean glass and hyde had slugged back the whole shot with enough whiskey anything could be borne she leaned forward as she spoke to the younger woman who sat on the other side of the small table mallory how do you find these places of course she understood the logic no one from the coventry arms was likely to wander in not without their own private security the bulge under mallorys coat could only be a gun now that was comforting tell me more about eric franz said mallory anything specific and what did eric have in common with a judge and a gigolo are you sure hes blind dead sure said betty hyde how so if the blindness was fraud the wife didnt know how does a man keep a thing like that from his wife maybe she did know no mallory annie believed he was blind how can you be so sure well i did tell you his wife had an interesting sense of humor for a bitch she used to flirt with men in front of him nothing spoken only the rubbing up the nuzzling what annie did with other men were the sort of things eric couldnt see or hear it was quite a show the two of them in public and there were other jokes at his expense the faces she made the obscene gestures it was the darkest humor you couldnt look away you couldnt tell her to stop you were a prisoner to every exhibition why did she hate him so much because he loved her so much too much if only hed been rude to her occasionally it might have gone a long way toward improving the marriage she was that type and his type he was a doormat a nice guy but youre right she had nothing but contempt for him in all the time i knew them is that why they never had children you know there was a time when i couldve sworn annie was pregnant she had that certain aura of impending motherhood that special glow that comes from vomiting every morning but then when i saw her again she was her old self dropdead gorgeous and frighteningly awake you think she got rid of it abortion yes i do but theres no way to confirm it i pride myself in being a hardcase but i cant ask a blind man if his wife aborted their only child well i could if it had the makings of a good story does it did you tell eric i was a cop before i joined the consulting firm no dear i only told him you might be interested in any little tidbits about the judge but it was all over the news every channel said you were a dead cop a fireman was killed on monday do you remember the news story yes he died saving an old man it was a long story what was the firemans name i dont remember oh i see yesterdays news who remembers the details the names and faces but you my dear have a memorable face and eric franz is blind when she returned home she hung up her clothes in the closet as helen had taught her to do the cat had already sensed her presence and was pounding its hello on the bathroom door with the soft thuds of paws she pressed the play button on her answering machine and went into the kitchen to open a can of tuna for her star witness it was rikers voice on the machine mallory do any of the suspects have a dog charles dimmed the lights of the front room and settled back on the couch long legs splayed out in front of him an early christmas present from mallory lay in the midst of its green velvet wrapping paper he was staring down at yet another of mallorys attempts to lure him into the current century he had a remarkable record collection and the finest turntable money could buy but he was a dinosaur in her eyes it was not the music which counted with her but the technology every old thing be damned technology ruled he picked up her gift the portable cd player did she really expect him to go about the streets wired up to the age of electronics how perverse was their gift giving he gave her jewels in antique settings which she never wore she gave him expensive hightechnology which collected dust between visits from mrs ortega he pushed the button to open the top of the machine just on the off chance shed had the plastic cover inscribed with a sentimental message he gave the same odds that two moons might appear in the sky tonight a disk lay in the machine ready to play at a touch it was only a mild shock that it should be louisas concerto could she have known about the ruined record in the basement probably not more than likely she had noticed the concerto was not included in his record collection after he had made a point of saying it was a popular recording for any classical music buff earphones grew out of the small dark box in his hand but he didnt actually need the earphones did he the concerto was locked in his memory now and running through his conscious mind what had happened this afternoon had stunned him in the way cattle are stunned with a bat before they go into the slaughterhouse blades he understood how it had happened the music had always been a trigger in his childhood fantasies of louisa now the concerto was keyed to his eidetic recreation of amanda she was archived in his freakish memory and she would probably live there forever he didnt want to touch on this again the fear was real it was no ghost story this but something threatening to his mind mallory would not be frightened so and what exactly was he frightened of it was only an illusion wasnt it something he had made with a childs memory of a magic act and nothing more a mere holograph of remembering malakhais magical insanity had been a gift of sorts and that was his field wasnt it exploring gifts furthermore he had actually found a practical application for the old magicians delusion if amanda was true to life if he was faithful to her in creation she might be able to tell him something useful to mallorys investigation if mallory could face bullets he could face amanda it was not so insane a mere conversation in the mind memory led him back through the setup for the act he was a child again the conductors baton was rising as the concert hall quieted to heartstopped silence the concerto had begun the inner music fled the confines of his braincase and rose around him in a wall of sound which opened on to bleak corridors filled with the scent of roses the lull of music was the warning of the great dark hole which sprawled out before him in that magic silence where the listeners placed the phantom notes rather than endure the emptiness there he heard a woman keening wailing for a death softer now and coming toward him into the light she wore the clothes she died in the blazer the blue jeans and running shoes his memory had faithfully recreated the stain on the material and the uglier stain of the golden hair where the wound matted it to wisps of red strings how did malakhai begin oh yes so simple good evening amanda she gave him a shy smile as she sat down in the chair opposite his own there was a moment of relief when he realized his creation did not have the substance to make an impression in the plush upholstery she rested her hands on the arms of the chair he looked to the wall further relieved because she cast no shadow to sit with his own good evening charles her voice might be borrowed from mallory but in amandas throat the words were gentled and gentle were her eyes amanda when i saw you this morning standing over the little boy he was in pain she said looking down at the soft white hands folded in her lap i couldnt bear it you only wanted to comfort him yes such a troubled little boy i love children i know its difficult for me to understand why you changed your mind about the child you were carrying she looked down to the floor for words and not finding them there she looked up with tears that were all too real to him her hands raised in a gesture of helplessness you wanted that baby very much didnt you oh yes i planned my life around that child the baby was the world to me all that meant anything at all then why why did you do it you asked the doctor to cut the child out of you what was it about this man that was so horrible it made you abort his child she rose gracefully and walked away from him back into the shadows her gait was listless tired it had been hard work cutting a muchwanted baby from her womb her life her future when she had one too hard on her chapter december angel kipling scanned the bulletin board her bright eyes rocketing across the scrolling lines seeking out the evidence of fresh lies and wondering how much it would cost her this time perhaps it would cost her one husband in addition to the fees for keeping her name out of the press each time he kissed her cheek she recoiled wondering where he might have been wondering what he might have done had to wonder couldnt stop herself his lies were unnerving and her logic was relentless in puzzling out each one early morning sun obscured only a few of the lines which repeated endlessly angel glared but the lines would not go away dont panic she whispered you always panic it was probably a shakedown if it wasnt a shakedown it would have exploded all over the media so nothings going to happen for a while we wait for a connection she looked to her reflection in the glass of the monitor see how simple things can be if you only let them be she wished sometimes that he would die as long as he lived he would be within harming distance would that he might die and she could be done with him instead of always listening to his lies and his excuses and his endless apologies he had apologized very nicely for illegally putting up the condo as loan collateral but then he apologized for clearing his throat he apologized to the dog and then he apologized to her in the same tone the concierge surveyed his world the lobby of the coventry arms and found nothing amiss perfectly attired people went to and fro in their designer dresses tailored suits and handmade shoes he paid more attention to the clothes than to the faces and the faces of the occasional children registered not at all his toe tapped to the quick bright notes of a vivaldi mandolin concerto which played throughout the lobby at a tasteful level of background music less tuneful downright disruptive music of highpitched barks and guttural growls was coming from the elevator in its descent to the ground floor the doors opened and the dog fight overflowed from the elevator and into the lobby the concierge waved his hands at the porter but the porter was hanging back a safe distance from the fray of course no job description required the man to be torn to shreds by a pit bull and a mastiff the owners were displaying the same common sense and now the doorman had abandoned his post and entered the lobby to cheer on the mastiff the porter displayed a five dollar bill and placed a silent bet with the doorman his money on the pit bull well something had to be done the concierge who had never been invited to a dog fight before and didnt understand the rules found himself standing too close and now he was wincing with a bite from the mastiff his own scream chiming in with the barks all comings and goings had stopped and twelve people gathered to watch between the blood flow and the betting not one of them noticed the key being taken from the rack behind the desk and then being replaced with a key similar to mallorys did you like the cd player yes thank you and the recording of louisas concerto was a nice touch you have to change to cds charles you might be able to transfer most of your records theyre in good shape for artifacts you mean i like the records i like the turntable he did not want any more technology invading the house your record collection cant grow with obsolete technology and you cant replace worn out records any more i noticed you didnt have a copy of louisas concerto in your collection i wore it out ages ago there was another one in maxs collection downstairs but im afraid i ruined that one the timing of your gift was perfect whatever happened to maxs friend crazy malakhai oh hes living a quieter life these days i suppose he is pretty old yes hes getting on in years since when did mallory make small talk and louisa shes really still with him oh yes but louisa would still be young just nineteen forever charles watched her pinning more printouts to the cork board which spanned the wall of her private office are you quite sure youre on to something with the business of the lie mallory tapped the printout from the real estate agency computer and he did not ask if the real estate agency had donated this material by consent or by a hijack on the midnight rail of the electronic superhighway four days before the abortion she made an offer on a small house upstate according to her agency file she was concerned with local school systems and area playgrounds during the next four days according to the doctor she hardly ate or slept im guessing this is where he told her the lie so it worked on her and then she had it out with him the outburst at the keyboard was just before her death wasnt it could we have this wrong might that be the day she caught him in the lie no the lie made her abort the child it worked on her maybe she just couldnt take it any more she snapped late theres a flaw in the logic here you cant always go by logic you have to get into the perps skin when you know him you know how and why all im missing now is who she turned to him how well do you think you know amanda there was only a subtle shadow across his mind she couldnt know what he was doing with malakhais magic madness but the timing of her gift of music was entirely too perfect had she made a trip to the basement and seen the ruined record no of course not that was paranoid based on the manuscript i might know amanda well enough to guess her reactions to events but not the events themselves not the lie that was told to her i can only tell you it had to be something monstrous she had a gentle personality a wry sense of the ridiculous i rather liked nothing in the monster category in the background checks but she had to turn it up with the usual research avenues if she found it i can find it not necessarily and you have to consider that this might not have been his first kill that hes done it before and gotten away with it that might be what she uncovered its better logic if there was no record of it how did she find it mallory these two people had very intimate knowledge of one another this was no great love story but they shared a bed there was conversation if he lied to her she may have caught it in the untechnological way the rest of us catch lies when you tell the truth its always the same truth when you lie you must have a superb memory or it will be a different lie in every telling and now his eyes took on some pain as he clearly understood their separate roles in this business mallory could crawl into the mind of a killer with disturbing ease she had left the difficult job to him the job of identifying with a frail human being who had no pathology or defenses in a brutal landscape peopled with those whom mallory identified with best he wished he could wire mallory into his delusion of amanda and remove himself from the game and a game it was to mallory murder was the best game now she was unloading a pack of tapes from the mornings scavenging something on television could have tipped her the judge had a lot of air time in the past two weeks could it be that simple a clue in amandas last days they were spent in the upheaval of the lie lack of sleep anxiety and guilt from the abortion he walked the length of the cork wall at the back of the office this was not louis markowitzs style all the tiny little detailing was missing mallorys quick brain could not stop for the minutiae which had been louiss obsession he had to keep reminding himself that she was not obliged to be a copy of her father now he read the interview with the doorman whats this about it looks like thats the day she finally snapped the doorman said she was agitated then she went home obsessed about it and that same night she logged on to her computer maybe she was working late to get her mind off it but the book was about him wasnt it thats when the you liar outburst occurred she fed one tape to the vcr these are all the broadcast cuts from the past two weeks the first tape was a press conference judge hearts stage presence was commanding and he seemed to know it he singled out women reporters for questions and looked into the eyes of each one as though she might be the center of his universe even more entertaining were the tapes on the senate hearings for judge hearts nomination to the highest court in the land mallorys candidate for wife beating was rambling on and on about his concern over sexual harassment in the workplace the senator from maine was nodding in approval of each lie he fed her on his empathy for women and the need to protect them charles was wondering what might draw amanda to this man power had its attractions he supposed and fame and hearts intelligence was undisputed the judge is always in the paper pretty dry stuff coverage on the hearings pictures of candidate and family did i mention that i think he killed his elderly mother slope ran that by me at the poker game hes not convinced theres no evidence its pure speculation sometimes speculation is all you ever get to work with charles and you did ask me to keep an open mind about the possibility that he had killed before a mother killer you think that might put a woman off having a baby just on the off chance that matricide was genetic perhaps by your description harry kipling seems harmless enough and hes just the type to panic all the testosterone in his marriage is angels they sat in silence throughout an hour of mallory fastforwarding tapes and stopping the action to have a closer look over the two weeks of tape he noted a growing tension in heart now watch the judge lie to this reporter a young woman approached him smiling brightly and the judge beamed down on her with his most avuncular smile he was the man every boy and girl wanted for a daddy im going to wrap this up on the twentysixth said mallory and this conversation is between us not us and coffey and riker how can you orchestrate the day you dont even know which one it is oh not just the day i can even plot the moment roughly how i was always in charge of him charles when i get him on camera i start pushing his buttons ive got the usual buttons for franz and kipling im going to get the judge in motion by telling him that im going to get the paperwork to dig up his mother slope wont support i dont need slopes permission to dig up a dead mother indeed she didnt seem to need anyone you have a favorite dont you she ignored this im going to wrap him up for the da on the day after christmas is it me youre wrapping up asked a small voice behind them justin riccalo stood in the doorway the boy was staring from one to the other is it me does that worry you asked mallory she didnt wait on his answer but turned her back on the boy charles when little kids can just walk into the building id say we had a security problem charles looked down at the boy how did you get in justin why didnt you use the intercom i walked in with an old man on crutches he dropped his package so i carried it in for him it seemed kind of silly to go back outdoors and use the intercom its cold out there mugridge let you in mallory seemed skeptical and with good reason the elderly mugridge was the most security conscious person in the building yes maam i did knock on the office door you probably didnt hear me theres a buzzer on the door said mallory in an effort to ward off any further interrogation by mallory charles ushered the boy into his own office and pulled the door shut mallory hates me doesnt she mr butler shes suspicious of everyone even me dont take it personally what can i do for you justin i wondered if we could go back to the cellar i didnt think you would want to not after yes i would i think i do like magic after all your parents dont mind you missing a morning of school schools out its christmas vacation of course it was christmas eve where was his mind well ill just give them a call to let them know where you are i wish you wouldnt do that im supposed to be at the tanner school right now but you just i am on christmas vacation the tanner school is warehousing me for the day its a holiday program for working parents my parents are doing the cocktail circuit this afternoon every corporation in town is having their christmas parties so they think im at school the boy sat on the edge of the straightback chair his wriggling feet not quite touching the carpet his hands gripped either side of the wooden seat as though unsure of the chairs intention to remain stationary i see how would robert riccalo react to his sons truancy not well you know i did want another chance to talk to you alone i have an idea that your parents make you a little nervous you have a gift for understatement mr butler they both drive me right up the wall your partner makes me nervous too she thinks im doing it you dont believe in this levitation crap do you oh i dont believe anyone is levitating anything humanity has enough bizarre problems without dragging in the occult parapsychology is a nonscience as far as im concerned but i do think one of you is rather good at illusion or maybe not even if it was a slipshod job who looks for the obvious thread when a sharp object is flying toward them im betting on my stepmother but she seems to be the target i think shes using this to turn my father against me he doesnt even like me any more he avoids looking at me and shes already gotten to your partner one day i saw sally talking to her on the street i know she turned mallory against me where was this in front of her apartment house the coventry arms your stepmother followed her there yes she made me wait in the car down the block but i followed her i know what shes trying to do to me and no one will believe me justin i really am on your side the boy seemed unconvinced i know something that will cheer you up he gathered up his house keys from the drawer of the desk lets go down the basement but no music this time only magic as they walked into the hallway mallory was disappearing into the elevator with no goodbye no ill see you this evening she was not usually inclined to unnecessary words but she never missed appointments the sun might not come up in the morning but mallory would come back at eight of the clock for dinner now in some part of his brain he was recalling each bit of small talk on the subject of malakhai and wondering what to make of this deviation in her he and the boy walked down the hall in the silence of their separate thoughts charles looked down on justin who was clearly miserable but not frightened this time the boy led the way down the winding staircase to the room below drawn along by the stored remains of maximillian candles traveling magic show when the wall partition was pulled to one side justin was first in not waiting for the light of the globe to go exploring the dull light caught up to the wandering boy and cast a fuzzy moving shadow on the trunks of props and costumes oh cool said justin from the other side of the tall chinese screen and he knew the boy had discovered the guillotine but as charles rounded the panels of rice paper he could see it was the knife set that had justins attention charles touched another globe and another light came to life as the boy was staring at the rack of knives he looked up at charles and then to the old much punctured redandwhite bulls eye which was propped on an antique easel one hand reached out to the knife rack hovering tentatively as his eyes shot up to charles to ask permission he nodded you will be careful with them wont you justin picked up the first knife and missed the target though it was large and close dont feel bad it takes a bit of practise max had many years of practise i can tell said the boy approaching the target which was pocked with scars his finger traced the outline of a human body surrounding the area free of knife holes that was where his assistant used to stand right right he cut it close didnt he i can see the holes of the knife points between the fingers can you do it yes i can once when i was your age i stood in the target center it was a birthday present from max youre kidding werent you scared no then max gave the knives over to me and he stood in the center of the target so you can really do it really really the boy moved into the center of the target and flattened out on the rings of the bulls eye do it i trust you go ahead actually you would only have to trust me not to let go of the knives the blades come out of the target they dont go into it you pretend to throw the knife but you really drop it into this pocket he turned a small table so justin could see the black velvet bag which hung just below the table top he pointed to the black lever by one leg and the wire trailing away from the table and toward the target the trigger for the knives is in the foot pedal see then the hilt of the blade springs out from inside the target with a springload but the audience sees what its conditioned to see a knife is thrown and a knife appears on the target it would take me a few minutes to set the springs its perfectly safe once you know how the trick is done if justin was the one who rigged the flying objects this might be a practical application for his gift he was wondering how he was going to sell a future in the magic trade to the boys father when justin walked away from the target all interest in it lost the boy looked up to the guillotine and thats only a trick too right as if he were asking if this was only another lie a cheat yes sorry it has a failsafe mechanism its wicked looking but harmless as a child charles remembered being enthralled by the trickery not the danger justin was of an opposite bent he seemed disappointed at the lack of danger perhaps the magic trade was not the right area for justins intellect whose then the stepmother the father justin i know youve been told what your iq is have you given any thought to the future what you might do with it how you might develop it whats to develop a brain is a brain and if you believe me when i tell you i dont make things fly around the house then i dont have any talent either well you might have a talent for observation and deductive reasoning thats something we can test for and it might even be fun suppose i help you figure out how the objects fly then youll know what to look for so you work with me for a while and well help each other deal as mallory would put it deal said the boy his small hand thrust into charless for a handshake good he was lifting a black ball with holes in it from a box at his feet this was one of the few floating illusions in maxs act it only takes a few minutes to set it up where was the fluid container he found the bottle he sought in a neighbouring box covered with dust while charles pondered the shelf life of chemicals justin was examining another box and apparently he had tripped the spring for now bright colored scarves exploded from the box shooting straight up and then billowing out flowing on to the floor in a loam of silk justin was trying to smash the scarves back into the box as quickly as he could pluck them from the air he looked over his shoulder to charles guilt and apology on his face and fear was there too im sorry im sorry its all right justin just let them be theres no harm done really youre not angry with me no of course not you know your partner hates me oh i doubt that he trained the beam to another dark quarter of the basement searching out a trackline post ah there it was and it was still set with the running wires now why would mallory hate you my father says people hate other people for what they hate in themselves well i suppose thats sometimes true but what might that be in mallorys case matches oh yes he pulled an old box from the chest of drawers in the open steamer trunk i dont know i dont know much about her well shes a loner like you said charles disappearing into the dark at the edge of the globes small circle of light and then reappearing with empty hands she doesnt mix well with people other qualities in common he had to wonder there was something between her and the boy a mutual understanding he could not understand all right justin ready the boy nodded now there was a bright flash of light and a glowing ball of flames was hurtling straight toward them it stopped three feet short of its targets man and boy and then rose over their heads and was extinguished in the darkness beyond them justin whistled and clapped his hands now thats a flying object said charles and miles more fun than pencils dont you think it runs on a track of wire its the only floating illusion i know but there are crates full of books on magic if you want to look through them i dont know maybe the less i know about this stuff the better off i am why did everyone assume i made the pencils fly well when teams go out to investigate the odd ghost story or some other instance of paranormal activity they usually discover the origin of the event behind a neighbors garage in the form of three small children laughing their tails off but this isnt funny sallys gone nuts i cant sit in the same room with her shes such a basket case and shes always staring at me it just never lets up every time something happens were all together but i get the blame justin kicked at a box it isnt fair i need somebody on my side somebody has to listen to me as charles was facing the boy they both heard the noise to the left charles turned to see the knife sticking out of the target the blade still wafting with the vibration justins eyes were wide this time this was no flying pencil no ball on a wire now youll never believe me said the boy he turned and ran in an uncoordinated jagged stagger out of the circle of light and into the dark hitting against cartons and trunks in his mad flight his wild search for a way out for the light of an exit his thin flailing arms were poor versions of moth wings memory guided charles through the darkness and swiftly to the door he opened it to a rectangle of bright light in a moment the boy was through it and flying up the stairs shoes slapdashing the iron work on the top landing justin fell charles lifted him to an upright stand and held him by the shoulders are you all right no he could see that the boy was not all right justins eyes were filling up with tears the child slumped against his chest and charles held him until the racking stopped captain judd thomas of the west side precinct sat dead center in the hierarchy of arranged chairs in jack coffeys office the captain was wearing his diplomatic smile just enough teeth showing to say he wanted to keep this meeting friendly no blood drawn not today palanski wants in on this case i dont think so judd said jack coffey who was overworked understaffed and only wanted the meeting done with all of this was in his face the shadows of too little sleep the lines of too much stress palanski has a way of getting information from these people dont i know it said mallory captain thomass tiny eyes became even smaller as he turned on her and whats that supposed to mean mallory rose from her chair and left the room so quickly there was no time for coffey to threaten her with a look that promised charges of insubordination charges which would have meant nothing to her riker smiled coffey was looking at captain thomas with something approaching temper in his eyes but not crossing the line with the words who told palanski she was working that building hes got sources in that crowd riker leaned forward and ill bet his sources dont stop with the doorman he can work those wealthy people like street weasels is it just me am i the only one in this room that finds that interesting coffey shot riker a look that said shut up captain thomas ignored him and looked at coffey with raised eyebrows clearly asking if riker was housebroken and leash trained palanski is one of the best detectives i have hed be an asset to any investigation its mallorys case judd you dont get squat thats it commissioner beale and i go back a long ways jack as far as beale is concerned the sun only shines on kathy mallory this week the little bastards grinning like a ghoul shes the only cop ever commended by the civilian review board for shooting a citizen she can do no wrong but what about you jack youre in line for promotion this is a highprofile case big money big names in that building palanskis got sixteen years experience mallorys a kid you dont want her to blow that promotion out of the water do you judd if i thought you were threatening me id have mallory blow you out of the water cause i just really hate that riker sat back in his chair if coffey kept up this insubordination with superiors then one day he might have to stop ragging the kid and show him a little respect then what would he do for fun tell palanski to back off judd the captain sighed you know jack with all the moonlighting and the free food and discounts for cops all the little fiddles getting worked all over town if we ever enforced the rules we wouldnt i dont know where you think youre going with this judd said coffey you got something on one of mine you spit it out now thomas put up his hands to say okay enough and he lifted his bulk out of the chair and left the room and riker knew that was too damn easy he was wondering what the captains own fiddle might be when coffey turned on him angry do you know what mallory has on palanski no idea shed never rat out another cop she might shoot him if he gets in her way but shell never rat on him you went too far with judd thomas its her life on the line you know palanski is dirty and i know it hes responsible for all the damn leaks one of those leaks could get her killed you went too far riker thomas finds palanski useful the way i find mallory useful if all shes got on him is flashy clothes and fiftydollar haircuts mallorys clothes are tailormade for christs sake and she doesnt cut her hair over the bathroom sink does she right now were real lucky the captain got his new job with politics instead of brains but lets not count him a complete moron lets not push our luck okay riker hated it when coffey was right you want me to see what i can turn up on palanski no ive got someone else working palanski undercover so just table that okay no more speculation even if your lips dont move you didnt put it through internal affairs no no ia men i want to keep this one in the family when you see mallory tell her to get her ass back in here i think it would be nice if she went through the formality of handing in reports just to be polite you know this might be her version of professional courtesy maybe she thinks youd rather not know what shes doing and how shes doing it she might have something there think about your pension ive already got a problem with the way shes handling the case shes trying to cover three suspects by herself its a scattergun approach for one cop if she doesnt get him soon shell lose him oh i think she knows which one it is if she tells you she has three suspects you can figure two of them for smoke she thinks you dont trust her to run her own investigation and thats wise on your part i havent trusted her since she was ten its nothing supernatural i promise you said charles justin was deathly quiet his small face turned to the cab window to the fall of snowflakes silently crashing against the glass when i get home ill go back down to the cellar and have a close look at the target ill find that the old mechanism was triggered by accident you probably jostled it when you leaned on the target its that simple in fact i dont even need to look and i wont look thats how much faith i have in you theres no other explanation justin the knife came from the other side of the target no one made it fly through the air all right the boy turned to him in that small face there was clearly a will to smile when they exited the cab in front of the school on the upper east side charles stayed awhile to watch justin join the other boys who were standing about the yard in groups of threes and fours but justin did not join them hands in his pockets head down he stood alone by tacit agreement of the yard charles winced for he was watching a living memory of his own school days now a bell called the boys back into the building two by two and three by three and justin on his own charles unfurled his umbrella against the hard drive of snow and stared at the park on the other side of the wide street mallory would be a straight shot across the park and a jog in the road north perhaps he would visit her if she was at the rosens apartment also just the other side of the park was the crime scene cabs passed by him empty of passengers and ripe for the hailing but he liked to walk in the snow over the years he had acquired a taste for all the solitary occupations and so would young justin on his foulweather meanderings closer to home charles would frequently encounter others in this select club he was on a nodding acquaintance with fellow rain walkers and snow walkers and they would smile at one another in passing recognizing the secret sign the gait of no pressing business while all the other pedestrians were hurrying along anxious to be out of the wet and the cold he crossed the street and took a path that wound down from the sidewalk and into a pristine valley of new snow only his footsteps marked the way until he came to the road which led through the park he walked along the road wondering what mallory was up to wondering if he would actually want to know that now a horsedrawn carriage approached him the snow ploffed on his umbrella and it suddenly occurred to him that his shoes were not meant for snow it crossed his mind to hail the carriage driver but no he let the carriage pass unhailed new shoes could be got new snow was not so easy to come by he continued his solitary tracking what would markowitz have said about mallorys negligence in failing to visit the crime scene what might she have missed nothing probably her refusal was most likely only an overreaction to rikers lecture on procedure suppose he visited the scene himself and possibly noticed something useful how would she react to that well they were partners werent they youre living in a fools paradise said a voice which had come to shelter under charless umbrella behold a pale horse said the man who materialized at his side to hold a conversation with a third person who was not visible to the naked mind charles felt an involuntary shudder he looked down to a shiny bald spot in the center of the smaller mans matted swirls of gray hair the old mans coat was dirty but good wool a scarf was wrapped around his neck and trailed behind him on the ground it was the longest scarf charles had ever seen and with all the colors of an unwashed unkempt unraveling rainbow the man continued to walk along with him accepting the shelter of the umbrella as though it were his due charles knew he could never look on madness in the same way again he had done his own time with one who was not there and he had to wonder how often malakhai had done that trick before the damage became permanent before it became impossible to send louisa away each thought changed the configurations of the very brain itself i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending im charles butler good day he moved the umbrella to one side the better to protect his grayhaired companion from the driving snow which dusted the old mans sloping shoulders and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair the old man intoned well perhaps it hasnt been a good day said charles a woman clothed with the sun and the moon at her feet what is mallorys day like what is she up to right now and there was war in heaven that might not be far from the mark now the old man parted company with charles as the invisible partner in conversation led the man down another path of revelation and gravel covered over with snow when charles came to the site of the murder the yellow strands of tape were still in evidence staketied by their broken ends and waving in the white wind of snow he walked to the place confirmed by hellers map as the original murder scene he stood by the water and looked around in all directions so far he had learned nothing that mallory might not have gleaned from the map the site was within view of the path along the water that fit nicely with mallorys theory of a spontaneous act there was not sufficient cover to do a murder undisclosed the murder had taken place on a rainy day few people walked in the rain and the snow but those who did were habitual in their defiance of the elements he stared up at the towering building on central park west the upper floors reached above the tree line of bare branches mallory might be looking out of one of those windows at this moment he walked around the leg of water to the path lined with benches and then he sat down to wait he had not been sitting there for very long before the one he waited on came walking along the path the other walker in the snow he nearly missed her though she was close the bright snow had strained his eyes and he had to work to pick out the particulars of her the white face white hair covered by the white woolen cape she was as close to invisible as one could be without being a figment of the mind cora pulled the hood of her white cape close about her face too late he had seen through her camouflage the man was very tall but not threatening in his stance she squinted to focus on his face which became clearer as he walked toward her well with that silly wide grin she might assume that he was one of the more docile lunatics who roamed the park at will no he was not dangerous her hands went past the layers of sweaters beneath the white cape and into the deep pockets of her white woolen trousers looking there for a few coins excuse me the man said standing before her now and bowing down to her so the wind wouldnt take his words and no matter if it did for she read the words off his lips she drew the coins from her pockets and offered them to him now promise me you wont spend this on wine oh no thank you its not money i need and now her suspicions were aroused anew he didnt want money well he must be crazy and perhaps dangerous as well she turned away from him he circled round to the opposite end of the path but kept a courteous distance there was an apology in the way he stood and a foolish hopeful look to his eyes the pair of which had entirely too much white around the irises oh yes he was quite mad i need your help he said its about what happened there on the morning of the nineteenth he turned to point to that place across the dark water where the broken yellow tapes were waving in the wind he turned back to face her before speaking again he had already picked up on the fact that she was a lipreader that spoke well for presence of mind maam i dont suppose you were out walking that morning he seemed sane enough now the shape of the words on his mouth had a good neighborhood to them without slang or slur of form and she could find no fault with his manners yes young man i was out walking that morning did you happen to notice two people a man and a woman standing over there he must be speaking of the young lovers blue legs and the tall umbrella oddly she felt protective of the young couple who was he to pry into their secret meeting why do you ask when he was done explaining that the lovers were murderer and victim she felt the need to sit down he sensed this and guided her to a bench a few feet up the path he dusted it for her with touching chivalry and sat down beside her now the mans face was all concern was he reading the new horror that was setting in behind her eyes she had taken blue legs wound for a flower what a fool she had been a rose in winter why hadnt she known the young woman was on her way to dying perhaps she could have oh yes she could have if only she had not the fools idea to go out without her glasses and her hearing aid and now she bowed her head with the weight of a dark understanding in the same way she had prevented the carnage twixt a beetle and a spider with only the flick of her wrist she might have prevented a murder so a bug survived a woman died blue legs i am so sorry he touched her hand lightly to call her face back to his so he might ask another question had she seen anything else anything out of the ordinary well no the young lovers had taken all her attention a speeding blur of red cap and jacket with churning bluejeaned legs ran past them in a boys whiff of spearmint gum and wet wool a dog was fast on the heels of the boy dog and boy left the path and put new tracks in the virgin snow of the incline behind the benches then they were gone oh the dog yes there was a dog racing up that hill and he caught his leash in the brambles i suppose i should have thought it odd to see the dog with the leash and no human attached to the other end but you know people will let the dogs run wild in the park though it is against the law theres someone id like you to meet said the man and now she found his smile quite engaging though still a bit loony when they stopped to speak with the doorman at the coventry arms the mans friend mallory was not at home the doorman checked the name against a list on frayed creased paper he smiled broadly and invited them to wait for miss mallory in the lobby mallory just sit down and shut the hell up to coffeys surprise and he hoped it was concealed surprise she sat dont you ever walk out on a meeting again i dont want any more grief from you dont you even think about irritating me any more no more insubordination none of that crap ive got riker for that if he thinks youre stealing his song and dance he wont like it im not going to work with palanski no youre not but that was my decision not yours and now about that other little job i gave you did you pull the records for me did you steal them for me she said nothing and he had to make what he could of the silence he was operating by mallorys rule book now i hope youre doing this discreetly dont get caught silence ive got an idea palanski does a lot of overtime hes on the take she only nodded but that was promising he seems to have some kind of radar for homicide scenes within smelling distance of money even on his days off he was on vacation time when the body turned up in the park oh sorry mallory im telling you what you already know thats rude isnt it he was close to joy when the side of her mouth dipped with annoyance so even mallory had buttons did you bring me the records you dont want to see his records she said mallory markowitz never turned on a cop shut up mallory granted im no markowitz but neither are you your old man was a detail fanatic hed take any information he could get from anywhere anybody you should have learned more from him when you had the chance your lone cowboy attitude isnt something i expect to cure in a day but i do want to keep you alive long enough to bring you up on charges the next time you cross me someone at the coventry arms tipped palanski to the activity it might be your perp or it might be you rattled another cage and its unrelated if im going to plug the leaks i need the dirt on palanski her arms folded across her chest no she was telling him she was not going to roll over on a cop ill handle palanski she said and then she threw in if you like as a concession it was a small gift from mallory a consolation prize as she was telling him to go to hell another round was lost okay you handle it was he losing his mind loosing her on palanski giving her carte blanche dont do anything markowitz wouldnt ask you to do understood later in the washroom he saw a ghost in the mirror over the sink it was markowitz no it was jack coffey wearing markowitzs old worries over mallory and what she did and what might come back on him breaking laws to keep them was the norm now he was so easily seduced by her he was going to kill her it was the only way but first a little fun he would make her pay for torturing him and she would pay slowly thoughts of her came and passed when she was in his mind she brought with her a burning sensation inflicting a hot red flush all through his body and his brain when he thought of her it was her eyes he saw before him the bright lanterns of an onrushing accident running mindless relentless along a single track no one at the wheel no way to stop her and each time that moment of helpless fear and panic passed on he was left with exhausted humiliation and anger now his hands balled into fists so tight his nails left red indentations on his palms one of those indents was filling with blood he looked down at the bleeding flesh she had reached out and done this to him she had drawn first blood and she would be sorry a fat gray bird strutted along the ledge by his open window it was still there when he returned from the kitchen with the bread he crumbled a slice in his hand and slowly reached through the window to lay a line of crumbs for the bird it jerked and started and cocked its head to look at him with one eye only it was a city pigeon and unafraid of humans who had failed in all their pathetic attempts to annihilate its entire species as a defecating public nuisance contemptuous of the hand which lay only inches away the bird concentrated on the meal of bread crumbs which brought it ever closer to its death a young woman stood at the desk in the lobby something was concealed behind her back and concealed quickly at first sight of the couple being pointed out to her by the man behind the desk formal introductions were made to cora by her new friend the man with the foolish smile and now the small party moved up through the floors of the tall building to the spacious apartment which did not fit the personality of the young woman called mallory mallory you were right said the man whom cora now called charles he was well mannered in the way he kept his face toward her so that she should not miss any part of his conversation with the young woman amanda was meeting him in the park that day it was a spontaneous act as you said and the murder occurred at we have a witness mrs daily may i introduce my partner mallory mallory this is cora daily who likes to take long walks through the park in bad weather how do you do said cora the child before her was so lovely but there was an aspect to the girl that was inhuman eyes like a cat she had well that was all right in fact that was fine in seventyeight years cora had outlived many cats and had no fear of mallory what did you see asked the young woman who was also quick to pick up on the lipreading she brought her face low and close did you see the murder no im afraid not did you see him strike her the first blow no but i did see the meeting between them so you can identify the killer no you see i wasnt wearing my glasses but i know he was a tall man and now cora could tell this was not news to the girl she felt she had let down the charming mr butler i saw the red wound to the side of her head after he struck her there was an umbrella in the way when the blow must have been struck but he was holding on to her before and after the wound appeared is that helpful to you tell me more about the perp excuse me the the perpetrator you said he was tall how tall he was taller than the woman how much taller hard to say the umbrella was an impediment most of the time and i suppose the way he held it made him very tall but do you think im very tall oh my yes are you even sure it was a man or did you assume that because you thought they were lovers youre quite right of course i shouldnt have assumed that i havent been very helpful have i of course you have said her young man gallantly jumping into a breach of uncomfortable silence he looked up and exchanged expressions with the young woman his face said play nicely and her face said why the hell not and now the young woman smiled you were better than most i have nightmares that any case will hang on an eyewitness eyewitnesses are never any good their testimony is the worst evidence you can bring into a court room but you confirmed the scene of the crime thats useful you placed the time of the murder thats helpful you saw the first blood i like that all in all a good job and now the smile evaporated and cora could read nothing in the young womans face any more charles leaned forward still careful to include cora in the conversation by not averting his lips as he spoke mallory do any of the suspects have dogs everyone in the building has a dog why cora tells me there was a dog running through the park that morning he was dragging a leash maybe one of your suspects walked the dog that morning and then lost track of the animal while he was doing a bit of murder mallory turned to cora you saw the dog cora nodded what was the breed im afraid i couldnt say my glasses what size was it oh a standard size not awfully big or very small im sorry i cant what color was it i dont remember but i think it might have been dark but not black not that dark maybe a brown dog maybe she had no answer for that she had underestimated the young woman and now she was wondering if there had been a dog at all or a pair of lovers could they have both been women might the dog have been well now said charles lurching once more into the silence you place a dog on the scene and youve ruled out toy poodles and great danes the young woman nodded this was useful to her which seemed to please charles very much any fool could see he was in love with the girl well at least he was happy good job she had come to like this man when she rose announcing that she must take her leave of them he escorted her down in the elevator and handed her into a cab he insisted on paying her fare to the driver as she shook hands with him she said you were born in the wrong century my dear when he returned to the apartment it was difficult to miss the sharp knife lying on the coffee table next to the canvas duffel bag as if she didnt own enough weapons first there was the very large gun which bulged under the blazer she removed this now and took it into a back room then there was the gun that she ought to be carrying the one the police department actually approved of he supposed she kept that one at home and last there was markowitzs ancient long colt which she kept in the desk of her office at mallory and butler ltd he would never have pictured her with a knife he picked it up and turned it in his hand on the reverse side of the blade was the crest of maximillian candle its probably none of my business said mallory walking back into the room and nodding towards the knife but i wondered what was going on in the basement i just came from there the door was unlocked and the partition for maxs equipment was wide open my fault i left in rather a hurry you didnt by any chance pull that knife out of the target did you she nodded charles stared down at the knife and forgot to ask what had brought her to the basement so great was his surprise it was the wrong knife of course all the blades that came from the interior of the target were partial blades without points and fixed to the mechanism they could be pushed back into the compartments but not drawn out and not with a full blade and a point when he had explained it to mallory she asked could anyone else have been in the basement with you and justin well its possible but i doubt it did you tell the parents what happened in the basement yes of course i called them from the office it took me forty minutes to track them down to a cocktail party the child had been in trauma they had a right to know he was upset well you also left the basement door open has the boy had time to go back and change the knives the boy or one of the parents but the front door of the building wasnt unlocked its self and we both know that a kid can bypass that security how tough do you think it would be for an adult i just cant picture one of them easier to picture that scenario than a knife flying through the air on its own someone has gone to some trouble here and this is quite an escalation from flying pencils this business has got to be cleaned up and its up to you ive got my hands full with a murderer you truly believe someone in the riccalo family is going to get hurt oh sure its coming count on it theres no supportable argument for that so so when did logic ever interfere with her train of thought it was her method first to settle upon a target hypothesis and then to move toward it with great velocity and let nothing get between her and it an eyeblink ago the space by mallorys feet had been empty and now it was full of cat nose was picking up her bad habits are you still planning to wrap up amandas death by the twentysixth she nodded if i dont move on it now ill lose him if i string him out too far he might get to a lawyer before i can nail him lucky for you all three suspects are spending the holidays in town if one of them had left town i wouldve crossed him off the list but logically logic only works on paper jack coffey seems to think you talked to coffey you didnt tell him about the novel did you no why didnt you tell him why all the secrecy you work with these people no wait fool she doesnt she works alone a cop is leaking information im not taking any more chances but youre taking terrible chances suppose youve underestimated the murderer coffey says you underestimate every mallorys posture was ramrod straight her chin lifted only a little i know this man he cleaned that apartment over and over again he cleaned things he couldnt have touched he had to be absolutely sure he wouldnt miss anything and so he can never be sure he didnt miss something hes the only one who can tie me to amanda bosch because hes the only one who knows shes dead and that i was mistaken for her he wants to run but he cant he figures i know something but he doesnt know how much its driving him crazy me being here every message i leave on the computer puts him closer to the edge he cant leave he was my prisoner the day i moved into this condo hes waiting for me to come and get him every knock on his front door is the end for him when he cant stand it any more when he snaps hell come to me and i will pick that moment for the duration of her soliloquy he could swear she never blinked her eyes there was an edge to her voice it was the sort of edge fools like himself were prone to falling off of crashing as they fell and proximity made him nervous jack coffeys right you know nose locked eyes with him as though asking how he could have said such a thing out loud coffey is well yes i think he is right about a few things the cat looked away giving him up for dead and im wrong the measured weight of her words also carried the second question whose side are you on for it would always be that way with her this demand to choose up sides her side versus the balance of the planet mallory if you string out all the facts just the bare facts they dont amount to much of a portrait certainly not what youve extrapolated you cant bet your life on it it was nose who picked up the warning signs first with an animals radar for the impending storm he bristled and crept under the couch and charles was suddenly reminded of the old man in the park quoting from revelations warnings of earthquake the dark of the sun the long red fingernails disappeared into the duffel bag on the coffee table and emerged again with a small bundle of printouts sectioned off with paper clips she selected one clipped bundle of sheets and held it up to him okay charles lets take a look at your own little problem with the flying objects the light sheaf of papers hit the coffee table with real force her face was rigid these are the facts my contribution to the partnership two women died two insurance companies paid off a third woman is frightened or at least she acts that way the kids trust fund is down by a full third the father is the executor of the trust you might assume he just made bad investments because his own portfolio and accounts are also depleted but that would be supposition and im sticking to the facts the stepmother is a computer programmer with a financial background she has a fax origin number access to the executors signature and documents she knew robert riccalo for ten years before she married him per your own notes nothing flies unless the three of them are in the room a pencil flew at the stepmother now its easiest to make the pencil fly to the person pulling the thread but i made it fly to you didnt i her voice was entirely too civilized prompting the cat to stick its head out from under the couch where was all this background information coming from as quickly as he framed that question he filed it away among all the other unspoken unanswered questions which were suspended from the rafters of his brain like bats sleeping in the dark when she got information for him he had ceased to ask where she got it and he tried not to speculate on the source setting his ethics adrift becoming more like markowitz another printout hit the coffee table with a hard slap the cat was gone again the boy used to keep normal school hours he had one afterschool program to fill out the parent workdays she said now his hours are longer at the tanner school he sometimes goes six days a week without eating a single meal at home the new stepmother arranged that and justin was right about all the wives being copies of one another they all favored extended afterschool programs none of them wanted the kid around the kids trust fund is down and dads in a hole the new stepmother is topheavy with insurance from her job the natural mother had a history of heart problems the suicidal stepmother had a brief psychiatric history these are facts i suppose the one with the psychiatric history saw things flying through the air no way to know its a fact that a shrink was observing her for signs of paranoia during a brief hospital stay she didnt leave a suicide note the me investigator tried to do the workup for a postmortem psychological autopsy he said the family never discussed flying objects with him theres the file on the womans death there are personal notes in there about the kid the word spooky is mentioned twice im only repeating the facts there was a restrained violence to the words a force being held in check though her anger was increasing in pent up energy there were no signs in the cool mask of a face well the suicide rules out the insurance motive no charles in fact it doesnt riccalo went to court to make them pay off there was no suicide exclusion and she had no psychiatric history at the time she took out the policy and robert riccalo was the beneficiary thats a fact the settlement was deposited into the boys trust that sounds sinister lets stick to the facts charles the settlement barely covered the amount lost in bad investments the previous quarter if that trust fund had dropped too low it would have triggered a bank audit he didnt have much choice about depositing the money back into the trust so just at the right time a heavily insured woman dies i call that interesting you have nothing to indicate foul play as i understand it there was no one in the house when it happened thats speculation the department wont check an alibi unless the case is written up as a homicide if you stick to the facts you have a logical case to fit any one of them but if instinct counts for nothing how come i know the perp from the next victim and you dont the air between them was chill to dangerous even malakhai in his debunking days would have found her quite unnatural in the world all the good logic of his good brain excused itself and went off to keep the cat company under the couch too late he had come to believe in her as others might believe in magic which one of them is doing it too bad i cant tell you i didnt figure it out with logic so it doesnt count does it which one who do you think it is oh no charles ive seen the light ive got religion im only a cop a detective youre the genius and now that you have it trimmed down to logic and solid facts the rest should be easy for you let me know if you ever work it out but theres a case to fit any of them logic logic is your handicap not mine if logic is king how come i know and you dont have fun charles dont forget to duck send postcards she began unpacking new boxes of disks from the duffel bag you make it sound like i wont be seeing you for a while ive got things to do he only turned his back for a moment looking for something to say to her when he turned back to face her she was gone the door to a back room was closing behind her the cat was padding after her and he was left to show himself out so were still on for this evening right he called to her through the door to the back room silence as he walked to the front door he had to examine another set of facts she had been right about the manuscript being autobiographical certainly to the extent of the pregnancy and the dancing cat and right about the meeting the spontaneity of the act he had closed the door behind him and was standing at the elevator when he thought to go back to pound on her door and demand to know which one of them made the pencils fly she knew and only now he remembered the knife was still sitting on the coffee table why had she brought it back to the rosens apartment what had she been doing in the basement robert riccalo still managed to dominate the large room though he had retreated behind the financial pages of his newspaper which obscured all but his trouser legs and the green leather of his chair the chair was positioned like a throne and elevated above the cushions of the couch where his wife perched justin sat in a small wingback chair which might have been made with a childs size in mind the rustle of robert riccalos newspaper could be heard above the television chatter of a commercial for fabric softener every grunt or sigh from the throne called justins eyes up and away from his book each time he looked up he would catch his stepmother staring at him finding justin a hundred times more interesting than the television set which played on to no one all three heads turned in the same direction when they heard the crash of glass in the next room robert riccalo looked at his son who scrunched down in the chair sally riccalo was rigid as a board sitting ramrod straight at the edge of the couch cushion eyes fixed in the direction of the noise her long thin nose pointing to it like a compass for things that went bump in the night robert riccalo was first into the dining room pieces of blue glass lay on the marble tiles four of the longest shards were lined up in a row pointing toward the room he had just left now he turned quickly at the sound coming from his wife who stood behind him it was from deep inside of her a squeak that escaped her eyes fixed on the bits of broken glass justin was last to enter the room as the first shard of glass was inching along the floor toward sally riccalo she stood there paralyzed unmoving now she broke formation and pointed at justin its him hes doing this to me hes trying to kill me its him her finger pointed at the boy and robert riccalo turned to his son thunder brewing in his eyes justin fled the dining room and ran down the hall to his own room he turned the lock and strained to move furniture across the door justin his father bellowed justin the yelling was coming closer justin almost at the door now the doorknob moved as the lock was tried he listened to the large man turning on his heel footsteps fading off to get the key then robert riccalo was back and fitting a key into the lock justin backed up to the far wall as the door cracked against the dresser and that heavy piece of furniture was being moved slowly relentlessly out of his fathers way it was the fiveyearold who caught her attention when he yelled in anger i want to see the body and now mallory wanted to see it too she walked toward the group of pedestrians clotting the sidewalk in front of the next building the boy kicked the leg of a woman who held him by one arm the woman was of a different color and by her uniform a different piece of the planet earth one closer to the ground than the highrise strata where the child dwelled i will not go inside said the child balling his tiny fists now she noticed the long black coat of outstanding tailoring even by mallorys standards it was draped on the man who was pushing at the body with the tip of his umbrella is he dead asked the woman next to him drawing back is that why he smells no said another woman they all smell like that mallory pushed through the small group to see the umbrella successfully rolling the stiff body of a man the eyes were closed as if in sleep and there was no trauma to the grimy face no trace of insult at the prodding umbrella for he was dead the bottle by his side the spill of vomit and the ragged clothing told his story he had crawled into the bushes late at night and frozen to death too far gone with booze to seek better shelter or perhaps he had choked to death in the vomit the third shift doorman whose job in life was to drive off the poor had probably been sleeping on duty or reading his paper when the man had taken refuge from last nights snow beneath the slim cover of a bush the child was looking up at mallory having ferreted out some authority in her is the doorman gonna call the road kill wagon like he did for the dog what dog in the glee of a really great conspiracy the boy said i saw a dog murdered it happened right there he was pointing to the curb i was upstairs how far upstairs the nanny stepped forward he lives on the tenth floor he keeps going on about the dog but i dont know if he could have seen i did too see it and i wasnt on the tenth floor she just says that so my parents wont find out i was unsupervised said the child giving care to this last word which was obviously a newly acquired tool to blackmail the nanny that would explain why the nanny wouldnt fight back the kid had something on her i was standing in the hall on the third floor he said i looked down and the man was murdering the dog how he strangled it the dog pulled on the leash and i guess he didnt like that he lifted the dog up by the choke chain he lifted it right off the ground and the dog was kicking and kicking and then it stopped moving it was dead he kicked the body into the street i wanted to go see the body but the doorman wouldnt let me he said he was waiting for the road kill truck when was this i dont know mallory looked to the nanny now when did it happen the nanny shrugged it never happened he makes these things up i dont i dont said the boy with another wellplaced kick to the womans leg maybe i should talk to the doorman or his parents said mallory it was on the nineteenth said the nanny with instant recall the day it rained but neither doorman nor boy had been able to describe the dog and mallory knew the world would be a better place without the clutter of eyewitnesses the door was open mallory shifted the bag of groceries to one hip and pulled out her gun with the gun concealed by the bag she pressed through the door and into the apartment the concierge was standing in the front room when she came through the foyer now all of the room was exposed and she could see angel kipling opening the closet door looking for something the concierge spun around oh miss mallory pardon the intrusion but mrs kipling was sure she heard a scream coming from this apartment it must have been the cat said angel yeah thats it had to be you always keep him locked up in there its a big bathroom i dont want him shedding on the rosens furniture when the concierge had excused himself and closed the door behind him the woman turned on mallory we got your message what message dont be cute i saw the setup in there kipling nodded to the door of the den which was wide open most of us only have the one computer all the harassment comes over the computer it explains a lot so what do you want how much to keep quiet too good to be true pity the cameras werent rolling but whatever angel gave her couldnt be used against the husband id rather deal with your husband youre dealing with him im the husband in this relationship advancing on mallory angel kipling opened her mouth to say more but then she either lost her words or thought better of them the woman backed up in the way of the cat when mallorys glare said enough kipling stiffwalked to the door and slammed it behind her mallory walked into the kitchen and set down the grocery bag she laid the gun alongside it on the counter and put the perishables in the refrigerator the phone rang she let it she put the butter away and closed the door on the second ring she walked into the front room in her own time with no hurried motions the cat was pawing at the glass on the aquarium maddened by the swim of fish unable to get at them i know just how you feel said mallory on the fourth ring she picked up the receiver mallory its me justin it wasnt me that made the pencil fly what it wasnt me will you help me you know the conditions when youre ready to tell me the truth ill help you she heard the childs sudden intake of breath and then the connection was broken abruptly justin was forgotten in the next minute through the open door to the back room of the rosens den she could see the vase falling from the small table bouncing on the plush carpet strewing yellow roses and water damn cat but now she heard nose mewling from the room behind her she stared at the roses until she was distracted by the warning light from her computer system another fax was coming in she brought the fax up on her monitor it was addressed to judge heart the logo bore the name of a law journal and the text was a request for permission to reprint one of the judges papers in an upcoming edition she fed the fax into the graphics file where she cut and pasted the logo and signature on to a clean page and then she typed her own text the journal is considering a manuscript and we want to cover ourselves for libel there are only a few little things to clear up is it true that you beat your wife on a regular basis is it true that your mother died of a savage beating then she sat down to a quiet hour of computer terror tailoring new messages for the building bulletin board oh sweet jesus said riker as he approached mallorys door was that what he thought it was it was the genuine article all right he pressed the buzzer and pounded on the door mallory you in there when she opened the door he grinned mallory would never know the relief that was washing through his system shutting down all the reflexes that would have broken in the door if she hadnt been quick enough to answer it he pointed to the large scrawled x on her front door the marking could only be blood they could both tell catsup from death nice touch mallory said riker walking past her and heading toward the phone on the table by the door a little ostentatious but i like it the perp knows your name and where you live that wasnt enough you thought he might lose his way definitely a squirrel was all she said still staring at the x now lets have another little talk about your pet theory this guys stalking you it doesnt square with a frightened perp who kills in a panic and runs away its a different game maybe it is or maybe somebodys working with him okay two of the suspects are married say one of the wives is a different type of personality more like yours either shes a ballsy monster in her own right or she does whatever shes told still an open game huh or maybe youre shaking out too many trees you had to scare all three of them it never occurred to you someone else might come after you maybe with a multimilliondollar lawsuit against the city or a weapon he looked back to the door how long do you think its been there it wasnt there an hour ago when i got in riker was on the phone now saying ask heller if he can get down here maybe well get lucky if the blood is human it might be his he put down the phone and turned to mallory time for backup kid dont call me kid and im the low budget case remember you cant stay here alone any more i dont have that high an opinion of the perp look at this she pointed to the center of the bloody x on the door feathers our fearless perp murdered a bird so no backup im not letting anybody screw this up for me they were still playing backup no backup when heller arrived with his kit and began to scrape the samples off the door riker was worn down to okay no backup when heller left when do you figure to bag him maybe on sunday it figured that she would pick the day when god was resting not looking if she wasnt lying to him again the cat was purring around mallorys legs as she holstered her gun mallory picked the cat up in her arms nose nuzzled her face licking her skin with a pink sandpaper tongue eyes closed slowly in the cats idea of a smile mallory walked to the door of the bathroom held the cat out at arms length and dropped it on the tiles the cat stood up and began to dance riker whistled low has he ever done that before no kneeling down she took the paws in her hands and put them firmly on the floor the cat purred at her half closing its eyes again she stood up and now the cats eyes were open hurt as she was closing the door what did i do wrong asked a confusion of rounding eyes and jerking starts of the small head the paws rising the door shut if only she had been a woman of standard intelligence and ambition if only her countenance had not been the beautiful antithesis of his own clowns face if she had only been normal he would have given her everything he had but she was abnormal and deviant and if she wanted it he would give her everything he had he had known she wasnt coming at only five minutes past the hour now he measured the passage of time by the ice melt in the silver bucket the red wrapping on her gift looked pathetic to him now stupid box ridiculous thing sitting there all dressed up for a woman who didnt care to open it for an hour more he stared at the door she would never knock on and then he was pulling on his coat and opening the front door which he would not remember locking behind him because he hadnt he passed through the halls and down the stairs and into the dark to walk and think the night was crisp and cold to the north he could hear the bells of the convent on bleecker street and to the west the bells of st anthonys he was such a fool that he found the night romantic though he had no one to share it with and perhaps he never would mallory was everything riker said she was no heart no soft places he might reach of course she thought him a fool of course he was one he always said the wrong thing if only there were some aspect of her that was conventional a bit of sure ground that he could understand the cd player slammed on his thigh from the deep pocket of his coat he had thanked her for the gift but never used it well perhaps this bit of technology was the bridge to mallory he pulled it from his pocket set the earplugs in place and pushed the play button music poured into the center of his skull and seemed to be coming from everywhere at once it was wonderful it was all new again this music he had carried in his head since childhood and something new had been added to his homemade madness for a moment he forgot to breathe as he listened to that sound that was not music and neither car horn nor church bell he knew it was amandas footstep behind him even before she came abreast of him a delusion with audible footfalls her tread was too light and a bit off stride an as yet imperfect imitation of a living woman he turned away from her and turned the music off the footsteps vanished he kept his eyes otherway directed and focused his concentration on mallory she knew who made the pencils fly perhaps she also knew the dynamics of his small telekinetic family in a way that he could not was it signs of abuse she recognized in justin or as justin had said something she saw in the boy that she did not like in herself or was it something simple that allowed her to see what he could not something simple the absence of a heart sometimes they cant love back amanda said keeping time now with his own footsteps his delusion had a near human persistence amanda had come back to keep him company for a while he looked down at her sad face and fear of her turned into curiosity you werent loved back either were you no and when you came to know this man contempt killed what feelings you had for him am i right yes but you will never have contempt for mallory its not the same my contempt was for his weakness she has a terrible strength thats not quite in the normal scheme of things and frightening sometimes isnt it youre lost charles i was better off than you its better to have a definite end to the loving in the end it was only the child you cared about yes why then did you ask to have the child cut away from you he lied to me her footsteps made less noise now as she walked along beside a lonely man who cast one shadow for both of them he had gone to no trouble to create her this time and this should have worried him but he was oddly glad of her company do you know why she gave you my manuscript so i could give it a thorough read maybe find something of value to the investigation you know she read every page before she gave it to you of course she did it was the love of the child she couldnt fathom she couldnt understand how i could want to build plans for a lifetime around the future of an unborn baby but mallory was a much loved child helen and louis were devoted to her yes after the damage had been done to her out on the street what about mallorys own mother how was a child so quick so beautiful left wandering the streets she was the child women pray for how was she let go if youre still looking for the link to the boy it might lie in her history what do you really know about her early days charles sighed mallory is an intensely private person her history was never open to discussion if you could bend your mind outside the parameters of fact and logic you might reach the conclusion that mallorys mother is dead perhaps murdered i think thats a bit farfetched amanda is it shes predicting violence in the riccalo family you see a link between her and the boy theyve both lost their mothers doesnt it make you wonder what sent her into the street a small child on the run what was she running from perhaps she was abused as a child by her mother no she loved helen on first sight someone taught her to trust women like helen markowitz the nurturer healer of scraped knees lover of children suppose mallory saw her mother killed oh this is absolute rot there are no facts to support that line of reasoning next youll be telling me that justin saw his mother die and thats the common bond as though mallory could read that in his mind maybe they read one anothers eyes dont they both have the look of damage justin doesnt behave much like a child does he he doesnt have a childs conversations theres another commonality mallory was the same way wasnt she the purpose of creating you was to find out who killed you yes but was that your idea she only gave you my manuscript when she realized that once you had this intimate piece of me you could do the succubus illusion could she be that convoluted mallory certainly all those prompts about malakhai what else could that have been about hed been had amanda nodded her understanding and walked ahead of him and what about you amanda he called after her who killed you how could you be killed that way and why he lied to me he was too tired to sustain her and thus restrain her unable to keep her with him he watched her go into the shadows she was of such frail substance she was killed by the first patch of darkness she encountered to be abandoned by two women in one day he stared at his shoes for a moment as he walked on in and out of the light lost for a while in thoughts of mallory he meandered south and east for too many blocks into territory he was unsure of unsafe in when at last his eyes were looking outward again and he realized this he found he didnt care and he was only dimly aware that the time was passing from christmas eve into christmas morning he shuffled through the pile of newspapers close to the brick of a building wall and then he went sprawling the cement came up to meet his face with a hard hello something small and alive was squirming out from under his splayed legs she was standing in front of him now and wearing a little red coat oh dear god he had tripped over the body of a child she must have been sleeping under the newspapers he was staring into the smudged face of a little girl with matted hair and the biggest eyes hed ever seen she might be six or seven the child was extending a cup to him it was torn and jingled with change it took him a moment to grasp the idea that the little girl was begging for money that she was thin and shivering wheres your mother why are you now the child was backing away from him bright eyes quick with intelligence had sized him up for a nondonating type and maybe an authority type and possibly even a cop or worse a social worker as quickly as he realized all of this was going on behind her eyes he was watching the back of her as she slipped away in the dark he found his feet and gathered himself up to a stand and ran after her pounding down the sidewalk in and out of the black and bright zones of street lamps intact and broken in one of these dark patches she had disappeared he stopped to listen for her soft footfalls silence now a jingle he looked up to see her straddling the top of a chainlink fence and he held his breath as she monkeyed down the links with amazing speed he came up to the fence in time to see the small red coat flapping around a corner in the distance and now the child was altogether gone and with her a ghost of mallorys christmas past oh fool his head bowed into the cold metal of the fence his eyes closed tightly his heart was breaking fool her eyes were not a christmas green nor the green of living things but cold and just now eerie the lights from the dashboard made them glitter in the shadows they seemed lit from within as though mother nature had thought to do something different with the makings of mallory to break up the monotony of stereotypes and throw an occasional scare into riker you know mallory if i thought you had a heart id think you were worried about me offering myself for the holidays yeah right said the dip of her mouth on one side and no words necessary he closed the passenger door of her small tan car i wont be a minute just a few things to pick up for breakfast he turned and walked toward the dim glow behind the plateglass window of the bar he peered in and waved one hand peggy leaned her broom against the bar and waved back to him he ambled toward the front door the beer hed already put away had numbed him he was only dimly aware of the teenage boy thirty yards to his right now he looked casually toward the boy the kid was looking in all directions probably waiting for someone riker looked back to mallory who was lost in the darkness of the car the bartender opened the door and he walked in whos your friend riker asked peggy looking over his shoulder riker slowly turned his head to see the teenager behind him peggy was not so slow not drunk at all and she was backing up to the bar where she kept her shotgun too late for that now he was watching the boy reaching into his jacket hand closing on the gun in his belt riker wondered if it would be the fast reflexes of youth that would kill him or could he put it down to his own slowed reaction time too much booze either way the young thief would have him all this was calculated in the second it took for the boys hand to pass into his jacket just another second out of sixty the boy never got the chance to pull the gun suddenly a rush of manic energy with bright curls was pushing the boy through the open doorway slamming him into the near table so hard mallory nearly cut him in half at the gut level she reached into the jacket and pulled out a revolver now she was cuffing him and hustling him out of the door momentum stunned wonder and pain had made the boy docile riker never said a word to peggy he lifted his hands to catch the brown bag with his breakfast sixpack on the fly as he followed mallory and her new pet out to the sidewalk hey whats the deal here mallory was pressing down on the boys head to ease him into the front seat of the car on the passenger side any kid who watched too much television would know the perp rode in the back of the car what was she up to she opened the back door of the car for riker and said sorry about the inconvenience sir ill get rid of him as soon as i can since when did mallory ever call anybody sir she hadnt called him that even when hed held the rank of captain but that was one wife and how many bottles ago he nodded and settled into the back seat to play out her game when mallory was in the drivers seat she leaned over to the boy and said in a low voice its too bad you had to witness the deputy police commissioner drunk in an afterhours bar i guess ill have to kill you you understand dont you its politics and nothing personal as mallory drove the streets riker watched the boys face the kid was sweating and his body was weaving between this is crap and true believing its a damn shame you had to pull this stunt on a night when a top cop is drunk in the back of my car yeah i guess ill have to kill you it was ludicrous but now riker realized that this boy was so young it had not been so many years ago that he had bought into santa glaus and the tooth fairy and then the kid had additional proof in mallorys eyes the eyes of an assassin yeah the kid was buying it riker felt a worry coming on in the pit of his stomach where he kept his ulcer she hadnt waited for the kid to pull the gun to commit the crime she hadnt read the suspect his rights shed broken every rule and now she was making up new ones to break well he could relax a little she wouldnt actually kill the kid because markowitz wouldnt have liked that in the absence of a normal sense of right and wrong good and evil mallory was much guided by what would have pissed off markowitz and what wouldnt now they were in the wall street area deserted on christmas eve she pulled into a blind street closed off by construction signs her eyes roved over the bins of debris left on the site no not here she said sorry its taking so long sir ill get rid of him on the next block okay i wont tell screamed the kid mallory said nothing as the minutes rolled by slow with the creep of the car stopping in dark places shaking her head and driving on i gotta wonder where that gun came from she said at last and i gotta wonder what youve done with it riker found it interesting the way her expensive education fell away at warm moments like this one her voice had a rough edge that would scare any sane person into backing off with no sudden movements he could only guess at what was going through the kids mind his own body was pressing into the upholstery of the back seat mallory and the perp looked so young to him with their unlined faces and blond hair they might have been brother and sister but he could almost feel the car dip to one side with the power on the drivers end of the front seat are you in a lot of pain asked mallory her voice switching gears all mother love in her tone yeah my gut hurts something awful said the boy good i noticed there werent any bullets in the gun thats not too bright is it the kid looked from the gun to mallory and back to the gun genuinely startled so you stole the gun but not the bullets when i wash this registration number through the computer am i gonna find out that some taxpayer was burgled by a moron who thinks the gun makes its own bullets what else did you steal nothing i didnt riker jolted forward as mallory slammed on the brakes the boy didnt fare as well with hands cuffed behind him his head hit the dashboard the boy moaned and riker looked away the better not to see mallory drawing first blood of christmas morning wall street was a ghost town after the financial houses end of business day you could do what you liked in this neighborhood without fear of another pair of eyes mallory leaned over to grab the boy by his shirt collar you are stupid when i run the gun through you think they wont mention the rest of the stuff it was nothing there was a ring and a bracelet but it was junk i took it to a jeweler he said id be better off selling it at a flea market and thats the truth ive known him all my life he wouldnt lie to me riker shook his head and smiled a baby felon who took stolen goods to his neighborhood jeweler the criminal class was getting dumber every year and no bullets didnt these kids learn anything in school he listened as mallory called in on her car phone to run the dates and the jewelry description but she neglected to mention that she had the suspect in custody and she never mentioned she had the gun and at the last she said sorry it doesnt match up and closed the call it checks out she said to the boy im gonna cut you loose but you never tell anyone you saw the deputy police commissioner drunk in an afterhours bar deal the kid nodded his head like a trick pony yeah whatever she wanted so long as she didnt hurt him any more riker stopped smiling he sat still in the dark at the back of the car and tried not to lose the glow of the previous sixpack of beer no good he was becoming unwillingly sober as he crept up on mallorys mind of course it all fit it was only the thiefs gun she wanted he rolled his eyes up to the ceiling of the car ah markowitz you bastard how could you die on me and stick me with your kid can you hear me you son of a bitch look at what your babys doing now shes robbing another baby if i dont see you when i count to ten i dont shoot you okay she leaned across him to open the door on his side of the car riker listened to the metallic mechanics of mallory unlocking the irons she sat back but the boy was tied to the upholstery by fear and she had to finally cut the cords with get out you idiot the boy did his dumbpony nod again as he was half falling half stumbling from the car he staggered in a weaving line for all the seconds it took to understand that he was free and then he ran riker got out of the car and slid into the front seat ill take the gun mallory no its mine you never planned to take him in and that wasnt to save me the embarrassment of showing up at the station house drunk everyone already knows im a drunk no you wanted his gun for a throwaway piece you wanna save it for the perp in the condo now if ive got this wrong just stop me but he wasnt about to let her stop him and he went on with the relentless energy of a train running at her full speed because it was the only way to deal with her if he lost his breath he lost his turn and the train would turn around and crush him you figure the perps weapon of choice is his hands if you have to kill an unarmed man the civilian review board will get you but if you pull another gunslinger stunt lets say you get him in the knees coffey will get you for it hell lock you up in the computer room and youll never see the street again almost seems like you cant win but if the perp has a weapon lying on the floor beside him if it looks like he brought his own gun to the party you cant lose can you she wouldnt look at him markowitz never carried a throwaway piece not in all the time he put in on the force he hung out there in the breeze with all the rest of us he played it straight and that took guts maybe you dont have the stuff kathy did you learn anything hanging out with the old man anything at all kathy mallory to you she corrected him youre going to give me that gun or ill beat the crap out of you and take it i loved markowitz longer than you knew him im not gonna let his kid screw up give it to me you know i dont bluff never have never will nothing she was rigid deaf and blind to him now mallory or it starts to get real ugly she handed him the gun and merry christmas to you too riker the device on his belt gave off the annoying beeps the mechanical nagging request to call in and quickly he picked up the car phone and dialed the number for special crimes section yeah he said into the receiver i know him no its no problem im on my way to mallory he said charles is at the station he needs something and says ill vouch for him you coming no ill drop you off trouble between you and him charles asked for you not me he doesnt need my help he made that pretty clear when he stepped out of her car ten minutes later he leaned down to say softly have you given any thought to the toy gun on the inventory sheet her eyes shone with sudden understanding she smiled slow and sly he really hated it when she did that charles sat on a yellow plastic chair which was too small to accommodate his long body his legs crossed and uncrossed tucked in and splayed out looking for a way to look unfoolish at three in the morning there was a constant activity under the bright fluorescent lights a woman wrapped in a blanket and screaming walked past between two uniformed officers a dazed and docile teenager was led along by a plain clothes detective charles knew slightly two tourists came in yelling by the snippets of their conversation he deduced that they were minus their luggage wallets and jewelry next in the parade two young men in handcuffs were escorted by four officers merry christmas said the bright silver paper letters strung over the desk of the civilian clerk who had taken his report charles looked down at the lines and pockmarks on the floor until he saw the familiar scuffed pair of worn brown shoes topped by a bad suit and a cloud of beer that was rikers breath riker nodded to him and walked on in the company of the two officers who had tried to reason with charles and failed to communicate that there was no way to catch a kid who didnt want to be caught they had no problem catching grownup felons they told him but kids could fit into hiding places they had never dreamed of then in desperation charles had resorted to the crime of name dropping one phone call from the desk sergeant and only minutes later here was riker the improbable knight now riker was sitting down at a desk and nodding amiably as the two officers leaned down to tell him all their problems with his friend the lunatic riker picked up the phone and charles watched him make three calls in quick succession on the fourth call riker smiled into his telephone eased back in his chair and put his feet up on the desk his hand waved to tell the officers they could go on about their business in parting one officer put a friendly grip on rikers shoulder riker set down the phone after another minute and motioned charles over to the desk he picked up the sheet of paper which charles recognized as his report and began to read it aloud so your small friend had a little red coat that didnt quite fit right mismatched shoes and socks matted brown hair and light colored eyes riker did a double take on the next line she was unwashed malnourished but excellent motor skills good reflexes three feet six inches tall approximately seven years old and in a big hurry yes thats her and she had head lice charles you left that out i found her you done good you scared the little brat right into a shelter for runaways they know this kid as a regular she came in with big eyes and gave them this fairy story about being chased by a giant i guess that was you i didnt mean to frighten her good thing you did shell get a hot meal and a bed what else can i do nothing charles youll never see that kid again youll never find out what happened to her i wont even give you the name of the shelter because a deal is a deal normally they wont tell us anything at all you see we hold the legal position that the kid belongs to the parent the shelters sometimes take the view diat the kid will live longer if we butt out but this supervisor owes me one so with the understanding that we never had this conversation i tell her about my crazy friend who wants to turn nypd upside down to keep a kid off the street on christmas morning and she asks me how tall you are im a fool dont ever change ive ruined your holiday my wife left me on christmas day it isnt much of a holiday for me let me buy you a drink i insist on paying no my treat im gonna get you the best scotch money can buy come with me they passed through the swinging doors that led down the familiar corridor on the way to special crimes section when markowitz was alive charles had been this way many times up the narrow staircase and into the cavern of dimmer lights and dead quiet broken now by the plaintive ringing of a single telephone two detectives sat alone in separate pools of light on the other side of the wide room one lifted his head and waved to riker riker opened the door to jack coffeys office which had once been markowitzs office he sat down in the chair behind the desk and seemed at home as he pulled out a wire jiggled the lock on the bottom drawer of the desk and extracted a bottle and a halfempty package of plastic cups charles folded his long frame into the opposite chair smiling and utterly companionable in this small criminal activity he accepted one of the poured shots and lifted his plastic cup in a toast merry christmas riker merry christmas charles riker downed his shot and smiled so whats the problem between you and mallory anything i can help you with we had an argument at the wrong time shes not speaking to me did she tell you about the riccalo boy flying objects and no hands in play yeah theres something she sees in the boy that i cant see something like a memory a kinship or a likeness i need to know what the link is but shes not talking to me any more what should i do apologize oh no worst possible idea you dont ever want to lose face with her never show a weakness then what do i do what makes you think theres a tie well its not logical of course ive got nothing to support the idea but i do believe she sees something of herself in the boy you mean the kids a monster i was thinking along the lines of abuse do you know what her past was like before she went to live with louis any clue at all markowitz did wonder about it he spent a lot of time trying to trace her helen was hot to adopt the kid but mallory wouldnt cooperate not even for helen she would have died for helen but never told her a thing after a while markowitz and mallory came to an understanding it was her history not his and he backed off did he ever speculate on it he respected the kid whatever he figured out he never let on never shared you think child abuse couldve been a factor in her early history if anyone had tried to abuse her the bastard couldve figured on losing an arm no charles you only think im kidding i watched her grow up but surely when markowitz pulled the kid off the street he recognized her position on the food chain she was a baby predator mallory may rack up suspensions but shell never lose her job with nypd none of us could stand the strain of having her on the other side all you need is a few simple rules dont ever let her down dont ever rat her out and dont ever trust her was riker changing the subject or was this his imagination i need her connection to the boy this is very important riker pulled out his wallet which was falling apart at the creases and slid a photograph out of the cracked plastic holder maybe youve seen this before its the one markowitz always carried thats what the brat looked like at ten see anything familiar charles stared at the photograph she had been so defiant when she posed for it yes there was an unsettling aspect of the boy in mallory that same look of damage riker do you think its possible that mallory witnessed a murder when she was a child riker spilled a portion of his drink and it was not from lack of coordination wasting liquor was a breach of rikers religion curious riker reached down into the drawer and pulled out a brown bag upending it and spilling a passel of deli napkins on the desk he kept his eyes down as he mopped the desk with the napkins buying the time to recompose himself now he shrugged as he looked up at charles she was out on the street for years she couldve seen a murder i guess she never said perhaps i should ask edward slope hes known her as long as you have and now something in rikers face said he wished charles wouldnt do that what might riker be holding out on him charles looked down at a roll of paper in the path of the spreading puddle he picked it up it was a computer printout and scrolling on forever the words said i promise to shoot to kill i promise to shoot to kill line after line charles held the roll up to riker what lunatic did this mallory said riker turns out the kid has a sense of humor after all coffey reamed her out and she dropped that on his desk the next day why is coffey angry with her for not killing the mugger he was holding a gun on an elderly man and she coffey figured she was playing with the perp and she was i backed her on that one but coffey was right she screwed up when you draw a gun to shoot an armed perpetrator youre trained to shoot for the widest part of the body the best shot you can place to stop the perp cold that sounds pretty brutal it is you may only have that one chance to save your life and every civilian in the area is in your care when you draw that gun from the moment she arrived on the scene that old man the victim was in her care if shed blown the shot the old man wouldve taken the bullet after hers all the people on the civilian review board yeah the review board the citys grand experiment with amateurs so this week mallorys a hero but if the perp isnt happy with the crook of his little finger after the surgery on his gun hand hell sue the city for a million dollars it happens your highminded civilians will remember theyre also taxpayers theyll turn on her every one of them will curse her for not killing the perp because dead men dont sue i love this town what am i going to do about her she knows something crucial about justin but she wont talk to me learn to think like mallory how can i i dont have an underprivileged childhood to draw on and i still dont know much about hers charles youre a very smart man i think thats why lou asked you to look after her now think shes too old to need a nanny right the old man figured you were the only one with a prayer of outsmarting her he left her to you not one of his old cronies like doc slope yes he would have been my choice edward slope is a very intelligent man true hes a smart old bastard so why not him you wonder you always hear him bitching about her defects he can see every scam coming right right in case you hadnt noticed she walks all over him hed break his hippocratic oath for mallory and the rabbi would take her side against gods riker finished his shot and poured another his red eyes rolled up to charles with a question which could only be and what would you do for mallory chapter december all women are bitches only death made them beautiful that stunned look when they knew death was coming when they could see it hear it coming for them only then did he respect them for this experience this knowledge which had eluded him to be dead to be nothing never to be challenged again to actually watch life leave the body was his obsession but this too had eluded him for in death they might only have been asleep the women had taken the secret with them bitches unwilling to share perhaps one day one of them would tell him what it was like as it was happening to her perhaps the next one he plotted against her as he opened his drawer to find his socks as he pulled on his pants as he buttoned his shirt he schemed as he ate his morning meal and it went sour in his stomach he kicked a small animal and heard his enemy screaming he looked at sharp knives with longing and stuck one into a piece of fruit many times he killed her a hundred times a day and the animals the fruit and the insects all suffered for it sandstone carvings graced the elaborate structures extending as curving arms from either side of the wide staircases running down into the plaza the vast public space was presided over by a bronze angel high atop the bethesda fountain her wings were unfurled her robes were rippled and there was debate as to whether she danced or not from the cover of high ground and stonework mallory looked down at the man in the plaza he was the only one walking the paving stones casting a weak shadow from the morning sun riding low in its winter orbit he checked his watch and sat down on the edge of the fountains wide pool the angel of bethesda loomed behind him some twenty feet or more above his head the waters of the ancient biblical bethesda were said to have healing powers mallory figured those waters would be wasted on a sick bastard like palanski the things she suspected him of were a crime in every philosophy under heaven mallory lifted the antique opera glasses to her eyes bored silly by opera she had finally found a practical use for this gift from charles she cared nothing for the delicate settings of tiny pearls and precious stones it was the resolution of the lenses she approved of she could pick out the mole on one side of palanskis face and now she scanned the rest of the plaza the sky was overcast blunting the sun and giving its light an eerie quality as it flooded the stone floor there were only occasional moments when the sun could create a shadow and then the clouds would thicken and uncreate it now a woman passed near mallorys position mallory turned to see the back of her walking along the path leading to the wide staircase the womans carrotred hair was piled on top of her head she was small only five foot if that and thin a short leather hooker skirt rode high above the bare gooseflesh legs the backs of her knees bore the bruises of the needle another trademark of a hooker the woman passed behind a bank of decorative stone which obscured half the staircase protecting her from mallorys view as the small prostitute cleared this facade mallory raised her binoculars to her face not a woman beneath the penciled dark eyebrows the eyeliner and the smear of red lipstick that was her mouth was the face of a child how old could she be twelve or thirteen years the light brown eyes had the look of a stunned animal her face was in a junkie sweat though the air was cold and her thin closefitting jacket could offer little warmth mallory slipped the opera glasses into her pocket and wondered how long it had been since the baby whore last had a fix of the needle palanski rose to a stand as the girl made her way down the stairs and along the wide stone floor her hand rose in a vague gesture of recognition and then fell back to her side mallory slipped along the footpath leading down into the plaza on palanskis blind side she was in the open now with no cover as she silently walked the stones skirting the fountain she was moving faster now the little prostitute took no notice legs in motion but mind in limbo eyes blank and staring at nothing moving slowly toward palanski whose hand delved into his pocket and produced the lure in a sudden cloudbreak the bronze angel cast a long shadow across the pool of water the tips of its wings lighting on the stone under mallorys running feet the little girl was within two yards of palanski when mallory rushed the child and gripped her by one arm which was bone thin beneath the light material of the sleeve when the girl looked up a badge was thrust in her face the girl body and soul crumpled under mallorys hand in the same dispirited resignation of her older peers her sisters the adult whores for this was part of the job wasnt it the arrest palanski was gaping at mallory as she pocketed her shield his eyes were panic wide and disbelieving he took one step forward instinctive reflex sent her free hand to the holster inside her jacket he stopped dead she watched his darting eyes and knew he was framing the story to explain this away as his mouth opened mallory said dont even think about lying to me i know what you did palanski turned willing his feet to move at first trapped on his toes for a full second then breaking into a jog and now sprinting across the plaza three packets of jettisoned white powder floated on the fountains waters you better run you son of a bitch mallorys scream echoed off the stones of the cold and desolate plaza wherein she kept company with a blind bronze angel and a small child with faraway eyes betty hyde waited by the entrance as arthur opened the door for an elderly tenant and her dog then a woman with groceries and a man with a briefcase the last stragglers of the morning she looked across the street to the place which had been bloodied more than a month ago on the night annie franz was run down by a drunken driver now there was no more traffic through the door to the coventry arms arthur had his smile in place as she walked over to him good morning miss hyde good morning arthur lovely day isnt it a fifty dollar bill found its way from bettys purse into arthurs pocket in the new york sleight of hand which outoftowners mistook for a handshake yes maam it is indeed a lovely day correct me if im mistaken but didnt you switch shifts with bertram on the night mrs franz died i seem to remember you were on duty that night yes miss hyde you have a good memory so you must have seen the whole thing i saw everything every detail i was able to give the police a complete description of the drunken driver and the numbers on the license plate they caught him within the hour you know it happened right over there arthur pointed to the park side of the street and continued in the wellworn patter of a tour guide it was in the morning and mrs franz was a little unsteady on her feet im not saying she was drunk mind you no arthur would never say that betty nodded her encouragement to go on well they were arguing again there had been no argument in erics version when she had given him shelter from the press and the police she had called her own personal physician to treat him for shock in erics version he and annie had been discussing the first draft of his new book she thought it was the best thing id ever written and that same line had found its way into subsequent interviews with eric on the talk show circuit circus following the death of his wife so the arguments getting pretty loud by now said arthur she stumbled back a bit and then she was standing in the street annie said she had dropped her purse in the street she went back to get it eric had told her tears streaming down his face behind him was the million dollar view from her apartment the skyline and the bluegold spectacle of dawn as he described the sickening sound of his wifes body hitting the car arthur was now slipping into the mode of a broadcaster describing a sporting event instead of a death so hes still on the sidewalk hes looking straight at her and right into the lights of the oncoming car i remember the look on his face with the headlights shining in his eyes as the car is coming to kill his wife it would have been so weird if you didnt know mr franz was blind he was three feet away but that was close enough to pull her back or at least warn her but he couldnt know the car was coming because he couldnt see did the police ever ask you about it yes maam a few questions i talked to the uniformed officers and then later a detective tall thin fellow but at the time they were all more interested in the hitandrun vehicle and the police had not paid him for the entire monologue the blow by blow account on the death of a woman arthur must have hated as much as he liked eric franz everyone liked eric later the detective came back to ask if i could corroborate the statements of the other drivers you know there were three vehicles in all but of course the papers got it all wrong well she had her back turned when the drunks car ran her down she flew about twenty feet in that direction arthur pointed north she wondered if he was aware of the fact that he was smiling as he warmed to the subject of the flying body mrs franz landed on a southbound van the van driver put his vehicle up on the curb and wrecked the awning support for the building next door she fell off the van and into the path of a vintage silver jaguar her dress got snagged up in the rear wheels and the jaguar dragged her for maybe fifteen feet before he stopped very confidential now just between the two of them she was still breathing miss hyde that wasnt in the papers either she didnt die until just before the ambulance arrived betty nodded of course it would take at least three vehicles to kill annie franz and it was so fitting that the last one was shaped like a silver bullet did mrs franz say anything before she died i dont think so youd have to ask the police department or maybe that detective could help you he was the first one on the scene piece of luck i think he said he was just passing by i believe he gave her first aid while we waited for the ambulance and what was eric doing while this was going on he was just standing there he was in shock of course one of the uniformed police officers was trying to take a statement from him but i think he was having trouble making sense of the whole thing and that was when you came down and took him away from the policeman yes he was in shock poor eric said betty it must have been so hard on him if only hed been able to see he could have saved her mallory leaned down to the drivers window of the cab this is police business im commandeering the cab no english said the driver police thrusting her shield and id into the cabbys face she said badge so now you know english as she was handcuffing the girl to the handle of the cab door the cabbie was protesting in his native tongue which had many accompanying hand gestures and one of them was obscene in any language mallory crossed the street to the pay phone after five minutes of conversation she was back at the cab door undoing the cuffs and giving directions to the driver no english he said she opened the door and jerking on the material of his coat she spilled his short body out on to the street you want to ride in the back seat or the trunk if you dont tell me now ill decide for you oh and i noticed the hack license picture isnt your face maybe this is a stolen cab i guess ill ride in the back seat said the driver rising to his feet and reaching for the handle of the back door but mallory and the girl were already in the front seat and the cab was pulling away from the curb why didnt you call for a police car said the girl who had been silent till now paperwork said mallory if i go through the paperwork i have to turn you in youre already dope sick if i turn you in youll be in custody when the real misery comes on is that what you want the girl turned her face to the window i didnt think so said mallory i want to know what kind of business you do with palanski he wasnt meeting you in a public place for sex the girl kept her silence pressing angry lips together a prelude to a tantrum and taunting evidence that this was still a child if youre thinking palanski will get you out he wont hell be keeping a low profile for the next few days and if youre thinking hell kill you for talking youve got good instincts but i wont let that happen i suppose you want my life story too whats a kid like me doing in a no i know your story all the stories are the same you cant go home again nothing passed between them until mallory was taking the cab out of manhattan through the twilight lamps of the lincoln tunnel it wouldnt do any good to tell on him said the girl no one would take my word against a cop youre right about that palanski would say you were just an informant hed get off with a reprimand for not turning you over to juvenile officers unless there was someone else to corroborate your testimony the johns would never talk thats nuts rich bastards theyd and now she shut her mouth again knowing shed said too much mallory smiled okay lets see if i can work this out palanski lined up the johns for you he does the background work shadows them gets to know their habits then he tells you where to plant yourself so theyll run into you does he feed you lines too or do you know how to get them to take you home the girls head lolled to one side as she closed her eyes i give them all the same line its cold mister do you know how i can get out of the cold and maybe get something to eat sometimes they just give me money one of them tried to flag down a cop car and i had to run for it palanski screws up sometimes but youd be surprised how many men want to take me out of the cold then palanski shows up at the johns door the next day right he shows them a mug shot and the date of birth how old are you thirteen and the johns pay up and they pay well he wouldnt even need to solicit the bribe this was new york city and they all knew the drill the wallets had flown from their pockets the money had spilled into palanskis outstretched hand and he had tipped his hat and smiled on his way out the door where are you taking me the girls eyes were open now and looking out the windows on a landscape that was not manhattan any more someplace safe a friend of mine arranged for you to spend a few days in the country a few days is all im gonna need i cant go three days without a i know mallory reached inside her jacket and pulled out the three bags of white powder she had retrieved from the waters of bethesda she showed them to the girl and put them back in her pocket by the time the car pulled into the circular drive she knew the girls name was fay and fay could never go home if she did her mother the drunk would beat her to death or perhaps the mothers new boyfriend might get first dibs on the girls young body mallory pulled up in front of the large and graceful old building with a white georgian facade edward slopes car was parked near the freestanding wooden sign mayfair research facility what kind of a place is this mallory kept silent until she and the girl were in the lobby which might have passed for the ground floor of a fashionable hotel when the girl saw the first whitecoated attendant she tried to bolt she pulled at mallorys hand which would not release her now the attendant had fay by both arms and was forcing her down the hall and away as she screamed out to mallory you said you wouldnt turn me in you promised you promised she broke free of the attendant and ran to mallory we had a deal you promised she was crying now the garish makeup washing down her face like yesterdays halloween mask she was stripped to childhood again she wrapped her arms around mallorys waist as the attendant tried to pull her away dr edward slope was glaring at mallory i told you to prepare her for this you never listen to me or anyone else he sat down on his heels and gently turned the face of the child toward his own you think its going to hurt it wont i want you to go with this man youre already feeling sick arent you yes i can see that hes going to give you something to take the pain away itll never hurt you again you have my word on that she loosened her grip on mallory but the look of betrayal remained a deal had been broken nothing would change that and they both knew it when she was gone down the hall with the attendant slope turned to mallory theres a limit to my influence here but i pulled every string i could i just hope you know what youre doing an underage jane doe is illegal as hell so im passing her off as a relative incognito shes in the program but only for the three days of detox what then i hadnt thought that far ahead i just need her off the street for a couple of days oh and i need a polaroid of the kid can you manage that for me yes of course but what happens to the child when the three days are up i dont know ive got enough problems right now kathy sometimes i think youre growing into a real human being and then you exasperate me this way you got her this far thats good but after the detox what then you cant just dump off a little girl like she was a sack of potatoes doris does all the cooking in your house thats her job right what mallorys hands went to her hips her words had a cautioning edge if youd ever tried to prepare a meal youd know what an art form it really is making every dish come out at the same time her voice was on the rise now and angry well im cooking ive got six dishes going at six different speeds and they all have to be done at exactly the same time or the whole thing falls apart on me one long fingernail jabbed at his chest you go do your own damn job get off my back and the cook with a gun walked through the lobby and out the front door today mallory had only one message for each of her suspects she blocked out the bulletin board they would access on their screens and tapped in the code to call up the dummy board it displayed only one sentence repeated over and over again i have a witness and that was no lie if cats counted though the hallway was generous in width pansy heart pressed her body to the wall as her husband walked by his face was red his eyes hard and he walked heavy on his feet sending one fist to the wall a scant few inches from where she stood in the room he had left the computer screen was blank once more what had been the message this time a door slammed at the other end of the hall she jumped as though she had trod on a live wire she gripped the edge of the hall table feeling empty and airy inside believing that she might fly upward without this solid anchor of oak her heart was knocking on the wall of her chest it was natural to be thinking of her motherinlaw on that last day of the old womans life in that moment when the organs were shutting down one by one there had been an inner knowledge of impending death in the ancient eyes only minutes before terror had lived in that deeply lined face then the lines had smoothed out and in the eyes was not peace but triumph and then her motherinlaw had died escaped angel kipling paced up and down the carpet before her husband harry dont tell me you dont know what this is about she held up the printout from the computer a single sentence repeated one hundred times across the sheet a witness to what what have you done her voice was in the whining mode and threatened to climb into a scream harry kipling was buttoning his shirt in front of the mirror now he sought out her reflection behind his own its not addressed to me is it angels lip was curling as he turned around to face her in the flesh she placed her hands on her wide hips and her robe fell open to display the ponderous breasts sagging against the thick body his eyes dropped to the opening in the robe and he quickly turned away from her she winced as though she had been slapped as he left the fulllength mirror to examine his tie rack angel stood alone in the glass staring at her reflection she had not yet put on the armature of makeup and her hair was wild with snarls she closed the robe quickly and addressed her husband in a smaller voice this time its not another bank card scam is it harry youre not having trouble living on your allowance money are you it had cost her a fortune to clean up after his last foray into creative banking that or face the scandal and the stockholders and she had never believed the stolen money was gone spent was he amassing capital for a getaway no he would never leave her he would never stray far from the source of unlimited wealth he ignored her and continued the business of tying his tie an odd and useless preoccupation for a man who had no occupation no business to conduct and now she forgot that she was ugliest in the morning most vulnerable without her magic makeup answer me you prick you dont want me to cut off your allowance again do you angel i have no idea whats going on its probably a prank some kid in the building its another bank swindle isnt it i thought i made it very clear what would happen if you tried this one more time you wont like being poor again harry i havent done anything she pulled a crumple of computer paper from her robe pocket and thrust it at him this was faxed yesterday its an application for a credit card and the form is addressed to you i havent applied for any credit cards read it he accepted the ball of paper and made a small production out of smoothing it over the surface of the bedside table under the heading of pertinent information it read first tell us why you did it please print or type your confession in the space provided he picked up the sheet of paper bringing it close to his eyes examining the logo of the credit card company which appeared at the top of the page the next line read does your wife know what you did if so we have provided additional space for her comments now he stared at the short list of questions why did you lie would you do it again if we gave you the chance he lowered the page and then looked up as angel paced back and forth across the rug with barely contained fury and now this message on the building bulletin board the words exploded from her mouth what does it mean she looked down at the most recent message clutched in her hand i have a witness a witness to what talk to me harry or ill cut off your allowance and then ill cut off your balls eric franz was slow to answer his door betty hyde could hear him walking toward the foyer a shuffle of hard soles on marble when the door did open he was looking over her shoulder as though just missing her with his eyes a sheet of paper was wadded in his hand his face was a mask the room behind him was dark but for the constant glow of the computers everopen eye if she knew you were digging into her past it could end your friendship said rabbi david kaplan i only want the connection between the boy and mailory said charles butler the rabbis den was a place where books lived they were not kept to the shelves but quietly gathered in stacks on every surface of the room perched in groups of agreeable subjects a single leatherbound volume lay open on the desk patiently awaiting the rabbis return to the interrupted business of scholarship perhaps the connection between them is only a simple commonality said the rabbi the difference in their backgrounds doesnt leave room for much in common all children have a commonality in innocence i wouldnt describe either of them as innocent the boy talks like a fortyyearold man and mallory is mallory perhaps they share the innocence of good and evil thats the first time ive heard the word innocence so connected with evil take helens view of kathy helen could see nothing bad in the child helen always said no one had ever explained the rules to kathy and she was close to the truth these concepts of good and evil right and wrong heaven and hell what is that to a child on the street living by wit and theft when she first came to live with louis and helen her behavior sometimes bordered on that of feral children raised apart from humans what about the natural mother is it possible she abused her child perhaps that would explain a lot of the damage charles i know nothing about the natural mother kathy has never once spoken about this woman suppose you had to speculate on her parents just based on what you know of her what would you say we assumed kathy had been on the street for three or four years before markowitz arrested her she was a tenyearold thief she tried to lie her way to twelve and markowitz let her get away with eleven but she stole that year now we know shed never been to a formal school helen had her evaluated at the learning center but someone had taught her to read and write at a very early age she also had an astonishing natural aptitude for mathematics that was why helen and louis spent more than they could afford on private schools they were afraid her gifts would wither in the public school system with one teacher to every fifty children the rabbi went to the shelf and took a box from among the books from it he withdrew papers this is a sample of kathys handwriting at ten its not the hand of a child someone took great care with her and very early on and then helen evaluated her religious education one day we took her with us to meet with father barry at the parish in the neighborhood it was that time of year when we joined together to feed and clothe the poor when kathy saw the crucifix above the altar she automatically made the sign of the cross helen took this as an omen and she gave the christians equal time in kathys spiritual guidance so someone had taught the child to make the sign of the cross from only this i may deduce that someone spent an enormous amount of time with her she was not unwanted or ignored not considered a burden to her mother but the focus of attention and that person enabled kathy to love helen at first sight i like to believe she must have been rather like helen markowitz this special someone can you see this woman abusing her child or allowing anyone else to do it i can not this woman i know nothing about i remember her in my prayers may i take that to mean you think the woman is dead what else could separate such a woman from her child im going to bring down the judge she thought that might make his little eyes spin around mallory stared at the me investigator across the same table in the same coffee house where she had first hooked him she had left him just enough time to let his own imagination do all the work for her and then she had reeled him back in that was the old mans style and it had worked well tkank you markowitz heller lives for his work and theres none better if he knew you were walking evidence out of the crime scenes hed hunt you down and put a bullet in you so you walk the evidence you give it to a cop and youre one person removed from the crime of blackmail youve got nothin solid mallory if you did ive got reports on three suicides with no notes left behind thats what tipped me you were the me investigator on all three scenes who did the notes implicate what embarrassing details were in them suicides just love to unload before they cross over i imagine youve carted out other souvenirs maybe a few photographs of married men love letters what else in the case of the judges mother you obstructed a homicide investigation you kept quiet about evidence of murder palanski showed up because you called him in you had to no way you could hand him the old ladys body so now ive got the two of you in the same room of a dirty operation but this time you covered up a murder no it was battery maybe but not homicide and the battery wasnt all that recent she had a split lip but it had healed some maybe it was a day old and there was a bruise on the side of her face but it was at least two days old and that didnt kill her either her own doctor was there you can ask him she did die of natural causes but the marks wouldve been embarrassing to the judge right so palanski shows up and he takes over and works the judge am i right the me investigator would not meet her eyes she looked down to the paper napkin in his hands he was shredding it to moist confetti he opened his mouth to speak but she dared not give him time to say he wanted a lawyer she slammed her open hand down on the table and his mouth closed as he jumped in his chair nerves shot to hell your biggest problem is that your partner is stupid he buys stock bearer bonds and the idiot thinks nobody can trace them because the deals are cash every cash transaction is logged just like the credit transactions all his financial activity is on computer did you know that palanskis been cheating you on the cuts no she could see he hadnt known the way you handled your cut of the payoffs was only a little brighter she thumbed through the sheaf of papers on the table till she found the one she wanted she set this in front of him this is a record of all the cash deposits you made into your mothers bank account but you have power of attorney on that account so youre tied up by computer transactions too your mothers entire legal income is social security and yet she has this fantastic bank account still internal affairs would never have tipped to that oh but that fool palanski you wont get anything on him without me testifying on the payoff i wont hurt you a deal is a deal im going to let you rat on yourself and palanski you know the drill the first one to turn states evidence gets immunity nose was paroled from the bathroom for the evening he purred around mallorys legs as she put the bullets into the speedloader for her revolver she faced the foyer mirror and thought of visual cues she looked down at the cat and closed her long and narrow eyes to suspicious slits nose began to dance the cue for the dancing what was it a muffled noise called her eyes up to the ceiling the sounds upstairs were unmistakable plush carpet and thick insulation could not block out the scream now furniture was being turned over feet pounded into the front room above her head she followed the sounds eyes to the ceiling she stopped by the phone in the living room she tapped keys on the building computer and scrolled through the list of tenants until she had betty hydes number more furniture was moving a dial tone another scream hyde residence said a foreign voice put hyde on the phone tell her its mallory and its urgent telephone pressed between shoulder and ear she opened the closet door and pulled out the heavy sheepskin jacket to hide the bulge of the gun the jacket was bulky enough to interfere with action but she was not ready to show her hand or her gun in public for this was the visual cue to call the lawyer she was slipping into the sleeves of the coat when betty hyde came to the phone mallory darling i thought youd never call meet me at judge hearts apartment ill be there before you stay back all right stay the hell out of my way she took the stairs three at a time she noted the three locks as she neared the door most people only used one lock until they were in for the night it was early yet the main lock was the flimsiest but the thick door was too formidable to break down she banged on the door with her fist and pressed the buzzer open up now there was dead silence within and maybe a dead woman she banged on the door again open up or ill call the police magic words for the man in the public eye she heard heavy footsteps on the tiles of the foyer beyond the door and then the sound of the lock being undone the latch chain being slipped into its notch the door opened a crack and she was looking into the cold eyes of judge heart just above the length of gold chain which bound the door to its frame she smiled politely stepped back and kicked the door at the center breaking the latch chain and knocking the man off balance she pushed past him and entered the apartment pansy heart was in the corner of the front room trying desperately to crawl into the pattern of the rug and disappear her nose was bleeding her lip was split and the side of her face was already beginning to swell behind her the judge was screaming you have no right mallory turned on him im taking her out of here dont give me any trouble his face had gone to purple rage as he advanced on her with a quick sure kick she put her foot into his groin and watched his skin drain of color as his eyes bulged out with surprise and pain he slipped down to one knee pansy heart was crying softly mallory pulled the woman up and walked her toward the door one arm supporting the smaller woman about the tiny waist betty hyde stood in the doorway her eyes were fixed on pansy hearts ruined face and her mouth was suppressing a smile ill take care of her she said putting her arms around the crying woman as mallory stepped back come with me pansy you need a doctor dear the judge was getting to his feet he was clumsy and slow about it as both hands were clutching his groin mallory tucked a foot under his unbending legs and tripped him sending his face into the corner of a heavy oak table and giving him his own bloody nose pansy heart looked back at her husband as though awaiting further orders then she yielded to the gentle force of betty hyde who was propelling her through the door and into the hall the gossip columnist was on her way to an interview with this battered woman and nothing but a joint act of congress and god would have stopped her mallory wondered if she had done the judge a favor by preventing him from getting between hyde and his wife mallory set a tray of teapot and cups down on the table and then she let her eyes roam the generous front room of betty hydes apartment it was a copy of the rosens only in the architecture the decorator had been a pro she knew charles would have appreciated the american and british antiques masterfully woven with the modern pieces the front room was open and airy without bricabrac it was gracious living without souvenir or sentiment or any heart to it at all mallory approved the judges wife was sitting in an earlyamerican rocking chair holding a cold compress to her swelling face betty hyde sat on a footstool and gently pushed on the armrest of pansys chair rocking lulling the crying woman entangling her gaze with pansys hyde crooned soft words smiling eyes gleaming playing the good nurse mallory handed a cup of tea to the judges wife the woman smiled her gratitude and accepted the tea with a nervous clattering of the china she seemed even more fragile than the delicate old willow teacup mallory leaned down until her eyes were level with the woman who had ceased her crying and now looked up at mallory with absolute trust mrs heart were you at home the night the judge beat the crap out of your motherinlaw the womans eyes were startled wide and it seemed that her thin shoulders were being pressed to the back of her chair then her head dropped to her chest and her entire body wilted now pansy had been assaulted for the second time in one night mallory eased back lifted a cup from the near table and began to stir her own tea did that old woman scream as loud as you did the sobbing began again racking the smaller womans leaflight body betty hyde rolled her eyes she rose from the footstool and led mallory back to the kitchen that was brutal mallory one day we must have a long talk about your style i think i could learn from you are you just fishing dear or do you have something more on the bastard ive got copies of the hospital records during the years judge hearts mother lived with them theres another file with his wifes hospital records he probably didnt kill the old lady with a beating but if you want to get to the judge i would suggest applying a little pressure on his mothers doctor you might want the old womans body exhumed the da is a good political animal you might approach him with the word coverup and then explain that a highprofile case might be good for his career and leave my name out of it understood and what can i do for you mallory milk pansy for everything you can get at the tenants meeting she said her dog was gone is it dead betty turned to the woman in the other room pansy had ceased her crying now and sat quietly staring into her teacup hyde raised her voice to ask pansy you still have a dog dont you dear rosie isnt it pansy heart turned to face betty with a look of mild surprise yes rosie is at the animal hospital i dont know when shell be coming home shes very sick mallory found something familiar about the tone of voice it was the practiced way the woman said the words she was lying well everybody lied mallory strode back into the front room and leaned down with both hands on the arms of the rocking chair pansy looked up and her hand started to rise to ward off a blow it was an instinctive reflex your dog is dead isnt it the woman was flying apart from the center one hand flashed out and sent the teacup and saucer crashing to the floor her eyes were slipping into shock when did the dog die and now the words came out in a gush of hysteria i dont know i havent seen rosie for days my husband took her out for a walk and she never came back again he said she was at the vets but you called the vet and the dog wasnt there right pansy was nodding quiet now shock was doing its calming work mallory turned away and left hyde to clean up the damage this puddle of a woman in the middle of her floor edward slope took his seat at the table stop apologizing charles but i only meant to leave a message on your office machine i would never have dragged you away from your family on christmas night but i wasnt with my family charles i was catching up on a backlog of autopsies christmas is my busy season so why the secrecy has the little brat asked you to break the law charles had never been able to win at poker he didnt have the face to run a bluff or so edward slope had reminded him once a week so how to begin this foray into lying which was mallory country and an uncharted place he had never been to i had a few words with riker last night said charles i know kathy witnessed a murder when she was a child and that was true wasnt it rikers reaction had confirmed it certainly and his reaction to discussing the matter with edward slope had suggested that edward could tell him what riker would not the doctor sat back in his chair and went through the stalling mechanics of removing his glasses and cleaning them so riker told you about that charles nodded and in that nod he told his first lie of the evening he was practicing at mallorys religion of everyone lies forgive me edward my friend for my trespasses against thee slope restored his glasses to the bridge of his nose when i asked riker point blank if he had ever seen any of the films he denied it you havent mentioned this to anyone else have you no said charles with the sudden realization that somehow he had just betrayed riker forgive me riker for im about to trespass some more charles settled the napkin on his lap not wanting to meet the eyes of the man he could not beat at poker riker wouldnt go into any detail about the film and that was true no it was not it was deception im sure he wouldnt hes not supposed to know the film existed but apparently riker did know about it theres no other way he could have known about the murder i gather this is important or he wouldnt have hung himself out to dry that way its very important if he was right about the connection between mallory and justin a child was at stake markowitz swore to me that riker had never seen the film and we destroyed it that night it wouldnt make sense for him to tell riker after the fact not if you knew markowitzs style do you understand that technically this knowledge could make you an accessory charles nodded another lie no i dont understand and only a second has gone by and now ive somehow betrayed markowitz too markowitz would never have shown it to anyone else this was kathys history and he protected it he wouldnt have risked the feds seeing kathy on tape interrogating her he only showed it to me because he wanted to close out the case he needed a positive identification based on a scar the original wound was on the film did riker give you any background on the case not much the fbi came into special crimes section when a body turned up in manhattan the remains had the trademark wounds of a pair of serial killers operating up and down the eastern seaboard markowitz turned up a lead on one of the killers and the feds botched the arrest they sent five men to arrest the suspect and the man was killed in a shootout markowitz must have been furious he was he flushed the feds out of special crimes as though they were so much vermin he took over the site of the shootout and recovered a cache of film it took him a long time to go through all the reels he did it himself it was so brutal he said he didnt want to burn out his detectives but really he was a bit like kathy always keeping something back all he shared with the others was a splice that showed the face of the second killer i know youve heard the story of how markowitz took kathy in well he did arrest kathy for breaking into a car and helen was adamant about keeping the child that was all true but the real reason he wouldnt turn kathy over to juvenile hall was because he recognized her shed been several years younger when the film was made but who could forget that face so she had seen the murder and he wanted her as a material witness no theyd already found the location of the film set several years had gone by and the site was cold it was another four years before riker made the arrest on the second man and killed him but it was in the line of duty wasnt it that was rikers story one thing that worked in rikers favor at the hearing was that the fbi had killed the mans accomplice during an arrest markowitz took the position that riker had done the same thing it took five agents to do no more no less and markowitz swore under oath that he had been the only one to view the films so la couldnt take it as a case of a cop cracking up and taking vengeance for the victims and since riker had killed the suspect with his fists and not his gun internal affairs and the da came to the conclusion that death was not premeditated that it occurred while resisting arrest that would seem reasonable at the time it did i backed their conclusion to my knowledge at the time markowitz was the only one who knew the personal connection of the film so now it seems that markowitz lied to me well that was typical he wouldnt have told me the truth if it made me an accessory after the fact and he was probably feeling part of the blame for what riker had done you know personal detachment is everything in police work and riker loved kathy kathy doesnt know about the film markowitz wanted it that way you can never tell her about this evening thats understood of course markowitz warned me said i didnt have to sit through the entire thing he told me id regret it if i did but i was so confident in my own professional detachment i took it for a challenge i had to view the film because riker had made such a mess of the mans face markowitz couldnt identify the victim from the drivers license photo and there were no prints on file he asked me to make the id based on the scar from a wound the victim received in that film tell me about the film after i tell you you will wish i hadnt i guarantee that shall i go on this was his last chance to be an honest man the man edward slope thought he was dealing with yes go on do you know what a snuff film is no its a film of the torture and murder of a human being a little something for the ultimate film buff the freak most of the victims are children any child you see on the streets of new york can be turned into some kind of currency slope waved down a passing waiter to order a double scotch he turned back to charles i cant do this sober are you sure you want to hear all the details quite sure not at all sure i have nightmares enough no go on i deserve this when the film opened the children a boy and a girl were asleep on the floor of a cage it wasnt a fancy production it was shot in a warehouse with only one set i believe the children were drugged the little boy was just coming out of it maybe thats why they took him first the little girl wasnt moving at all it was kathy of course you knew that charles nodded another lie and another bad dream due for penance she could only have been eight years old when the film was made shed apparently been on the street for a while by then she was wearing a grimy tshirt and jeans that were miles too big for her i remember her telling me once that shed always stolen the jeans closest to the door of the shop so she didnt always get a great fit a waiter hovered over the table to deposit a glass which edward grabbed up at once he drank quickly she was only wearing one shoe and one foot was bare well they took the boy out of the cage and started to work on him i made markowitz turn off the volume but i can still hear the child screaming you dont need to know what they did but he lived quite a while before they were finished with him and all the while the cage was in view to one side of the screen kathy never moved never opened her eyes i watched her the whole time they were torturing the little boy oh god no wait im a visitor in mallorys church tonight and god is not here then it was kathys turn i dont want to hear any more of this one of the men opened the door of the cage and lifted her out she was dead weight in his arms edward ran one hand through his hair and then drank from the glass as though with a terrible thirst you know what i remember most vividly the one small shoe and the little bare foot isnt that absurd kathy slept on as he laid her down on the mattress that was bloodied from the body of the little boy they had just rolled him off to one side so much blood charles watched the rapid movement of edwards eyes and realized that the man was watching the film all over again edwards hands covered his face for a moment and his next words were muffled oh christ isnt it just a wonderful world for children charles charles began to rise from his chair leaning toward his dinner companion edward put up one hand no im all right sit down charles im sorry and after another moment the reel in the doctors eyes rolled on again and then the man bent over her suddenly kathy was awake not just coming around from the drug but wide awake shed been shamming sleep that was obvious waiting out the murder picking her moment and then she was all over the man and all teeth and snarls like an animal her little thumbs stabbed at his eyes that one veered off with both hands to his face blood was streaming out between his fingers you can guess at the damage she did there and then the cameraman was on her she closed her mouth on his bare arm and bit off a chunk of the flesh a chunk of flesh charles and she spat it out on the floor charles looked into the shattered lenses of edwards eyes the doctor was in the moment it was happening all over again and now the men are screaming lights are being overturned the camera is lying on the floor the closing shot is kathy hightailing it down a dark hall and away from the light running like the devil with one shoe off and one shoe on he had liked that stupid look of surprise in the moment she realized she would die best of all he liked the look of her when she was dead all lines of hostility smoothed out the only good bitch was a dead bitch mallory would be no different the two grapes were squashed beneath his thumbs but slowly in the delicious destruction of the orbs the breaking of the skin flattening of membranous flesh therein the feel of the cold destroyed tissue each was a green eye to him and now he drew his thumbs back from the cutting board staring at them mashed split she was blind to him she wouldnt press charges said betty hyde setting her coffee mug on the counter top in the rosens kitchen i dont suppose you have any more proof on the beating of his mother ive got a very vague column for the morning edition my editor wont let me use any names till we exhume the body and thats in the works i also have a young reporter waiting to ambush the judge outside the building tomorrow you know the sort of thing is there any truth to the rumor that you beat your elderly mother to death did pansy give you anything no poor pansy ive never seen that kind of pain close up shes gone back to him shes up there now shes crazy she says hes always very contrite after he beats her shes not afraid of him right now she thinks she can work this out you know hes going to kill her the next time does she have to file the complaint couldnt you do it in addition to the humane aspects im thinking of libel laws an editor wont touch it without a police report and there isnt one i didnt witness the beating if she says she fell down the law agrees with her mallorys face was devoid of all expression as she folded her arms and looked down at betty hyde hyde fought off the startling illusion that mallory had grown taller in the passage of seconds now mallory leaned down and hyde stepped back until she was pressed against the kitchen counter youre holding out on me what have you got on eric franz it was late to be calling on the neighbors but then she had taken eric in on the night annie died it was late then too tit for tut my dear when eric answered the door he was pulling his robe closed about his waist and staring into the air over her left shoulder eric its betty can we talk he stepped back from the door and waved her into the room it was black until he said oh sorry and pressed the light switch she shouldnt have been surprised to see the room unchanged it had been little over a month since annie died although gone was the bad joke of their framed wedding portrait with crayon cuckolds horns drawn on the head of his likeness they were hours and bottles into the wine rack when eric lost control are you crazy annie would never have stayed with me those last three years if not for the blindness no actually it was the insurance money that changed her mind about divorcing me and then i had the success of the books and the prizes but if i had been sighted she would have left me in a minute and taken a large settlement but she couldnt leave a blind man could she not a socialite like annie what would the neighbors think the latch lowered and the door opened with a gentle push he prowled through the dark rooms until he found her her long slender body was stretched out on the bed her hair had a glow to it as though she had found a way to trap sunlight to bring it indoors with her and keep it alive in the night he lay down beside her with animal stealth and rolled on to his back and into sleep four feet paddling the air chasing mice across his dreams it was the cold metal of the gun against his nose that woke him to the bright light of a lamp he looked at the tip of the gun and it was necessary to cross his eyes to do this weary and unsteady on the bedding he rose to his hind legs and began the dance but she was already gone having slipped from the bed and into the dark of the next room preceded by the gun in her hand he thudded down to the floor and padded after her as she searched behind each door she stopped awhile by the bathroom door he rubbed his head against one of her bare feet which did not love him back but pushed him away her hand depressed the latch on the door she pressed on it again and again she looked down at him and whispered are you that smart which he more or less correctly interpreted as good boy and he began to purr now he was being picked up in her arms luxuriating in the warmth of her skin and then he was falling toward the tiles of the bathroom floor the light went out the door slammed and he sat alone in the dark wondering what he had done wrong this time mallory the consummate liar had barred herself from the poker game for the damage of a lie how perverse and convoluted was her code of what passed for honor charles had learned to lie and betray in one night oh wouldnt mallory be proud of how far hed come how low hed sunk no no she wouldnt one did not do such damage to people in mallorys orbit but she would never know what he had done even if he was in the confession mode he was bound by slope to keep silent a lie of omission as riker had once explained to him her history belonged to her alone she would hate this intrusion this conspiracy of knowledge slope would never discuss this evening with riker the lies and betrayal would go unnoticed and so there were more lies by omission he didnt have the luxury of barring himself from the poker game questions would be asked she would ferret out the answers more damage would be done once a week he would be reminded of his crimes sitting across a card table from edward slope and he could not confess to riker either not without the web spreading he only wished he were a practicing catholic so he could confess to someone the pattern of his web had become too intricate sleep was lost in the tangle of the weave but finally sleep did come for him all in visions of a little girl running in the dark pursued by things which were darker still and might be spiders and when she slipped in the blood of his dreams he snapped awake his mind flooded with music to kill the images and thoughts created by a night of lies and now his penance was in the room with him he shut his eyes and tried to end the music but he could hear the light steps of amandas feet all around his bed interesting isnt it said amanda she was able to pretend sleep while another child was being murdered no please i dont want to think about that oh charles youll never stop thinking about that it wasnt the reaction youd expect from a small child was it since when was mallory predictable he kept his eyes closed in hopes of minimizing the damage to his mind he didnt know how to send her away perhaps the delusion would pale without the reinforcement of sight but no she continued to pace footsteps growing heavier waiting on her answer as a solid woman would do addressing his words to the ceiling he said it wasnt mallorys mother who was killed in the film you were wrong about that angle was i amandas pacing stopped for a moment she never moved the entire time a child was being tortured she played dead she might only have been paralyzed with fear there are no facts to support logic and facts have failed you charles you had a qualified medical examiner as a witness to the film she was playing dead where did she learn that maybe shed had some practice witnessing another bloody murder maybe thats what happened to her mother and to justins mother he rolled over to face her this woman who was not there yet he kept his eyes closed amanda this is ludicrous justins mother died of a heart attack thats a fact now the aspect of child abuse makes more sense thats what mallory would see in the boy she would recognize the signs of an abused child even mallory could not divine a murder through the boys eyes strains of the concerto meandered through his brain he recited the greek alphabet in a whisper the music fled amanda remained to pace the floor around his bed her footsteps were heavier now he opened his eyes to faint moonlight and the stronger light of street lamps pouring through his bedroom window he turned his face to the opposite wall where his ultimate nightmare was moving across the wallpaper amanda had learned to cast a shadow chapter december she had been unsuccessful in her efforts to bully the maid perhaps it was true that betty hyde was not at home this morning and neither was eric franz answering his telephone but the judge was in and so was harry kipling she picked up the plastic evidence bag and held it up to the camera to visually record the chain of evidence written on the seal and then the breaking of the seal she pulled out the cap gun and set it down on the table in the front room back in the den she ran a test of the camera equipment which had just made her visual record of the evidence on her way to the front door four gilded wall mirrors caught the swift passing reflection of her tshirt shoulder holster and jeans she was pulling on the new brown cashmere blazer a twin to the garment amanda bosch had been wearing when she died the tailor had reproduced it exactly not that most people would appreciate the detailing she had been tempted to recreate the cigarette burn on the sleeve but the ghost of helen markowitz wouldnt let her do it and helen would have been the first to comment on the bulge the gun made in the line of the blazer mallory stopped at the mirror in the foyer checking the giveaway bulk with a critical eye she called the cat to her and it came she snapped her fingers and the cat made a leap into her arms and nuzzled her neck she looked back to the mirror no it wouldnt do the squirming cat wouldnt hide the bulge of the gun unless she killed it first and pinned it on like a furry corsage she dropped the animal on the floor at her feet shrugged off her blazer and removed the shoulder holster she slid the gun into the drawer of the small table beneath the mirror putting the coat on again she snapped her fingers for the cat with no selfrespect no pride nose jumped back into her arms she made her way down the hall wondering that doors didnt open to inquire about the racket of purring she stopped at the door to judge hearts apartment and knocked it was a repeat of last night the chain had apparently been replaced the door only opened a crack the judge was staring at her i want to see your wife said mallory go away i could be discreet or not up to you i want to see that shes all right i want to see her now the door closed to the sound of the newly installed chain slipping off the latch now the door was opening and the judge was calling out pansy pansy pansy heart entered the room her face showed only the damage of the previous night and no fresh marks just checking mallory said turning to go she stopped and looked back over her shoulder at the judge i know what you did and im going to get you for it judge hearts face was in rage shades of red as the door slammed when she knocked on the next door one flight up the kipling boy opened it there was no leer on the boys face this time he stepped back to make room for mallory and she walked in harry kipling was seated at the table he looked at the cat and rose quickly to his feet but not quickly enough a springer spaniel was bounding across the carpet and heading for the cat jaws wide and joy in his eyes the apartment was still with no current of air or sound to indicate an animate being not even a cat then the quiet of noonehome was broken by a pair of feet crossing the foyer and dragging a shadow along by the heels the intrusion was shortlived for the revolver lay in the first drawer opened the gun metal gleamed for the moments between the drawer and the dark of a bag stepping softly the thief quit the apartment when mallory slammed the door behind her the kipling boy was yelling look what she did to my dog mallory returned by way of the stairwell the door to the rosens apartment was open could she have been that stupid this time the cat didnt cry when she dropped him he was even prepared for the fall nose had grown accustomed to this game of holding and dropping he padded away yawning she opened the drawer of the table by the door the drawer was empty her smith wesson revolver was gone nothing else had been disturbed the cap gun lay on the table where she had placed it what now she couldnt call in for backup and admit shed lost the gun neither coffey nor riker would let her live that one down a rookie would not have lost her gun a crash came from the direction of the bedroom she passed through the kitchen and slipped a wine bottle into her hand now she entered the bedroom the cat was standing over the remains of a broken lamp there was no mystery to the breakage a fringe of the lamp shade was tangled in the cats paw but there was still the problem of the gun she picked up the phone and dialed charles from the bedroom im in a big hurry charles go to the center drawer in my desk and get the old long colt and bring the box of ammo with it youll have to turn off the she lowered the phone at the sound that may or may not have been the cat now she set the receiver back on its cradle to stifle charless loud repeated hello coming from the mouthpiece she left the bedroom quickly silently gliding down the short hallway to the den she flipped the array of switches for the cameras backup tapes and audio she entered the front room to find the cat crawling under the couch and harry kipling standing in the center of the room the cap gun was lying on the coffee table how much time would it take charles to get to her with the real gun you left your door open said kipling that was careless she had meant to make his access easy but she had planned to have a gun in her hand when he came through the door it was an odd moment to be thinking of rikers itoldyouso grin too late for backup and charles was miles from here the cameras were rolling there was time to wonder if coffey would catch her in this screwup or if she could lie her way out of it max candles knife lay on a shelf of the bookcase behind kipling had he seen it originally she had planned to steer him to it so he would have a weapon in his hands in the event the cameras should catch her blowing away a taxpayer but that plan had been contingent on having a gun in her own hand and where was he hiding her gun kipling was still staring at the cap gun on the table you recognize it harry its the same toy gun you used to teach the cat to dance now nose only has to see a gun and he dances was it the noise of the caps did you fire that toy close to his head to make him dance and now the cat began to snore charles was closing the door to his apartment so that was it im in a hurry bring me a gun how many weapons did she need all at once she had a rather large gun and a sharp knife in her possession now but who was he to question mallory he who kept company with a dead woman he was crossing the hall to the offices of mallory and butler ltd wondering which of all the stupid things he had said had made her the most angry he had accused her of lack of logic and of underestimation of oh fool she had questioned him about a blind man not too quick to underestimate that suspect was she and now she was gathering more weapons no lack of caution there where was his own logic perhaps he had gotten everything wrong genius that he was what had possessed him to take coffeys side in this at the time it had made some sense but now maybe coffey had only feared she was too fixed in her knowledge of the suspect riker had been right to caution him he should have shown her more respect he must not let her down now he unlocked the door to mallorys private office and strode quickly to her desk the center drawer was locked now that was a snag he had no keys for drawers mallory must assume that everyone was as gifted as she in the art of breaking and entering he picked up the letter opener he had given her it was the only object in the room not manufactured in the current decade in fact it dated back to another century he hesitated only for a moment hefting the irreplaceable piece in his hand then he inserted it into the space above the drawer and used force to pry the metal open an earsplitting squeal was the first warning followed by a cascade of bells giant bells gongs in hellish amplification this must be mallorys idea of accommodating his aversion to high technology she had wired the office for an alarm and in place of an annoying beep or siren she had worked in his recordings of church bells and now he was inside the bell tower inside the bells themselves he put up his hands to cover his ears he would altogether lose his ears if he stayed much longer he could turn it off but there was not time enough to hunt the wiring from the drawer before serious damage was done to him and the speakers might be anywhere in the myriad of electronic equipment there could be no direction to sound when ones head was itself the clapper of a monster bell he opened the wooden case nested in the center drawer and there was markowitzs old long colt gleaming with mallorys good housekeeping which extended into the barrels of antique guns he picked up the revolver and the ammunition box and ran for the door the peal of the church bells from hell followed him down the stairs and into the street where every window had a head sticking out of it he put out his hand to flag down a cab silently begging forgiveness from the neighbors kipling walked back to the front door and locked it i dont think we want to be disturbed right now what would charles do when he met with a locked door he had the size to kick it in but he would not know how how did you get on to it harry kipling lowered himself to a straightback chair and motioned her to another she remained standing he leaned back in the chair lifting its front feet off the rug and rocking on the two back legs staring absently into space his face was drawn dramatic in the hollows below the high cheekbones where afternoon shadows followed the contours he seemed tired at the point of giving in or giving up what mistake did i make you made a lot of them said mallory they had been tap dancing for ten minutes now where was the gun it could be hidden in his belt at the small of the back he had not yet looked directly at the knife with the crest of max candle how much do you want kipling smiled this is a simple case of extortion am i right whats it worth to you harry whats my marriage worth call my wifes accountant i dont have all day for this how much do you want to keep it quiet why did you do it desperation if you want the sordid details youre not getting them just tell me how much money you want ill get back to you she would not allow her eyes to travel back to the knife to give it away but she knew she could have it in her hand in a heartbeat if she only had the advantage of position the chair and the rocking kipling blocked the way moving in slow silence she angled around kipling who was holding the cap gun in his hand examining it as a curiosity she could see him in profile now there was no gun concealed in the small of his back he was dressed in a polo shirt and closefitting slacks there was no place on his person to conceal a large weapon so where was her damn gun so i had a relationship with amanda bosch now how much do you want how much not to tell my wife well theres a bit more to it than just the relationship with amanda youve only got me on one woman if you believed there were others you would have said so before now im not going to pay the moon for this now how much do you want did i mention that i knew amanda i know you lied to her and she caught you on it but there were so many lies by the way he smiled he seemed to take some pride in that im talking about the lie that made her abort her baby does that narrow it down for you that particular lie isnt worth any cash to me i dont think you did know her i think youre a crooked cop the news said you were a cop and the daughter of a cop was your father crooked too does it run in the family lets say i learned a lot from my old man if i never knew amanda how do i know what tipped her off to the lie what made her snap she had not been a worldclass poker player for nothing helen always wanted her to have a fine education and now the weekly poker games of childhood were paying off amanda was sitting on a bench outside the building on the day before she died the day before she called you on the big lie she never went up to the door she just watched it was a busy day for the doorman people were coming and going tenants kids dogs then she saw lets not get too dramatic shall we she saw peter and she knew he wasnt adopted you know until then i always thought it was a blessing that he looked like me and not angel still holding the cap gun in the palm of his hand kipling stood up and crossed over to the bookcase he leaned against the shelf where max candles knife was sitting he was only inches from it so it is a shakedown if you know her you know she was only using me for genetic material she didnt ask me if i wanted to make another brat did she she didnt know that she could make one it was a miracle pregnancy according to her doctor so then you lied to her yes i told her the genetic stew was botched what of it i told her it would be a monster that all my children would be monsters things growing on their outsides that really should be on the insides missing their little eyes and little hands little things like that so what thats not a crime a cop wouldnt have any interest in that this is a shakedown now how much do you want to make this nasty little business go away it was a stupid lie wasnt it you had to know shed catch you in the lie when she saw your son what were the odds they would ever meet most of the year my son is away at school there are camps in the summer my wife has no maternal instincts peter looks so much like me angel hates the sight of him hes rarely around but amanda saw him thats why she forced the meeting in the park i dont know what youre talking about we only met at her place i know you met her in the park you dont have to talk to me you could remain silent if you say anything it could be used against you in a court of law are you reading me my rights still playing cops and crooks are we next youll be telling me that if i cant afford an attorney one will be appointed for me youre no more a cop than i am did they kick you off the force youre a cheap little hustler arent you theres no law against cheating on your wife maybe the two of you are thinking in terms of a multimilliondollar civil suit well forget it mallory shrugged his constitutional rights were recorded on camera his arm leaned on the shelf of the bookcase close to the knife only inches from it it was working so well the only snag was that she didnt have the gun what had he done with it you met her in the park she called you on the lie she had just killed her child thinking it was a monster but it wasnt she aborted it for nothing she was so angry you panicked when she threatened to tell your wife what a monster you were she was going to do it then wasnt she right that minute then you killed her so amanda was the woman in the park killing no wonder you thought you were going to score big cheating and murder has it occurred to you she knew more than one man in this building that someone else killed her no it never did not from the beginning if it was me id take the subway said amanda taking a long drag on her cigarette charles stared at her there was no music in the cab perhaps it was the stress that had triggered the delusion this time now he realized that there were flaws in his construction glitches in the mechanics of freak memory for every now and then amandas blue eyes would slip into mallory green amanda youre not allowed to smoke in this cab see the sign perhaps you i aint smoking buddy said the cab driver and the name is fred amanda smiled and continued to hold the cigarette one of the perks of being dead no fear of lung cancer but if it bothers you ill put it out he couldnt smell the burning weed and neither did the swirling blue smoke sting his eyes that was a good sign he was not altogether crazy the gun pressed into his leg and he removed it from his pants pocket and shifted it into his coat so whats with the gun mallory needs it what did you say asked the cab driver nothing take the subway said amanda just on the chance that she needs it in a hurry this traffic is the pits she stared out the back window at the still life of motionless vehicles trailing behind them im sure well get moving soon said charles waving his hand at the phantom smoke swirling around the interior of the cab you know the cigarette smoke does bother me the cab is full of the cab driver turned around to say for the last time pal im not smoking and now the cab was filled with smoke that was not real but which obscured every real thing he was engulfed in the smoke panic was rising steady now its not real but then he turned to amanda who was blurred by the thickening blue clouds of his delusion and he realized he was getting lost in this very cramped space which was his mind please stop stop it okay thats enough said the driver out of my cab fella now cheating on my wife doesnt make a good motive for murder oh sure it will i like it money motives are the best according to your fatherinlaws will you dont inherit if your wife dies smart old man your fatherinlaw and you dont get alimony if she divorces you for cause and that incidentally is the clause that hangs you you couldnt afford to get caught in the act you cant possibly base a murder motive on the possibility that she wouldnt overlook one small indiscretion youd be laughed out of court everybody cheats and everybody lies you mean the way she overlooked your embezzlement i found the transactions in the company computer she covered the sale of the stock you didnt own and she covered the collateral loan on the condo she wouldnt haul you in court for that it might make the stockholders nervous to find an embezzler in the family but im betting shed haul you in for adultery the threat of divorce is still a weak motive for murder is it if angel divorces you you get nothing you even had to agree to give custody of your own child to another relative in the event of your wifes death thats how much the old man trusted you kipling was backing off in the body language regrouping for another tack my wife is rather cold she never lets me touch her any more i had to have a woman on the side but i certainly didnt kill amanda she had always known it would be something simple and disappointing now there was only the tedium of letting him flap his mouth catching him in the lies while the camera was rolling he was exhibiting all the signs of the liar he explained too much emoted too much and now he was going on and on about the tragic death of amanda and his own more important tragedy all his life hed been waiting on opportunity which had arrived in the shape of an heiress and now when he was set for life it was all falling apart on him everything unraveling and he could not would not see it the lies didnt work any more and yet he kept on lying amanda made the decision to have an abortion he said butchery mallory silently translated its unreasonable to blame me she was going to tell your wife eventually amanda saw it my way stunned with a rock and bleeding i loved amanda i love all women to death and here mallory interrupted him your blood type is b positive kipling tightened all the muscles of his face you killed her by the water and then you ran away you came back later and smashed up her hands you took some time with that i suppose you were there when this fantasy supposedly happened mallory smiled at a dead run charles took the stairs leading down below the level of the sidewalk he was half falling down them as others were shouldering up the narrow stairway at the booth he made a frantic exchange of coins for tokens the man behind the bulletproof window busied himself with some bit of paperwork and then began slowly to count out a packet of dollar bills he never looked up never responded to the crazed knocking on the glass which sounded the panic of the oncoming train that charles would miss without the token the train pulled in as the clerk was pushing a token under the partition charles turned into the crush of disembarking straphangers to plant his token in the slot and hurry through he ran at the train the doors were closing and he put his hand inside and pressed them open again with the aid of an electronic eye which had not kicked in until charles felt real pain he squeezed in among the press of other passengers who looked up at him as though his size was something he was guilty of now the train was in motion and the public address system was making an announcement to the passengers he couldnt make out the individual words among the garble of mechanics and the garble of a man who was eating his lunch as he addressed the riders over the loudspeaker in what was obviously his second and recently acquired language what is he saying charles asked a woman who had the bored look of having been this route many times the woman only shrugged it was amanda by his side who answered his worst fears hes saying what they always say no matter where youre going you cant get there from here when the train did stop again he discovered the local had turned into an express judging by the lynch mob attitude of other passengers who were far more irritated than the shrugging woman this change of route was a whim of the engineer when he saw the light of day and the first street sign he knew he was miles out of his way and he began to run you were standing down by the water when she nailed you on the lie she was going to give your wife all the evidence she needed to divorce you for cause you panicked and grabbed her by the arm first you stunned her and then you killed her then you ran away like the dog my dog you were walking the dog that morning that was your excuse for going out to meet her in the park the dog was running loose while you fought with amanda he got his leash caught in the bushes when he was heading north over the rise youre probably wondering how i know that so you found the dog and took it home then about thirty minutes later you came back to drag amandas body into the woods you couldnt and you smashed up her hands her fingerprints you made so many stupid mistakes harry he moved toward her and away from the knife good now she was circling around him the way to the door was almost clear his hands were rising now the hands which had snapped a womans neck it was panic time again for harry kipling he was rushing toward her she reached out to grab his outstretched hand struck one long leg across his path and pulled hard on his hand to guide all of his weight to the floor big he might be but not terribly graceful he was looking for his large feet when she kicked him in the groin to double him into a fetal position then she rolled him on his stomach and pulled one arm up behind his back until he screamed youre going to break it then hold still with her free hand she reached for the heavy drapery cord and yanked on it bringing down drapes and curtain rod his running was hampered by the dense crowd of people on the sidewalk it wasnt fair the streets should be deserted couldnt all these people have waited one blessed day before racing out to return their christmas gifts and exchange them for the right sizes charles dropped the gun and an old woman kicked it out of her way he wondered if she could not see it over her packages or did she think it was commonplace sidewalk debris for this part of town he leaned down and picked it up he began to make better time now suddenly not bothered by the crowd any more in fact people were hurrying to get out of his way well this was more like it and now it occurred to him that this sudden show of public courtesy might have something to do with the naked gun in his hand well of course they were all being polite fool harry kipling was hogtied hands tied behind him and roped to one leg he was pulled back in a bizarre bow he looked ridiculous he was ridiculous a pathetic bastard who had struck out in childish fear in anger and then tried to clean up his mess the death of a human being named amanda he was so disappointing an unworthy opponent who made so small a noise in the world he had failed to wake the cat the camera was rolling on to the music of cat snores and kipling sobs with a critical eye mallory looked at both her hogtied trophy and her weak criminal case an assault on a police officer was not hard evidence for murder there were loose ends to be tied better evidence to be got something with more weight for a da who chickened on every case with less than a complete set of prints and a smoking gun in evidence whatever she might have to do kipling wasnt going to get away with this stop crying its not like i really hurt you what did you do with my gun but he would not stop crying and she was not taking much satisfaction in this she lifted her head and turned toward the door with the first sound of metal on metal the door was being unlocked charles no it couldnt be it wasnt someone else was standing in the foyer alone but for the long shadow extending back into the outer corridor now this was more like it this was walking death she was staring into mirrors of her own eyes above the barrel of her stolen revolver murder is the best game isnt it yes it is said justin riccalo leveling the gun at her head now he pulled the barrel up slightly oh thats wrong isnt it youre supposed to aim for the widest part of the body and now the barrel dropped to the level of her chest her heart perversely she smiled he didnt like that she knew he wouldnt kill the bitch yelled kipling not sobbing any more but frantic in the eyes all women are bitches said the boy in the monotone of a litany yes yes they are all of them said kipling with the fervour of a television evangelist playing the crowd kill her now lighten up you idiot said mallory to the man at her feet hes going to kill you next i thought you understood that kiplings mouth hung open and no more words came out all the words she heard were toward the back of her mind where markowitz lived with helen get him to talk to you kid said a memory with a brooklyn accent tell me justin what kind of bird did you kill to make the bloody x on my door it was a pigeon said justin with a hint of a query at the end of his words i love all the little details said mallory how did you rig the glass of water in the kitchen prime the pump get him talking and he wont be able to stop justin smiled i set the glass near the edge of the table and then i put pennies under the back legs to make it slant but only a little the glass was leveled on a sliver of ice when the ice melted the glass crashed and the evidence was gone he looked up at her with the expectation of being petted and admired for this nice job justin same thing with the vase yes it had to be something with water to explain away the slick of the melted ice i thought your best trick was the knife in the target you even fooled charles and thats not easy im betting you rigged the spring load yes i was surprised to see that old carnival prop in the basement as you may have guessed i have a passing interest in magic the spring was easy it was old you could see the rust even in bad light after i pulled the spring over the edge of a gear i only had to keep mr butler talking until it broke and released the fake knife then later you went back to the cellar and pushed the fake blade back into the target compartment right then you stuck one of the real knives into the face of the target justin nodded how could you count on getting back to the building in time to change the prop for the real knife it was easy he goes everywhere in cabs ive watched him from the street i gather he doesnt like subways and probably has so much money it never occurs to him to take one i took the subway back to soho after he walked into the park i had all the time in the world to change the knives the gun was heavy in the childs hands he corrected the dip of the barrel which aimed at her heart dont you have any questions for me justin you werent surprised to see me were you no when did you begin to suspect me from the first violence was coming i knew that youd gone to a lot of trouble to set it up you were the brightest one in the family i always knew youd be the last one standing justin moved the gun to point at harry if you like as a last request ill kill him first he is annoying isnt he no i can help you he said to the boy youre trussed up like a hog said justin you cant even help yourself do you have any idea how silly you look theyre going to find your body that way does that disturb you listen to me boy i can help you i have an idea its foolproof ill back you up if the cops get on to it she wants to arrest me for killing a woman a bitch you need me and now you have something on me i cant tell on you can i justin looked at mallory did he really kill someone no i dont believe hed have the nerve do you why did you tie me up then explain that one to the kid the boy looked to mallory for his answer i tied him up because the twit pissed me off and the civilian review board wont let me shoot him she made a mental note to edit that out of the video tape you heard about the unidentified woman who died in the park kipling raised his head and yelled well i killed her mallory shook her head we call this a confession under duress its worthless and now she turned her eyes down to kipling i dont think justins buying it either youre a documented liar harry now this kid is smart hes probably going to make it look like he was trying to defend me against you she turned back to the boy right justin the boy nodded mallory looked down at kipling who was squirming on the floor harry i just dont think youve got a handle on the situation youre an adult youre bigger than he is or to put it briefly a dead man right again justin im afraid so damn straight not too bright is he justin i did kill her i killed amanda bosch because she was a bitch said harry in his best attempt to pass for a fellow disciple in the hatred of women and the boy who believed all women were bitches seemed to be weighing this well said mallory lets have some details that werent in the papers in my case its professional interest now justins killed twice before we cant call him an amateur but you are harry details did amanda cry or did she take it like more of a man than you are hey it was her own fault if she hadnt threatened me it wouldnt have happened the bitch brought it on herself all women are bitches said justin in the descending note of an amen details harry i hit her with a rock and then i snapped her neck that wasnt in the papers did you grab her by the throat and strangle her no i twisted her head until her neck snapped how long did it take you to teach the cat to dance four days okay kid now untie me no said justin i dont think so he pointed the gun at kipling and the man froze then the gun turned slowly back to mallory it would be more logical to kill mallory first shes the dangerous one you sir youre pathetic you didnt even hate that woman did you no he didnt it was a panic kill said mallory and then he ran away not your style justin it was like markowitz was in the room with her they like to talk kathy the old man had told her even after you read them their rights you cant shut them up the boy giggled clearly enjoying this power over two adults id bet even money you put more thought and planning into your murders said mallory or maybe i overestimated you your mother and stepmother died alone maybe youre blowing smoke here too you know better than that you were close werent you you must have been you were planning to dig up my mother i heard you say that to mr butler if i had dug up your mother what would i have found you might have found out that i replaced her heart medication with vitamin pills the same size and colour the absence of medication might have been noticeable why did you kill her well lets say i never miss an opportunity for fun so she died for lack of proper medication thats pretty boring arthur was holding the door for a tenant when he saw the large man running at him clutching some object to his chest and then concealing it in his pocket now the man was close enough to identify as miss mallorys friend and as the man drew closer still arthur could see the twenty dollar bill extending out from the mans hand the bill hung in the air as charles shot past him and arthur clutched the twenty before it hit the ground no time to be announced im late yelled the large man in passing shell kill me if im any later the words trailed behind the man as he ran past the occupied elevator and pushed through the side door and into the stairwell arthur nodded his understanding at the closing stairwell door as he pocketed the twenty he would not like to cross miss mallory either oh no i killed her said justin she died of a heart attack said mallory ive seen the death certificate yes i suppose you could say i scared her to death once she was weakened by the lack of medication it wasnt all that difficult i did the sort of things that would make her seem crazy if she told anyone she was hardly going to tell my father she saw things flying through the air youve met my father a bit intractable wouldnt you say you are an interesting kid ill give you that much but this still sounds very tame as murders go oh it wasnt tame at all she crawled from room to room following that bottle of worthless pills i walked along beside her kicking the bottle out of her reach she screamed she cried she was terrified it was glorious you should have seen her face as she was dying she just could not believe this was happening to her and what about her replacement the first stepmother i suppose you killed her too yes i also made things float through the air for her she never told anyone either she thought she was going crazy in my opinion she was half crazy when i started to work on her but there was nothing wrong with her heart no but with her brief stay in the psychiatric hospital the suicide was quite believable they should have had a child guard on that window you know its the law according to the me investigators reports both women were alone when they died school was in session both times im afraid the tanner school doesnt keep very good track of children theyre very progressive attendance is on the honor system but i dont think anyone bothered to check they just assumed i wasnt in the apartment they also assumed neither death was all that suspicious amanda was less the thing of solid stuff as she floated up the stairway beside him its three more flights you shouldve taken the elevator charles now you tell me his side hurt from the unaccustomed exertion he could feel a searing in his lungs as though he had swallowed fire did you keep any trophies justin its just professional curiosity on my part all the big names in serial killing kept trophies of every murder i kept the bottle of doctored pills and the tricks i used on my first stepmother how did you get her to jump out the window well she didnt actually jump i had the window open it was a large window then i took the knife and ran the cord to follow the bars of the track lighting system that runs across the ceiling i only had to maneuver her into line with the window and make her back up when you see a knife floating toward you you do tend to back up in a hurry when she was at the window and off balance i only had to run at her to give her a push in the direction she was going in that was the tricky part there was a moment when she understood what was happening to her and she was reaching out to take me with her there was a bit of a risk in that one but your new stepmother told your father about the floating objects yes and i blame myself for that i should have spent more time with sally gotten to know her better i had no idea she was one of those pathetic new age freaks a paranormal obsessive but its working in my favor now shes a documented hysteric so youre still planning to kill her well of course you can kiss that bitch goodbye and now im going to kill you its been fun mallory really it has the boy was raising the gun look kid the gun wont fire she said the safety is on a revolver doesnt have a safety good try mallory what else have you got have you ever heard that old standby look someones coming up behind you once i think it was a television rerun from the seventies charles butler was standing in the foyer on the far side of the room which seemed miles wide to her now markowitzs colt was in his hand his head was turned to the side and down as though he were distracted by someone or something unseen what was wrong with him charles dont fail me now so if i tell the guy behind you to shoot you there wont be any hard feelings charles was staring at her now eyes wide head shaking slowly from side to side charles dont fail me the boy was smiling theyre your last words mallory say what you like the barrel was rising aiming at her face when she yelled charles shoot him charles raised the colt and fired on the boy not once but pull after pull on the trigger walking the length of the room on shockslowed feet firing and firing the boys head had turned quickly with the first click of the empty gun and now he stared at the crazed giant with the wide eyes sad eyes advancing on him clicking and clicking and clicking mallory moved and the boys head snapped back she watched his eyes making choices he was opting for the larger threat the barrel was turning to charles as the cat ran out from under the couch and stepped lightly delicately on its hind legs dancing up to the gun the boy stared mallory dived for the gun it went off the bullet spun the cat in a wicked turn and blood splattered the rug kiplings body went limp as his eyes rolled back lids closing chin falling to his chest mouth hanging open all still now before she and the boy hit the carpet she had the gun in her hand nice going she said pinning the boy neatly under one leg and looking up at charles his gun hand dangled by his side but his grip was tight and the trigger finger continued to spasm and click the misfires and then the ammo box fell from charless other hand seal unbroken youve never loaded a gun have you charles no no i never have so he had gone up against the boy with no bullets in the gun no cover and no hesitation and the empty gun had to be the explanation for the lack of hesitation he couldnt have fired so fast not looking at a child in his sights civilians were not constructed that way charles was the soft and civilized type such things were not done in his world so with his own peculiar courage and backward thinking he had risked his life to draw fire and buy her time now riker and martin were coming through the door martin first riker panting behind him guns drawn they stared at the hogtied kipling and the boy pinned under mallory riker hunkered down beside her panting from the run upstairs fishing for his irons in another moment the boys hands were cuffed behind his back how did you get here so fast she said it was an accusation well charles caught my eye when he streaked by the car riker pulled a small device from one ear oh ive been listening in i planted a highly illegal bug in the apartment the last time i was here ive learned a lot from you kid and now he fingered the fallen drapes on the floor very messy mallory this is so unlike you martin holstered his gun the reception kept going in and out most of the time all we could hear was this noise like a little engine so riker tells me its a cat snoring he thinks ill buy anything riker nodded her attention toward charles you think you could stop him from clicking that thing its getting on my nerves mallory stood up and moved quickly to charles she used force to pry his fingers off the gun and then she closed her hand over his to stop the finger from its spasmodic firing of a gun that was no longer there charless eyes were locked with the boys justin was still and quiet turning his eyes away from charles to look inward and it was only a little disturbing that he pouted like a real child an angry child martin was standing over the hogtied kipling is he dead no said mallory he fainted when the gun went off riker and mallory exchanged words without words do i know my perps she asked with only the lift of her chin damn straight he said with one thumb up martin was fishing out his cuffs naw said riker putting up one hand to stay martin i dont think the cuffs could improve on mallorys knots lets carry kipling out through the lobby like that martin grinned yeah i like it now martin stabbed his finger at the blood splatters on the carpet so who took the hit his answer was crawling slowly across the rug pulling itself along by its front paws crying and making its way to mallory at last it lay at her feet bleeding on her white running shoes what happened to the cat i didnt do it said mallory mallory youre going to love this betty hyde slipped the video cassette into the vcr the picture was of the judge on the steps of the coventry arms he was flanked by an escort of two uniformed police officers a young woman reporter was thrusting a microphone in his face and asking him if it was true that the district attorney was planning to exhume the body of his mother then the judge advanced on the woman one fist knocked the microphone out of her hand and the other fist was flung at the cameraman the camera lay on the sidewalk shooting the feet of the officers scuffling with the feet of the judge dragging him back from the feet of the woman reporter the audio portion was a womans screams ofyoure hurting me you son of a about that police escort with the judge said hyde i dont suppose you could explain that im not sure mallory lied i heard a rumor that some me investigator implicated a detective in an extortion racket i think they just wanted to ask the judge if he had any information on the case but you didnt get that from me of course not thanks for the judge on a platter said betty hyde not that im greedy but did you dig up anything else that was interesting no mallory lied again as she continued her packing well i did you were right mallory i was holding out on you eric franz is not blind mallory pressed out the wrinkle on a tshirt before she folded it into her duffel bag eric franz told you that oh no he denied it for several hours actually he spent most of that time getting drunk and reminiscing about annie thats the strange part he really did love her but the accident was certainly murder if he was sighted and he didnt if franz didnt confess to you then where is this coming from i told you i have spies everywhere mallory folded a pair of blue jeans into the duffel and slowly zipped it shut arthur right he was on duty the night of the crash is he the one who told you franz killed his wife well no arthur doesnt know eric can see he only said that if eric had been able to see he could have saved his wife but erics version of the accident doesnt match eric lied how much did you pay arthur fifty dollars well you probably got the full treatment i only gave him twenty mallory opened the flap pocket of the duffel and rummaged until she found the file she was looking for arthur told you he gave the plate number to the police and they caught the guy in an hour right right but mallory held up a sheet of paper this is the accident report he did give them a plate number but it was the wrong plate and they didnt pick up the hitandrun driver until am the driver was parked outside of his own local garage sleeping off the drink waiting for the shop to open so he could have the dent removed from the fender there was still blood on the car a meter maid caught him but arthur described and did he tell you the part about the little silver jaguar it was a gray ford nothing like a jag but it makes a better story for the money he saw a fight between the franzes across the street i dont think so she selected another sheet of paper from the file this came off his optometrists computer arthur does fine for the first twelve feet without his glasses so all youve really got is a case of the blind contradicting the blind but even if arthurs vision had been it probably would have been the same story any cop could have told you eyewitnesses are the least reliable evidence you can have if your case hangs on a witness youre dead meat in a courtroom and the testimony you have to pay for is the worst i dont think youd make it as a detective dont give up your day job ive been had havent i you steered me into eric franz to keep me away from kipling didnt you youve got the judges head and youve got an exclusive story on amandas murder so you dont have anything on eric franz two out of three isnt bad i owe you one mallory you owe me a lot more than that if youd printed any of that crap on franz youd be in the middle of a lawsuit and looking for another job out on the sidewalk eric franz stopped a moment to talk to her he lowered the dark glasses and stared at her as a sighted person would do his face looked sleep starved and pained i understand we have some business to transact i gather the computer messages were yours youll be contacting me again no said mallory we have no business you and i i dont think well ever meet again she pulled out her shield im only a cop and you didnt break any laws none that she could prove he was just a little crazy charles could explain it better he was good at guilt she had neglected to mention to betty hyde that the doorman had been wearing glasses that night arthur had only made all the mistakes of the average eyewitness with good eyesight the doorman had seen the lights of the oncoming car shining on erics face in that bright light the doorman would have seen the proximity of the man who watched his wife cut down in the street like cora arthur had witnessed a murder without realizing it but it was not the coldblooded murder that good cases could be built around it had been a crime of passion just as surely as if he had caught her in bed with another man and shot her dead there were moments in everyones life when they should not have a gun in their hands she had understood the moment of the kill eric franz had been presented with two thousand pounds of speeding metal and for lack of a warning annie franz had died mallory watched the faux blind man walk away with his dog she would always wonder what it was like to live in that charade of darkness unable to leave it for an unguarded hour it had crossed her mind to finesse him into a breakdown but what would be the point what fresh hell could she have added and what for the man was doing his own version of hard time markowitz would have let franz walk away she wasnt sure how she knew that but she knew epilogue new years eve jack coffey had seen the tape version of judge emery heart attacking a reporter who had not it had run continuously on all the news channels for the past five days at that moment the real live version of the judge was cooperating nicely with internal affairs the judge was singing to ia and the da ratting out palanski for an extortionist and supporting the allegations of an me investigator the exhumation order for the body of an elderly woman was the currency for the judges testimony exhuming the judges mother would not have led to a murder charge according to mallory and unlike riker coffey did trust her now and then and with only the prompt of a photograph from the mes office palanski was confirming that the judge was a woman beater palanski was also taking revenge on his expartner in extortion the me investigator who was sitting in yet another room happy in the ignorant fairy tale that immunity as a states witness might protect him from a charge of tax evasion it wouldnt once the trial was over the treasury agents would be waiting for him in the wings their mouths hanging open and sloppy with saliva and when palanski finished a long sentence for extortion the tmen would get him too and nowhere in this chorus of singing rats was there any trace of the music director one day he would teach mallory to trust him and then he would ask her how she had pulled that off and she would tell him to go to hell coffey looked down at the snapshot in his hand the one which had so frightened palanski it was an innocent picture a sweet kid with wavy tumbles of carrot colored hair she was standing in front of a christmas tree in the chief medical examiners home the protecting arm of doris slope was draped across the girls shoulders the photograph had come to him with a brief cryptic note from dr edward slope and no mention of mallory he lit a match under the photograph per slopes request now special crimes was completely out of the loop and mallory had never been in it later in the day when riker caught the news on palanski he would only know that mallory had held out on him well everybody held out everybody lied he and riker would never discuss the possibility that mallory had brought down another cop she had covered her tracks always one person removed in the chain of evidence and in his hand awaiting his signature was the final paperwork to wrap up no less than three homicides it was a rare sweet day like malakhais delusion his own had required him to be faithful to the logic of his creation amanda would not come back again he knew that she was a woman who loved children how mad was he he touched the button to the cd player and the real and solid music which mallory had given him swelled up and out from the center of his consciousness his eyes were cast down at the desk and his head slowly bowed when the music ended he sat quietly in the gloaming the afterdinner hour when the office shadows were the deepest but now in sidelong vision he saw the woman taking shape in the darkness coming to life for him walking toward him into the light mallory she sat on the edge of his desk and waited until he lifted his face to hers justin is going to a funny farm for the very rich i thought youd want to know you think itll do much good no i think he was born that way still hes only a child a killer a child what did the district attorney think of your camera work he was thrilled two killers and three murders on one roll of tape what a saving for the taxpayer he couldnt make out her face in the gathering darkness but thought she was smiling the civilian review board might think i shot the cat she said but they havent charged me yet he smiled too though against his will and against his state of mind well youve got the video i dont have those last few minutes on tape which was mallorys way of saying she had erased the part where he had opened fire on a little boy and therefore it had never happened every now and then she surprised him with unexpected insight and delicacy that took balls charles faking him out with an empty gun she eased off the desk and padded out of the room followed by the cat which made more noise on its feet less graceful now with the weight of its new bandage a trace of perfume lagged behind and it was a few minutes more before mallory was altogether gone in the romantic literature of another age a woman might have asked wouldst thou slay a dragon for my sake but the world had changed was changing still and the monsters were cruelly deceptive in their different faces in the bizarre romance near the edge of a new century mallory might ask wouldst thou slay a child for my sake she had a
