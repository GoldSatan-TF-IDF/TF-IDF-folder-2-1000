ridley pearson the risk agent friday september pm chongming island china lu hao a slim welldressed man in his twenties stood on the roof of a subcompact car the size of a toaster peering over a tenfoothigh concreteblock wall and into the parking lot outside an aging tannery there was almost too much going on for the senses the acrid smell of tar the clamor of dump trucks and road rollers the din of chinese spoken in machinegun staccato lu hao had been schooled from an early age about the role chance and fate played in ones life if he hadnt driven past that particular fuel station at that exact time he would have never recognized the foul mongolian a man he knew from his deliveries over in shanghai would have never followed him to the remote location would have never witnessed the meeting where three men went into a factory building and only two came out he had watched through a crack in the hanging doors as the smallest youngest of the three argued with a portly chinese man wearing an expensive suit with a nod from the businessman the younger guy was then bludgeoned by the mongolian a moment later back outside the mongolian shook the hand of the businessman who then walked over to a black audi sedan and was driven away as the license plate flashed in the glare of a floodlight lu gasped the plate carried only the number indicating a person of extreme importance a highranking official without question why here of all places trembling now lu hao clung to the wall refusing to move and risk attracting attention terror rippled through him opportunity risk reward chance fate a part of him wished he could forget what hed seen wished he could sneak off in the chinesemade subcompact he was about to do just that when the mongolian inspecting the paving job jerked his head up quickly in the direction of the yards far corner lu hao looked in the same direction cao he cursed silently a glass lens winked from above the wall it belonged to a sizable video camera in the grip of a pair of whiteskinned hands a waiguorena foreigner lu hao dropped from the wall like a stone fumbled for his keys and was into his car in a heartbeat no more he would determine how to best use this information later when he could be calm and reasonable he might appeal for help he might go to the temple and burn incense but for now hed get gone return to shanghai and hope that he too had not been seen thursday september pm changning district shanghai china lu hao rode his lovingly restored cj motorcycle its sidecar seat covered by an oilcloth tarpaulin hiding a duffel bag that minutes earlier had contained cash a good deal of cash the kind of cash lu hao needed in order to repay his father for his own foolish mistake but now the duffel was nearly emptya few thousand yuan was all that remained he returned his eyes to the street to glance away from shanghai traffic for more than a second could prove fatal the middle lens of a shanghai traffic light was an lcd timer that counted down to the light change giving motorists on both sides of the intersection time to at least consider the traffic laws not that anyone obeyed them the traffic laws in shanghai were offered more as suggestion than enforceable law lu hao revved the bikea thing of beauty a sound like that he drew a few envious looks hundreds of waiting vehicles crawled forward a darwinian exercise commenced in the wide bike lane to the right motorcycles assumed the lead followed by motor scooters electric bikes and finally bicycles not a horn sounded not a curse was thrown everyone knew their place lu hao turned off yanan road a tenlane arterial and traffic immediately lessened a few more turns and he entered a time machine shanghai as it was a century before laundry hung like colorful prayer flags from bamboo poles jutting from apartment windows there were more pedestrians than vehicles on the street he slowed straddling the motorcycles sonorous rumble a delivery man had dumped a halfdozen fifteengallon water cooler bottles off his motor scooter stopping traffic lu hao swung right again down a narrow street lined with stalls old toothless men in white undershirts commandeered secondfloor windows the spirited laughter of a mahjong game echoed down the lane mixing with an out of tune piano implausibly working through gershwin he caught movement from his left a man running toward him at top speed head down an ambush forced upon him by the spilled water bottles the lane was a choke point he glanced to the sidecar and the hidden duffel his attacker led with his shoulder connecting with lu hao and knocking him off the bike two more men appeared they grabbed hold of him he was dragged facedown barely conscious and thrown into the back of a microvan where yet another man slapped duct tape over his mouth and pulled a plastic tie around his wrists then everyone started shouting at once clete danner wore the motorcycle helmets mirrored visor down to hide his american face he bent into the handlebars to disguise his sizethere werent many chinese who were sixthree and twothirty when the threat came from lu haos left danner vaulted the bike and in an infinitesimal misjudgment caught the toe of his right shoe on the frame he overcompensated suddenly finding himself offbalance and thrown back on his heels only a few meters from the van a nunchaku came at him like an airplane propeller its aluminum cylinder striking his raised right forearm he felt a bone snap he went lightheaded and a deep purple overtook his vision he cocked his right leg and kicked the nunchaku connected with his upper thigh but the man holding it went airborne slamming into the metal frame of the van and sliding down unconscious his assailant was hauled inside there was much screaming in mandarin the vans motor strained and coughed exhaust from the tailpipe the van backed up knocking danner over his helmeted head bounced off the asphalt everything went dark a second or twomorehad passed followed by pain the broken arm the bruised thigh his concussed head he was dragged into the van the smell of sweat oil and blood overwhelming him the van doors banged shut a flurry of angry mandarin as the van took off his helmet was ripped off his head waiguoren he heard he knew he could not possibly be part of their plans hed had lu hao under surveillance for months where had these guys come from his cover was now blown the entire operation was blown the pain subsided replaced by a deep and welcome silence friday september days until the ransom am hong kong special administrative region china the twentyfourthfloor corner office overlooking the bustling hong kong harbor and on the opposite shore kowloon was spacious its appointments comfortable three flatpanel screens surrounded a sitting area one displaying a blackandblue logo of mirror image rs beneath which was written rutherford risk security matters brian primer ran rutherford risks asian division he wore a golf tan beneath a full head of hair his face punctuated by gray flinty eyes turning to his left he addressed david dulwich one of his six key field operatives picking up on dulwichs reference to a takeaway food container in a photograph it was but one of many photographs on the coffee table between them along with a brown paper takeout food container with a wire handle jesus said allan marquardt the boyishly handsome fortyfiveyearold ceo of construction industry giant the berthold group marquardt sported a tailored suit with a blue pocket square and matching tie the corner of a china air ticket envelope peeked out from his breast pocket he was reacting not to the photo but to the memory of opening the food container less than ten hours earlier and discovering its contents a photograph of two mena chinese holding a newspaper and an american holding his broken armtaken against the backdrop of a hung bedsheet a carefully folded ransom note two plastic bags each containing a single qtip dulwich said the one on the right hes ours cletus danner he was keeping tabs on mr lu must have walked into this both alive at the time of the photo confirmed pol proof of life he means primer informed marquardt youll get up to speed on the acronyms quickly anything you dont understand just ask like why somebody would do this marquardt asked its a business dont personalize it us concerns paid out four hundred million dollars last year in ransom in mexico alone come on at thirtynine dulwich had a face lined with worry and consternation a fleshy scar that looked like melted wax climbed out from beneath the tshirt he wore under his opennecked oxford buttondown the qtips are assumed to be dna swabs dulwich said were running them now another two days minimum but theyll come back lu hao and cletus danner used to be you sent a severed finger for the sake of the print we havent seen swabs used before our takers are young educated and enterprising seems a stretch for a triadan organized gangthough not out of the question whatever the case its very clever and tells us these are not people to mess with we want to get this handled and get both hostages home asap brian primer passed dulwich the plastic evidence bag holding the ransom note the brown papers common enough in china dulwich explained having already studied it easily purchased simplified chinese characters written in pencilnothing terribly interesting about that the lack of a political manifesto suggests its all business thats good for all of us our insurance will pay our half of the ransom marquardt said as i assume yours will as well primer nodded just like a ceo thought dulwich thinking about cash before lives theyll kill them once theyre paid said dulwich you cant know that marquardt said our mans dead for sure at that point dulwich said calmly if they dont do him before our one hope is that as an american hes worth more to them alive why kill him at all marquardt asked because at some point hes too great a liability a chinese kidnapping a waiguoren an american at that you dont want to get caught better to bury him jesus mission accomplished dulwich had gotten the human cost to sink in marquardt had turned ghostly pale the ransom demand names the first of the month so were already short on time dulwich continued our clients typically are given weeks or even months until the drop this shortened schedule is disturbing primer said the first is the start of the national day holiday dulwich said which coincides with the autumn festival this year its an interesting choice he set the ransom note on the coffee table you make it all sound soordinary marquardt said if only primer said the dna samples the hurried schedule by no means ordinary dulwich screwed up his courage and asked the question primer wouldnt whats more important to the berthold group mr marquardt the recovery of lu haos recordkeeping or lu himself thats a hell of a thing to ask marquardt said thats not an answer dulwich said to his bosss obvious discomfort what mr dulwich means is its important to clarify and prioritize your goals primer said i wont lie to you said marquardt lu haos records of the incentives could be extremely damaging to the company and to me personally youre referring to the two australians who just got twelve years in chinese prison for similar incentivizing dulwich said the case won our attention marquardt admitted it had stunned the entire expatriate community bribery overpayment incentives were part and parcel of chinese dealmaking for nearly a decade the chinese government had been working to ferret out corruption among its officials but reaching into the private sector and imprisoning foreign businessmen had never seemed remotely possible remember allan primer said were your representatives in this were not here to judge you only to get the job done the job you want done and that means prioritizing if the documents are more important then so be it we lost one of our men in this hes our priority so dont think for a minute were going to abandon extraction but how we approach recovering mr lu for the berthold group will be adjusted depending on your priorities and needs were talking about human lives marquardt said i never thought thered be any question of priorities we pay the ransom we get them back like i said dulwich told him it isnt that simple we wish but if these people are professionalsand we have no reason to believe otherwisethen theyll have a halfdozen separate groups in play the person overseeing the entire operation is called the intellectual then theres the hostagetakers the hostagekeepers one or more surveillance teams ransom retrieval delivery and processing hostage return jesus its big business dulwich said only the intellectual has the full picture sees all the parts and hes removed from the others we never get to him none of the groups knows of the others which is what keeps it safe for the intellectual and makes it nearly impossible for us so yes we work to help you stay calm and to negotiate the release of or extract the hostages as you know we have a rate of success in the midnineties we know what were doing if this was colombia bolivia or any of the stans itd be simpler but this is china and our guys an american even if yours isnt they kidnapped an american that gives them two things a rationale to make a high money demand and a reason to kill the hostages marquardt looked even paler dulwich noted he seemed to miss the fact that four hundred thousand dollars was a paltry demand that point had not escaped him and primer ten million would have been a typical starting point so why not when a chinese is kidnapped and safely returned thats the end of it an american the kidnappers will be hunted down by police caught and executed period they know that we know that whether they meant to take our man or not its too late now thats why theyve set a relatively short timetable for the ransomto get this over quickly get out of dodge but make no mistake once its paid theyll kill and bury at least our guy maybe both hostages its the safest move mother of god marquardt whispered but remember primer said they still want the ransom to win it they need to offer us at least one more proofoflife maybe two we have a week to locate and extract the hostages maybe push back the demand certainly negotiate the amount down because theyll expect that its doable all right marquardt nodded back to the accounts dulwich said theres another aspect to it lu haos records of the bribes could be extremely important for us as well as to you you want to keep the incentives secret fine we might be able to use the list of people receiving the bribes to find our men any one of the recipients of those incentives could be directly or indirectly responsible for the kidnappings with so little to go on and so little time thats one area we intend to explore there are many other avenues well pursue primer hastened to add but lu haos records are our best lead equally important everything rutherford risk does in shanghai has to be done virtually invisibly so while were searching for mr lus records it cant look like were involved for one thing it would put the hostages at added risk the kidnappers demand is for no police and that includes us for another we cant legally operate in china the chinese authorities have not been notified of the kidnapping as you know marquardt nodded i understand and agree what we need said primer is someone levelheaded and preferably chinese to act as our berthold group contact and lead this search he paused we have someone in mind dulwich said marquardt looked anxiously between the two this person primer said happens to be the one who recommended mr lu haos services to your company in the first place which means she has a personal connection to mr lu you need to know that to approve that going in its not sop for us but china presents us withunusual difficulties and restrictions youre forbidden from doing business there yes im well aware of that marquardt said of having any professional presence whatsoever within the prc dulwich said peoples republic of china david will put together a freelance teampeople not on any security company payrolls including our ownto try to find mr lus accounts and to perform the ransom drop andor extraction you need not know and should not know the details its imperative that you trust us and more than anything that you cooperate fully with us of course with the help of your hr division david is prepared to put our person in position today you may communicate with her as you wish but only where and when she determines it appropriate i understand who is she grace chu shes a chinese national convenient for our purposes she took her undergraduate in shanghai a masters in economics at berkeley and another in criminology at uc irvine she works here in hong kong as a forensic accountant technically as far as the chinese are concerned she is a private contractor not our employee and untraceable to us but shes one of the best forensic accountants weve worked with you will meet her in a moment primer gestured to dulwich who left the room little was done by telephone inside rutherford riskinteroffice communication was accomplished through runners we have never officially signed an employment agreement with ms chu primer continued nor has she ever been on our payroll ms chu can enter china as a recent hire of the berthold group with no one the wiser she can lead the search for mr lus records as well as aid your accounting department as necessary she can also make adjustments to correct discrepancies in your public accounts shell know what to do with mr lus books as well when theyre found you sound soconfident marquardt said david should have a second person on the ground in shanghai by tomorrow ms chu will be in place by this evening noon tomorrow at the latest the sooner the better said marquardt after all we only have until the first of the month came a womans melodic voice grace chu entered the room with dulwich who closed the door her gray tailored business suit complimented a figure that for most westerners needed some help up top marquardt rose and the two shook hands she took a chair immediately to primers left honestly she said i would have thought the eighth we chinese believe in the power of numerology eight is good yunqigood luck she had a wide face peaceful and serene her shoulders were broad the muscle tone in her arms taut and impressive her skin looked airbrushed but it was her nearly unflinching eyes that unnerved marquardt you will forgive me mr marquardt she said i have made a cursory examination of your companys general accounts for the past quarter lu haos contractthe incentive moneyis paid from your ga your general accounts ledger it averages one hundred seventytwo thousand us dollars per month i will need to see the rest of your accounts the endofyear to know how to better conceal these expenditures because right now youre open to questions questions your people may have difficulty answering i have drafted some recommendations at the request of mr primer she handed marquardt a clear plastic file folder thank you grace primer said she took this as a dismissal and stood from her chair please marquardt said motioning for her to stay seated you knew mr lu i know mr lu she corrected grace checked with primer who nodded she leaned forward he is the younger brother of a close friend of mine i helped in the selection process when you requested a person to pay out the incentives for you do you have any idea where we might find his recordkeeping as i understand it thats possibly key to his and mr danners survival marquardt said ideas i follow money money that wants to be followed money that doesnt want to be followed i will start with the obvious proceed to the likely and continue to the possible its a process of elimination dulwich said you two will likely need to discuss this more thoroughly once youre back to shanghai we need to work out how to do that in a believable way grace ideas correct me if im wrong but a chinese employee such as an accountant grace said would rarely if ever be in direct contact with the ceo so we must find a believable way for us to come together without arousing suspicion pardon my impertinence but do you take a mistress what marquardt blushed if your secretary or assistant is aware of such a companion then it would make things easier for us i could assume that roleplatonic of course no im married happily married marquardt rolled his wedding band as to our chinese employees below the level of vice president grace specified marquardt stammered dulwich said face it your chinese employees are invisible right graces us education helps us a little but theres still no good excuse for the two of you being seen together unless youre jumping her that is nonplussed marquardt said it cant be this hard more difficult than you can imagine dulwich said you are already likely being monitored by a variety of competing intereststhe police the kidnappers your competitors possibly even the press there are eyes and ears within your companywe can count on that this kidnapping is on the street good god you cant be serious your every movement will be under constant surveillance for the next week we have little doubt you were likely tracked to this building marquardt looked clearly out of his depth as he glanced from face to face around him might i suggest grace said awaiting a faint nod from primer that i file a complaint with hr within hours of my taking my position nothing sexual not harassment but something of a financial origin breach of contract perhaps dissatisfaction with whatever lodging has been arranged mr marquardt anxious to keep me could request an audience with me to settle the complaint following this initial meeting he will then upgrade my housing and we might have reason to follow up on occasion primer checked with dulwich then marquardt i like a woman who can think on her feet marquardt said better on my feet than the alternative grace said for a moment it appeared primer might reprimand her instead he laughed grace did service with the prcs army for two years was assigned to intelligence for her final eleven months shes trained in surveillance handtohand combat small munitions and communications he smiled at her in the workplace youll find her passive and demure oneonone well lets just say shes no shrinking violet youre a welcome addition ms chu marquardt said when next we meet grace said remember it is for the first time you may or may not be taken with my appearance as you wish but you will be in no mood to accommodate my accusations of breach of contract its best if i have to fight you at least somewhat for that victory understood she stood and they shook hands again he held on to hers a little too long but she made no attempt to separate instead she hung her head slightly suddenly a different woman pleasures mine she backed up a step pivoted smartlya hint of sandalwood and cinnamonand waited for dulwich to open the door for her before leaving pm ban lung cambodia accompanied by a local guide and driver a mosquitobitten john knox had been traveling for nine days through the jungles of cambodia on a buying trip he had packed the back of his land rover to the ceiling with tribal arts and crafts primarily handcarved stone boxes and some hammered bronze he had spent the past two days in virachey national park the most direct route to ban lung knox checked his appearance in the land rovers rearview mirror before climbing out hed run out of soap three days earlier and his beard had grown in quickly the dark stubble contrasting sharply with dark blue eyes that shone richly in the afternoon light his hair was oily his shirt sweatstained and soiled he ran his tongue over teeth cleaning up some of the gorp that had sustained him over the last forty miles and washed it down with a swig of warm water from a plastic bottle his driver spoke some thai the one language common between them unpack car find yourself a room knox said handing him a considerable amount of cash knowing the man would keep it and sleep in the car unload everything into my hotel this evening well ship it in the morning the village was a mix of aging concrete blocks and palmfrondroofed huts on stilts knox refocused on the front porch of the small hotel and a line of chairs beneath waterstained sailcloth paddle fans turning lazily against the heat he met eyes with the man occupying one of the chairs a grin swept painfully across his chapped lips he licked them david dulwich lifted his sweating beer bottle and gestured to an unoccupied chair look what the cat dragged in said knox mounting the steps you look like shit dulwich a former army sergeant had as a civilian managed the trucking contractor that had hired a young john knox as a driver to convoy supplies from kuwait into iraq the runs paid eighty thousand dollars a month hazard pay that knox had banked to cover his brothers longterm medical expenses back home the two men shook hands and slapped each other on the back dulwich signaled a waiter for two beers knox simply stared waiting him out what i was in the neighborhood uhhuh sure you were sarge i wanted first dibs on the teapots or prayer wheels or nose flutes or whatever the hell it is youve stolen off the unsuspecting locals only tommy knew i was coming to ban lung knox said you took unfair advantage knox had lived his entire life protecting and defending tommy about whom many jokes had been cracked not the sharpest knife in the drawer room temperature iq knox had heard them all had broken a few faces over them his brother suffered from bouts of epilepsycontrollable by medicationmigraines and moderate learning disabilities with proper oversight tommy could function as knoxs business partner but he also possessed a savantlike ability in math and computer sciences he displayed remarkable processing speed and bandwidth while often proving himself socially immature and inept despite his thirtyone years tommy was the one and only absolute in knoxs life the two were joined at the hip the wallet by blood and by telephone and skype dulwich shrugged tommy sounded great told me hes running the online sales which hes good at as it happens the beers arrived knox was tired and hungry he cautioned himself about drinking the beer too quickly he needed to remain on his toes given his present company he pledged to sip not gulp now it was dulwichs turn to stare cutting penetrating im not interested knox said the bottle finding its way to his lips a little too quickly it didnt take a giant leap for knox to understand what was at play hed turned down the offer of joining civilian convoys in afghanistan more than once hed been lucky to get out of kuwait intacthe realized that now others including dulwich had injuries that had nearly taken their lives now he and tommy had a business up and running with their parents both goneor as good as goneit was important that knox stay alive and the importexport business continue to succeed but it was also paramount to keep tommy supervised something that required a constant stream of money at present things were decent not great but decent no doubt the man sitting across from him had run a credit check dulwich did due diligence no doubt he knew of knoxs desire to set up a fund to cover his brothers medical costs no doubt he knew he and tommy were walking a knifes edge that an infusion of capital was exactly what the doctor ordered shithead dulwich showed him a photo and told him a long story about a kidnapping in china that had involved someone named lu hao the story ended with i had a guy shadowing lu he got caught up in it they took him hostage along with lu its danner dulwich unfolded a photocopy of the ransom demand and passed it across to knox this was part of a lunchtime takeout order delivered by a sherpas guy to the construction companys ceo a man named marquardt runs a construction firm called berthold knox glanced at the note then back at dulwich sherpa was a popular food service delivery company that delivered from dozens of city restaurants not interested he lied in for a penny in for a pound dna swab accompanied the ransom note along with a photo we need a comparison sample dannys dna knox said yes try peggy we dont involve spouses until we have confirmation is that common a dna swab no first time for us young yes dulwich said you have a photo knox reminded ever heard of photoshop we need a dna sample this is danner cant help you its shanghai said dulwich by way of explanation you work out of shanghai sometimes six trips there in the last fourteen months knox eyed him for a moment dulwichs new gig gave him access to far too much information for knoxs comfort i like china looking at knox people might have taken him for a nomad but few would imagine the extent of it when not living out of a tent in some trading outpost he called hotels and rentals home tommy ran the online side of the company back in detroit unaware the guests at the house were paid home health aide supervisors while knox roamed all corners of asia from the middle east to eastern china parts of south america and eastern europe as their buyer with the death of their father three years earlier knox had assumed full responsibility for tommy hed left the highpaying highrisk work forming the more manageable trading company and bringing tommy in on it so far so good what do you make of the ransom demand asked dulwich knox studied the photocopy lefthanded under thirty because dulwich leaned forward writing mandarin in simplified characters began in the nineteentwenties it didnt take hold until the fifties and sixties this character knox said circling one with his finger was modified more recently than that and began being taught in schools in the late eighties that gives us the relative age of the writer as to the calligraphythe tails are from a lefty i cant tell from the photocopywas this written in ink or pencil pencil the continuity of the lines the lead suggests a mechanical pencil common enough there but maybe he works as a draftsman or engineer or hes a beancounter the date the first of the month is western notation not chinese thats interesting why not chinese notation knox slid the document back across the table with his index finger but you know all this already some of it not all i need you knox danner needs you we need a hair sample an electric razoranything with his dna for verification when he was first getting to know dulwich back in kuwait knox had read him as a steakandpotatoes guy the kind of person who got his reading from the back of shampoo bottles while on the can but over time hed revealed a deeper intelligence and far broader interests than knox had initially suspected now dulwich had the resources of a major security companyrutherford riskat his disposal companies like rutherford risk operated like a private cia or nsa knox knew better than to get sucked into one of their operations i see two people in his capacity as a consultant for the berthold group dulwich continued lus main job was incentivizing certain individuals and companies involved with the construction job you mean he was paying out bribes yeah dulwich shrugged hes known to have kept a set of books of these confidential payments one theory is that one of the individuals receiving the kickbacks realized how valuable a man like lu hao was to berthold and snatched him up another knox cut in listen i feel horrible about danny i do but ive got tommy in a good place i cant afford to step out on the business even for a short time im sorry youre sere trained i paid for it in the first place few civilians were allowed into the militarys survival evasion resistance escape training program a lifetime ago for knox dulwich had arranged for him and six others to go through sere training as well as the fbis quantico course it made knox a uniquely qualified civilian you know plenty of others with sere training exair force hire one of them they dont do regular business in shanghai dulwich said this is clete danner were talking about man maybe i judged you wrong knox sighed looked away maybe so you ever seen the inside of a chinese prison dulwich asked give it a rest thats beneath you if psb get danner thats where hes headed for an eternity you know the laws hell be considered a spy we need to beat them to it and we need to move quickly the public security bureauthe shanghai policewas nothing to mess with and if i slip up itll be the same thing for me ive got tommy no go weve put a woman into shanghai an accountant who knew the hostage personally shell pose as a new berthold employee and go after the bookkeeping with you she can interpret it once youve got it the hope is those docs will help lead us to the kidnappers in time meanwhile well be preparing to negotiate the ransom and the drop dangerous to play both sides like that yeah but what are you gonna do if a triad took lu hao and danner what do you think theyll do to the american once the ransom is paid dont lay this on me its not about you its about danner hes facing prison or death you know i wouldnt ask you otherwise knox shook his head bullshit you wouldnt look you have a legitimate reason to be in shanghai pretend like its a business trip meet up with the woman were putting in place support her help find lus accounts well supply you with whatever we can on the sly and if we find danner you bring him out and what if i dont get out knox snapped realizing as he said it that his mouth had betrayed him what happens to tommy then well pay your fee to him dulwich said sensing his progress well double it deep pockets on this one i dont like it knox said tommy says youre bored tommy talks too much enough with the cheap shots you know what i think dulwich said i dont remember asking you once said pulling me out of that truck changed everything remember that yeah thats about the same time i decided not to go to afghanistan and to get out of the contracting business peggy is eight months pregnant with their second dulwich said of danners wife she went hysterical when i told her hed gone missing shes forbidden from flying stuck in houston shit knox should have known about the pregnancy should have stayed in better touch i cant put any of our guys into china right now dulwich said weve had inquiriesformal inquiries asking if one of our employees is missing theyll be watching immigration but since you do business there on a regular basis you go in as you just another buying trip you meet up with the woman and together you find the books find lu hao and danner i dont babysit knox said you wont have to shes former red army very very smart and a looker shit shit and shit we have to leave tonight dulwich said checking his wristwatch he said wheels up in ninety knox drummed his fingers on the rattan tabletop and what if they do kill him then we deliver the wrath of god upon them you and me whatever it takes slowly knox stood and stretched do i have time for a shower god dulwich said with a smile i sure hope so pm huangpu district shanghai the waiting area of the guangdong road psb was a gray tubelit room with a poster warning of avian flu hung thickly with cigarette smoke the officerofthemonth photo hadnt been changed since june a blacklight bugkiller sparked randomly above the door into the station strode a wideshouldered chinese man shen deshi he had cropped hair a crushed nose and thin lips he wore a black leather jacket a gold chain around his neck and tinted glasses that partially hid searching distrustful eyes he proffered his credentials to the receptionist who worked to disguise her alarm the peoples armed police was the most highranking the most respected and feared in all of national law enforcement an armored division of both military and police bureaus pap officers carried concealed weapons and were free to use them at their discretion officers of the elite corps were often referred to by the nickname iron hand shen deshi leaned onto his forearms on the countertop his fingers were blunt wide and bent awkwardly each having been broken multiple times may i help you she inquired in shanghainese to test his origins i am shen deshi he said also in shanghainese i will speak with your most senior officer on duty i do not wish to be kept waiting she glanced toward the phone but then thought better of it one moment please shen deshi took a seat between two women waiting in chairs against the wall he gave the younger of the two a slight smile as he appraised her from ankle to chest then he looked straight ahead as if alone in the room the desk officer returned with a slight man in a captains uniform he was in his midfifties with hollow cheeks and cheap eyeglasses officer shen the captain said this way please in the captains tiny office shen deshi brushed off the chair unnecessarily before sitting we are honored by your visit the captain said the two men exchanged business cards proffering them held at the edges by both hands and with a slight bow of the head the honor is all mine i assure you shen deshi said flatly wanting the formalities out of the way may i offer you some tea i would be delighted but do not wish to trouble you or your staff it is no trouble at all i assure you the captain worked the intercom and ordered some tea there was no further conversation until the tea arrived some five minutes later shen deshi accepted the cup and immediately set it aside thank you he said it is my pleasure the captain said behind clenched teeth i need everything you have on the severed human hand that was fished from the yangtze you will withhold nothing he sat back eyed the steaming cup of tea one more time but did not reach for it im waiting the captain worked the intercom to request the evidence and all documentation an unusual case the captain said shen deshi offered only a disapproving look we followed procedure of course then i am sure to write a glowing report the captain swallowed dryly such discoveries are to be reported quickly said shen deshi the skimmersthe trash skimmers at the mouth of the yangtzesnag bodies on a regular basis the captain reported maritime accidents of course a utopian society did not foster suicide i did not know how to report this severed hand the captain said carefully its existence implied a violent crime or accident but one having taken place well upstream of shanghai a difficult situation shen deshi said though his face said otherwise i checked the reports of course saw nothing that might connect of this i am sure shen deshi said the ministrythe ministry of state security the chinese intelligence agencyis interested in this hand a quick resolution to this investigation could benefit all concerned it has my full attention the movement of certain members of an american film crew are at the heart of it indeed let us say they may have strayed from the parameters set forth in their visas the ministry is intent on knowing where they have been and more importantly why to cancel the visas perhaps shen deshi said his eyes warned the captain not to get ahead of himself the minutes stretched out the captain complimented his guest on the strength of his name shen the family name meant dont yield deshi virtuous the combination of the two was outstanding it had obviously brought the man much yunqiluck shen deshi avoided pointing out the captains name was weak his family name sounding too much like the number five which was bad yunqi the captain reached for the phone as a knock sounded on his office door a uniformed officer entered with a fogged plastic bag containing the human hand along with an assortment of photographs and paperwork we have kept it at a constant temperature of two degrees the captain explained shen deshi looked it over through the plastic handed it back to the messenger and told him to keep it frozen he then studied the photographs all properly scaled and a sheet of partial fingerprints he read the paperwork carefully the ring he asked oklahoma state university the captain replied shen deshi leveled a look on the man you see not so difficult an american it is a fortuitous start burned into his eyes was the fact that the captain had failed to notify anyone of the apparently dead foreigner the captain picked up on this and quickly defended his actions it was our intention to complete the preliminary investigation before troubling our superiors yes of course third document we have faxed a copy of the fingerprints to the ministry and are awaiting a response you covered yourself properly shen deshi said his voice grating barely able to contain his temper the hand was cleaved cleanly at the wrist there is either a onehanded american out there looking for his school ring or a dead american butchered on chinese soil his body parts floating down the yangtzethe rest of him long gone by now the americans must be notified right away the evidenceall of itmust be shared with them i will see to it i will contact the embassy myself personally i will do so immediately the captain reached for the phone not the embassy shen deshi said finally venting your idiocy is a pox on us all you bring us great shame the captain recoiled this was the gravest insult one could deliver great shame obliterated careers great shame could lead a man to the noose let me think a moment shen deshi reached over and took up the teacup and sipped nice tea he said suddenly pleasant i thank you for it my pleasure the captain was sweating the better course is to deliver the evidence to the consulate here in shanghai shen deshi said you will notify the us consulate humbly begging your pardon honorable shen but it would be faster to faster yes but thats the point it will take the consulate time to determine exactly what they have i need that time to further my investigation and get ahead of them i must be able to answer the obvious questions they will have you will quietly make inquiries if any upstream districts are reporting any assaults murders or disappearances involving foreigners right away i will need duplicates of all of this immediately we must not lose face with the americans bad yunqi for us all i will make the calls quietly as a mouse and i will deliver the information to a lowlevel bureaucrat i know at the consulate and even then not all the evidence not until they officially request it that may factor in another day or two for you this is very good thinking captain theres yet a chance that you can undo these mistakes that were no doubt made by your subordinates you are gracious perhaps said shen deshi smiling grimly some discipline is in order to set the proper tone hey there skype video challenged knox not for the technological issues but because his brother looked so normal boyishly handsome a kind face one would never suspect the problems that lurked behind the mans warm eyes you havent called me in a long time tommy said the childlike singsong to his voice gave him away how long had it been knox wondered tommy was prone to exaggeration im heading to china for a week or two i thought you were in cambodia tommy didnt miss muchthe doctors got that part wrong time and time again en route to hong kong then on to shanghai more pearls i think our inventory is okay johnny theres always something good in shanghai like a paycheck that might begin to endow tommys future medical costs their partnership gave them a reason to work together it was something tommy not only could handle but was good at it kept knox traveling it was never going to make them rich it could be good for us i thought you were coming home pouty knox rarely went home he made a million excuses to himself all of them convincing but the truth nibbled at the edges stinging i am buddy just need to get this out of the way first business first tommy said sounding like a mynah bird you got it ill tell eve evelyn ritter their bookkeeper tommy had a crush the size of texas good idea whats wrong tommy asked that was the thing about tommy what he lacked in academic intelligence he compensated with intuition maybe hed learned to read knoxs expressions though knox was well practiced and tried not to send conflicting signals maybe hed heard something in his voice or maybe it was far more subtle knoxs timing his choice of short sentences maybe his kid brother just got him like no one else its a side job tommy moonlighting he wasnt going to lie talking down to tommy resulted in regression a lesson long since learned something for dave dulwich mr dulwich excitement the soldier you rescued dulwich had been a soldier once but not when knox had pulled him from that truck knox said you know mr dulwich can i speak to him i think you already did knox said not meaning to silence hed stung him with that tommy lived to please his older brother any sense hed inflicted something on knox would burrow down deep inside him and come out later as something far more vile i wouldnt have gotten this offer knox said if it hadnt been for you you think i know are you kidding youre taking care of me i thought it was supposed to be the other way around tommys laughter coughed static across an otherwise surprisingly clear connection knox at forty thousand feet in a private jet tommy on a smart phone in detroit he leaned to get a good look out the window at the chunks of land and water so far below from somewhere within came the urge to refuse dulwichs offer or was it too late knox laughed along with his brother as a cloud pulled the blinds and the space inside the plane grew mildly claustrophobic saturday september days until the ransom pm pudong district shanghai knox arrived at shanghai internationals sprawling new terminal wearing a khakicolored scottevest windbreaker with most of its fifteen concealed pockets occupied by his passport cash documents and electronic devices he wore a pair of white earbuds the wires from which disappeared into the jackets collar and connected to an unseen white iphone provided by dulwich the iphone was apparently one of rutherford risks newest toys during calls it switched cellular carriers every ten seconds limiting any electronic eavesdropping to a few spoken words here and there customs let out into an lshaped gauntlet of webstrap retainers beyond which stood hundreds of chinese holding signs or waving frantically loud and chaotic just how knox liked it he blended into the crowd heading for the maglev traina frictionless marvel the envy of the engineering world the thirtykilometer train trip took only seven minutes bypassing what would have been forty minutes of congested highway traffic he determined he likely wasnt being followed though video surveillance was another matter china employed seven million closedcircuit surveillance cameras and the worlds fastest computers for face recognition shanghai operated half a million of those cameras knox boarded the number line and switched trains at peoples square arriving at a busy corner on huaihai middle road the sidewalk was jammed a light rain falling the colorful umbrellas moved like a dragon dance beneath an awning of plane trees a throwback to the french concessions storied past when in the midnineteenth century an outlying part of the burgeoning city had been given to the french to keep the foulsmelling foreigners in their place a weary knox reached the fourstar jin jiang hotel with wet hair and damp jeans he paid a discounted price in cash part of a longstanding deal with the manager this was not the first time hed created a doubleblind to hide his place of residence twice before in the thick of difficult negotiations with black market traders hed feared for his safety and had created a false residence at the jin jiang which like all hotels registered their guestsforeign and domesticwith local police he entered his fifthfloor roomas a general precaution he never stayed above the fifth floor of a hoteland placed his bag on the desk then tore back the bedding ran the shower and dampened a bath towel to mimic a persons use of the room he tore the housekeepers v from the toilet paper roll removed a bar of soap from its wrapping and passed it under the faucet poured some shampoo and conditioner from the complimentary bottles and flushed it down the toilet the mirror revealed a face now permanently tanned and ruddy from the elements juxtaposed against unnerving royalblue irises it was his eyes that caught the attention of women and men alike the eyesmore so than the asymmetrical eyebrows or the scar by his left ear or the cleft in his chinthat gave him an air of confident stillness some mistook for hardline arrogance this stillness had the unnerving effect of concealing the machinations of his thought process and while there was nothing in his affect that projected menace per se neither was one ever in doubt about his capabilities instead the doubt surrounding knox had to do with what brutal efficiencies might if pressed emerge from beyond his mask of calm back in the bedroom he moved the televisions remote to the bedside and drew the blackout curtains one last ruffling of the pillow and he admired his work as he awaited the knock on his door he tipped the bellman for returning his passport and slipped it into one of the jackets internal pockets he donned a tan tigers baseball cap checked the hallway through the doors peephole and left if possible hed return to disturb the room for a second or third time depending on his perception of risk soon he was back on the street in the thick of pedestrians it took him fifteen minutes to reach the alley entrance behind changle road he shook off the rain and entered the quintet guesthouse and climbed a narrow staircase to the first landing he pushed open the door with a light knock john knox ni hao ma knox said hello how are you hen hao answered fay quintets owner and manager she was in her late twenties with a long graceful neck and wideset eyes she wore a simple gray tshirt and no jewelry knox stirred at the sight of her pleasant memories rekindled a blind for a week knox said speaking english now officially im registered at the jin jiang what is it this time she asked jade he lied not feeling right about it she nodded you do get yourself in some binds she checked the computer ive got nothing tonight after that if you dont mind moving rooms a few times i can take care of you her attention still on the screen she pointed back at the couch you can sleep here if you like yes perfect thank you fay theres the toilet she indicated a door no shower im afraid until we get you into a room im grateful she spun in the chair its good to see you and you he fished a stack of yuan from his coatthe largest chinese bill was a hundredrmb note about fifteen us dollarsand peeled back twice her rack rate fay accepted without counting and slipped it into the desk drawer i would invite you to stay with me she said softly but i have a boyfriend good for you bad for me my guy has converted a lane house into office space leases the ground floor to a coffee shop good salads if youre interested cobb isnt it fay didnt forget much he made a mental note and nodded smiling i will tell my staff you are not here she continued that they never saw you but you will want to avoid our night watchman i dont know him well enough yet he just started he smokes out in the front patio from midnight to dawn you should be fine using your key on the back door i dont have a key she tossed him a loaded key ring a man like you you must be pretty used to back doors he switched to mandarin and cursed she laughed and returned one worse he prepared to continue the exchange of insultsgood chinese sportbut she was interrupted by a call when she turned around a moment later to speak knox was gone pm pudong district shanghai the pressure of lost time beat down on knox as steadily as the rain the likelihood of danner being found alive diminished with each passing hour some friendships carried debtclassmates survivors of catastrophe among them danner was both a fellow civilian classmate of knoxs during sere training his shotgun rider on the resupply convoys from kuwait city into iraq theyd grown rich together both avoiding serious injury and death and had each other to thank for it but danny was even more tommys legal guardian should anything happen to knox a lifelong burden hed readily accepted when asked now it was evidently dannys life at risk and knox knew that to turn his back was akin to danny turning his back on his brother when pressed knox rode a city bus across the huangpu river into the pudong district before attempting a search of lu haos residence where he hoped to locate lus bribery records knox first wanted to visit danners apartment he knew the dna was crucial but he also knew danner to be a thorough researcher if he were minding lu hao for rutherford and the berthold group then he would have known all about lus consulting work so there was at least a small chance hed have made a copy of lus books or created his own version or perhaps even made notes about where lu hao kept his confidential documents likewise if danner had had any suspicions about lu haos clientele he might have noted it in advance of their abduction knox would gladly follow any leads that danner had left behind pudong had arisen from shipyards and rice paddies twenty years earlier and was now the wall street of shanghai inventive office buildings and gorgeous apartment towers lined the wide streets the security guards in danners riverview coop were twentyyearold boys in illfitting gray suits knox knew they wouldnt mess with a waiguorena foreigner their job was to put a face on the compound and to keep out potential thieves and robbers knox introduced himself as a friend of mr danners and saw in their faces that they were aware of their residents absence he asked me to get a few of his things and send them to him knox said again he monitored their response what he detected surprised him what were they expressing it looked like fearjust below the surface it took knox a moment to make sense of it but once he did his heart sank someone had beaten him here he had a fairly good idea who that might be entrance to mr danners apartment is not possible said the most senior of the boys so very sorry must hear from mr danner directly knox switched to shanghainese a local dialect few westerners could command politely he berated the man for his insolence the guard flushed you will join me knox said still in shanghainese together we will take inventory anything i remove i will sign for no problem would you like to check with your manager i think this arrangement is good the guard said chastened and relieved i am glad you thought of such a workable solution knox said i will make certain to let your manager know how promptly and efficiently you handled my request he withdrew two hundred yuan from the vest on their way to the elevator making sure the guard saw him do so balling the money in his left hand knox kept the brim of the tigers cap toward the floor for the sake of the hallway cameras danners contemporary chinese luxury apartment was the perfect example of decorative contradiction marble floors fauxleather furniture glass dining room table all under the glow of lowvoltage lightingmixed together with red velvet curtains polished brass gold plumbing fixtures and leaded crystal lighting sconces gaudy pretentious and overthetop knox planted the man outside the door in the hallway then inside conducted a thorough search of danners desk closets drawers and bathroom he searched for hair samples to provide dulwich his dna sample maid service had scoured the place he failed to find a brush or comb offering hairs he located an electric toothbrush but doubted its sample strength he was about to give up when he spotted a clear plastic razor dispenser holding new and used razor blade cartridges he studied the used blades more carefullyall were caked with thick black lines beneath the blades whiskers he pocketed the dispenser he would overnight it he continued the search for evidence of a kidnapping danner was far too careful and clever to leave anything important where it might be easily discovered so knox also searched for hidden panels and loose floor tiles he accessed and unscrewed four air vents peering inside the closet safe was locked but if he was right about the man whod preceded him its contents were now gone five minutes dragged into ten fifteen knox took it to the next level patting down and searching his missing friends clothing an elliptical trainer faced a flatpanel tv a neatly folded white towel draped over its handlebars he checked in the slight inclined gap beneath it checked behind the flat panel checked the flat panel itself for a usb drive or memory card dug down into the soil of the potted plants searched the refrigerator and freezer pulled both away from the wall removed the stoppers from the sink and tub drains and looked for hidden wires or chains used to lower contents out of sight inspected the toilet tanks put his hand down the garbage disposal in the divided sink a framed bedside photograph of peggy and a twoyearold boy won knoxs attention stopping him he studied it then removed it from the frame but found nothing for show he gathered a pair of pajamas and placed them in his backpack along with two paperback books he would show these to the security man he took photos with his iphone and disassembled the apartments phone looking for eavesdropping bugs he collected a power supply from behind the desk taking note of the absence of dust on the power strip where a grounded plug had been connecteddanners laptop also plugged into the strip was a lonely charger cord its power supply marked garmin a gps he zipped it in his backpack as well he found the garmins owners manual in a desk drawer along with another for a honda motorcycle and one for the elliptical trainer he called the security man inside and showed him the few items he was taking out of the apartment but did not reveal the garmin power cord the man nodded not asking for knox to sign anything the other man or men that came here knox said calmly chinese or waiguoren i did not say other man come here same question the man didnt answer it is up to you knox said the issue of the computer being removed will have to be addressed of course waiguoren tall hair shaved close us consulate credentials it was the only person outside of a fellow rutherford risk employee whom knox could imagine talking his way inside and leaving with something like danners laptop computer still the man said nothing did he sign for it is there an inventory of what else was taken no one here no one take anything no need to sign i beg your indulgence knox said keeping it polite but i believe you may be mistaken you see mr danner asked me to collect his laptop computer for him and yet its not here do you see his laptop computer anywhere the security man squirmed if he did not sign for it did you search the waiguoren he hardly paused no i didnt think so the mans lips pursed and his eyes darted about i mean no disrespect but you see my job is complicated by the laptop not being here i said this man took nothing the mans voice faltered my mistake now in the elevator knox handed over the two hundred yuan again he spoke shanghainese the waiguoren asked you to contact him if someone like me made inquiries the security man stood stoically if you want to become further involved with the us consulate then go ahead and make that call he offered two more hundredyuan bills as for me i do not wish to be bothered cousin my government can make life hard for me same as your party can make life hard for you neh the bills disappeared knox fixed his gaze onto the man for the rest of the slow elevator ride the man stared straight ahead at their reflections in the polished metal then the doors opened and knox left the building his baseball cap brim held low against the eyes of the cameras as he entered the darkening dusk of shanghai pm changning district shanghai the door to allan marquardts corner office was flanked by two mahogany desks occupied by efficientlooking twentysomething women with rigid spines and beautiful faces though most employees were gone for the weekend not all had departed marquardt was not taking any days off given the current crisis neither were his secretaries grace checked in with an executive assistant named selena ming who approved her visit and rose to open the office doors for her grace squared her shoulders and brushed her hands over her gray suit doublechecked that her collar was peaked properly and fingered her modest string of pearls selena ming trailed behind her with a steno pad in hand as the door closed behind them marquardt rose to greet her grace wished he hadnt ms chu he said its nice to meet you ive heard so much about you better she thought the office was paneled in walnut with handknotted rugs overlaying the parquet flooring crowded bookshelves gave it the feel of a private library in the corner a gleaming black lacquer tray held cutglass bottles of colorful liquors and upsidedown glasses she felt as if shed stepped back into shanghai at the turn of the twentieth century what a breathtaking view she said crossing the spacious room and shaking hands with him marquardt indicated an armchair it was covered in red raw silk embroidered with hummingbirds the smell of sandalwood incense hung in the air selena ming delivered green tea and there was five minutes of small talk finally marquardt said you have filed a grievance with human resources his executive assistant took shorthand a minor misunderstanding is all i assume grace said you are displeased with your accommodations i believe it is nothing i was informed my residence would include lobby security and workout facilities yes in fact my present accommodations do not i am deeply sorry if there has been a misunderstanding he said no misunderstanding it is in writing we will resolve this immediately ms chu with your permission we will have your belongings transferred to a new residencehe checked a note on his deskto the kingland riverside luxury residence serviced apartments in pudong by the close of business today he passed grace a brochure selena ming looked up from her steno pad clearly intrigued then lowered her head the keys will be on your desk before you leave for the day i trust that will be satisfactory his tone and demeanor were pitchperfect that would be lovely thank you now he waved away selena please allow me to show you the view selena left and marquardt led grace out onto a narrow balcony closing the elegant french doors behind them she spoke softly i mentioned before that i need access to the endofyear recordsmore than just the ga i would appreciate the passwords required for access youll have them he said fifty floors below the traffic crawled antlike through intersections the smogencrusted skyline was broken by towering cranes the air alive with the percussive sounds of construction and the steady drone of traffic he pointed to the right of the jin mao tower just past the world financial center you see the building with the yellow crane on the very top yes thats oursthe xuan tower yes she said marquardt nodded proudly its a beautiful building and so far weve been tolerated by your government though clearly our participation is unwelcome he turned and looked at her we are beijings token foreign construction project authorized only to show the rest of the world they dont favor their own weve pissed off a lot of chinese grace i know we have but just how far i had no idea it appears nearly finished she said noting the buildings upper twenty stories were wrapped in a green fabric strung over elaborate scaffolding noting that he thought the kidnapping directly related to the construction of the tower theres much yet to be done is it coincidence that as we near completion lu hao is abducted and therefore the incentives stop and we encounter problems were only a couple days into this and were already experiencing costly slowdownsmaterials labor our vendors and suppliers arent getting their payments marquardt paused to make full eye contact with grace our problem is only mr lu knew their identities this is critical work youre doing ms chu it benefits your chinese competitors if you go down that road start with yang cheng yangs a devilish prick who has taken every opportunity for nearly a decade to remind me foreign builders dont belong here hes never accepted our being awarded the xuan i will start with lu haos apartment grace said the sooner i have the endofyear accounts the better i can help keep auditors from realizing the exact nature of lu haos work for you important should we fail in his recovery yes of course he said though didnt sound at all certain her blackberry vibrated take it if you want he said im fine she said noting that the call was from her mother she flushed slightly as she returned the device to its holster anything else he asked was there anyone within your company who served as a primary contact with lu hao preston song i would like a meeting with mr song not here not in the company building perhaps something social but soon ill arrange it before he opened the doors to the office marquardt said please be careful ms chu yes grace nodded back inside the office marquardt raised his voice slightly to make sure his assistants heard i trust you will find your new residence acceptable if you have any more problems feel free to bypass hr and bring them directly to me he paused we are pleased to have you working with us ms chu grace rode one of the elevators to the lobby and stepped outside for privacy she returned the call to her mother speaking mandarin mother you come to shanghai and do not tell me what kind of daughter are you her mother continued berating her but grace was stuck on the fact that her mother knew she was in shanghai how can you possibly i only arrived this morning third cousin by marriage teardrop chang was on a flight from hong kong you do not call your own mother your mother who carried you for nine months your mother who suffered your birth of course i was going to call she lied if you have returned for the sake of little brother lu please do not tell your father he will most certainly have heart failure why would i return for the sake of lu hao grace tried to sound naïve her heart pounding now her mother could not possibly know of the voice mail shed received from lu hao ahead of his kidnappinga voice mail shed ignored little brother lu has not called his mother does not answer his mobile phone has not been seen do you know nothing my daughter the detective listen mother she hissed into the phone covering the mouthpiece with her free hand i am not a detective i am an accountant a contract accountant and please no names over the phone then more conversationally you must not speak of that which you do not witness yourself such mistruths are dangerous do you hear me mother dangerous think carefully of the wellbeing of your family appealing to the womans sense of family was often the only way to get through to hernot a card grace could play very often if you can you must helpour friends son her mother said he must have his medicine the poor boy his mother is vexed although he looked fine to me at the party grace had been told of lu haos epilepsy years before by his older brother but shed forgotten until now had not considered he would be on daily medication what party mother his mother lu lis celebration four years of the rabbit lu hao was at the party of course as was i what day was that sixteenth of september you are certain lu hao had left the voice mail for her on friday the seventeenth have i not known this woman my entire life im as certain as i am of the shame you bring upon your father by not accepting the betrothal he has arranged for you she never failed to rub salt into that wound for lu lis birthday the families gathered lu hao was there on the island that thursday are you listening do you doubt your own mother four day celebration i will call you later she said and hung up friday the seventeenth guilt over never having returned his call wormed inside her lu haos medical condition had not come up when shed recommended him for the contract work for the berthold group along with the surprise that came with her mothers knowledge of her arrival was the news about lus condition and the inescapableand perhaps intentionalreminder of lu haos older brother lu jian with whom shed had a romance that had begun in high school and had ended nearly six years later with the announcement of her arranged marriage that had blindsided her shed fled shanghai joined the army and had broken off communication with her family for the next two years she had yet to speak to her father and only heard from her mother periodically when her father was not in the house lu hao was the black sheep of the family a film student and icetoeskimos salesman who had emotionally corrupted and manipulated his father to invest in his film project lu hao had eventually bled the family savings dry and driven them toward bankruptcy and loss of facethe greatest disgrace of all grace had known of the situationthrough her motherand had tried to use los angeles friends to circulate lu haos script in hollywood but to no avail her second more successful effort had been to win lu hao the contract with the berthold group all this had less to do with lu hao than it did her continuing feelings for his brother shed hoped that by trying so hard she might renew contact with him a hope that had yet to bear fruit bringing lu jians brother home could only help her cause the first step was to search lu haos apartment for his accounts documentsand now for his medicine as well now tonight with or without the man dulwich said would be joining her grace was not waiting for anyone pm changning district shanghai the man following her was a pro grace had changed into tight jeans and spike heels in a lobby restroom and then left by a side door eschewing the main entrance to the mw building home of the berthold group she might have missed him completely had she not picked up a second whiff of him but there it was the same distinctive scenta masculine musk part pine part perspirationshed first noticed while at an atm the stop used to scan the sidewalk she now knew he was back therehed passed close by her for a second time the act alone showed nerve and confidence while she reeled over how she might have missed sight of him in the first place she contemplated her next move she did not want to reveal her training only to appear as an average citizen at the same time she would have to lose him once and for all along with a column of hundreds of passengers crammed elbow to elbow she took the stairs down to the platform glass partitions served as barriers to prevent the crowds from pushing someone onto the tracks the hordes jockeyed for position a regular part of any day grace along with them flatpanel television monitors suspended from the ceiling counted down the timing of the train arrivals to the platform her skin prickled at the sight of a tan baseball cap she remembered from a window reflection back near the mw building she shivered had he made her earlier or only picked up on her at the atm was he that good or was she that rusty she spotted the cap again though she couldnt make out the face beneath it her nerves on edge she moved down the line of the groups waiting to board standing among a group of women she withdrew a black scarf from her bag and pulled it over her hair then she donned a surgical mask of the kind worn by many citydwellers to protect against the shanghai smog the crowd surged toward the doors a squeal of brakes cried from down the dark shaft grace slipped out of the crowd and pressed her back against the escalators retaining wall the ball cap moved with the crowds it jostled for position as the train arrived it paused turned toward her could he have possibly spotted her transition into the disguise impatient passengers shoved past the hat it appeared the man in the cap wasnt going to board she turned and took the long way around the escalator intent on leaving the station on foot a quick glance back the tan cap was moving onto the train but the body language was wronga chinese and in that instant she realized the hat had been given away by the first man wearing it he was very very good she caught him hatless in profile at the base of the escalators he fit the description shed been given by david dulwich relief flooded through her losing the ball cap was a nice touch she said from behind the man spun around he studied her and smiled a kind smile he was tall a welllivedin face tanned and lined under a sprinkling of gray in his short dark hair nice he said glancing once more at the train and the doors about to shut very nice grace chu she said through the mask they shook hands john knox the scarf and mask i didnt see that one coming next time she said you should pay more attention pm pudong district shanghai three men in coveralls carrying toolboxes approached the receptionist desk in the spacious lobby of building in the kingland riverside luxury residence the lobby receptionist was a roundfaced girl of twenty wearing a crisp navy blue suit and a plastic tag that bore the name shirley a word she could not pronounce the first of the men spoke shanghainese chu youya home theater installation the receptionist doublechecked her logs so sorry i show no such appointment for ms chu then you will please tell chu youya why we left little flower when she asks tonight about home theater installation good luck with finding a new job he signaled the other two that is it he circled his index finger the three turned for the street wait the receptionist called i will make an exception with the lead mans back to her the young receptionist missed the wry smile that crept across his lips before he turned to offer a shrug of indifference yes or no he seemed to be asking she picked up the phone and he feared the involvement of a higherup always a higherup and after that another you make this a committee i am leaving he stated calling across the lobby i have not got all day your decision little flower reluctantly she hung up the phone five minutes later the lead man deadbolted the door to graces apartment it did not escape them that luxury apartments such as this were often bugged by the government that they were bugging an already bugged apartment was the source of great amusement they went about their business expertly one handled the video while the other installed the audio the team leader chose the placements five microphones three prying eyes a pressure sensor beneath the carpet at the front door capable of turning the devices on and off in order to conserve battery life the lead man used his mobile phone to log in to a secure website moments later he was looking at a miniaturized color image of himself staring at the phone on the way out through the lobby his men avoided looking at the receptionist as ordered the fewer recognizable faces the better the leader raised his arm all is well little flower hopefully we not see you again your card she called out having overlooked this requirement earlier she needed a record of exactly who had visited the lead man hesitated then returned to the desk and handed her a business card he could sense her palpable relief as she read the card from a best buy in the changning district a card hed received from a show floor salesman on an earlier visit on his way out to the parked van he lit a cigarette and dialed from his mobile phone its done he said record everything a mans voice said on the other end of the call feng qi lowered his voice as he stood at the entrance to xiangyang park wiry welldressed and carefully manicured he had not yet seen the chu woman leave the mw building as the chief of security for yang construction he was the man responsible for tracking the berthold groups new arrival in the finance department the division in which the recently departed lu hao had worked feng qi was deeply concerned by the womans long absence and could only hope she was working late on her first night on the job he continued into the phone i want full transcripts and video delivered by email each night before midnight you will have it transcripts cost extra that is to be negotiated feng said he got no argument and ended the call in shanghai everything was negotiable pm zhabei district shanghai as knox and grace rode the metro toward lu haos apartment building knox reviewed for her his search of danners apartment grace told him of lu haos apparent need for medication which knox took as progress the kidnappers might be forced to return for the medication providing them an opportunity to identify one or more together they entered a corner tea shop with a view of lu haos apartment building and knox bought grace a green tea the intel on the medication he said is it from a trustworthy source she blushed what is it he asked lu hao she answered is the second son in a family close to my own i recommended him for the consulting job at berthold this information about his medicationit comes from my mother unfortunately i do believe it is reliable your mother is alive dead i am sorry sarge hosed us knox said irritated excuse me mr dulwich this op is personal for me too clete danner the other hostage is a close friend of mine hes my younger brothers godfatherhis caretaker in the event anything should happen to me the news clearly surprised her our personal relationships with the hostages ensure that we will make our best effort at recovery and if we are caught by police there is an explanation for our involvement yes convenient for rutherford risk very i assure you mr knox i will not allow this to interfere with the execution of my duties she sounded like she was reading it from a manual im not worried about you knox said the point is if the stuff hits the fan rutherford risk may not exactly have our backs i cannot believe that she said good lets hope im wrong she hesitated there is one thing more the skin around her eyes tightened i received a message from lu hao on the seventeenth of september a voice mail to be precise by all means lets be precise he nearly said who was this robot he sounded panicked he said he had seen something that he was not sure where to turn now she pleaded with knox the thing is lu hao has an active imagination and is always looking for others to take care of problems he started i was not going to get any more involved than i already was so typical lu hao high drama i was exceptionally busy at the time a job for rutherford risk i never returned the call he said dont beat yourself up over it though he could see she was knox changed the subject detailing his search of danners apartment with mention of the missing laptop and gps you think the police were there first she asked a waiguoren according to the security guy im thinking its a guy i know at the us consulate makes sense for him to chase something like this i cant ask him outright but i can nibble around the edges nipple nibble small bites ah no blush from her no embarrassment he noted and us mr knox our cover professional or something more intimate meet your new client he said i operate an importexport company for real you just became my chinese tax advisor and accountant he held out his hand and she stared at it he withdrew his hand importexport always struck me as a rung above rug merchant accountants are the most boring people i know knox countered which is why i joined the army she replied which explains why i didnt knox said i just supplied them with bottled water and hand lotion a mercenary i believe you call it not exactly more of an opportunist she had perfected the air of superiority step one to finding the hostages is lu haos records his accounting of the incentives she said knox snickered at the use of the euphemism the records may lead us to someone motivated to abduct him agreed i realize thats rutherford risks plan but dannymr dannertakes no prisoners that is if there was any lead up to this any planning any indication it was coming hell have left crumbs for us to follow i think dannys laptop is our most valuable player we must work together mr knox agreed so lus accounts are first i have my instructions and i have this timer running down in my head all things being equal id like to find danny alive we must not ignore the berthold groups chinese competitors there is bad blood these companies would gain a great deal from either stopping the incentives or intercepting the list of recipients a great deal indeed reason enough to kidnap and torture mr marquardt mentioned yang construction yang and the berthold group have a colorful past much competition i am unclear how to approach this but perhaps something will present itself yeah wellim still taking danny and his research he paused you were given an iphone yes secure communications we can text most certainly as well as voice despite her two years in california there were times she still sounded like a language lesson cd the next time we meet ill bring my financials he said as cover this is acceptable she said in shanghainese the first fortyeight hours are critical in a kidnapping no need to tell you that no he glanced at his tag heuer knockoff out of habit were well past that already sargedulwich to youis convinced dannys presence is a game changer yes that theyll kill him maybe both of them because hes american not if we kill them first she said he hesitated it didnt sound right coming from her mouth agreed he said and as to logistics how we move when we move i will handle he opened his mouth to challenge that when she said this is my city mr knox do not forget it pm shanghai allan marquardt waited behind his desk for the peoples armed police officer to say something instead the man seemed to be trying to make a point by looking out at the xuan tower as the work there continued through the night illuminated by massive floodlights the scaffolding crawled with antsthough marquardt knew it was far fewer ants than the day before a troubling development this meeting had been arranged abruptly interrupting marquardts saturday evening at the shanghai grand theater no great loss he still had calls to place to headquarters in boston and an engineering firm in san francisco it promised to be a long night but one did not turn down a meeting requested by the peoples armed police he thought of them as the gestapo of china marquardt was well familiar with the term iron hand and now looking at this man understood it more fully inspector shen deshi was bigger than most chinese by half his face unreadable eyes distant like a man incapable of feeling marquardt had no intention of putting the berthold group on his bad side he had trouble enough having been coached by brian primer over the phone on his way here marquardt braced himself for mention of the kidnapping to show no reaction to deny it reminded the police wanted such a situation no more than the berthold group if not provoked the officer would more than likely skirt the issue giving marquardt openings but not pressing him to take them failure to address the crime would be held against him at a later date but appreciated in the near term the complexities of the interwoven social and professional etiquette involving the chinese required him to rethink his replies the vaguer the better any problems lately asked the inspector there it was teed up marquardt needed to show respect while demonstrating his understanding of proper etiquette speaking adequate though americanaccented mandarin he said shi shang wu nan shi zhi pa you xin ren a chinese proverb that literally translated you must persevere to accomplish seemingly impossible tasks yi ke lao shu shi huai le yi guo zhou shen deshi tested him again please slowly the inspector repeated his proverb marquardt managed to translate it though searched for the true meaning the chinese language had many nuances the man spoke passable english one mouse dropping ruins the whole pot of rice porridge thankfully no mice around here marquardt said mice are everywhere we guard against them have you i am aware that there is some kind of documentary being filmed about your construction project marquardt felt his tension release by a degree had he assumed incorrectly the inspector knew about the kidnapping ah yes its a piece for our national public television in the states you must enjoy dogs biting at your feet we can tolerate it were used to it actually a free press is something you learn to tolerate in china we have no tolerance for unauthorized investigation marquardt said nothing he found it an interesting choice of words any problem with the film crew to be honest i have little to nothing to do with them you would need to speak with our director of communication i am speaking to you prick my dealings with the film crew have been positive nice enough people we screened the first episode but i havent seen anything since why do you ask visas for foreign press are quite specific the inspector said this crew has approval to make film of xuan tower as well as your offices he hit the arms of the armchair nowhere but this if theyve overstepped their bounds i wouldnt know if you want to deport them be my guest marquardt tried to calculate where all this was leading it was a saturday night an inspector with the peoples armed police was in his office all this because of a visa violation it didnt add up we are only the subject of the film this crew does not work for us has no affiliation with us is there something i should know i believe you must be aware two of the cameramen have connections with world life the environmental group certainly not extremists militants shen deshi said if they do not work for you then i trust that i can expect your cooperation in this matter iahfirst detective inspector it must be understood that neither i nor anyone in this company has any knowledge of nor control over the visa status or operations of this freelance film crew marquardt was tempted to call in their chief counsel i must account for each member of the film crew shen deshi said with all respect sir as i was saying and it must be now tonight marquardt felt his temper flare listen here tonight isout of the question he thoughtunlikely he said our director of communication will be in by ten oclock monday morning this is unacceptable the inspector said i repeat the berthold group has no professional affiliation or business relationship with the filmmakers beyond an agreement to grant them access to our offices and construction site you will please make contact with your communication direction tonight shen deshi said misspeaking marquardt wasnt about to correct him i wish to speak with the entire crew at once please he added as an afterthought prick on a stick barely able to control himself marquardt eked out monday morning at ten oclock shen deshi drew himself out of the chair heavily he reached into his pocket withdrew a leather wallet and carefully passed his business card to marquardt both hands extended marquardt returned his card in similar fashion if you are able to help me in this matter inspector shen deshi said gravely your present situation will continue to be overlooked at least for the time being marquardt swallowed dryly your present situation the kidnapping we believe one of the cameramen is unaccounted for shen deshi said a member of the american press had gone missing was this man hinting at his knowledge of the kidnapping or could there have been anothera secondabduction a journalist given what he now knew marquardt realized the man was on orders from the highest level of his government the chinese would want to get in front of the event before they lost face in the international community their unforgiving stance on foreign journalists was well documented not a pretty track record christ there must be heads rolling marquardts next thought was whether he could leverage this to his advantage his hand felt small in the other mans as they said their goodbyes but it was the determined hardened look in his visitors eyes that stayed with marquardt this man will stop at nothing sunday september days until the ransom pm zhabei district shanghai the realtor will meet us in thirty minutes grace said returning her iphone to her purse i love shanghai knox said you make a call on sunday afternoon no less and you get a showing two hours later entrepreneurship at its best in the us weve become too complacent too expectant of the good life here everyone still earns it his one accomplishment of the day had been walking the crime scene the backstreet warren from where danner and lu hao had been abducted lu hao had ridden into an ambush though why hed turned into the narrowlane neighborhood in the first place remained unexplained you heard me yes thirty minutes yep you look appropriately slutty i must say i on the other hand could use a quick makeover watch your mouth john knox i mean it as a compliment its part of the plan right grace was looking past him across the street i spot two possible policemen she said the one working the trinket cart and the big guy inside the restaurant over there yes i make the one with the cart as psb you certainly police of some kind yes we have many such bureaus and ministries here in china the other im not so sure about private security i think she said would other foreign companies have an interest in lu hao of course they would so maybe thats it i do not know she said still sounding stiff he was considering nicknaming her rosetta stone the realtor said she would meet us out front you should hang all over me you know like were shopping for a place toyou know to carry out our torrid affair not a problem she said seriously is it that easy for you he couldnt imagine this woman acting sexy or slutty he couldnt wait think of it this way when i am not serious i will let you know together they found a shop and knox bought some dress pants and a pressed shirt he changed and added his worn clothes to hers in the bag she carried one thing im confused about he said studying himself in the shops fulllength mirror after all that education why join the army instead of returning here and making serious money and then why hong kong it is complicated she said we make the complication it doesnt make us you may be good at whatever it is you do mr knox but you are not much of a philosopher he narrowed his eyes have i offended you she asked you would have to work harder than that he said lu hao has made much trouble for his family bad financial dealings i extended the offer of employment to him in hope of assisting his situationhis familys situation the berthold group was paying him extremely well now he is in trouble which reflects badly on you knox said she said nothing for several strides as i said it is complicated minutes later they were on the sidewalk in front of lus apartment building a young energetic chinese woman approached them she was in her midtwenties displaying unbridled enthusiasm and a lot of leg beneath a miniskirt they introduced themselves she twohanded them both her business card spacereal estate for tomorrow the apartment buildings lobby was clean and brightly lit all latest qualities the agent said her english clipped and at times broken the highspeed internet the telephone and the highly technical security every residence have hot water and warming and colding of the environment they rode as a group to the fifth floor in the buildings only elevator the name of the vacant apartment being offered was labeled in mandarin beside the door five fawns knox crossed the small living room and looked out the window to inspect the view first he saw the man in the restaurant window then a complication the trinket cart was heading toward the apartment building wondering if theyd been made knox considered aborting instead he hoped to speed things up and get out of here grace surprised him with a squeal from the bedroom lover she called out you must come here this instant knox entered the apartments bedroom a space barely wide enough for the double bed grace was bouncing on her knees on the mattress like a fiveyearold so soft you must try this she said patting the mattress knox waited for the agents attention to return to grace and he subtly tapped his watch graces head went up and down as she bounced shed caught his cue what do you think she asked you like it its the view im concerned about my little rose we talked about this street being too noisy too busy grace threw herself back onto the bed drew her knees up into her chest and hummed her satisfaction always so practical she said to knox as she sat up very well you grace said to the agent will please negotiate on our behalf street noise is too much requires fifteen percent deduction the real estate woman said i am quite certain price is firm grace laughed derisively there wasnt a firm price in all of china must i remind you you represent both the landlord and our interests yes the agent said of course grace patted the mattress again knox did not sit the landlord is to install a mirror on the ceiling grace said bedroom lights must be on dimmers she reached over and took knox by the hand come on lover please you must try knox shot her a look the agent pulled out a small notebook and took notes flatpanel television grace said one hundred centimeters reading lamps on both sides of the bed no compact fluorescent makes your skin look yellow disgusting the agent continued writing not that there is to be much reading grace said mooning at knox hmm knox grinned oh you he said pushing her shoulder so hard she fell back onto the mattress ah you want to play later knox said in a suggestive tone grace faced the agent landlord is to pay utility of course she said lover will pay for television cable channels knox took graces hand as she reached over for him grace glanced down at the floor demurely you will excuse my demands cousin she said in shanghainese but this man and his opinion of memy time with him all very important of course knox played it as if not understanding a word now i will leave you two grace said to review the mechanicals and discuss numbers yes grace asked rhetorically yes dont be long knox pressed cannot bear to be without you grace said popping up off the bed she swished past the agent your phone knox said making a point of handing her both the purse and bag containing their clothes ill text you when its time to leave the agent waved knox toward the kitchen i believe you must be most impressed with features of the kitchen dining not really cousin grace called back on her way out the door it is not like we will be doing much cooking minutes later grace arrived to the door marked seven swans having passed seven lakes and seven gorges on her way from the elevator she drew in a deep breath and knocked seven was a neutral number but she took it as an ominous sign she was greeted by a gangly young man in his early twenties his tshirt showed grease stains his right index finger a smokers smudge where is he grace asked angrily in shanghainese she barged past the surprised young man quickly taking in the three other boys reclining in front of a flatpanel television takeout wrappers pizza boxes and red bull cans littered the low coffee table tell me where he is she shouted not liking the look of lus living room clearly it served as a dormitory housing the other men as well the space was crowded with bamboo mats pillows blankets and ikea furniture singling out lu haos belongings from the mess would be next to impossible without a great deal of time not to mention privacy she continued on to a closed door and threw it open hiding in here she called out better this room was neater a single futon occupied the corner alongside which were a low bedside table and a crane lamp an ikea desk part of a matched set with the dressers in the living room a smaller flatpanel television with a game box a dvd player and a cable box lu haos room she thought a bamboo rod hung from wires screwed into the ceiling holding laundered pants shirts and two sport coats on plastic hangers she pulled open the armoire to find it stacked with suitcases and packaging for all the electronics a digital picture frame on the desk stopped her a photo of lu jian came and went in the frames slide show confirming her suspicion her chest cramped lu jian looked somewhat older than she remembered him but even more handsome if that were possible the same warm eyes for a moment she couldnt breathe she sensed a presence behind her without turning she asked where is he we havent seen him for a couple of days a roommate informed her she wheeled and moved toward him another girl how should i know hes a big boy he doesnt need me looking after him maybe you should check his family home its chongming island yes i know do you think i do not know lu hao you child the boy did not appreciate the admonishment some are saying the triad got him but if one of the triads she thought then why had the apartment not been tossed killed she made herself sound shocked he didnt respond kidnapped she said letting emotion enter her voice you know rumors tell me truthfully have others been here asking questions do not lie to me i swear no one she sniffled please i need a minute alone he seemed eager to leave her she saw him out of the room and then closed the door behind him quickly she entered the bathroom adjoining lus bedroom pulled this door closed as well and started rummaging through everything in sight from inside the galley kitchen knox had a clear view of the wallmounted video display showing the apartment buildings secure entrance he kept one eye on it as he feigned interest in the pantry shelving and the cabinet water heater the agent stood alongside studying him reciting the benefits five people had left the building in the past few minutes no one had entered but when a heavyset male appeared in the security display grabbing the closing front door knox took note of the black leather jacket the man whod been watching the apartment from across the street on camera his features were sharper and bolder than most chinese he looked bigger as well ive forgotten if you told us knox said addressing the agent how do i reach the buildings manager if i need him there is direct dial on the stateofart security installment entrance beside the entrance he lives in the building of course on the lower level do i use the east or west stairs to reach him she looked a little put off by the question there was no figuring westerners west the manager would have the security camera system in his room if a cop or agent the man whod just entered would check the videos first trying to determine where he and grace had headed it gave them a few minutes but not many he texted grace abort he had to separate himself from the real estate agent get grace clear of the building then if possible he would tend to business grace cursed her mother under her breath having found no prescription medication among lus toiletries back in his bedroom she searched his desk then the rest of his room methodically but hastily pulling out drawers crawling beneath the desk checking for a hidden usb drive or external disk drive any conceivable place he might have stored the desired documentation of his bribery she patted down all his clothing checked inside the toes of his shoes a tennis racket cover two empty backpacks the futon mattress and frame her iphone vibrated abort she cursed aloud and then started snapping photographs of the room including the empty desktop never mind the roommates claim it appeared the room must have been searched the most important items taken the digital frame switched photographs lu hao on a lovingly restored motorcycle and sidecar this transitioned into marlon brando also on a motorcycle then steve mcqueen in the great escape followed by harrison ford and shia labeouf in indiana jonesalso a sidecar and bike and finally the shanghai skyline before revealing a new picture of lu jian grace put her hand to her mouth as she took in the photograph this time lu jian was smiling widely his arm around another woman she fled the bedroom quickly the kid had returned to his place on the couch where is lu haos laptop she asked he had an address i need the boy shrugged was it not here the day he disappeared another shrug has someone been here before me she asked someone asking questions looking around who are you the boy asked she marched over to him you know what they say about a woman scorned the boy appeared properly terrified thats me you do not want to make me any more angry than i already am sowho was here before me i told you no one i swear it a woman she said playing her role to the limit no i promise what did she look like what is her name i tell you there has been no woman no man no one liar you tell lu hao to call lingcha she said making up a name the moment he steps through that door you understand the boy nodded by the gods ill have your balls in a vise if you forget she marched to the door turned and glared at the other boysthey all looked both terrified and relieved that she wasnt haranguing them she let herself out knox stepped aside allowing the agent to enter the elevator first i would like to take the stairs he said i will meet you in the lobby the agent stepped toward the control panel to stop the car but too late the doors slid shut he assumed the mongolianfor that was how hed pigeonholed him northern chinese or mongolianwould use the west staircase because according to the agent the west staircase was closest to the superintendents residence in the event of an abort grace would take the west staircasefarthest from the buildings main entrance knox texted take east stairs but moved quickly to intercept her in the event it was too late he reached the stairs and put his ear to the door faint footfallsapproaching him he slipped inside steel and concrete stairs in a concrete shaft sounds from above and below above being grace below the mongolian he caught grace as she rounded the upper landing hand signaling for her to leave the stairwell the ascending footsteps grew louder and quicker grace paused heard the approach and left through the door the shoulder of a black leather jacket appeared knox stepped away from the railing drawing in a deep breath to charge his system and purge the adrenaline knoxs sere training had inspired in him an interest in and study of handtohand combat techniques chinese soldiers and shanghai police were trained in sanshou a barefist closequarters fighting technique russians were taught sambo a martial arts style of fighting that combined hardfisted blows and wrestling techniques within the first few blows knox would know where his opponent was frominformation that might come in handy later knox flew off the landing catching the mongolian midstride and plastering him to the wall the man maintained his balance and postured a wrestling stance sambo so not chinese and therefore unlikely he was police a game changer knox could do more than push and shove his mind raced russian mongolian north chinese a foreign agent or private security good either way as he could fight the man without fear he was assaulting a chinese officer he pivoted and kicked the mans chest followed with an openfisted chop aimed for the mans throat but the man countered with an effective forearm block and used knoxs forward momentum against him he ducked under knoxs arm and headbutted knoxs ribs the wind knocked out of him knox teetered the man stepped in for a headlockagain a wrestling move knox kneed him in the side and drove his elbow into the mans face a bone cracked the mans jaw looked like a jackolantern that had been dropped he cursednot chinese not russian the man ran off a string of expletives an agglutinative language mongolian knox had been to ulan bator only once in a matter of seconds the fight was over knox pinning the man pressing a knee to his groin while holding his right arm twisted to within a quarter turn of tearing his rotator cuff his opponent remained conscious but in a crippling amount of pain knox removed a switchblade a wallet and a cell phone from the mans pockets he would overnight the phone or its sim card to rutherford for analysis he considered working the man for information but the guy didnt look the conversational type and knox was pressed for time he gave the arm a sharp twistlike taking a leg off a cooked turkey but this was a big bird and its cry convincing grace waited for him in the back room of bliss a bar on jinxian road decorated in s retro the cigarette smoke was thick the recorded jazz smooth and the waitresses very young and pretty the sign listed twentytwo on the occupancy permit maybe it was a maximum age limit knox thought there were five others scattered around at tables eating dessert or enjoying a drink no one over twenty next time she told knox as he sat down across from her please let me pick the place its quiet he said i cannot breathe if you jump the wall out the back door youre in a lilong he said explaining his choice a lane neighborhood he ordered a beer when a clear drink arrived for her vodka rocks he was guessing so whatd we find he asked you are favoring your right side im fine he said tell me about the apartment she passed him her iphone on which shed been reviewing the photographs shed taken in lus room in return he passed her the mongolians wallet and produced the sim card from the mans phone hes carrying a national id so maybe not mongolian but he looked mongolian i found no medication she said troubling no toothbrush no laptop or charger no mobile or charger no usb or storage device for files no accounts no files nothing knox looked up from the photos on the phone the kidnappers beat us there the roommate says otherwise how about clothing nothing to say one way or the other my mother was obviously mistaken mothers are never mistaken he said not if you ask them he had hoped for a smile perhaps lu hao keeps his medication with him could be but why take your laptop on a delivery run she said in china a laptop is a sign of prosperity people carry them like handbags she pointed across the bar to two young chinese at their laptops yeah he said i didnt say it meant anything your voice did know me that well do you she worked the vodka well enough she had the mongolians wallet open and was pulling out cards a transportation card a chinese resident identity card if a forgery she said it is a very good one he sounded mongolian knox said looked it too but maybe hes chinese possible we get our share across the border knox had never thought of people wanting to get into china before he was trained in close quarters combat sambo you know sambo yes of course waiguoren he said in mandarin foreigner it made knox think back to the guard at danners apartment building mentioning a foreigner the beer was half gone knox ordered them both another drink she didnt object he liked that im going to overnight the sim card to dulwich but first tonight ill hope for an incoming call or maybe we should call some of its recently called numbers patience my contact at the us consulate might run the national registration card for me hes a good man and if hes who took danners laptop he might be willing to share what about lu haos motorcycle she asked what about it mr danner and lu hao were both on motorcycles when they were taken correct correct so what happened to the motorcycles where did they end up danners missing garmin gps knox was thinking youre brilliant she averted her eyes to the tabletop and reached out for the second drink as it arrived chinese had trouble taking compliments not him since the police do not yet officially recognize the kidnapping she said perhaps neither motorcycle has been processed as evidence knox said brightly lady grace you should drink more often excuse me another compliment accepted progress he hoisted his beer and they clinked glasses a waitress passed knoxs eyes strayed to her he said do you know the term handicapable afraid not a person whos challenged physically or mentally but the challenge is viewed more as opportunity than limitation that is nice that is my brother he said my business partner the beer was wrestling with his tongue she sipped the vodka looking across the rim of the glass at him curiously just thought id get that out of the way he said upending the beer she stared across studying him i actually would like you to review our books he said then i will lu hao he tested whats the family connection not yet she said her lips opening to welcome the liquor monday september days until the ransom am luwan district shanghai the us consulate occupied a former private residence on four acres at a prestigious corner in the heart of what had once been the french concession having already copied and overnighted the sim card from the mongolians phone to rutherford risk in hong kong knox walked in the shade beneath the plane trees a warm breeze on his face to his right rose the twelvefoot wall topped with razor wire that encircled the consulate phone boothsized security booths stood at regular intervals manned by rigid uniformed officers of chinas ministry of state security there had to be dozens of security cameras trained on the area the chinese captured and identified every face that entered knox had originally met steve kozlowski through the mans wife liz a statuesque blonde who served as an immigration lawyer at the consulate her love of all things chinese had inevitably led her to knox whose reputation for procuring the best antiques and collectibles made him popular with the trailing spouses he and kozlowski discovered a shared love of american football and with the consulate receiving the us armed forces television feed knox had joined the ranks of corporate executives university professors and a few select government workers handpicked by kozlowski to watch live games with him and a few marines exactly twelve hours off the us air time over time hed developed a cautious friendship with kozlowski who by reputation got close to no one knox often wondered if the man were a spy knox passed through the thorough security check and was greeted by kozlowski tall and strikingly handsome he had a receding hairline disguised by a nearly shaved head dressed in a tailored dark gray suit a bright blue tie and with a consulate id lanyard around his neck kozlowski looked more like james bond than a bureaucrat responsible for the welfare of every american citizen in southern china walking toward the centuryold mansion converted thirty years earlier into consulate headquarters the two discussed the nfl season knox asked after liz they passed sumptuous gardens where chinese workers in blue coveralls toiled bent over in the shade they passed through an interior security desk knox was led into a large common area of pool secretaries and assistants that had once been a spacious sitting room kozlowski had the center office knox immediately spotted an open folder on the desk a gruesome color photograph of amanssevered right hand on kozlowskis desk he reminded himself he read the date upside down nine days earlier a ring with osu running at an angle he committed the design to memory believing it either oklahoma or oregon or ohio state a dead american correction he thoughta butchered american too far back to be danners thank god knox felt a rush of relief kozlowski must have seen him snooping he shut the file folder and gave knox an eyefuck so whats up kozlowski moved like a piece of claymation all sharp movements knox had never seen the man fully relax on the phone you said you had an offer i couldnt refuse kozlowski said which by the way is not terribly original you realize knox lifted his hands in mock defense the offers legit so talk said kozlowski leaning back in his chair im looking into exporting cjs knox said ms mms and misupers preworld war two bmw rs if it goes well maybe even some tuo la ji he referred to threewheel tractors common in the farms kozlowski who adored anything with two or three wheels and a motor leaned forward now yeah so so the baby boomers are moving away from the harleys and into some of the vintage bikes theres a market there the recession has pushed more boomers into early retirement but theyre far from broke and theyve got time on their hands i drive the chinese equivalent of a vespa kozlowski said youre trying to get me to upgrade liz is the shopper in our family not me heres what i think the chinese police must impound hundreds of bikes a week the bikes then sit there and gather dust now i could go around putting up posters in noodle shops with my phone number on tear tabs advertising ill buy junker s or i could talk to the boys at the impound about the timing of their next auction who says they have auctions you know otherwise you want to pay off a cop to walk them out of the door right now i know you knox i cannot will not be part of that knox didnt deny it all you do is make the introductions koz we look over the inventory if i return another day i return another day no dealing with you in the room i promise and for the introduction you get the pick of the litter i dont accept gifts righteous motherfucker knox thought at cost then ill think about it you know what youll think knox asked youll think you died and went to heaven when you see it buffed out and rebuilt the has a sidecar koz think of you and liz on a sunday afternoon humming down changle lu its a thing of beauty kozlowski admonished him with a look but it wasnt a full dismissal knoxs eyes wandered searching for what might be lu haos laptop he saw nothing that qualified so kozlowski said you arrive in hong kong from cambodia on a private jet leased to rutherford risk and reenter the country commercial the same day and youre telling me that kind of urgency is all about antique bikes gathering dust knox fought for composure surprised by the mans knowledge do i look urgent im flattered you looked me up neither knox nor dulwich had considered the ramifications of dulwich having flown on the rutherford jet into cambodia if kozlowski could uncover such records so could the chinese youve entered china six times in the past year and a half youre constantly on the road in south america europe and eastern europe a man busy building a company or a corporate spy the two men remained locked eye to eye wouldnt a guy like you knox said know if a guy like me was a spy you arent a us spy but there are all sort of spies these days knox what we see the most here is privatized industrial espionage its rampant i thought the shoe was on the other foot knox said consulate employee head of security not hardly kozlowski said listen im in the laotian jungle bidding on hammered bronze and swatting mosquitoes the size of sparrows and the lightbulb goes on in my head motorcycles picture this liz with a scarf tied on tightly the wind ruffling her shirt you with your sleeves rolled up a trip to suzhou on a warm late fall afternoon tell me that isnt perfect so you call rutherford risk for a ride ran into a friend in cambodia thats right david dulwich an old buddy of mine we both worked for a private contractor that served rumsfeld and george the second he was my paycheck for two years a good paycheck he pops up in ban lung sightseeing for all i know and offers me a ride as far as hong kong on the company g what would you have done he didnt dare lie about the details kozlowski could know anything you would have thought up a better story if youd had the time if it were a story believe me i could have done better knox waited tell me youll help me with gaining access to the impound like today for instance ill consider it but im warning you no business discussed in my presence and i want no gifts no deals ill be a boy scout promise uhhuh right knox lowered his voice one other favor kozlowskis eyes hardened i doubt it what if a friend of mine lost somethingsomething importantand i came up with a sim card some phone numbers that might help him find it i cant help i cant believe youd want the chinese looking for my friends lost package an american package thats bad for everyone kozlowskis eyes found the folder containing the severed hand he slid back his chair and stood thats it thats all the time i have they walked out together knox took his time letting kozlowski digest his rutherford risk connection and hoping they might get around to talking about danners missing laptop as knox had tried to instigate but it had to come from kozlowski not wanting to push any harder on the danner front he slipped kozlowski the national registration card carried by the mongolian run this past your boys and see if its legit kozlowski accepted the card and pocketed it dont overestimate our relationship knox i cant work miracles whos asking for miracles you go down that road you may need a miracle which road is that knox slowed to a stop sensing they were close to actual trust rutherford risk is forbidden from doing their kind of business here just as my office is has it occurred to you theyre using you it was a plane ride nothing more he hesitated but my friends laptop would help it just came out he wished he could have it back kozlowskis nostrils flared but he maintained his composure remember what i said vehicle impound knox reminded wearing his disappointment openly i heard you the first time am knox walked up huaihai middle road rather than take a bus or taxi he marveled at the traffic sorting itself out the birdsong in the middle of such a large urban landscape and the beauty of its women he stopped on a wideopen plaza in front of a bank took a look around and placed a call using the secure iphone dulwich answered before the second ring go ahead you got my package i did id have called if we had anything goddamn labs knox said were any body parts included with the ransom demand negative theres a video a proof of life why didnt i see it knox asked it arrived at berthold today we havent seen it either i need to see it were on it knox said i saw a photo of a hand just now i was in the us consulate it was not pretty none of our business that i know of but ill look into it a college ring osu got it turns out your jet comes back registered to rutherford risk llc its flight options so what so im made silence my bad you wouldnt happen to have someone keeping an eye on me more silence the phone made subtle sounds each time it switched carriers knox wondered why dulwich was taking so long to answer negative dulwich said a chinese or mongolian the size of a subzero same answer ive sent you a second package a sim card i could use the three ws on callerid coming and going well try no promises im getting a lot of that so see a doctor dulwich said youve met the girl piece of work i know its against your nature but trust her there are a lot of moving parts knox said were after his records we get that maybe it tells us who did this we get that then extraction keep it simple tic this is china that all ive gotta be someplace knox laughed the girl mentioned some competitors were going to look at them as well makes sense the mongolian or whoever he is is troubling knox said there was one guy trying to look undercover by pushing a trinket cart around a cop for sure but a mongolian is this thing international is he private muscle for one of the competitors well look at the sim card and tell you what we find out any more contact these things are fluid knox we know what were doing we need more to go on theres a surprise knox ended the call frustrated dulwich with all his resources and no one seemed to know anything sichuan citizen only a few blocks from the mw building served a mixed clientele of chinese and expats in a hip urban atmosphere that included canvas paddle fans and a longlegged hostess in a formfitting black silk pantsuit the aroma was a pleasing combination of hot peppers exotic spices and sesame oil mandarin mixed with english in a singsong of language interrupted by french and dutch knox whod entered by the back door sat down across from grace at a small table for two he laid down spreadsheets in front of her and anchored the corners with steaming black bowls of rice noodles eggplant and gingerglazed pork you were followed he said by a chinese late twenties scooter neatly dressed thats him yes impressed she knew of the tail knox said certainly not mongolian han she said naming the race of chinese that accounted for over ninety percent of the population you allowed him to follow you of course that way when i need to lose him he wont be ready for it i copied and mailed the sim he said speaking quietly one number was called six times in a row to the intellectual she said she answered his curious look our term for the leader he nodded yes the brains you see the chinese and americans arent so different you want to call the number she said a statement of course i do but once we make that connection he wont answer it again the phone will be tossed we lose any chance of any contact or tracking i think we keep that one in our back pocket agreed she said he was about to point out he didnt require her approval when she spoke interrupting his thought some interesting leads in lu haos receipts she said lowering her voice i found these in his apartment she passed a stack of receipts across the small table he studied the receipts sherpas he said whats so strange about that half the city orders from sherpas the sherpa catalog of restaurants participating in takeout service was in the kitchen drawer of every expat in shanghai you have not seen photographs of the ransom demand he remembered dulwich sitting across from him in ban lung the letter the ransom demand yes they were delivered by a sherpas delivery man to allan marquardt at the berthold group please notice the chop she said chinese used chops as their personal signatures small individualized stamps knox had one he examined the square red stamp at the bottom of the receipts theyre identical all nine receipts the same chop she said the same sherpas delivery man nice catch this cannot be coincidence impossible odds a friend betrayed lu knox said lu hao places orders with sherpas so he and a friend who works for them can hang out someone gets to the friend more likely the sherpas driver is a new friend thats more interesting knox said this guy befriends lu gathers enough information to pull off a kidnapping he worked it around in his head maybe they didnt think so much alike i like it we must interview the sherpa there were all sorts of takeaway food containers in lu haos apartment maybe this man has been back to the apartment since the kidnapping maybe he took lu haos laptop and medication knox now recalled dulwich saying something back in cambodia about the takeout food carton used as the ransom delivery he fought his fatigue notice the bigger chop on back of the same receipts she instructed he flipped over one of the receipts the chop carried the sherpas logo along with an address he inspected several more the same chop and address grace said there are a dozen sherpas dispatch offices throughout the city yet all these deliveries issued from the same office this driver is assigned there knox said she pursed her lips staring at knox it cannot be a waiguoren asking questions at a local sherpas dispatch she said therefore i must do this im going with you if this guy betrayed lu whos to say there arent others there working with him maybe a bunch of sherpas guys i can handle it ill keep my distance we will be connected by the iphones so i can listen in to whats going on grace said i must return to the office i will change clothesso i may leave the building undetected i do not wish to be seen trying to lose someone not at this early stage we must be careful agreed well meet in one hour she said outside city shop on shaanxi road take those with you he said pointing to his companys accounts id like you to look them over as you wish she said gathering the pages pm huangpu district shanghai graces change of clothes provided her a disguise so that as she left the mw building her surveillant missed her entirely to confirm her success she took her time reaching huaihai and shaanxi and then spent five minutes in the aisles of the subterranean city shop supermarket before ascending back to street level precisely on time knox pulled up on a motor scooter that had seen better days she accepted a scuffedup helmet from him and climbed on hiding within the helmets assured them of anonymity on the streets did you steal this she asked borrowed a friend of a friend he answered in shanghainese no worries the scooter belonged to fays bookkeeper who had rented it to him for what to him was a song and to her a fortune his to keep as long as he needed good friend she said you dont have to sound so surprised the traffic lanes were jammed but the bike lane moved well at a stoplight knox lifted his visor and turned toward her rehearse what youre going to say knox instructed it must not raise eyebrows eyebrows suspicion you believe me so incapable you went a little wild in lu haos apartment a mirror on the ceiling as only children we chinese are privileged pampered even we get what we want when we want it the agent expected such demands from this kind of girl a mistress to a waiguoren leave all things chinese to me please i know what i am doing the slowmoving river of vehicles flowed on ten minutes passed knox dropped her off call me now for the connection grace placed the call strung the white ear buds and microphone around her neckshe needed only its microphoneand headed down the sidewalk toward the cluster of motor scooters and electric bikes bearing orange sherpas crates strapped above the rear fenders if you do not hear me she said knox hearing her clearly through his ear buds nothing we can do about it she paused in front of an unmarked storefront with gray rainstreaked glass knox waited her out ni hao he heard grace say ni hao came the faint reply of a male voice through the ear buds speaking rapid shanghainese grace appealed to the manager to help her right a wrong she claimed to have shortchanged one of his drivers and did not want to get the man in trouble the phone offered enough clarity that knox could actually hear her proffering a receipt the manager thanked her and offered to accept the money on behalf of his driver grace apologized profusely citing her own inadequacy and stupidity while firmly insisting she pay the driver directly herself it is most unfortunate the manager said speaking more slowly afraid this is not possible lin qiu has had misfortune i am so sorry to say is he ill grace asked perhaps balancing his debts might cheer him up an accident i am so sorry to say badly injured many broken bones bad luck i see you will be kind enough to allow me to pass along your generosity the manager was no longer asking his patience had worn thin i would so like to apologize in person not possible and to think just yesterday i saw him riding on nanjing lu it reminded me of the debt you see yesterday the manager inquired knox was impressed that she attempted to nail down the date of the drivers injuries i am afraid that is impossible cousin the manager said the accident occurred thursday thursday she repeated exactly so late afternoon but i was so sure i think not he said here then she said the debt plus a little something for his troubles generous indeed you will see he receives it by my honor of course i have someone going that way now you neednt trouble yourself with it a moment longer grace exited the storefront along with the manager who leaned over to one of his riders and handed him what had to be the money knox rocked the scooter off its stand and rode past making sure grace had a chance to see him they met minutes later at the far corner she climbed onto the back of the bike saying the drivers wearing a green tam saw him headed west on xincun knox steered the bike around the block hurry she said well lose him seriously do you think ill lose him knox gunned the scooter forcing her to grab him around his waist he weaved through oncoming traffic into the westbound bike lane they caught up to the delivery man and followed the bright orange box strapped to his rear fender he collected a takeout order from an indian restaurant on dagu lu near the four seasons hotel and headed northeast his next stop was at a thai restauranta second pickup they rode behind him for another fifteen minutes his first delivery was made in huangpu district the second in changning from there the driver headed to putuo district and a crumbling lane neighborhood destined for the wrecking ball knox slowed allowing the rider a substantial lead were here he said over his shoulder the old lilongs lanes were narrow and cluttered with rusted bikes and scooters houses sagged bowing to gravity roofs were patched together with corrugated tin and blue drop cloths such neighborhoods existed as islands bound within the clusters of newly erected apartment towers the contrast startling knox and grace putted down the lane passing three intersections with even narrower sublanes running off to the right she tapped him on the shoulder knox braked and backed up using his feet i saw him turn left grace said a moment later knox too swung the bike left at the end of the sublane the delivery man was just pulling to a stop he left his scooter and entered a rundown stairwell reappearing briefly on the secondfloor balcony we wait knox said sneaking a look at his wristwatch grace absorbed every detail of their surroundingsthe hung laundry the decrepit scooters the timeworn faces in the open windows a minute later the delivery man reappeared he drove past them the sound of his engine growing distant knox and grace climbed the dingy stairs sounds of people coughing wetly behind closed doors mixed with a babys crying over a background drone of chinese soap opera at the top of the stairs a landing offered three doorways all hanging open for ventilation grace thrust her hand out to block himthis was for a chinese she stepped through the first door a womans weathered face looked back at grace a cigarette dangling from her lower lip she said nothing only stared grace bowed and left keeping knox back and entering the second doorway hello cousin she said loudly i trust you have just received the money you were due i desired to see you received it i am forlorn to see you so indisposed the man lay on a bamboo mat beneath an open window wearing only pale blue pajama bottoms his battered head on a folded rag he had facial bruises and poorly treated lacerations on his arms the purple and black marks on his bare chest bore the distinct shape of fists knox stepped in behind her he shut the door the man asked knox to reopen the door he spoke a dialect of mandarin not shanghainese knox noted knox also speaking mandarin said i prefer to leave it closed cousin his tones just right menacing and impressively chinese the room was spare a small tube television along the near wall we come for a simple reason grace said also in a chilling monotone she approached the man we are simple people with simple needs she hooked a threelegged cobbler stool with the toe of her shoe and dragged it alongside the man she sat down upon it every motion was confident and bold it is extremely important cousin she said that you do not lie to us the delivery mans eyes ticked between grace and knox i want no trouble he said reciting a proverb she said the greater your troubles the greater is your opportunity to show yourself a worthy person please she said lu hao is my cousin the mans already sickly face drained of nearly all color knox thought sometimes i love this work we know you visited him she glanced over her shoulder at knox as if she needed his assistance seven knox supplied at least seven times grace repeated seven is a neutral number is it not could be bad for you let me see your hand let me read your lifeline she took hold of the unwilling mans forearm he lacked the strength to stop her she held his hand in both of hers secured by the thumb in her left and his pinky finger in her right she lowered her voice to a whisper this line is bad she said tracing his palm with her red fingernail she drove the nail down intentionally hard he grimaced as tiny beads of sweat sprouted on his upper lip and forehead he tried to withdraw his hand but grace only tightened her grip spreading his fingers farther apart he grimaced you will please tell me where we can find lu hao she said calmly his eyes darted between grace and knox measuring them knox said i am not sure he heard you time is running short grace spread his fingers farther lu hao friend the man said sharply what kind of friend drops off a ransom demand grace asked the mans lips pursed gray we have you on security camera knox lied sherpa delivery to the berthold group his location grace said think clearly before you answer she maintained the outward pressure on his fingers i do not open food container before i deliver the man complained i pick up i deliver how am i supposed to know what lies inside grace snapped his finger breaking the knuckle he screamed the finger hung like a broken twig she seized his ring finger let us try again she said in an eerily calm voice where is lu hao please i beg you she threatened this finger the man spit out an address so fast it was indiscernible knox did not trust it a delivery man would not be given the hostages location he was just trying to stop grace from hurting him grace shot him an inquisitive look knox shook his head slowly now she said speak clearly so i can understand but know this you lie to meto usand your family will mourn your ignorance grace applied pressure to his finger the man carefully repeated the address in the xinjingzhen neighborhood you lie she said by the gods i speak the truth he repeated the address twice more grace held the mans hand secure she spoke english to knox it is not possible the ransom delivery man would know the location of the hostages the intellectual would keep these pieces very much apart agreed and xinjingzhen is at least thirty minutes from here hes trying to buy himself time to disappear he cannot disappear with me by his side holding his hand grace said also in english call me once you arrive at this place we will get to the truth if he should be testing our resolve i will test back knox did not like the idea of leaving her alone even with her so firmly in control find out who did this to him his beating she turned and looked into the mans terrified eyes holding fast to his fingers she spoke mandarin we do not take kindly to old news a rat who gnaws at a cats tail invites destruction what rat i tell the truth then tell me who did this to you you did not fall off your scooter but i did he proclaimed showing her the lacerations on his wrists and forearms who she repeated they ambushed me he groaned filthy waiguoren waiguoren like him she asked pointing at knox no a northerner cousin autonomous region perhaps north of that for all i know the filthy invaders mongolians grace said in english glancing over her shoulder at knox you gave the mongolians this same address you have given us she said in mandarin i dare not lie the man said it is true do not punish me he cried out to grace i did only what any man would do the hostages will be long gone knox said in english his disappointment obvious providing theyre still alive grace flushed behind anger i would like to break every last finger she said not letting go of the mans hand she said threateningly who took lu hao who are these people who took my cousin these people to whom you betrayed my cousin do i know one face from another i tell the waiguoren the same thing i am told to pick up and deliver a meal i pick it up i deliver it a face is a face nothing more you lie poorly knox said in perfect mandarin you knew this man lu hao you are no simple delivery man how did the northerners find you grace challenged no idea they appeared after delivery to the berthold group arrive on all sides out of nowhere grace shot knox a look the northerners had been watching the mw building i gave you the address the man said i was to report there this is all i know he cowered who are your partners knox asked you mean to lie to us again lu hao lu hao lu hao the man chanted dismayed he sounded as if he was calling for his help your partners grace hollered the man trembled with fear and passed out knox took the man by the chin and shook him who knows he could be out awhile if we leave here we will never see him again she said if we stay knox said who knows what trouble the neighbors will bring us he was pretty loud i should have gagged him all business remind me to stay on your good side he thought we have to leave now he said there is more he can tell us i can feel it these othersmongoliansare out in front of us he said i hate playing catch up she let go of the mans arm it bounced lifelessly against the bed the way you handled yourself she said you are part chinese you know she said thank you he said pm changning district shanghai knox took precautions to identify motorized surveillanceexecuting four consecutive right turns slowing down speeding up reversing directions grace kept a lookout as well do you have him she asked leaning her chin onto knoxs shoulder their helmets bumping black shirt shaved head yes i havent seen anyone with him knox shouted above the roar no doesnt that seem a little odd vehicular surveillance nearly always came in pairs or trios uncommon she said yes maybe their numbers are small about to get smaller can you drive one of these he asked of course hang on he felt her hold to him tightly he abruptly directed the scooter down the next lane he turned right at the first sublane and leaned over allowing grace to grab the scooters left handgrip knox then slipped off the seat and his shoes met the concrete he ran with the momentum to keep from falling the scooter wobbled but grace gained control she continued down the sublane knox hid in a doorway peering out breathing hard adrenaline running hot an older chinese couple passed arms hooked strolling down the lilongs main lane grace and the scooter disappeared to his right the idling bubble of a smallcc motorcycle engine grew louder closer knox ducked back into the doorway he reached for a bamboo broom as the scooter driver goosed the throttle to make the turn the man was big with sharp high cheekbones another mongolian knox lunged and drove the broom handle through the front wheel he slapped his hand over the riders and gunned the throttle the bike lifted over its front wheel the helmetless driver sailed over the handlebars and smashed down onto the concrete the bike slamming on top of him knox sprang kicking the bike out of the way he removed a russian makarov mm from the mans lower back knox took the mans mobile phone noting it was the same make and modelthe same coloras the mans hed attacked in lu haos apartment stairwell he pulled the man free drove his knee into his groin and watched the man recoil he found a resident identity card and some yuan in the front pocket of the mans jeans he kept it where is the hostage knox spoke slowly in mandarin where is lu hao the vacancy in the mans eyes told knox he either didnt understand mandarin or was ignorant of the information he struck him hard in the face lu hao the man spoke and this time there was no question not russian but mongolian who the fuck are you knox said in english fuck you the man returned in english the thwap of the mans skull smacking concrete was slightly sickening he was out cold knox checked the mans hands for callusesrighthanded he broke the mans right elbow across his knee he was interrupted by an old womans shouts of distress knox looked up his temper boiling looked right into a surveillance camera high on the buildings corner the scooter reappeared graces timing impeccable two mongolians he thought wondering what the hell private muscle for whom bertholds construction competitors foreign agents chinese cops the bike sped off knox wrapping his arms around graces tiny waist pm xinjingzhen neighborhood shanghai grace steered the scooter in a uturn across the wide empty road and returned having driven past the address supplied by the sherpa delivery man the scooters light found the light industrial compounds entrance blocked by a padlocked steel cable the interior roadbed was packed dirt litterstrewn and weedinfested it led to a group of six flatroofed concreteblock buildings that looked decades old but had been built just five years earlier the cable was there to stop cars and trucks grace slipped the scooter past a stanchion and into the compound building s north side looked out on a field of weeds and heaps of rusted junk she killed the engine and together she and knox listened looked and learned knox doublechecked the designation b he stacked some cinder blocks and climbed up to have a look through a gray glass window the interior space was dark but looked empty as grace parked the scooter knox found a length of rusty wire and hooked it through the doors gap and tripped open the locks tang they were inside a typical warehouse space with floortoceiling metal posts in the near corner were three plastic lawn chairs and some overturned cardboard boxes along with empty pizza boxes beer and soda cans grace stepped forward but knox blocked her advance he took photos using the iphones flash wads of discarded duct tape lay on the concrete floor by a wooden chair knox pointed to the chair and held up a single finger eager for quiet until theyd cleared the space he handmotioned grace to the left he circled around the right they checked nooks and corners clear she said softly here too knox said they returned to the area by the door where a balledup rag lay among the duct tape one chair knox said making his point again so they divided up she said yeah he said gutpunched they both understood the other possibility we work the evidence he said you take the food and those lawn chairs ill stay here on this sure she said sensing his anxiety over having possibly lost danner as she worked behind him knox tried to make sense of the scene to see people in the space instead of a space void of people he put lu hao in the chair bound by duct tapeconfirmed by sticky adhesive on the front legs at ankle height and on both arm rests he noted the stains and the sour smell suggesting the hostage had urinated soiling himself then he spotted a shallow plastic tub leaning against the walla makeshift bedpan he put the hostagetakers in the lawn chairs smoking and eating and killing time squatting he moved like a frog around the chair then stopped what he saw caused him to reassess not lu hao in the chair but danner alongside the leg of the chair were three straightline black smudges danners messagethree hostagetakers knox felt a spasm of release in his chest it wasnt lu he said it was danner in the chair three men covering him three yes that is what i have got she confirmed one a smoker another lefthanded and a vegetarian the third nervous and fidgety seriously she glared at him that chair she said pointing cigarette ash and butts center chair beer can on left side not the rightlefthanded the pizza there is no meat only vegetablesvegetarian last chair napkin shredded folded pieces rolled up and tied in small knots nervous disposition ill take your word he muttered he didnt need dna results he felt confident it had been danner in the chair he studied it more carefully using a pencil light paying special attention to where the mans hands had been taped it took a different angle to see the grooves pressed into the wood of the arm the number fortyfour mean anything to you knox asked he tried to get a photograph of it but failed grace looked over but didnt speak how about fortyone grace stepped closer gravely fortyfour she inquired knox pointed out the impressions in the armrests wood what is it he asked nothing grace four sounds likesideath danner or lu he wondered aloud danner could be wounded lu hao could have had a seizure only the one chair she said he pointed out the scuffmarks it was danner in this chair count on it he dug into the balledup duct tape peeling it apart he found a patch with whisker hairs and torn skin in the rough shape of lips the whiskers were faintly red under the pencil light danner knox whispered for certain wheres lu hao she gasped dying and dead no jumping to conclusions he cautioned weve got no blood no sign of trouble chances are these guys are pros and kept the hostages separated sop if they lose one to the cops or escape they still have the other nothing to worry about not yet you sound like you are trying to convince yourself not me she said do i he wondered guilty as charged a lefthanded vegetarian he left a partially eaten pizza slice behind ate off the left side of the slice you are trying to change the subject why would a simple delivery man know this address yet it is not the address for lu hao that does not make sense not to knox either he was surprised how quickly she jumped to the same place he did we cant get ahead of ourselves he said we have danner alive moved not too long before we got here judging by the smell of the place sweat and smoke hung in the air someone had been here in the past several hours we have the sherpas driver but he operated as an independent the mongolians hostagetakers survey the payee of the ransom demand we have the mongolians watching lu haos apartment that could fit or like us they could be wanting lu haos records but ive seen welldressed chinese watching the mw building from xiangyang park she said these were the men she used her disguise to be rid of yes maybe working with the mongolians maybe separate if we forget the sherpas guy that gives us the two groups to deal with the welldressed ones could be psb perhaps she said or independents or the kidnappers themselves and if the kidnappers then we have to explain the mongolians listen this was a lead we had to follow but the gold ring is still lus records gold ring the prize he said clarifying we know from the sherpas man that it was the mongolians who attacked him they hit him after he made the ransom drop at berthold so they were watching either berthold or the driver himself they arent the kidnappers they got this address ahead of us but by the time they got here the place was empty because no sign of a struggle she nodded so the sherpas driver must have been expected to call in a code or message once he was safely away from the berthold ransom drop he never got time to do so because the mongolians attacked him and the kidnappers packed up and moved at least danny yes it makes sense but if true it also means the intellectual made an amateurish mistake in giving the sherpas man the hostage location why would he do that maybe not a triad she said someone less experienced at kidnapping like a competitor of berthold knox said we come back around to needing lu haos accounts of the incentives he bristled at the use of the euphemism one step forward he muttered but who are they these mongolians perhaps we should inform the psb about this place grace said the psb is efficient they can lift fingerprints dna this evidence could help a great deal if the psb finds danner ahead of us knox reminded hes worse off than in the hands of the kidnappers lu too more than likely she looked ready to argue instead she exhaled and settled herself three days she said tuesday september days until the ransom am huangpu district shanghai you asked i show you everything feng qi said sitting uncomfortably in a dynastic armchair seven centuries old across from him occupying an ornately carved chair and looking like a feudal lord was yang cheng the expansive desktop was a museum piece exotic mahogany inlaid with ivory ebony and motherofpearl yang cheng was everything feng qi longed to be rich not that a security man could get rich off the salary he was paid but the stock market was another story along with the old toothless geezers in their pajamas feng stopped into the public trading rooms whenever possible buying and selling on rumor and instinct he was up eleven percent in the past two months he invested every dime he earned a good deal of it in yang construction lets see what youve got yang said he ran the dvd player and the fourquadrant screen came alive with security camera images of graces apartment it is interactive you may select any image at any time feng had no doubt what image his boss would select he had personally cued the dvd for the occupants entrance into the bedroom from the bathroom the woman was naked feng knew on which side his bread was buttered yang cheng replayed the full screen image several times oh my yang cheng said that puts some cayenne in the old stalk she is very clever this one feng said we see her entrance but have yet to spot her leaving the mw office building this while watching every exit carefully disguise yes it is the only explanation this tells us she is up to no good also that she spotted you you are an idiot or she was told by berthold about the kidnapping and to take no chances why her and no other employees yang asked feng looked stumped we must now consider that she is aware of tragic lus current situation i imagine berthold employees are not the happiest right now this gives me a good idea one thing of note she made no attempt to disguise herself for yesterdays lunch with a waiguoren he paused canadian american possibly this i find even more interesting no listen to mei told you she is up to no good her arrival is no coincidence her precautions she fears the government of coursethe ministry of state security what else that they are aware of the kidnapping and may be interested in any newcomers of course i knew it and the fact that she takes such precautions a windfall she acknowledges her importance to us leading us to the american she is engaged in the highest form of deception she is challenging us to take the bait or let it go thankfully our resources are many we can play both sides to our advantage he was excited to the point of arousal the two appeared to have reviewed financial statements lu haos accounts in public feng said no their waitress sweet lips woo said it was an expense account maybe you paid the waitress you are a smart man feng its what i do did you follow the foreigner the question put feng in a difficult position if he admitted his man had lost the foreigner he feng would be held responsible if he tried to pretend hed been shorthanded and had not followed he would be declared incompetent i deemed it more important to stay with the woman he said next time get your head out of your ass and wipe the shit out of your eyes but if anyone is to lead us to lu haos bookkeeping it is this woman i have it on good authority she has spoken directly with marquardt himself all important absolutely but i want the name and employment situation of the waiguoren your job is information bring me the information yes sir you must do better young man of course feng said having no idea how he might go about finding the man again i endeavor to serve your every need your needs as well theres a bonus in it for you feng thought there was no more sweetsounding word yang was known to hoard his profits but he could be generous with his mistresses and held much guanxi with his business partners yang stared out at the pudong skyline envious of the xuan tower it stuck in his side like a thorn feng said if i might make a suggestion yang cheng didnt take kindly to suggestions this was dangerous territory if you must perhaps if you were to invite the accountant chu youyathe one they call graceto this evenings festivities perhaps encourage her to bring a companion the waiguoren if we get lucky i am always lucky i was born lucky eighth day of eighth month feng suppressed a gasp it explained so much about yangs ability to amass such a fortune so relatively young double eights what more could any person ask its a good suggestion yang said a fine suggestion this is exactly why i pay you so well feng coughed keeping his sarcasm at bay yang passed the invitation along to an assistant by phone when he hung up he said to feng should she refuse my invitation perhaps her employer or the psb would be interested in her contact with this waiguoren perhaps she lacks the proper licensing to do such business i leave the details to you you are a brilliant and cunning strategist you will join me tonight the nineteenth hour place two of our men outside number twenty guangdong road at the ready to follow you will be inside with me fengs chest swelled with pride my pleasure this isnt about pleasure you fool keep your wits about you its about laying a trap its about outwitting the competition have you learned nothing my apologies go now leave the dvd with me he had freezeframed the naked image of grace striding across the bedroom if you get any more like this i want to see it of course feng suppressed a grin the bonus couldnt be far off eleven percent in two months he thought already doing the calculations am changning district grace had no intention of showing up for work her full attention on obtaining lu haos records of bribery the three days remaining until the ransom drop felt more like three hours she and knox had a few sketchy leads the existence of the mongolians their phone records and their resident identity cards they knew danner had been held alone a return to the sherpas driver had found him gone as theyd expected knox had called to nudge kozlowski once again about making a connection to the police motorcycle impound while dropping another leaden hint that he needed the contents of danners laptop so they waited the one thing grace was not particularly good at she was sipping a coffee at a bakerycafé when her phone rangnot the iphone but her private mobile she reached for it tentatively fearing another battle with her mother ms chu hello a woman definitely chinese she spoke english i am calling for yang construction at the request of yang cheng our president and ceo yes she said politely her chest suddenly tight yang cheng calling her on this number how did he even know about her mr yang invites you and a guest if you like to a cocktail reception at the glamour bar this evening seven pm business casual i amflattered grace said honored but perhaps anticipating her hesitancy the woman said mr yang like to welcome your return to shanghai my return yes this is chu youya yes exactly so theyd done their research can i put you down for a party of two thank you i apologize for such short notice entirely my fault i assure you no apology necessary we would be happy to send a car for you if no need so they wanted to know where she lived as well seven business casual as you wish see you tonight then ms katherine wu i so look forward to meeting you the woman said should i put you down for plusone yes i will bring a client with me thank you as grace hung up a throat cleared behind her she looked over her shoulder wondering how much selena ming allan marquardts assistant had overheard an awkward moment as neither spoke congratulations on the new apartment selena said a promise is a promise certain arrangements were made at the time of my hiring grace knew that only executives of vice president and above were provided such luxury housing she wondered how this might sit with the other chinese employees join me grace motioned to an empty chair i could not please selena sat it is nice the apartment very nice it took grace a moment to catch on would you like to see it sometime oh please i do not wish to trouble you no trouble in fact mr marquardt has meant to deliver the eoythe endofyearfinancials to me perhaps you would be so kind as to bring them along i can check with mr marquardt but if he clears it most certainly good thank you very much grace had hoped to avoid that hurdle but by putting the request to a third party it pressured marquardt to either deliver the accounts or explain to brian primer of rutherford risk why he would not the girls face brightened yes and thank you she said selena walked off practically floating grace reread her note about the cocktail party she needed to reach knox then a new dress am huangpu district the air was guncotton gray visibility less than five blocks commuters and pedestrians wore surgical masks against the smog kozlowski waited at the entrance to the police impound a door marked with a small plaque if this works kozlowski said i get my pick of the litter but at your cost no gifting agreed as to your not so subtle requests let me drive home this point tread lightly friend an inspector shen shook down berthold groups allan marquardt about a film crew and a missing cameraman knox said relaying what dulwich had told him in their daily wrapup conversation the night before he knew quid pro quo was his best shot at winning favorspossibly danners laptop if kozlowski had confiscated it which knox suspected kozlowski did not break his cool did not allow the slightest indication of any kind of knowledge to cross his face it was new territory for their friendship kozlowski was focused on knoxs barked knuckles he could easily have been informed of a westerner having assaulted a man in an apartment house stairwell or having dumped a motorcycle in a back lane of a lilong knox said given the restrictions our government faces concerning investigation inside chinaif you ever needed an errand boy shut up kozlowski said softly he took knox firmly by the arm i ran that registration card as you asked its legit issued in beijing knox had been convinced the card would turn out to be a forgery legit he said correct so hes either a chinese or hes very well connected kozlowski said as in dont go there im already there knox said who could get a legit registration card made for his hired muscle i dont even want to think about that kozlowski said i do no you dont kozlowski opened the precincts door for knox and they entered kozlowski showed the receptionist his us consulate identification tag she clearly recognized the name he showed them into the back where a chiselfaced man in his forties with greasy hands welcomed them superintendent first class gao following some small talk all in mandarin kozlowski presented knoxs wish to be included in any auctions prior to auction the superintendent said station officers get first pick of litter knox recognized an opening he said how many officers might there be in the office fifteen including myself we each may advance bid on one vehicle per auction perhaps one or two might be willing to serve as my proxy knox said i would be most pleased to present your card by way of introduction gao was no stranger to exploiting loopholes by working with knox he could pad his officers and his own pockets establish valuable guanxi with kozlowski and reduce his inventory they accepted the offer to tour the back lot a mud yard surrounded by a rusted cyclone fence hundreds of motorcycles motor scooters and electric bikes were chained together through their front wheels in ungainly lines some looked salvageable a few looked interesting all were rainscabbed and filthy it took knox less than a minute to spot a beautifully restored cj and sidecar that matched graces description of what shed seen in lu haos apartment five bikes farther down the line he identified a dark green honda street bike reminding him of the owners manual for a in danners desk drawer beautiful he said in mandarin approaching the he rattled off the bikes specifications and caught kozlowski staring at him not the bike a recent addition the superintendent said this one will not last will be reclaimed for certain this model and ones like it interest me greatly knox said the superintendent wandered the lines searching out other antiques knox meanwhile moved closer to danners honda an agitated kozlowski hands in his pockets didnt know what to do with himself it would be impolite to leave the captain alone knox told kozlowski who glared back at him knox reached danners bike its right side was badly scarred it had been dumped and had skidded a good distance reaching it he called out hen haovery goodso that his spending time with it could be explained the superintendent hoisted a thumbsup from across the yardhe could smell the yuan flowing knox observed a bracket attached to the handlebars its black plastic stamped garmin he checked over his shoulder the superintendent was busy searching for a similar prize kozlowski watched knox from a distance like a worried parent knox screened his opening of the motorcycle seats storage and he rummaged its contents a pair of foam earplugs leather gloves a cable lock a small plastic funnel bungee cords and a black fauxleather drawstring bag he lifted the bagthe weight and shape making sense for a gpsand he zipped it into one of the scottevests lower pockets the superintendent shouted as knox was zipping up the jacket do not make a mistake knoxs blood ran hot it was too late to return the gps he got the seat compartment closed believing hed been caught in the act that one may look pretty the superintendent said in blistering shanghainese but the older ones run far better knox shouted at the superintendent i do not doubt the young pretty girl has nothing on the older experienced woman the superintendent howled kozlowski bristled the superintendent indicated a beatup that lacked its sidecar knox moved in that direction passing what looked like a vintage bmw or a good russian copy of one they identified six bikes including lu haos the superintendent wrote down the plate numbers gao would talk to his men and be back in touch out on the street kozlowski said if youre lucky they put you in a sixbysixfoot cell and slowly starve you within a week youll say anything into the video camera they want you to say and it wont help you one bit to say it if youre unlucky you never get as far as the cell he liked me knox said you do not want to get into this im buying a couple motorcycles listen i know who lives in the apartment building in zhabei where the man was beatena man by the way who has not been seen since he should have visited a hospital he did not health care these days i also know which private security companies are contracted to which usbased corporations with offices here i know whose jet carried you into hong kong i will say this knox im very careful about running background checks on the people i drink beer with break bread with the people i admit into the consulate for monday night football extremely careful so either i missed somethingunlikelyor youre a sleeperalso unlikelyor youre into something you shouldnt be but id gotten to like you and that opinion is quickly changing he waited a moment for people to pass them on the sidewalk i help people i like but not the stupid ones knox considered entering full denial modehis kneejerk reaction to such lectures he caught himself and said i need the laptop or its contents i need a headsup if the heat joins the game and i need some slack from you kozlowski said you think really times against us here knox said im staying at the jin jiang room fivefortyseven i know that shit knox what do you think i do all day knox swallowed dryly he didnt like the thought that kozlowski was keeping tabs on him he wondered if kozlowski knew about the room at fays as well knox shook the mans hand and thanked him youve been a big help whatever you took out of there kozlowski said i wouldnt mind it landing on my doorstep in a basket with no note this street is twoway or its shut down kozlowski said understood knox looked up in time to spot the distinct shape of a face among the hundreds of chinese looking his way a man on a green motorcycle nearly the color of danners a mongolian am up the street a wideshouldered man loitered on his motorcycle by a cart that sold cong you binggreen onion pancake he watched the two caucasians leaving a nondescript entrance the mans parents had created his name melschoi by way of a cruel acronym marx engels lenin stalin and choibalsan hed taken heat for it in the schoolyard but by the time hed signed with the police in ulan bator no one murmured a critical word in his company melschoi had developed into an imposing force physically oversized mentally resilient and morally strong after six years on a police force fueled by corruption melschois attempt to stay clean proved his ruin in failing to bring down a cabal of officers he and six police loyal to himfour of whom were with him now in shanghaihad been betrayed two of his team including his younger brother had been abducted tortured and brutally killed he and his remaining four officers had been forced to run stowing away beneath a winter train bound for beijing an experience that accounted for the two missing fingers on melschois left hand disgrace had left him disfigured he and his men planned to return to ulan bator with enough money to move and protect their families before finishing what theyd begun now hed lost two of his men to injury at the hand of an ebpona foreigner hed witnessed this same ebpon visiting the sherpas driver now he was with cold eyesthe us consulates security chief as far as he was concerned it confirmed the ebpon was a spy a foreign agent this discovery irritated him because it meant that the man was handsoff his client would not tolerate an act against the us government melschoi understood the guidelines imposed but he understood the rules of a street fight better the foreigner would pay for cutting his team in half though the mans ability to take out two of his men did not go disrespected melschoi had long since proved himself to be a patient and careful adversary accidents happened he left the motorcycle and hailed a taxi prepared to switch cabs several times if necessary the ebpon would never know what hit him pm huangpu district the bund shanghai heading up guangdong road toward the huangpu river the buildings grew older and more imposing some of them dated back to the nineteenth century when this area was an enclave of foreign privilege and shanghai thrived on trade in tea silk and opium where once the flags of many countries flew from these rooftops now hung the distinctive scarlet chinese flag the wide avenue paralleling the huangpu fronted a river walk that held ten thousand or more chinese tourists on a given night weekend nights there were even more there was a european grandeur to the bund like grandplace in brussels or the champsélysées in paris an architectural nobility the air buzzed with an intoxicating mix of human excitement ships horns and the whine of vehicles arriving at a group of valets knox had a glimpse of the teeming quay and beyond it the neon and lcdcharged pudong skyline the pearl tower flashed pink and turquoise through the evening darkness tenstory screens on the sides of highrises played advertisements for coke and kfc tens of thousands of tourists jammed the elevated quay all jostling for a piece of the famous view grace waited on the steps pushed back against a handrail while watching guests being dropped off by their drivers mercedes lexus bmw the ubiquitous chauffeured blue buick minivan a symbol of the corporate expatriate life she looked ravishing in a short purple raw silk jacket over a black tea dress with a high neckline a string of turquoise and red coral complimented her long neck her hair not a strand out of place was pulled back into a bun stabbed into place by a length of tortoiseshell she leaned to kiss knox on the cheek ever the role player you will find unlike our american counterparts chinese women are always on time knox checked his watch five minutes late you looklovely he said and i would take this as a compliment if i heard conviction over surprise he took her arm his grip strong on her elbow and guided her up the marble steps grace resisted i would prefer a drink alone before we go up she seemed hyperaware that anything and everything said between them might be heard she angled her head across the street your wish he said escorting her through a break in traffic they rode the elevator to new heights a seventhfloor restaurant and bar that also overlooked the river they had a view across guangdong road and through the windows into the glamour bar where yang chengs party was already underway the bar itself was made of thick frosted slab glass the liquor bottles reflected off shiny shelves of black lacquer he ordered a beer and she a glass of champagne with no seats to be found they stood at a chesthigh drink counter so knox said before we go upstairs and into that grace said pointing toward the glamour bar where honestly we must play our roles to perfectioni wanted to know when you were going to tell me about what you are carrying in your coat pocket knox leaned away i felt it when you kissed me on the steps you dont smoke it is not a cigarette case it is too heavy and too big for a phone too light for a handgun too bulky for another kind of weapona knife for instance it is in your right pocketyou are righthanded so you obviously wanted it close obviously he swallowed dryly and looked for the beer a video camera she asked he glanced into the reflection off the glass admiring her small but beautiful fiercely put together into a showcase of fashion and femininity giving no hint of the physical power she no doubt contained from her army training her focus most of all her control lowering his voice he said my friends gps ayee she let slip it was your suggestion the impound grace snarled she clearly didnt want compliments or small talk i can follow its moving map but i dont know the city well enough to know if a waiguoren will stick out and as much as i dont care whos there to greet me i dont want to put danner at risk we cant afford mistakes not with only a couple days to go we know theyve moved at least once i dont want them moving again he passed it across to her there are seven saved locations its got to be lus payout route danner follows lu hao and marks each location where he leaves a bribe its better for us than his accounts we do not know what these locations are i know how danner is he said trust me this is the money trail grace said it could be nothing but his favorite restaurants or massage parlors then lets go get a bite and a rub and see what kind of tastes he has she turned on the gps and scrolled through the saved locations it is an interesting mix of neighborhoods she said im listening she looked across at him as if she considered this a rarity some are poor grace said others upscale both fit for kickbacks he said depending whos on the take the riverfront compound across in pudong she said luxury condominiums for chinese party officials businessmen you see she softened and then said we do not want to accuse such people we must leave this to others very powerful very connected such people i have no intention of accusing anyone i want to have a nice quiet sitdown with them all grace flashed her disapproval you want to involve accusations and lawyers knox asked we have two days i want lu haos accounts she countered he threw up his hands im open to ideas but this he said tapping the gps in her hands this is the closest thing we have to a lead this is not a good idea help me with the neighborhoods please danner bookmarked these locations i need to have a look grace switched off the device and slipped it into her purse give me that knox drew some looks you must trust me she said youre not working real hard to earn it give it back please or ill take it from you it is no good at night this kind of thing you must trust me you ask for my advice on shanghai this is my advice we must plan double egress for each location establish rendezvous we will meet early tomorrow morning at six am first light we will do this together early morning the traffic is not as bad this is a good time for us john knox he attempted to cool himself down with the beer he failed his attention remained on her purse and the gps it contained but his eyes did not he didnt want her playing defense to absent friends he said hoisting the bottle and waiting for her champagne glass pm the bund the glamour bars lavish art deco interior was a throwback to the heyday of shanghai in the s when commerce intrigue and opium conspired to form the most unique and magnificent city in all of asia knox and grace were checked against a guest list and then welcomed by a gorgeous twentysomething hostess the bar was a black granite island in a central room off which hung two sitting rooms and an elevated lounge that overlooked the huangpu river pudongs neontrimmed highrises flashed colorfully river tour boats trickedout in neon and more video screens slipped between coalladen barges it was times square times ten with broadway a quartermilewide black water river the bar crowd was a mixture of chinese and expatriates the asian women breathtaking the men overconfident the euro waitstaff circulated with trays carrying champagne sparkling mineral water and pineapple juice big band music fought against the din of voices knox choked on the cigarette smoke he caught grace appraising the other women you neednt worry he said theyre all eating your dust she looked down dust you look fine fine before knox could rectify the moment the two of them were interrupted by a young chuppya chinese upwardly mobile professionalbulging out of a lowcut bustier and wrapped in a dark gray jacket and skirt her chic eyeglasses reflected the glow of an ipad she carried with authority the woman introduced herself by her english name katherine wu and her position as yang chengs executive assistant grace introduced knox as a business client the hostess had greeted knox with an openly coquettish expression though it turned quickly churlish importexport was regarded as unglamorous and last century allow me to introduce you to our host she said as she led them through a choking crowd around the bar and up three small stairs to the view lounge the lounge consisted of clusters of wellheeled guests randomly grouped yang cheng stood at the top of the steps welcoming and chatting slightly balding and of an indistinguishable age yang wore a tailored suit italian leather shoes and a red tie his wideset eyes suggested a man overly pleased with himself knox identified the fit man in the cheap suit as the bodyguard or security man this man lingered a little too long on grace for a complete stranger there was something smarmy about the look he then took in knox like a full body scanner knox distilled this mans reaction and quickly analyzed it he knew grace he didnt want to forget knox then something strange happened as yang spotted grace he offered a smarmy look at his security man it was a locker room exchange one man to another a look knox knew well and had trouble processing for its content it went beyond shes hot to something more licentious it was in particular personal not simply suggestive knox was right on the edge of understanding it when he was jarred by introductions the meaning escaped him the provocative young assistant introduced them yang had the enviable ability and grace to make them both feel it was only the three of them in the room knox caught a tick to yangs eye and katherine wu gently took knox by the arm following an obvious script for now knox agreed to play his part please mr knox allow me to show you the view she eased knox away from grace and toward the windows grace and yang cheng descended into the bar area you have been to the glamour bar before many many times knox replied one of my two favorite views in all shanghai and the other she inquired he turned his gaze onto her why you of course ah she blushed involuntarily but alas views are only for looking youll please excuse me ms wu he said cordially wanting to keep track of grace ill be right back i just need a beer her grip tightened on his elbow she lifted her other hand and miraculously a waiter appeared like hed come through a trap door he took knoxs order his hostess said something but knox didnt hear hed lost sight of grace pm being led by yang cheng into the main bar grace couldnt help but see eyes following them yang demonstrated his knowledge of her reciting pieces of her cv thankfully he referred to her most recent employment as an independent accountant based in hong kong there was no reference or insinuation of any work being performed for rutherford risk the takeaway for her was that she was a person of interest to him this in turn made him more interesting to her was he calculating enough to have had lu hao kidnapped was her invitation to the party related to the kidnapping he continued greeting guests and shaking hands on the way to a table reserved for them she declined the offer of champagne as her head was already spinning my father he said began this business with a single handcart and a shovel yang construction has a fine reputation as the numberone construction company in all of shanghai all of china you flatter me i repeat only that which i have heard she said we are honored to do business in such a great and charitable nation we employ over twelve hundred in management positions and many thousands in the workplace all chinese no foreign blood other than a few consultants for appearances when he smiled his eyes became quiet for nearly twenty years now our chief competition is the berthold group your new employer chu youya their presence has grown from consultant to major player my father first did business with bg in nineteen eightytwo now look they are building the xuan tower foreign firm not chinese this is not right i make no secret of my wish to see xuan tower completed by a chinese firm such as ours i have just recently arrived in shanghai grace replied i am sorry to hear of your differences with the berthold group it is not your concern forgive me he paused and offered her a drink for a second time she declined i would like to come straight to the point chu youya he said i have the burden of many guests i must entertain so you will please forgive me of course grace said concentrating on keeping her face calm yang cheng would never begin the ransom negotiations himself but she prepared herself to look behind whatever his point was he lowered his voice the house of allan marquardt is destined to fail chu youya it is a foreign company after all no matter the lip service paid by our great country a foreign company will never be allowed to attain the position of a chinese company within her borders never you and i both understand that when berthold fails many people will be seeking employment accountantseven brilliant young accountantswill be like ants after the same sugar great challenges present great opportunities he continued as if quoting a proverb such an opportunity now awaits you chu youya you are chinese like me not foreign blood like them you come work for me now i will pay twentyfive percent more than allan marquardt i will offer better benefits and you will honor your family by working for a chinese company you do me a great honor yang cheng grace hung her head wondering if this was indeed the point of her invitation or was he seeking to explore the possibility of negotiation by erecting the pretense of an employment deal between them i am deeply humbled you will forgive me if i must take time to consider your generous offer time is sometimes a blessing sometimes a curse use yours well i am not the one in a hurry youon the other hand he paused tellingly she thought the implication had to be connected to the ransom situation but then became confused as he continued the xuan tower nears completion mark my words it will not bear the name of berthold group at the time of its ribbon ceremony it was never to be in defense of my current employer she said letting it hang there certainly dozens maybe hundreds of buildings in shanghai have been financed and built with foreign money whether in part or in whole so many western architects have made our skyline all the more interesting the french the germans the arabs shanghai is truly metropolitan of this there is no doubt americans too yes but xuan is to be the tallest building in world a point of great chinese pride chinese pride not american pride yes of course there will be no confusion on this point do not fool yourself allan marquardts reach will stop here in shanghai and before the xuan is open his face grew red the whiskey she doubted it perhaps hed had a promise from the government from the start lu haos kidnapping might be but a single mahjong tile pushed to send others falling financial conspiracy was an art form in asia practiced by allfrom the street sweeper to people like yang cheng he said chinese profits are reinvested foreign profits travel across the oceans and never return enough is enough will stop here in shanghai the berthold group had construction projects in cities all over china yang cheng had slipped up was there a bidding war underway for a shanghai project that yang cheng was determined to win was confident hed win if he knew about bertholds secret payments to inspectors and subcontractors he could instigate an investigation and immediately disqualify berthold from any future bids ensuring his own success lu haos offrecord books would play a critical link in any such attempt to paint berthold as corrupt please he said signaling a passing waitress he snatched a glass of champagne for her and lifted his glass she took a small sip i await your decision he said before the dismissal for the national holiday if you please hed named the same deadline as the ransom was she to make that connection was she supposed to acknowledge it will you be joining your family on chongming island for the holiday every muscle tensed his knowledge went well past her cv if time permits she said lying she had no intention of seeing her father family is everything a threat or a simple reminder of her chinese roots and where her loyalty belonged country ideology family she said reciting priorities established in her early schooling yang chengs eyes went beady as he forced a smile yes and of all these family pm knox took issue with a person wearing a bluetooth headset in public alone behind the wheel fine around the house maybe but it struck him as pretentious insular and ridiculous looking if god had intended for man to have a plastic horn protruding from one ear hed have put one there katherine wu kept touching her ear and going off into conversations that didnt include him she looked and sounded like a robot while her body sent much different signals knox forced a word in i understand the berthold group has encountered workforce slowdowns this week a stab in the dark but an educated one dulwich had told him as much problems with materials delivery some trucking issues she flushed i manage mr yangs schedule mr knox you overestimate my position i am afraid there was that word again he wished she would stop that oh i doubt that he said its all over shanghai is it and i am the last to hear so typical i wouldnt believe every rumor you hear i thought that was you a chinese womans accented voice from behind knox a voice he knew a voice hed heard in many incantations from joy to ecstasy amy xue a petite beauty wore a loosefitting raw silk offtheshoulder top and a pair of jeans that threatened her circulation her hair was done in an asymmetrical cut with bangs slanting high to low right to left she wore no visible makeup a gorgeous pair of black pearl earrings and a matching necklace her face was girlishagelesswith long narrow hooded eyes that had first won his attention three years earlier knox kissed her on both cheeks help he whispered they held arms tightly as he introduced her amy xue this is mr yangs assistant katherine wu she is showing me the view he faced ms wu amy is one of my original trading partners knox said and a close friend she has the finest pearls in all of shanghai but often too expensive americans always want cheap cheap cheap amy said like sound of bird sounds as if you two have been trading together for a long time katherine wu said intentionally impolite as i said old friends knox said having not taken his eyes off amy glad shed confirmed his occupation without prompting you may be old john knox but not me you come to my city not tell me in advance amy said how am i to hold best pearls for my best customer if you dont mind he said to wu taking amy by the elbow and leading her away katherine wu allowed them a fifteenfoot lead and then followed on a leash knox steered amy toward the bar and finally caught sight of yang and grace at a table in the far corner of the cocktail lounge to the right he felt an enormous sense of relief amy didnt miss much friend of yours my accountant ive always thought spreadsheet a dirty word not like that amy you know better than that i know my favorite customer when i see him i know you did not send email telling me you were coming it was a lastminute decision this trip tell that to your accountant he ordered drinks for them both a kir for her beer for him the smoking at the bar bothered her so they moved closer to a marble slab holding satay egg rolls pot stickers bao and fruit knox ate the pot stickers and satay amy stuck to the fruit he thought about danner what he was eating where he was sleeping he felt shitty about his own present surroundings in the lap of luxury the gps burned a hole in his coat pocket hed slipped it from graces purse as theyd boarded the elevator he hoped she wouldnt discover it missing before they separated for the night did you like last shipment she asked what he liked was the way she slipped the chocolatedipped strawberry between her lips and sucked on it we could use more of the stone boxes and the black pearls were getting squeezed on the cultureds by other online sites fewer of those we will give you what you want she said making him suffer through another strawberry more of the custom designs we cant compete on unstrungs its your beautiful designs that separate us you flatter me knox the bracelets are popular more bracelets black pearls more bracelets not a problem he considered asking amy what shed heard about the kidnapping rumor spread fast on the street but selfpreservation was about containment loyalties changed here as quickly as the weather amy would you help me with something kind of like translating he said thinking about the gps you speak better than most chinese your beauty is exceeded only by your exaggeration he said in mandarin then returning to english shanghai neighborhoods which are trickier than others for waiguoren these are business addresses for possible suppliers as safe as this city can seem i dont want to end up somewhere i dont belong suppliers i promise no pearls no jewelry you know this city well knox you do not need me shed teed one up for him to ask about lu hao and danner i hear the city has become more dangerous for a waiguoren in recent days is that so she said her voice as smooth as the surface of a fine pearl she offered no way for him to judge her knowledge knox spotted bruno the bar and restaurant manager and signaled him brunos size and comportment befit his name he had a wide serene face and a boyish smile all tucked into a sixfootone twohundredandeightypound body at knoxs request bruno led them into his back office and left them alone knox took out the gps and showed amy the bookmarked locations she worked through descriptions of some of the areas where a waiguoren would stick out not that there is any risk to you no physical risk this is shanghai knox memorized the map with her comments in mind he wondered if she had possibly not heard of the kidnapping she gave no indication otherwise he thought all of shanghai knew you saw this yes amy asked pointing to a tiny red dot the size of a pinhead alongside the character notation i might have missed that he said having no idea what it was it is a voice note she scrolled along the bookmarked route each location a voice note knox studied the device thinking voice notes friend in international pearl city try to sell me this same gps amy said garmin she said making it sound chinese she worked the device through some menus and knoxs breath caught as danners voicecalm and restrainedspoke he had trouble concentrating on the actual message second floor second door from the south corner husband and wife midfortiesout of shape no children knox wanted to replay it just to hear danners voice a note for each location he said rhetorically evidently okay then he accepted the device back and pocketed it a note for each location it might prove a shortcut to nearly the same information they sought from lus accounting of the bribes the precise location of each bribe recipient she said nothing more about it showed no outward sign of interest or curiosityas discreet as one could ask for here she said kissing him just off his lips and catching his hand as it came up do not wipe it off whos going to see us everyone already has if you do not want them asking the obvious questions then leave it she was testing him her way of asking him what this was about while saving herself face he searched her exquisite eyes what are the obvious questions xing xing zhi huo ke yi liao yuan she said a single spark can start a prairie fire shu dao hu sun san he returned an equally wellworn proverb when the tree falls the monkeys scatter he warned of fairweather friendship i am no monkey she said you must be careful john you never fail to surprise me this makes me warm for you its not what you think he said all waiguoren were considered spies first have you no idea what i am thinking about she placed his thigh between her legs and pressed letting him feel her heat she craned up and whispered maybe you can guess they kissed enjoy your accountant she said pulling away from him making a show of her muscular backside reentering the bar he was hyperaware of the dozen eyes that found himincluding graces he arrived at her table and addressed yang if you are seducing my date i will have to cry foul as the host of such a perfect partythe drinks the food the guestsyou outclass any man in attendance and play to an unfair advantage the older the ginger the hotter the spice yang answered he who pays the piper calls the tune he glanced over to grace only a fool would argue with such wisdom she said we were just wrapping up yang said he moved to draw graces chair back grace stood thanking him katherine wu appeared seemingly out of nowhere knox noted how well shed been trained and kept his mind partially on yangs security man wondering if that training spilled over to him wondering if he happened to know some mongolians i trust you will enjoy yourself yang said to grace the rest of the evening will pale by comparison to these few minutes in your company she said yang bowed ever so slightly together he and his assistant moved toward the bar had enough knox said you can leave any time you would like if i want permission ill ask he said she indicated her own chin and passed him a napkin from the table knox wiped off amys lipstick part of my cover you do not have to explain yourself to me she said sarcastically i wish to stay a while longer to see if i can get our host alone once more i worry for lu hao i do not doubt a man like this could be behind it did he offer to negotiate the ransom he asked aiming for specifics leave when you wish perhaps we make a small scene and i am left on my own men can be so predictable you could slap me he said happily she whispered six am he asked i dont forget so quickly grace said her eyes lingering a little too long on the smudge still clinging to the corner of his lips the corner of huaihai and maoming he said near the entrance to the metro station she cracked him across the cheek everyone nearby interrupted by the slap knox nursed it and moved away cutting through the crowd she had a hell of a right hand pm knox took repeated precautions to avoid being followed including arriving at the jin jiang hotel where he was officially registered he went through the motions of riding the elevator to his room both for the sake of his cover and to try to trap anyone behind him he might have missed once inside the room he stopped short at the sight of a brown padded envelope on his bed he felt through it before openingsomething hard slightly smaller than a paperback book he spent a minute giving the room a livedin look kept one eye on the package which was both stapled and taped shut finally he tore it open and slid out the contents revealing the smooth aluminum of an iomega portable hard drive he doublechecked the envelope no note kozlowski had to be before calling dulwich to deliver his daily briefing and inquire if the delivery of the hard drive was somehow his doing knox pulled out the gps and listened to danners seven voice notes used as a dictation device the notes were brief and cryptic unemotional and nearly without personality but knox held on to the sound of the mans voice replaying several of the messages just to hear him speak he suffered nostalgia a condition he thought hed been cured of permanently following his contract service with the military the last real friendships hed forged had been in kuwait now too many years ago to count he needed to listen to the last voice memo several times to decipher danners verbal shorthand late addition to route heavy duffel left behind choke point civi guard took off leaving two huns as gatekeepers hunsmongolians on lu haos payout route added late in the game knox mulled it over as he rode the elevator to the mezzanine and used his card key to enter the empty business office connected the hard drive by usb cable and studied the drives directory he tried search strings for lu bribes payoffs incentives berthold nothing the most recent word files were letters written to his wife peggy reading the letters stirred guilt and anger in knox he owed peggy a call something reassuring but vague he found the most recently opened excel files also of little use expense accounts nothing that pointed at lu maybe grace could find some files of significance but at first blush knox doubted lu haos books were anywhere on danners drive he disconnected the drive hit the street and bought a second external drive and had the teenage clerk copy it it took fortyfive minutes he tipped the kid a weeks salary he returned to his room and placed a call go dulwich said are you behind the package i found on my hotel bed negative what kind of package knox explained the package dulwich knew nothing of any hard drive but clearly wanted to get his hands on it i cant see kozlowski helping me out knox said too big a risk for him to take consider that he wants danner back as much as maybe more than any of us fyi i was about to call you dna is a match good work but listen an american gone missing this is on kozlowskis watch dont forget if you get danner back before the ransoms paid the kidnapping will never be officially recorded no black marks on anyones service record the government escapes a tricky one the party and kozlowski and the consulate too but i have no doubtzerothat hes connected me to you and rutherford so why not just overnight it to you directly there would be records of that you on the other hand just discovered something on your bed he probably paid off a chambermaid or doorman no legs now youre the one in position to do something with whatevers contained on there he knows that and if he found something on there it makes all the more sense because his hands are tied you become the sacrificial lamb you say hes made the connection to us he knows who we are knows were major players knows we specialize in kidnapping resolution and extraction if youre him who would you want on your side i suppose knox said and consider this that laptop was encrypted count on it so your consulate buddy broke the encryption that means hes got whatever youve got he might have even removed a few files before giving you a copy but who knows maybe its a matter of making sense of it maybe theres something on there but he needs a second set of eyes i can pass it on to grace knox said but with two days to go im not putting my nose into a computer screen understood is the date still firm knox said yes and knox could hear it in the mans voice the line remained open but dulwich wasnt speaking sarge a finger the open line sparked with static whose knox said knowing already look on the bright side dulwich said we know danny was alive as recently as yesterday and within city limits the finger had retained warmththe only explanation knox swallowed dryly which finger silence which finger knox repeated middle finger right hand ohshit the kidnappers had seized the opportunity to send a message within the message knoxs stomach turned no dna swab this time he tried for air ill kill these guys he said you and me both peggy no need to bother her with details she has a right to know hes still alive that is not a detail this is what we do buddy boy were on it any renegotiation knox asked ransom sums were always reduced the closer to the drop marquardt handled it very well its down to a quarter million usd twofifty k for two hostages including one american are you shitting me weve adjusted our game plan to consider them amateurs dulwich said berthold was prepared to go as high as ten million knox filled him in on the sherpa delivery man knowing a valid address and how this supported the amateurs theory game changer dulwich said if not a triad then maybe a coworker or a competitor but our modeling continues to suggest one of the bribe recipients we need those people identified you need to bring me lu haos accounts the mongolians did not strike knox as amateurs yang chengs men perhaps fyi we followed up on inspector shens inquiries with marquardt about the american documentary film crew knox said nothing his mind back on the sherpa and dannys severed finger weve confirmed one of the film crew is missing dulwich continued we got it from the head of housekeeping at the tomorrow square marriott hes a cameraman neither he nor his camera has been in his hotel room for over ten days and this pertains to us how listen theyre filming the berthold group right the tower construction now the chinese are all over it so that means were interested its a missing person weve got a couple of those ourselves also kidnapped who knows they sent a hand instead of a finger no one sent anything that hand was fished out of the yangtze dead how would we know hotel security can track keycard usage only housekeeping has been in and out of that missing guysthis cameramans roomover the past ten days sounds like hes toast again why do i care youre a coldhearted bastard a mans missing said one of the coldesthearted bastards knox knew inspector shen pays marquardt a visit a couple days after a kidnapping of a berthold employee and is clearly investigating a different missing persons case hes letting marquardt know they can share the wealththat one investigation may inform the other or hes threatening him not to investigate anything himself which means me that would be you dulwich agreed another reason its worth discussing dont you think would the peoples armed police a guy like the inspector ever employ mongolians as muscle knox asked ill tell you something the ministry of state security would employ goddamn attila the hun if it suited their purpose why ive dropped a pair of guys knox said both apparent mongolians but holding legit national residence cards theyre all over this like flies they were in the incentive loop im interested because i recovered dannys gps he left himself voice notes at each of lu haos drop points dulwich whistled the latest addition to lu haos payments could be these mongolians he heard dulwichs labored breathing that comment had gotten his adrenaline pumping i can have primer ask marquardt about any mongolians any blackmail or extortion that predated the kidnapping but ive got to think he would have volunteered that were working for him after all knox said the mongolians beat the shit out of the delivery guy who left the ransom you do work quickly their whole focus appears to be finding lu i dont see them behind this more like way behind like we are if theyre proxies for the chinese youre fucked those boys will take you behind the shed and put one between your eyes thanks for that i need you to make a second copy of dannys hard drive dulwich said i need my tech guys here to get a look at that maybe the gps and dannys voice notes get us around needing lu haos records you have names amounts knox didnt answer dulwich said stay focused knox those books remain the brass ring i thought getting them out alive was the brass ring im just saying and im not liking what youre saying the berthold group being more concerned with creating a coverup than winning extraction made corporate sense am i supposed to read between the lines sarge there are no lines the priority is human life dulwich confirmed that hasnt changed if it does im out im solo no argument from me i wouldnt suggest overnighting the hard drive no or sending it electronically no well put a courier in place i thought you couldnt put people in place over here no immediate response then we need that drive today dulwich said we need to move the ransoms usd incountry marquardt doesnt have access to that kind of us cash you take care of your shit ill handle mine if im giving this drive to someone make it someone i know by sight send me a picture or something dont go all pierce brosnan on me daniel craig you gotta keep up fuck you the line went dead knox rode the scooter out onto changle lu and took as many precautions against tails as possible twenty minutes later hed made the fiveminute ride as he eased the guesthouses back door closed he heard the steady murmur of voices the fill of background music and the clinking of glasses and tableware he decided to bring a beer to his room he would dress and drive the gpss bookmarked route as an intelligence gathering before doing so with grace in a few hours he passed into the tiny dining and bar area an offtheshoulder raw silk blouse caught his attention amy xue nursed a kir her back to him he approached and paused behind her join me she said patting the stool beside her they met eyes in the bar mirror knox slid onto the stool and ordered a beer you have words with accountant she said in mandarin a slight misunderstanding he said also in mandarin so the ruse had fooled even amy he thought she switched to english i worry for you john knox you snooping around who said im snooping you have money problems you should say something no money problems if you need extension of credit why did you not ask your friend am i missing something he said why would i need an extension of credit i ask myself same thing the chinese could never face a request or a favor headon it always went around the block before arriving at the destination or a middleman was used to save face for both sides this has to do with my payment yes of course i do not charge my friend interest she said no matter that it is within my rights interest why would i owe you interest knox asked taking the more american route you have spoken to your brother she asked what did tommy have to do with this do not involve tommy about john she said last payment not received i do not charge interest for valued customer it took knox a moment our last payment if you need more time this can be negotiated that was months ago two months sixteen days she said you didnt get the wire you should have said something i am saying something did not receive wire transfer of funds did not receive any funds you should have said something sooner we issued payment amy a wire transfer to your bank in hong kong same as always my brother evelyn their bookkeeper never made such mistakes tommy maybe it wasnt impossible given his condition but it wasnt likely ill look into it immediately you are a good customer john knox favored customer amy considered every customer her best customer but there was something more that she wasnt bringing up still it hung between them you miss a payment not a problem but when you did not mention it tonightwell this is not like you not like a most valued customer we paid he said and the wire cleared she asked ill talk to my brother and my bookkeeper please forgive this failure amy this dishonors me greatly contrition was an important part of business relationships with the chinese you can make it up to me she said coyly show me interest not pay it no shortage of interest knox wrote grand cathay in block letters on the bar napkinthe name of his room he pinched it beneath the base of her champagne glass amy kissed him and slipped off the bar taking precautions in a city where the rumor mill spun faster than a turbine having left the guesthouse by the front door she circled around to the back door and joined him in the guestroom joined him without a word spoken between them joined him in a sweaty athletic indulgence that ended with her straddling him their eyes locked their shared rhythm near perfect their needs fulfilled sometimes i wish i still smoked she said lying on her back oh you smoke knox said and she hit him knox rose up onto an elbow to enjoy the look of her he could see her heart beating quickly at the v of her ribcage if a body could be put into words he said yours would be poetry her smile widened silver tongue cold heart he took her hand and placed it on his chest does it feel cold to you she shook her head still smiling and staring at the ceiling fan it is an expression is all she hesitated i am worried for you he turned on the television and cranked the volume he trusted fay not to bug his room but believed in taking precautions no worries he said softly the iphone rang he scrambled to get to it and then considered not answering it but he couldnt help himself yeah who do you think you are graces shrill voice caused knox to distance the phone from his ear he moved away from the bed and made a face to indicate his surprise i will tell you a common thief a liar a cheat worse than all a man whose word cannot be trusted listen to me a minute knox pleaded the gps is the key to our success we are partners and yet you steal it from me steal it a common thief you delay our efforts you cost me panic and fear when i cannot find it how dare you treat me with such disrespect if you would justlisten the line went dead what have you gotten yourself into amy asked an unhappy customer he said returning to her you see you have problem with customer too its true hed known amy long enough to believe he could trust her though trust was more of a concept here than a practice together theyd bent enough export laws to hold weight over the other he nibbled her tenderly and she startled oooh i like that the television continued to blare though the sounds it covered were no longer of conspiracy and collusion instead they were the sounds of secret touches pressures and timing of instruction and direction of a womans cries muffled by a pillow and a mans growl as skin slapped skin and traffic hummed of shared guilty laughter between two people who knew no one deserved something so good when she had gone knox called down and ordered an espresso he showered and dressed and doublechecked the knife he carried as if by looking at it he could hone its blade then he placed the call hed not wanted to make he used the iphone allowing dulwich to pay for itknowing it could not be eavesdropped upon tommy answered on the third ring detroit sounded next door hey bro knox said johnny tommy was the only person knox tolerated using the nickname his brother sounded as excited as if an ice cream truck had just pulled up in front of the house with proper medication supervision and a solid routine tommy did all right he could handle the responsibilities of their partnership he indulged in video games hed pretty much conquered public transportation he had a start on adulthood if not there yet thankfully he wasnt inclined to look for the man behind the curtain knox played his role close to the vest the missed payment to amy was a red flag knox did not want to access any of their online bookkeeping from china he didnt want to give the internetsniffing chinese authorities a leg up how goes it knox asked just fine tommy said business good couldnt be better small problem over here where shanghai amy never received her wire silence the pearl lady but that was months ago tommy said impressive knox thought yes exactly wouldnt we know if a wire didnt go through tommy struggled with the concept of moving money electronically we should yes you mean i should tommy said i didnt say that its what youre thinking dont go there tommy its not what i was thinking you think i screwed up if you screwed up id say you screwed up since when do i mince words then what if not that why are you calling because we owe a lot of money to an important supplier and i want to get on it thats all there is to it dont make this bigger than it is ill have to check with eve evelyn ritter their bookkeeper and accountant yes thats where we start exactly a record of the wire and if for some reason it didnt go through we resend tommy said agreeing are you writing this down im not stupid of course i am well need to check other payments as well eve can help i dont get how she could have missed this one but stranger things have happened bet you anything its on this end you know chinese banks tommy had a schoolboy crush on their attractive bookkeeper knox did not like the way the relationship had developedhe didnt know if he was jealous of eve for winning tommys attentions or if he questioned why an attractive smart woman would express interest in someone with tommys limited social skills but eve spent time with his brotherquality timeand that was a blessing he wouldnt discourage how are things otherwise knox asked tigers suck theres news how about you tommy asked looking into importing vintage motorcycles hed lived with the lie long enough to begin to buy into it seriously they have some real beauties over here they copied bmw and russian designs for years better than the originals we can get em for a song bring em up to standards and sell them for five maybe eightx i thought im not allowed to ride motorcycles he said sounding younger all of a sudden some of them have sidecars maybe well make an exception an exception tommy said mimicking a signal he was tiring phone calls were harder for him than facetoface tommys doctors could not explain half of what went onor failed to go onin his brain ill sign off knox said expensive call email me what you find out from eve ill email you tommy said youre a good man tommy miss you johnny he hung up knox kept the phone to his ear a little longer than necessary his heart working like timpani he trod softly as he descended the stairs heeding fays warning about the night watchman and slipped outside carefully shutting the back door behind him enjoy yourself graces voice at his back knox didnt miss a beat thats the general idea he turned and she stepped out of shadow it wasnt graces presence that shocked him but the fact that he hadnt spotted her she is pretty in a slutty kind of way grace said i didnt know you cared he said you are going out on the route she said seeing the helmet yes without me that was the plan knox admitted she crossed her arms defiantly she couldnt bring herself to look at him this is not what we agreed to she said speaking to the lane no then why she asked its what i do the way its done its called advancing do not patronize me john knox thats all it was going to be ride the route make sure its safe determine multiple points of egress i was not going to ride youusinto a possible ambush my friendthis was his job its what he did for me im doing the same thing for me loaded with sarcasm nothing more nothing less he told about danners hard drive about his wantingneedingher to look over its contents admitted it was beyond his current patience level i agree to this she said softening some i would have been there at six am he pleaded believe that or not thats the truth he hesitated as to the woman no she moved toward the scooter we do this tonight now when thesecriminals are in their homes we drive it first he said the entire route we dont approach any of them until first light any of these peopleall of themknow their neighborhoods they can navigate in the dark far better than we patience and planning or we dont do this at all he motioned toward the scooter she stood there immovable intractable and willful please he said two motorcycles turned into the mouth of the lane racing toward them at a highpitched whine knox saw apology and regret in her eyes shed allowed herself to be followed both bikes veered toward knox skidding out from under the riders who leaped off and dumped them toward knox like bowling balls aimed at pins knox timed his jump well though was tripped up by a rear fender as he came down he sprawled onto the concrete a boot heel aimed for his face before he could recover grace took him out the boot missed knoxs face the other rider had gone down onto a knee while dumping his bike knox rolled toward him stood and kicked him in the groin the man lurched forward reflexively knox kneed him in the face and he was out graces opponent suffered her first kick had thrown him into the back wall of the quintet and off of knox a moments hesitation on his partdisbelief such lethal force could come from a hundredpound womancost him she went after him like he was a punching bag and he sank i know this one she called out to knox as she continued to deliver a volley of blows to the mans abdomen reducing him to the fetal position as the man sank she searched his pockets and came up with a wallet overconfident fools she said know him how knox asked yang chengs cocktail party knox got a closer look she was right the bodyguard type never far from the party host damn he said impressed he got the scooter going and aimed for the street grace threw a leg over the seat and wrapped her arms tightly around his waist and they were off wednesday september days until the ransom am zhabei and pudong districts shanghai the first pass amounted to a surveillance run knox drove with grace directing him from behind while holding the gps he replayed danners voice notes in his head and relayed them to grace afterward they killed an hour in jing an park awaiting the sunrise i want you to keep this he said passing her his copy of danners hard drive insurance also were going to need a laptop we need to study the contents of that drive asap she looked somewhat confused as soon as possible he said is not a problem laptops are for sale on every block in shanghai and cheap knox laughed and she followed covering her mouth as if ashamed knox wanted to tell her to show her smile he said nothing do you love her she asked he considered the question thoughtfully and how to answer do you know particle physics you accelerate a proton or neutron and smash it and it gives off energy and breaks into smaller particles which you then capture thats how i see love ive experienced the breaking up thing the energy im still waiting for the capture he added back at my placeit wasnt what you think he said you do not know what i think she said we dont control these things he said do you understand some things control us i understand perfectly well what controls you he asked she snorted the connection to lu haos family he speculated having tried before she flashed him a penetrating look lu haos older brother is called lu jian he waited her out i was responsible for lu haos placement with berthold you feel responsible tell me about lu jian it was more than that his comment drove her to silence i do not think so a romance she didnt deny it current or past no answer or both he said thats part of this for you there are family obligations face what would you know of face my brother i told you about him perception and reality are two very different things maybe i know more about face than you might expect i doubt it youre hoping for a second chance he speculated you save the little brother maybe you save the romance she shot him a vicious look but she didnt deny it not long after the sky lightened and they returned to the scooter street traffic was sparse though the corner bao shops teemed the smell of charcoal and grilled pork filled the air the routes and destinations were more familiar to them now knox slowed the scooter as they neared the first location danners voice told him it was a childless couple in their forties he pulled the scooter to the curb grace jumped off the back and threw her helmet to him you need to stay here she said in mandarin for the sake of the people passing on the sidewalk knox did not want to make a scene he knew any waiguorenany american accent no matter how goodwould stand out but he had no intention of standing by and leaving grace alone he slipped off his helmet pulled on a ball cap and hurried across the street chasing her foolish she said refusing to look at him the way we talked about he said the way i laid it out together they hurried up the darkened exterior staircase to a secondfloor balcony and around the corner to the second door from the street side of the apartment building knox put his back to the wall out of sight of the door she knocked and a moment later the door came partially open wei a womans voice speaking mandarin yes i have the delivery youve been expecting grace said the door swung open farther as the woman called out laogong husband the sound of shuffling slippers announced the husbands arrival grace threw open the door knox stepped through shoving the unsuspecting man back grace shut the door knox drove the husband onto a stool that overturned as he fell and knox followed him to the floor on one knee the room was sparsely decorated but well kept with a tile floor and a low coffee table surrounded by wooden stools knox spoke an angry unforgiving shanghainese i will tear your sack off your body my friend and give it to your wife as a souvenir a plastic id and lanyard landed on the floor next to knox grace had tossed it to him from a hook by the door steel inspector she said the man who paid you knox said his victim shook his head frantically shouting no good no good we have come for him bu xing the man backpedaled trying to get knoxs hand off his throat then i do not know repeatedly his face had gone the color of an old bruise his eyes occupied a third of his face and were growing you tell me now knox said reaching between the mans legs or you piss blood for a week the color in his face deepened he paid you my friend knox said do not lie to me i take the money it is true each week i take the money for this i give favorable quality standard reports may buddha forgive me i know nothing more than payment did not come this week nothing more i tell you enough grace called out knox released him and shot her a look that warned her not to interfere and this week knox asked the man did you still give favorable report the man flinched and recoiled as knox lifted his hand toward him i did not think so knox said he scooped up the mans id and pocketed it if you ever take so much as another fen for such a favor your family will pay for generations knox knew a threat to a mans lineage was the most serious of all i told you cried the wife i warned you nothing good came of such greed she with both a new refrigerator and a dishwasher in her kitchen not even expats had dishwashers your phones knox said to the man he glared back puzzled both of your phones he said to the couple they produced them knox collected the sim cards and crushed what remained he grabbed grace by the arm and they backed out pulling the door closed behind them walk calmly knox said grace was unfazed knoxs right hand was shaking we might have handled that differently she said accusingly thats how its going to be knox said exactly like that until were convinced the persons telling the truth and if they know each other if he should call ahead to warn the others thats partly why i took the phones he said i think you took the phones to look at who he calls who he knows knox said nothing she was too smart by half but if he should call ahead she said repeating herself provoking him what do you want me to say she didnt answer together they climbed onto the scooter and drove off grace holding knox around the waist she read directions from the gps while knox recalled everything danner had recorded as if it had been left for him personally they moved between districts and neighborhoods honing their interrogation skills with each stop grace was forced into the fray twice responding with a technical precision and efficiency to her movement and force together they manhandled and subdued three more recipients of lu haos bribes bringing the total to four when they found themselves facing a cluster of impressive highrise apartments overlooking the huangpu river danners voice notes had the floor and apartment numbers as well as comments about the lobby security knox passed grace a ball cap for the sake of security cameras these buildings she said no expats all party officials chinese businessmen important people everyone in shanghai knows this address construction inspectors we do not know for certain neh not until we find lu haos accounts she pushed this on him reminding him he had failed to secure the accounts she couldnt analyze what she hadnt yet seen every kind of successful person lives in this compound she said inspectors perhaps also city planners and regional supervisors architects engineers decisionmakers its early yet knox said every reason to believe they will be at home two are in the same tower she reminded him yes the fifth floor and the twelfth once we have visited the one it is highly unlikelynot likely at all she emphasized that a second interview will be possible in the same building interview he was thinking with each stop knox sunk into a darker place hed begun to enjoy the punishment he delivered to transfer his anger over danners situation into his fists to look forward to the next stop hed failed to fully consider the conflict this building presented until he heard her voice it that is a problem he said we cant pick one over the other people in powerthe way you describe these peoplethese could be the people were looking for yes we must coordinate our efforts time this perfectly youre suggesting we split up he said shed been complaining about his techniques is there a choice he imagined her gloating theres always a choice he said then i will take the fifth floor she said if they throw me out the window it is shorter to fall youre going to joke about this i am learning she said knox laughed aloud you understand he began grace put her fingers to his lips stopping him much more than you can possibly convince yourself of she removed her hand just as fast as shed used it to silence him there was no hidden meaning to be read into her touching him there was nothing suggestive implied by it yet knox felt his lips tingle well after her fingers were gone reminded for the first time since the cocktail party of her femininity and the power women wielded over him intentionally or otherwise he said we have two choices for gaining entrysubterfuge or power you leave this to me she said we will go to the twelfthfloor apartment together from there i will leave you and take care of the fifth they made it past two doormen in the lobby by grace holding on to knoxs arm and acting incredibly sexy she turned it on so quickly it surprised him which was her intention she ran her hands all over him while giggling and purring she pulled his hand onto her backside and he held it there the boysfor thats all they were boys in gray suitscouldnt keep their eyes off her and werent about to interrupt such a woman with a waiguoren involved they rode the elevator to the twelfth floor with grace continuing to act her part well aware the security boys would be attempting to follow them using security video grace gambled correctly that a maidthe ayiwould answer the door taking a cue from danners voice note she mentioned a teenage boy to the chinese woman at the door saying she had important information that could keep the family from embarrassment the door came open knox swept inside grace pulled the door shut leaving knox cupping the unsuspecting maids mouth as he dragged her to the telephone and pulled the phone offhook engaging the line and ensuring an outgoing call could not be made the maid went limp having passed out from fright he left her on the floor and hurried down the hall grace stayed behind to tie her up the first bedroom belonged to a sleeping teenager who didnt movewouldnt move only child male he recalled danner saying next door was an empty guest room and finally the master suite he moved for the bed but was jumped from behinda stupid mistake he realized hed made too much noise with the ayi a male with a knife and he knew how to use it knox turned but too slowly the knife punched for him knox blocked the second lunge he was a fat chinese man in checkered pajamas sweating from nerves in the glow of a green nightlight knox wrestled the knife free and kicked it across the floor the man kidneypunched him knox slumped surprised by how much it hurt he recovered to block another attempt and then with an opening he kneed the man in the groin and a fist to below the ribcage the man sank to the floor the wife came screaming out of bed carrying a sheet she tripped on the sheet exposing her nudity tripped again and fell knox now in full control of the man punished him with a flurry of fists you have taken money on the xuan tower project knox said in steady mandarin do you deny it he clenched the man by the throat you are wrong the man wheezed knox leaned his weight into the mans throat the wife tried to hide herself with the sheet failing miserably she skidded back on her bottom toward the wall sobbing i seek information about the one delivering your money knox said fuck you knox dragged him toward the french doors all men fall at the same speed knox said as you are about to find out husband the wife called out he heard grace before he saw her she was craning over the cowering woman you keep your tongue in your hole or i will tear it out grace said she moved across the room and opened the french doors for knox knoxs victim saw he was outnumbered saw the doors swing open shi de he cried yes it is true all true knox squatted and questioned him grace crossed the room to gag and tie up the wife she then took off down the hall the man confessed to accepting the bribes in exchange for harmony on the construction site but claimed to know nothing of lu haos disappearance or whereabouts knox told him if he reported their visit even to security within the building it would result in news of the bribes going public by arrangement knox did not go to the fifth floor just as grace would not return to the twelfth instead he left by a stairway door and returned to the scooter awaiting her she met him less than five minutes later her face flushed and shining with perspiration anything he said nothing she said one left getting late or early he said yes but worth a try is it okay with you she looked surprised he would ask yes okay the final stop came with an ominous note from danner recent addition to route extremely narrow alley ground floor second or third door choke point no mention of an individual no exact apartment of greater concern and explaining danners lack of specificity was his categorizing it as a choke pointa funnel with limited access making anyone who entered vulnerable this one is not good knox said at a stoplight as they followed the gps track not enough information danner didnt like it latest addition to lu haos stops she said reminding him of danners voice memo if we had an exact date this could help me with the berthold financials if i ever get you lus books we will get them the muslim neighborhood was small but heavily populated dress changed as did the smells of the street food once again knox studied the entrance to the narrow alley off ping wang jie road once again from a distance danners description was accurate a choke point let me walk it she said alone no i will not stop will not ask questions just a walkthrough she handed him the gps indicating the lane which appeared on the virtual map as a shortcut between two parallel streets a waiguoren cannot do this knox at that moment knox spotted an expressionless man coming out of the alley and looking toward them civi guard took off he recalled danner saying a lane guard a party employee assigned to a neighborhood as a security detail not police but someone gaining experience ahead of the application process typically a person eager to prove himself knox knew grace was right go he said ill meet you around the other side but if i dont see you in five im coming in after you please i will be fine she slid off the scooter handed him her helmet and disappeared through the traffic grace noticed the lane guard turning to follow her she kept up a brisk but unhurried pace she would not give him anything to feed on behind her she heard the scooter head off the lane was nearly narrow enough to touch walls with her arms extended stucco walls raised three stories overhead interrupted by rusted wroughtiron balconies it felt cloistered the air smelled stale she passed a series of doorways on her right and then caught herself staring at a green motorcycle it was the combination of the unusual deep green color and the basket on the back fender shed seen it in the lane outside the sherpas apartment the mongolians had been watching him that in turn meant theyd seen her and knox enter the residence the guard followed down the lane behind her a choke point she recalled she walked past the motorcycle committing its tag to memory stole a glance toward the small window by the door to her right curtained shut passing the next apartment its door hung open she absorbed the layout a single room of perhaps nine square meters in this case limited furnishingsa pair of bamboo mats on the floor and some stacked aluminum bowls a slightly larger window in the back wall the footfalls of the guard suggested hed closed the distance with her now only a few meters behind she continued walking neither fast nor slow knowing that had it been knox in this lane the guard would have confronted him two doors down she saw another open door despite what shed told knox she stopped and called inside in part as an act for the security man a muslim woman met her grace lowered her voice taking a chance hello she said in mandarin you are familiar with the northerner two doors down the woman nodded a mongolian and not the only one grace nearly cried out with the confirmation one of his friends owes me money grace said the womans eyes hardened i would forgive the debt cousin do you see his friends often another slight nod yes the resident said in an even softer voice than grace was using her voice brought chills up graces arms do they live with him these other men down the lane the woman answered two to a room a choke point how many five all told that left three in good health the reason i ask grace said is that i would rather not be seen by the one that owes me he is not pleasant all rough men yes grace said mongolians are rough the woman did not contradict her in pairs she said roommates the leader lives by himself leader they travel like a pack of dogs yes grace assembled the data wondering how far to push it two rooms she proposed the womans icy stare was difficult to read grace sensed shed overstayed her welcome you have been generous with me dear lady not at all the woman said grace backed away the woman stopped her again my advice forgive the debt do not deal with these dogs wethose of us in the laneleave them to themselves grace nodded peace be with you and you the woman pushed the door shut the lane guard had lit a cigarette and sat himself down on a stool by a pair of potted plants and smoked hed been watching but out of earshot grace moved on a moment later leaving the lane and entering onto a busy street she walked a block before crossing and joining knox on the scooter well knox said drive she ordered ill tell you as we go knox pulled out into traffic and grace wrapped her arms around him she let go jerked back and cried out softly knox knox her left hand was smeared with his blood she held it out to his side on display for him ill be damned he said you are bleeding i know that you did not tell me she shouted to be heard over the engine adrenaline he said as if that explained anything we go to your place at once we cant he said our visitors remember in the lane they know that location now eightoheight is out i cannot return and we cant go to your place either you were compromised when we fought them they followed you possibly from the party but you went back to your place she didnt contradict him so they have your apartment they have the guesthouse they want us or they wouldnt have come after us like that neither of us is going home she considered what he said for several long seconds i know a place she said we can go there and decide what to do later it cant be a friend its a service apartment rental but not with the best reputation but you know it first hand i know it i have stayed there she thought back to lu jian service apartments with kitchens and maid service were used for longterm stays by traveling businessmen in lieu of more expensive hotel rooms that could work he said we must hurry she said panic rising in her voice you are bleeding badly he had her trigger now the sight of blood everyone had one his was abuse the strong taking advantage of the weak it left him sick honestly he said leaning back to call out to her i didnt even know it was there im fine you are bleeding john bleeding badly pull over i will make a call then i drive shed called him by his given name for the first time he smiled through an unexpected wince of pain as she held to him tightly while he pulled the scooter to the side of the road am jing an temple jing an district shanghai melschoi paid a sorrylooking vendor seven yuan for a bundle of incense cursing the amount under his breath and entered the dimly lit temple the crosslegged goldleafed buddha rose thirty feet high surrounded at the knees by pomelo fruit and fresh flowers the fragrant smoke hung heavily in the air wrapping the idols shoulders like a scarf melschoi was not there to worship but because one of his two remaining uninjured men was assigned to survey yang constructions security man no nuts feng his man had followed feng into an alley behind quintet and had watched as a woman and an american had pummeled both feng and another man melschois spy had held back but had subsequently lost the two in trafficin melschois mind a punishable offense that left him quintet and the night watchman melschoi had just followed to the temple there was probably a chinese proverb about there being more than one way to skin a cat but melschoi didnt want to hear it his beijing boss was so well connected that he had ears in every keyhole how long until he learned of the compounded mistakes melschoi and his men were making how long until he cut bait and what then a bone crusher sent for him in the night police arrest melschoi had no leverage over his beijing employerknew nothing but that the money was good and it kept coming despite his agnosticism melschoi took a moment to pray for the opportunity and funds to return to his homeland and make things right for his family the subsequent talk with the night watchman came down to what everything in this city came down to money melschoi offered five hundred yuan and the man was ready to give him his firstborn the foreigner had had a lady visitor at the guesthouse that same night the woman had waited for him and had engaged in typical bar conversation with the barmaid the conversation had centered on jewelry because the guest owned a pearl shop in international pearl city in hongqiao melschoi would have words with this woman he would know all she knew about this american and what the man wanted with lu hao she was all he had she not this gold idol was to be his savior and everyone knew the fate of all saviors they were sacrificed am changning district shanghai wo de tian grace led the way into the furnished service apartment having secured it as easily and nearly as quickly as a hotel room the biggest threat came from having to show identification grace had gotten around this by implying she and knox were having an affair for a negotiated price the landlord had supplied the id she carried several shopping bags with her having made stops along the way the floor was a hideous marble tile the furniture black leather and aluminum the lighting recessed halogen the view was of another tower across a lane grace pulled the drapes and blinds blood caked his hand as knox slipped out of the scottevest his shirt damp with it i could use your help if you have the stomach for it she backed up a step repelled by the sight of his bloody shirt he pulled off his sticky tshirt with some difficulty grace stepped up to help him she turned away at sight of the wound it looks worse than it is youve been stabbed yes knox said fingering it two older scars one on his chest one across his ribs looked much worse the guy jumped me he landed one before i reacted my bad can you help knox moved into the bathroom and she followed carrying one of the bags with her looking on he washed the wound and dried it he grimaced as he stabbed an antibacterial pad deep into the wound and left it there for a count of thirty squeezed a bead of gel into the edges of the wound and turned to grace her color had returned she didnt look the least put off she snipped the applicator on the end of a tube of super glue you hold it closed for me he suggested i will apply the glue she said you hold it closed you need stitches this will work he pointed out his two scars stitches no stitches only glue the glued scar was gnarly and thick he pinched the skin together as tight as he could get it go he held it as still as possible for five minutes some of the twoinch wound held shut some pulled back open three applications later he was sealed shut how did you get these scars she asked most are shrapnel dulwich and iwe were in convoy when an ied a bomb took out the road sarges vehicle took the brunt of it i caught some metal you went after him she made it a statement those two yearsthats most of my scars you start out that kind of work thinking youre bulletproof you end up waiting for your contract to expire so mr dulwich owes you it doesnt work like that americans dont think like that everyone thinks like that tell me about the mongolians he said she seemed tempted not to change the subject but relented five all living in the lane and lu hao paid a visit to one of them so it would seem she said for a large payoff according to danny no way around needing lu haos books she said we must not lose focus its a work in progress dannys hard drive may help us there but the mongolians mean something are they just after their share could it be that simple why not or are they working for the police or state security someone who could obtain the proper documents for them freelance it is possible in that case for what youve done to them it would explain their watching lus apartment knox said theyre keeping tabs on you and me because we showed up there maybe they think youre the next lu hao and they want to make sure you know theyre due their share it would be easier to speak with me no need to follow yeah i know knox said he didnt like it either shed already told him about the green motorcycle so they beat the crap out of the sherpa hoping to find lu hao but like us its just an empty warehouse so they keep an eye on the sherpa and we come along by now they know an american has taken out two of them that makes us persons of interest to them or targets knox moved only slightly and winced with the pain the incentive budget would have increased to account for the mongolian payment your mr danner said it was a recent addition that money must be accounted for the berthold eoy records should account for it theres always just asking marquardt about it he would not know such details he is insulated from the particulars preston song perhaps can you talk to song i would prefer to see the company financials first the more i know the more hard information i have the more leverage he heard the frustration in her voice lus books knox said yes his accounting of the incentives should answer many of our questions his accounting is currency whoever has that information whoever controls it has the real power so if nothing else we get it for that reason to protect it to keep it from others grace said works for me mr marquardt has yet to provide me the endofyear accounting i do not know if this is intentional or simply neglect perhaps it is significant perhaps not above my pay grade he said feeling his wound he wanted sleep if i had to bet danny got himself a copy of lus payouts within the first week of his covering lu its how he rolls so it makes sense for me to do a thorough study of the hard drives contents grace said i am an expert with such data but unfortunately im not finding the data on the hard drive in the first place we can find somebody to help your friend she said disgustedly knox remained motionless to allow the super glue to set did you get beer she returned with two open beers they drank together i must attempt to engage preston song also mr marquardt if possible you must take every precaution he said yes of course off site if i can manage we have three known groups were dealing with the mongolians yangs boys and this government cop shen thats a lot of possible eyeballs on you understood he liked the way her throat moved as she drank he said and only one of me watching your entrance and exit our best and only real shot at identifying your surveillants i will arrange off site she repeated away from the office i arrive early leave late he was going to point out that her earlier mistake had led to the attack in the alley but she didnt strike him as a person who wanted or needed such reminders still as he pieced it together he couldnt help himself yangs men must have overheard your ranting about me taking the gps from you he said she looked struck i had not considered nor i but thats why they hit us with force they knew we had dannys gps my apartment she said theres something i havent mentioned he said a guy thing the way yang cheng and his bodyguard looked at you at the cocktail party it wasnt casual it wasallknowing she stared at him i do not understand theres checking out a woman and then theres the xray vision thing the full body scan the snicker boys in the treehouse these two had seen you of course they were looking at me had seen you inprivate your apartment im thinking she pursed her lips listen they were ogling you he saw her shiver we might be able to use that knox said her eyes pleaded for him to stop i need to call sarge and let him know were blown knox said and injured he can inform marquardt i will take care of that when i see him and preston song john i am sorry for this it is my fault he didnt disagree with her the assault after the hurt we put on yang chengs guyseven though they wont report it to the police theres a good chance the police will hear about it way too many eyes in this city so we can add the police to the list of people to avoid he chugged down half his beer face recognition he burped sarge warned me we need to take care she sipped from the bottle when he hears of your injury mr dulwich will order you back to hong kong so he wont hear besides i dont answer to sarge we both answer to mr dulwich she corrected he is our immediate superior its a cultural thing he said i believe we will be recalled he scoffed let me ask you this if they recall us are you going to leave lu hao behind she nursed the beer eyes probing over the curve of the bottle me neither knox said pm tomorrow square shanghai the white lotus located on the twentyseventh floor of the marriott tower in tomorrow square had a dozen private rooms off its central dining room each private room had an expansive view of the city a private waitstaff came and went only the headwaiter remained in the room arms behind his back standing rigidly in the corner allan marquardt dismissed him the round table could accommodate ten three was somewhat awkward preston song sat slightly closer to marquardt than to grace isolating her from the center of power a soft fortysomething with piggish eyes song wore a glorious blue suit a gold tie pin and a leering look of displeasure grace updated them on the sherpas connection and her possessing danners gps locations all in an effort to gain the elusive endofyear accounting from what youve told us youve clearly made progress marquardt said were encouraged by that i understand you have done well with negotiations she said yes preston song studied her distrustfully grace collected her thoughts and sought a professional and confident tone in our pursuit of lu haos accounts and location my associate and i have questioned those people on lu haos routethose receiving incentives i am afraid none is a candidate for lu haos kidnapper during this process we were made aware of a recent payment added to lu haos route she watched for reaction marquardt smirked preston song revealed nothing if we are to be effective we need to know who these people are and the purpose of the payment she paused waiting song was too practiced to allow anything to show on his face she said the first of two payments occurred on or before the tenth of last month having gleaned the date from the voice memo on danners gps songs eyes were fixed as she imagined him working out what to say my dear girl song said as we approach the conclusion of a project the size and scope of the xuan tower it is only natural that unforeseen expenses arise additional incentives must be paid understandable she said knowing then that song oversaw the payment of incentives for the berthold group and acted as a buffer protecting marquardt the point is she continued these men have taken an active interest in our efforts to find mr lu knowing their exact role is crucial if i may be direct we need to know if they are friends or enemies to date they are behaving much like enemies a knock on the door interrupted her song wore an irritable expression as a wave of servers delivered dim sum tea was poured as quickly as the servers arrived they were gone the food moved around on a lazy susan propelled by marquardts hand plates were filled what was the purpose of these payments she asked marquardt rested his chopsticks on the small porcelain lift alongside his fork his appetite apparently gone your line of questioning is growing impertinent song said this information is central to our task and to our safety grace said extortion blackmail might it have to do with the documentary being shot the missing cameraman marquardt looked up quickly his eyes piercing song never skipped a beat eating the dim sum before it went cold the first i heard of the matter was a few days ago said marquardt i promise you we have nothing to do with this and these most recent payments as preston has said end of project stuff the usual unforeseen complications he paused deliberately for a breath we have every hope and intention of getting mr lu back safely with your help that is certain financial matters need to remain confidential there are millions of dollars at play as you can well imagine if these matters had anything to do with mr luanything at allwe would not hesitate for a moment to share them with you do you understand were not fools we want the same thing as you do it occurred to her that lu hao might have discovered the film crew he could not resist anything to do with film his passion was the reason heand everyone elsewas in this mess he had put his family on the brink of financial ruin because of his passion song said this most recent increase to our subcontractors invoice was approved and paid out nothing more the reason we hire such subcontractors is so that someone else handles these complications she knew very well why they hired such subcontractors so their criminal acts of bribery fell onto others she bit her tongue very well thank you she said marquardt said listen im not going to lie to you lu haos accounts of the incentives going public could pose difficulties for us we want and need to recover those records but let there be no question about it first and foremost we want to get mr lu and mr danner back safely as ive said to that end we are at your disposal i would appreciate the endofyear accounts i do not see how that will help song said his mouth full of chewed food his plate held to his lips i asked for this before she said to marquardt indeed i would have expected you to have that by now preston i asked gail to take care of this whats the holdup youll look into this for me yes of course marquardt sounded legitimately put off song worked eagerly on the glass of beer the man shouldnt have tried for the shao mai the tips of his chopsticks shook considerably as he pinched the piece of wontonwrapped pork and slid it between his wet lips it was the first sign of cracks in his demeanor grace reveled in the moment preston song had no intention of her seeing the eoy accountswhich made her all the more eager to do so marquardt on the other hand felt like an ally pm changning district shanghai knox awoke with a start and answered the ringing iphone yeah he said looking around for grace shed slept on the couch where a blanket was now folded no sign of her it had to be around noon its me dulwich surprise knox said theres a wet market on the north side of julu east of xiangyang road bring the hard drive ten minutes more like fifty knox said im nowhere near there had to move well talk bring the hard drive we knox said but the call was dead a light rain discouraged use of the scooter and made finding a taxi difficult knox was late before he started an hour after the call he walked past the wet market on julu and stole a glance inside no caucasians he wore the scottevest the stain scrubbed clean from around the small slit in its left side he kept his right hand on a knife in the pocket entering the market he circulated down aisles of bubbling plastic tubs containing live eel catfish perch jellyfish minnows myriad crustaceans displays of rabbit pigeon chickens and carcasses he could not identify the market jogged to the right into another smaller room unseen from the entrance it appeared empty until knox spotted a man looming behind a tank thick with a moving coil of fish the fish spooked and parted the mans face appeared dulwich he stepped around into the open i didnt expect to see you knox confessed i thought the reason im here is because you couldnt be he felt the sting of dreadhad dulwich set him up all along dont worry dulwich said technically its not me he patted his chest pocket he was on an alias passport but still at great risk knox did worry if dulwich had been able to enter china then why recruit him for the job in the first place as a fall guy obviously someone expendable so why would dulwich enter now when it seemed the risk was heightened over even a few days earlier dulwich took knox by the arm and led him into a room farther from the street gurgling styrofoam tubs held softshelled turtles frogs and sea urchins knox winced with the tug and dulwich shot him a suspicious look pulled a muscle knox said dulwich extended his open hand the hard drive knox hesitated seriously what are you doing here the drop is still set for the day after tomorrow weve requested a final proof of life just before the drop you and the girl will make the drop thats fine but it doesnt explain your being here knox said since when do i answer to you dulwich said gruffly since now im here to help you dulwich said youre here for the hard drive but last time i checked you needed me because you couldnt enter safely who said im here safely dulwich said desperate times desperate measures and all that shit im here because of danny because of you knox wasnt buying it tell me youve got my back ive got your back the berthold group doesnt want a second copy of lu haos books out there thats why the hard drive interests you yes knox considered his own comment are you so convinced the hostages will be killed because danners an american or because the berthold group is more interested in getting lu haos books back than the hostages lets just say im playing percentages dulwich said marquardt seems like the real thing to me but who knows these fuckers are in it for the money right danny is not expendable not to me not to you thats why youre here am i right what do i know as to why i risked being here my boss primer raised the ransom cash for marquardt the twofifty usd its coming into guangzhou by container ship tomorrow im the courier primer will not trust freelancers with that kind of cash who put the free in freelance you could have headed straight to guangzhou knox said dulwich bristled coulda shoulda but dannys hard drives a priority you got the sim card i sent dulwich nodded yeah your guy made repeated calls to another payasyougo china mobile phone at first we thought it might be the intellectual fielding those calls the mongolians arent the kidnappers theyre on the receiving end of the incentives interesting dulwich said added on late in the game well whatever all that means the guy taking those calls appears to report daily to someone in beijing a party member government a businessman who the fuck knows but hes a priority to you and me both these mongolians are muscle for some beijing bureaucrat or middlemen for the incentives dulwich proposed that works for me weve been following gps locators on both phonesthe beijing guy and the shanghai phone that apparently reports into him daily knox thought they were getting closer to the truth of why dulwich had made the trip youre tracking them nice of you to tell me im telling you now right the beijing guy is smart enough to turn it off and leave it off most of the time making tracking sporadic the shanghai guy not so smart you want to meet him dulwich handed knox his iphone the blue dot thats him hes up the block from us knox studied the moving map youve got a bead on the mongolian when exactly were you going to tell me he came straight here the moment you arrived i watched the dot cross the city knox tried to make sense of it he must have followed you is that possible you took a cab dulwich stated as if knox had committed a crime knox explained i was short on time we know this guy is connected to beijing right youve actually helped us out by confirming the level of that connection he didnt follow you knox he just headed over here that tells me this beijing guy swings a big enough stick to have the shanghai cabbies looking out for you the runins with the mongolians knox said the cops contacted kozlowski at the consulate about an american wanted for assault so theyve been onto you makes sense they lifted your face off camera footage fed a photo to city cab drivers and here you are id keep my hat low from now on an elderly chinese man entered the small space scooped up some live eels into a plastic bag and left what about him ive got to lose him knox said pointing to dulwichs phone dulwich grinned i thought youd never ask pm kingland riverside luxury residence pudong district i wondered if youd taken your lunch grace said over the secure iphone knowing marquardts assistants rarely took a lunch break beyond a baozi from the corner she considered her lunch with marquardt and song a draw not a total failure but not the results she had hoped for with any luck selena could be manipulated to correct that discrepancy grace had learned from the best her manipulative mother not yet selena ming said quite busy today i thought you might enjoy a look at my apartment a moments hesitation then selena replied yes very much i am taking my afternoon here in order to focus on some accounting personally requested by mr marquardt do you like sushi an extravagant meal for an office worker like selena was kfc because of its price sushi was considered fine diningtakeaway or not my favorite i will order some takeaway i can pick this up on my way would you how kind of you grace supplied the name of a shop less than a block from her pudong apartment oh she said as if just thinking of it mr marquardt would like me to check the eoy financials end of year i may have mentioned that before she knew she had and selena had been reluctant to help her obtain them but now she came at it from a better angle selena had seen grace win on the apartment issue her impression of graces power within the company would have greatly improved i left them on my office computer she lied i wonder if i gave you my password if you could bring me a thumb drive i do not wish to trouble you as marquardts executive assistant selena would be able to obtain nearly anything grace did not have the files on her machine but knew selena would never agree to access another employees computer we have a printout here in our files if that would suffice i would be most happy to deliver these for you miss chu call me grace please the final hook first name basis with a junior executive mr marquardt would like me to complete the work as quickly as possible you know how he is i will bring them with me selena said thank you and i would just as soon he not know how forgetful i can be of course see you soon then grace said she chortled upon disconnecting the call proud of herself keeping in mind that her apartment was likely bugged she and knox planned to use selenas visit to ferret out whoever was behind the surveillanceto offer up just enough juicy content to tease a reaction from either yang cheng or allan marquardt grace fetched a scarf from her bag and covered her head she entered a sister tower to her own residence and rode the elevator to the tenth floor where a sky bridge connected the two if anyone was watching her tower they would not have seen her enter once into her apartment she was mindful of the electronic ears and eyes eventually grace was buzzed by lobby security and selena was announced marquardts secretary failed to conceal her reaction to the apartments opulence she covered her mouth moving room to room her eyes giving away her astonishment following the tour the two sat at the dining table and shared the sushi that grace had put out on a plate grace positioned them both with their backs to the room as if to admire the view in fact it was for the sake of the possible cameras hoping the open drapes would place them both in silhouette and make them less easy to read i was unable to download the spreadsheets you requested selena said graces shoulders slumped in disappointment i see but i was able to bring you these selena withdrew a pair of heavy binders from her backpack and slapped them onto the table i cannot give them to you but i can leave them with you for a day or two you can perhaps look them over and return them to me at that time yes of course grace did her best to contain her excitement these binders and the endofyear accounts they contained represented a complex numeric crossword puzzle as entertaining to her as it was challenging she flipped open the first of the two delighting at the sight of all those numbers somewhere in these pages was a record of every cent paid out as bribes through lu hao dates internal transfers of funds budgeting it is what you expected selena asked between bites yes perfect thank you what exactly is forensic accountant we are like surgeons we cut into the body and find out what is wronghow to fix it grace answered she fictionalized her role for the sake of the surveillance according to her and knoxs plan the firm believes there is an audit imminent from the us tax authorities broadly speaking my job is to make sure everything adds up you will no doubt be troubled with mr marquardts travel expenses then grace was typically focused on five or six figures and above but she was tempted by selenas concern if you have had trouble balancing an expense account she said i would be pleased to be of assistance i just wish to make it known that it was not my idea to redact lines from his credit card bill i would like very much for that to be understood is this a crime happens all the time dear girl not to worry inside grace was churning why should marquardt want his assistant to redact line items from a credit card bill buying a gift for the wife on the company card had he lied about a mistress did any of it matter there is no blame that will result from my work i find problems and make suggestions for how to fix them to institute proper accounting practices i removed the lines because of security concerns she said offering up the excuse i was told to by mr song indeed he said our competition would go to great lengths to secure such information yes of course i suppose the travel of the boss would be of interest to many grace couldnt allow herself to appear too hungry for more information but her heart pounded ever mindful of the electronic eyes and ears she considered how to end the conversation for now what were the dates of the trip or a particular charge that might help me locate it within the accounting a hotel and some meals in chongming golf you might think mr marquardt charges golf to the company card plenty but not golf he was with mr song so business neh no pleasure trips with mr song it is nothing to worry about i am certain grace said perhaps if you provide me with the dates she tried again i can take a look to make sure as to that it was midseptember i dont recall the exact day second weekend perhaps not during the workweeki remember as much even more curious given mr song was traveling with him the two together on a weekend i would never have expected that selena chuckled business only grace said simply to keep the conversation going while her mind sorted out what she was hearing danner had voicedated the gps bookmark for the mongolian delivery for september tenth shed had the call from lu hao left on her cell phone a week later the seventeenth marquardts chongming island trip had to be tied to lu haolu haos family lived on the island as did graces did this trip explain marquardts reluctance to show her the more detailed accounting even while cooperating with her other requests did it somehow account for lu haos kidnapping selena gauged the moment sipped tea and then marveled at the view briefly changing the subject mr marquardt does not like mr song she said i cannot imagine him traveling with mr song for pleasure a weekend together at the same hotel it must have been business what kind of business mr song conducts due diligence on our upcoming projects selena proudly showed off her indepth knowledge of the corporate big men easily explained then grace said cheerfully and the chongming island project is selenas eyes grew sharp i do not wish to pry grace said i simply want to do my best to keep you out of trouble with the us tax authority if you are not the one in charge of course i am in charge i handle all of mr marquardts itinerary all but his trip to chongming island this tripthis is the first it has appeared on his schedule but the billing statement has been redacted grace reminded so theres no proof of it anyway of course there is proof there is the original billing a duplicate can always be requested grace worked to appear surprised i can request the records the moment i am back into the office selena said i will send them to you the moment i have them what a clever girl you are grace said pm huangpu district the wet market was less than three blocks behind him when knox used a reflection off a storefront window to spot the dark green motorcycle at his back it started to rain lightly he walked quickly south and the mongolian followed dulwichs explanation about the taxi driver reporting him seemed plausible if unlikely more probable was that the mongolian had spotted him and grace on the scooter in his lilong and had then traced the scooters registration back to the employee at quintet from whom knox had rented the scooter he made a mental note to follow up with fay about that knox headed to the modern electronic city a funky threestory shopping complex at the intersection of xiangyang road and fuxing middle road inside was a congested rabbit warren of narrow aisles and shop stalls crammed with anything electronic as well as the ubiquitous clothes and kitchen supply stalls he was met with the roar of negotiation he climbed a moving escalator turned right at the top and slapped a hundredyuan note onto the scratched glass countertop he punched kenny g in the shoulder and in halting mandarin told the shop booth attendant he was being followed by a mongolian asshole who thought all waiguoren were fair game a common pickpocket no doubt to be called common was among the gravest insults kenny cursed knox a regular customer when in town stepped into shadow wedging himself into a corner the emergency exit he wanted was at his back two minutes and the mongolian had not entered knox saw across to a stall selling digital cameras on its counter stood an array of digital frameselectronic lcd screens that could display a slide show one of the frames scrolled through images of the great wall and the terracotta soldiers another advertised across the screen in a steady scroll join the revolution in digital storage holds over photos and songs grace had photographed a digital picture frame in lu haos apartment it had not occurred to her to collect it but it being digital implied internal memory the frames accepted images from usb connections lu hao had hidden his offthebook spreadsheet in plain sight knox was suddenly far less concerned with trapping and working over the mongolian for informationdulwichs current planas he was with returning to lu haos apartment to grab up the digital frame knox spotted dulwich wandering the lower level after allowing several minutes to pass dulwich rode the escalator upstairs and joined knox around the corner at kenny gs they quickly swapped jackets and hats dulwich now dressed in the scottevest jeans and ball cap knox in dulwichs pale gray canvas airman jacketcandy bar wrappers in both pockets given the rain the substitution might work forget working this guy knox said ive got a new lead to follow he explained how grace had seen a digital frame in lu haos apartment how theyd overlooked that as a possible digital hiding place all i need is to get this guy off my back the plan is still actionable dulwich said hes out there watching we hit him now he doesnt know shit knox said thats why hes following me he knows something we dont beijing that makes him an information asset just lead him away get him off me youve got his location on your phone we can take him anytime we want him there is no we i have a train to catch its now or never then never knox said adding not now this frame is more important your call stay tough he said he turned and headed for the escalator knox worked his way across the third floor to a stall selling rice cookers blenders and hot plates at the back of the stall was one of very few windows on this floora fixedpane window six inches wide and three feet high knox put his face to it through the blurry smudge knox spotted the mongolian across the intersection on the motorcycle oblivious to the rain they both watched dulwichnow wearing knoxs jacket and hatdodge his way through umbrellas to the curb where a taxi was waiting dulwich opened the back door and climbed in the taxi pulled out into slowly moving traffic knox celebrated their success the short distance to the taxi had made the substitution work perfectly the mongolian rose to kickstart his bike but held up on the curb watching as the taxi moved off why was he not following the idea had been to lure the mongolian away following dulwich the impostor so why give the taxi such a lead taxis all looked the samethey were difficult to follow knox peered down the street was there a second mongolian in place had they screwed this up panic flashed through him a heavy rain in shanghai snagging a taxi in this weather could take fifteen minutes and yet the taxi had been waiting at the curb improbable on a sunny day impossible on a day like this knox rapped his knuckles on the window as if he could stop the taxi already moving he fumbled with the iphone dropped it stooped to recover it dialed as he stood his face back to the window he saw the roofs of vehicles as traffic moved around dulwichs taxianother anomaly dulwichs taxi was clearly positioning itself toward the right lane yeah dulwich said his voice slightly altered by the evershifting signal embedded in the phones security abort knox said we were set up that taxi was waiting for me knox heard dulwich say hey pal pull over in english ting he hollered stop knox heard the breaking glass and twisting metal a millisecond before the same sounds found their way through the wireless phone network the taxi was tboned by an oldmodel gray toyota pushed clear through the intersection and slammed into a tree the drivers of both vehicles hurried out and staggered toward the curb now the mongolian headed up the sidewalk on his motorcycle he hopped off and reached through shattered glass as if trying to help knox knew better a massive throng of onlookers immediately surrounded the wreck everyone loved a good collision knox made it to the ground floor before his brain fully kicked in protocol dictated he walk calmly in the opposite direction of the wreck instead he ran to the wreck and challenged the crowd pushing and shoving and shouting curses in mandarin the mongolian was back on the bike he throttled up and swung left around the cornerout of sight the crowd owned knox he moved toward the wreck where a smear of blood stained the frame the whoopwhoop of a siren cried out an ambulance from nearby huashan hospital or the police either way knox couldnt stick around hed be questioned involved he pushed forward and tugged open the bent back door dulwich was unconscious his face bloodied knox hooked him beneath his arms and pulled him out as he did his hand found the hard drive he was searching for the iphone when an old nearly toothless woman slapped his hand and shouted thief knox called her an old cow but hurried off down the street before the crowd decided to make an example of him pm jing an district shanghai knox called rutherford risk in hong kong and then waited ten minutes for the companys head brian primer to return the call to the iphone as they talked he walked up changle road toward huashan hospital go ahead primer said with no introductions sargedavid dulwichis down traffic accident looked serious to critical you escaped unharmed wasnt in the cab whats the call i can have him out of there withintwo hours at the outside request a safe house with medical or an evac team i appreciate yourloyalty his identification is good it should hold no need to put the operation at risk not yet but the ransom money knox said yes im aware of the situation believe me you want me in guangzhou knox asked a long pause on the other end of the call as primer weighed his options perhaps knox had surprised him with his knowledge of the operation i need a few minutes an hour do you have the hospital approaching it now survey for arrival of interrogation team or anything suggesting compromise can do i wont let him be taken knox stated settle down primer said weve managed a lot worse than this it was intended for me the crash knowledge or speculation i spotted an adversary in the area both drivers fled the scene good to know then id keep my head down if i was you i want him out of there he paused i need the ransom money i said settle down this is what we do let us do it you handle your end the accounts a work in progress and is there progress it struck knox that this was primers focus guangzhou knox said he wondered if primer would authorize a quarter million dollars in cash to be picked up by a relative stranger that drop required dulwich well figure something out not to worry worry weve got two days less now i can get him on a plane a boat you handle the accounts the exchange there wont be an exchange without that money then extraction weve got dulwich covered sure you do knox thought wondering how expendable dulwich was to a man like brian primer keep this phone close the line went dead knox had reached the street corner looking left he saw the blockish white buildings of huashan hospital in the first few hours of care it would be difficult to get to dulwich but after that he kept vigil waiting for the arrival of police that never came an hour passed primer was right dulwichs accident was being treated as just another civilian casualty for how long remained the question pm changning district shanghai the wheels are coming off this thing he told grace having returned to the safe house apartment we have to get sarge out of there priority one the company will take care of mr dulwich the company will pretend he doesnt exist not mr primer believe it knox said in truth sarge probably doesnt exist hes probably an independent contractor like you like me now nowhere on their payroll despite his working there its an insidious arrangement set up exactly for moments like this like lu hao she said solemnly yes like that he agreed it all depends how good his documentation is there are ways you cannot possibly be considering removing him from hospital cant i we cannot care for him the way you described his condition dont get your panties in a knot excuse me he didnt translate it for her at some point theyll determine hes an american his teethdental workwill tell them that much x rays tattoos there are ways we must focus on lu hao and mr danner sarge was the source for the ransom money he relived their conversation in the wet market including the pickup in guangzhou a pickup that would not happen no sarge no ransom drop grace hesitated before speaking extraction right he said as if he looked over at her she needed sleep they both needed food okay one step at a time he said maybe the frame has lus files maybe the numbers tell us something we dont know he no longer believed it he suddenly saw them instead as a means to an end were looking at this wrong how so everyone seems to want lus accounts right it is possible she said yes so whoever possesses his files has power over the others power means leverage the numbers always reveal more than anyone suspects said the forensic accountant knox yawned youre missing the point which is she said angrily we need to raise money in order to pay the ransom i am aware of that predicament so now maybe we have something to sell knox said twenty minutes later he sat in a wheelchair outside a changing room in a boutique clothing store do you know the expression take no prisoners he asked as grace tried on clothes on the other side of a black silk curtain he could see her bare feet the petite woman who ran the store was in the front dealing with a customer i have heard it before tie up every loose end yes she said impatient with him thats why the change of clothes for both of us and my condition his hands on the wheelchairs wheels in case any of those cops are still watching the building the police she said we dont know who they are state security private muscle grace drew back the curtain she wore a gray business suit with black pinstripes and a sheer white blouse unbuttoned to show a good amount of skin she looked older she carried a tote over her shoulder just right knox thought slightly slutty she said how do you know those men who attacked us are not because of this woman you slept with they both knew graces carelessness had led yangs men to them in the alley but he kept his mouth shut how do you know lu hao isnt a blackmailer knox said that he wasnt blackmailing some beijing minister who then sicced the mongolians on him to clean up loose ends she studied him disappointment and disdain mixed with a hint of curiosity not lu hao she said knox rode in the wheelchair head down a blanket across his lap he wore a woven bamboo hat and a collarless blue cotton jacket typical of retirees his shoulders hunched his head drooped against a lightly falling rain wheelchairs were rarely seen on the streets of shanghai wherever shanghais elderly or handicapped were kept it wasnt on the busy sidewalks but knox fit the mold for those that were occasionally seenold and decrepit sad testimonies to the ravages of age guiding him was an upscale office worker a woman with a nice figure wearing high heels she pushed the chair with one hand and with the other clutched her purse over her head against the rain grace said pushing this is a lot more difficult than it looks knox barely heard her for the past several hours hed brooded over the loss of dulwich intent on rescuing him from the hospital he wished hed secured the mans iphone and its ability to track the mongolian now less than thirty yards from lu haos apartment building knox peered out from under the hat looking for signs of the police and surveillants theyd encountered their last time here they reached the entrance to lu haos apartment building and grace backed him through the door inside they acted quickly having talked through it for the sake of any cameras grace pushed knox and the wheelchair into the elevator she reached in and touched then she headed toward the stairs leaving him behind down the hall she found a door marked building supervisor in both english and mandarin she descended the stairs into a danksmelling but welllit basement the seconds ticked off in her head knoxs former assault of the mongolian in the stairway meant the police had questioned the supervisor residents and the real estate agent grace needed to take the supervisors attention off her face despite her attempts to disguise herself she paused on a landing bent down and tore her skirt she did the same to her blouse popping buttons and revealing her bra she wet her finger and smeared her eye shadow hyperventilating she approached the partially opened door that discharged cigarette smoke and the strains of a chinese television melodrama she knocked loudly and pushed inside without invitation help me she cried out in mandarin knoxs plan was designed to work no matter what the managers gender by exposing herself there wasnt a man alive who wouldnt jump to his feet to come to her aid and the implication of sexual assault would bring sympathy from any woman if a married coupleoften the case for building supervisorsgrace would have her work cut out for her it was a married couple early forties he with thinning hair and a bad complexion all skin and bones she in a blue jumpsuit her face oily her hair clumped and pulled back in a bun grace entered a small space every inch used efficiently a narrow futon two stools with an improvised table between them a small cathoderay color television flickered between neat stacks of clothing on a shelf to her right another smaller blackandwhite television sat next to two vcrs exactly as knox had described she plopped down on the empty bed without invitation heihe tried to she pleaded with her eyes to the woman please she saw the gravity register on the mans face unless he could quickly control the story he would be out on the street looking for work there had already been one assault in his building in the past few days another would be the end of him tea my dear the woman said shooting a look at her husband telling him to do something the kitchen was behind a maroon blanket with the clatter of pots and pans grace went to work she reached for the perplexed building superintendent to her relief he reached back for her pm seven swanslu haos apartment knox wearing the hat to screen his face from the security cameras used his knuckle to ring the doorbell avoiding fingerprints he kept watch on the glass peephole in the center of the door as it briefly flashed darkindicating its light source was blockedknox kicked open the door taking the doorjamb with it as it swung open he hit it again with a shoulder making sure to crush the man caught behind it he took two great strides into the center of the room dispatching a greasy punk who rose up from the couch and a second sturdier kid who was apparently slow off the mark neither was unconscious but theyd be wishing they were for the next several minutes knox pivoted on his right heel the man behind the door held up his hands in resignation he wasted no time getting into lu haos bedroom he grabbed the digital frame in and out of the apartment in less than a minute he rode the elevator down willing it to fall faster pm grace took the supervisors hands allowing him to help her up from the bed as she came to her feet she spun him and threw a chokehold silencing him until he went slack and unconsciousthe mans wife less than ten feet away grace eased him to the floor she hit eject on both vcrs and they discharged their cassettes they could not afford to be identified knox had been adamant about this she took these as well as other cartridges from a neatly ordered stack and filled the tote the wife came from around the curtain pulled by the sound as her face filled with horror grace slapped a hand over her mouth from behind he is fine you do not move no police this never happened knoxs plan counted on the couple not wanting another report against them the problem upstairs was drunken tenants the usual youngsters do you understand the woman first shook her head then nodded tears running onto graces hand i regret the intrusion grace said please accept my apologies she was back up the stairs in a matter of seconds pm knox wheeled himself out of the elevator counting down the seconds he would give her another minute no more then he would go after her grace arrived with her shirttails crossed and tucked in at the waist her torn skirt rotated so that the slit ran all the way up her leg revealing the thin black band of her bikini underwear she said nothing only nodded at him before pushing his chair out the doors knox reached over and deposited the digital picture frame and power supply into her bag two blocks later an empty wheelchair and a damp blanket collecting rain won the attention of the occasional pedestrian it looked sad as if it held a disheartening story fifteen minutes later it was gone an hour later it had already been resold twice thursday september day until the ransom am huashan hospital shanghai can you hear me the ruggedfaced man standing by the hospital bed cupped his hand shielding the patients eyes from the overhead tube lighting my name is kozlowski us consulate david dulwich looked around the hospital room without moving his head or neck which was held in a foam collar he wanted a way out there were slings and weights and pulleys attached to him he felt stretched you happen to be in luck kozlowski said a little too cheerily believe it or not you have formula one racing to thank for it ten years ago the city wanted to bring in formula one for a sanctified event but event organizers require the availability of topshelf western medicine before authorizing an event the result is this he said sweeping his hand umpteen millions of dollars spent on a stateoftheart fully staffed hospital ward for expats you my friend are the beneficiary from what im told youre lucky to be alive if youd been wearing a seatbelt maybe youd have walked away from it but then again show me one shanghai cab in which you can find the backseat seatbelts am i right he walked slowly around the bed in case youre wondering it was the pins in your ankle that stamped you made in usa though dont ask me how in a convincing australian accent dulwich said they got the work right mate but not my country of origin im aussie and its sanctioned event not sanctified kozlowski didnt look like a man who tolerated correction there was a time in my career when a guy like you would have confused me or maybe even fooled me completely kozlowski held up a small white card with boxes across the top each box contained a fingerprint the australian passport is good kozlowski continued very good too good maybe even authentic that tells me more than you want believe me kozlowski moved to the end of the bed hoping for eye contact dulwich wouldnt give him any both drivers walked one car was stolen the nephew of the registered cabbie drove the taxi on the outside it looks like a us citizen in the wrong place at the wrong time but the passport and iphone the likes of which my tech guys have never seen a plane ticket from hong kong booked an hour before takeoff yesterday morning a firstclass train ticket to guangzhou yesterday dulwich said trying to sit up no use the date its september thirtieth kozlowski pulled up a chair mean something to you i never like losing track of time by the end of the day ill have confirmed your identity im not going to get all law and order on you and tell you youre better off talking to me now than later we both know thats bullshit youre better off not talking to me at all youre better off walking the hell out of here when no ones looking but in your condition i dont think thats even possible maybe you could crawl honestly i probably dont want to know why youre here you smack of a ton of paperwork just waiting to happen dulwich winced painfully again as he tried to sit up there are plenty of individuals like you in this city dont think youre all that special trouble is americans like you are my responsibility im supposed to keep your nose clean or at least mop up the snot after its spilled maybe youre here stealing somebody elses secrets keeping track of his sins looking for a missing person or trying to lead a revolution i dont care i need you gone there is only one way you can gain my favor kozlowski withdrew and unfolded some photocopies he held the first in front of dulwichs face no dulwich croaked out seeing a photo of lu hao strike one him kozlowski said producing a second photo from under the first clete danner dulwich swallowed dryly no the medication belied his intentions kozlowski noted the twitch but said strike two he proffered the third of three a security photo of a chinese man and dulwich said he looks nasty mate you think youre going to outsmart the chinese kozlowski asked theyre all over this all over what really dulwich had the twitch under control giving away nothing he was thinking the iron hand the missing cameraman kozlowski could easily be part of that investigation could easily believe dulwich was involved in that investigation youd better have some serious support in play friend because from what the doctors tell me youre not going anywhere soon youre a sitting duck herethats an american expression but i think youll figure it out if you want helpprotection maybe a transfer thats all there for the asking if theres a bone in your body that isnt broken they havent found it he waited nothing seriously kozlowski took a deep breath and stepped back enjoy chinese prison i hope you like rice am changning district knox and grace spent the night working in the safe house grace reviewed bertholds financials with special attention given to marquardts travel expensing while security video of lu haos apartment building ran in the background if the mongolians had a prior relationship with lu maybe theyd be seen or if the kidnappers had returned for lu haos medication and laptop perhaps they could be identified knox confounded himself attempting to find any hidden files in the memory of lu haos digital frame a process well above his pay grade he determined that the frames memory was partitioned into two virtual driveslike two separate file cabinets hed been able to retrieve the images from one of the virtual drives but as far as he could tell the other was blocked by a password if anythings on this frame other than the photos were going to need an expert knox finally confessed grace said nothing did you hear me i heard you he glanced up at the fastforwarding security footage they shared this task anything he asked she had the two volumes of endless spreadsheet pages in front of her shed placed bookmarks of torn napkin throughout both making the printouts look feathered i put selena at risk she said not looking up you had no idea she was going to guilttrip off her boss going to some island and start blabbing about it i have made her an unknowing accomplice sometimes you sound so coldhearted he said not today and nearly all the time you sound pigheaded i think we could both use some sleep he said i need lu haos records i think weve established that grace looked up at him her face lined with fatigue the berthold groups accountants consolidated the payments to lu haos consulting firm in the gageneral accounting trying i suppose to make the payments appear like business as usual when they know otherwise the problem with that practice is that when those payments change substantially as is the case recently it is a red flag she showed knox the pages of numbers he pretended to follow along in this case an additional two hundred thousand us was paid out to lu haos consulting firm the timing is significant john first the added two hundred thousand she switched volumes and drew her finger down a column then less than a week later marquardts redacted trip to chongming island back to the original ledger then a second overpayment of two hundred thousand us the same day lu hao went missing knox whistled four hundred grand which is why they didnt want you getting hold of their books it took you only a matter of hours to connect it there are a hundred ways to hide such things they are either arrogant or ignorant both are crimes when it comes to accounting so they made a couple balloon payments probably to the mongolian thanks to sarge we know the mongolian has connections to beijing so the payments went north but that doesnt get us any closer to extraction to finding them i mean this is all well and goodand fascinating he mocked but weve already established the mongolian is as interested in finding lu hao as we are so hes adistraction selena claimed that marquardt and preston song would never travel together unless for due diligence on a future project grace lowered her voice connect that to beijing where the government decides all the biggest construction projects lu hao wasnt paying off the mongolian to aid the xuan tower he was paying for information on a new government project such projects can be worth billions speculation a logical deduction based on research and information we must act so lu hao makes the second payoff why does the mongolian give a damn about him after that protect the beijing superior grace said if lu hao talks heads roll executions of corrupt officials were not uncommon in china it had been a while since the last interesting knox said but again it doesnt get us any closer to extraction listen she said marquardt hired us to get lu hao out but he could be as panicked as the beijing contact if the berthold group is seen to be involved in influencing a government official they he could be imprisoned the australians were given twelve years she was referring to a recent trial that had made international headlines maybe they could negotiate their way out of criminal charges on the xuan payments but not something of this size tied directly to beijing knox wasnt going to repeat himself perhaps lu haos records confirm this not to be rude but who cares knox said honestly i dont care whos paying whom at this point i want an address i want extraction she was silent for some time lu haos records are our only source of possible information knox closed his eyes and tried to work it out the money trail was apparently fascinating to an accountant but hed grown tired of it the big payments to the mongolians and on to beijing were clearly significant yang cheng could be behind the kidnappings he said it was his men in the alley behind quintet he knew about your hire at berthold so he obviously has an insider there he wanted you to abandon marquardt make things more difficult for marquardt maybe we can trade for the hostages if yang had lu hao he would have lu haos information yang is not the kidnapper you know what who gives a shit whats important to us is that with sarge down theres no ransom money yes we wont want to trade the accounts until we know what were giving away again i do not follow lus accounts may reveal who has the most to fear who has the most to lose therefore who will pay the most john are you talking to me the accounts are the prizeit explains all the attention on lus apartment the attack on us you and i want the same thing if for different reasons she said lu haos books you sound like a marriage counselor do not get your hopes up ha regardless he said once we have lus books we can start dealing yang cheng the mongolians maybe marquardt as well you want to sell the information for cash to raise money needed to pay the ransom she said i thought you said you werent following he paused amy knows this guyive met him a couple of times sells counterfeit video games a computer brainiac he can help us so call this person she said reluctantly selena owes me a copy of marquardts redacted credit card statement i will ask her again this may help as well you dont have to sound so excited about amy helping us knox said this has nothing to do with you it is chinese you would not understand face i understand face westerners intellectualize face chinese live it it is very different pm knox did not like the idea of putting them all in the same room togetherpigs for the slaughterbut saw little choice carrying a black backpack containing lu haos digital photo frame he checked the street for surveillants at every opportunity changed his look every few blocks with baseball caps and sunglasses he arrived early at the rendezvous a dismallooking beauty salon with a white pink and blue barber pole outside walked past and continued for another block crossed through traffic cut back at the next light and approached the salon for a second time he paused by a curbside dice game being played on an inverted cardboard box in the shade of a plane tree cigarettes dangled from wet lips spitting tobacco bits and sipping cold tea rheumyeyed men competed fiercely amy arrived at the salon first taking no security precautions whatsoever grace followed also performing a walkby before entering selena had emailed marquardts electronic amex statement knox had left her studying it unsure if shed pry herself away for this meeting glad she had he awaited a city bus to screen himself from the opposing sidewalk and as the bus passed slipped into the salon amy occupied the third of three chairs to the right her hair foaming her attendant shooting a stream of water from a squirt bottle onto her head while working up the suds despite the wet application it was referred to as a dry shampoo grace in the middle chair was being prepared knox greeted the owner a fit man in his early forties with a cataract film covering his left eye the man checked with amy in the mirror amy nodded you wait few minutes please the man said in passable english he pointed waiting area in back past curtain knox and grace exchanged a meaningful look he wondered if she too had spotted the mongolian following amy knox wondered how the mongolian had possibly made the connection to amythe cocktail party quintet the curtain was a simpsons bedsheet thumbtacked into the doorjamb beyond which was a tiny sink and stool knox was forced to turn sideways to slip past the sink and into a narrow hallway that led to a back door he inspected the door checking the lock the door opened on to a sublane where laundry was in bloom clear both directions he turned homer and marge laughed at him in faded glory the tiny storage rooms shelves were crowded with hand towels hair product a rice cooker a cutting board and a plastic pail of green vegetables near the far wall half a wooden door on rusting file cabinets served as a desk at the desk his back to knox sat a twentysomething chinese boy with a lousy haircut if he stabbed the laptops keys any harder he was going to break it he spun to face knox a poor attempt at facial hair he was chewing purple gum he spoke english ready when you are professor tom knox said introducing himself randy as if amy came through wearing a towel on her shoulders and her hair spiked punk rock by shampoo you two make introductions she said yes knox said grace entered next crowding the space her eyes tightened dancing between amy and knox lets have a look randy said it sounded rehearsed the kind of guy to practice lines in front of a mirror knox provided him the digital frame amy had made all the arrangements she carried the anxious concern of a worried hostess grace seemed more interested in amy than the laptop it is crowded here we will give you room knox stayed he wasnt leaving a stranger in possession of the frame and its possible contents randy connected the frame to the laptop by wire and began typing ten minutes passed feeling like thirty memory is partitioned he said one side encrypted you care about frame only its contents knox said randy pried the frame open with a screwdriver startling knox he spoke as he continued disassembling the device common mistake is try to break encryption he exposed a small circuit board using a magnifying loupe he studied the board as his hand blindly searched the desktop for the screwdriver but thats what we want knox said we want the data from the encrypted partition i understand randy said breaking such code can take days weeks we dont have days or weeks no but we have this he said holding up the screwdriver his attention still trained onto the loupe and the circuit board the cmos battery is soldered he said he sat up and addressed knox just like laptop the board uses small watch battery to hold password dead battery no password sometimes battery is soldered to keep it from separating that is case here screwdriver too big need paperclip how about a bobby pin the man looked at him confused bobby hair clip were in the right place for hair clips excellent minutes later randy had used a metal bobby pin to short the board and drain the small batterys charge the full directory of the partitioned side of the frames memory now appeared on his connected laptop the women rejoined knox contents knox asked a dotxls file microsoft excel also some small audio files photos i will download for you he handed knox a thumb drive give us a minute please knox said eyeing amy and indicating for randy to leave the room the upper back massage is most pleasant amy said escorting randy out of the small room only takes ten minutes you will try now grace opened the spreadsheet five minutes passed knox standing behind her impatient anxious the spreadsheet notes were all in chinese characters he could read some but not all of them when she spoke she spoke english it is everything she said lu hao used full names phone numbers he recorded all payments very much money john more than is accounted for by the berthold group of course over past six months nine million yuan over a million us with this kind of inside information she continued any construction company would be ensured of success on the other hand if the government got hold of this list they would jail every one of them the inherent value of this is astronomical how many contacts how many getting payments the same no new locations the mongolians no sign of the most recent payments knox mulled this over seriously she nodded the four hundred thousand is unaccounted for why so much detail how stupid could he be lu hao is not stupid ambitious overconfident yes but not stupid it is doubtful keeping records was his idea she said someone must have required it but then whys it incomplete she shrugged knox attempted to clarify youre saying berthold wanted this accounting it is far too much money to entrust without some form of accountability a person could embezzle a small fortune do you think thats what happened lu hao put his finger in the pie that would explain kidnapping and holding the man not lu hao she said who would he have reported to marquardt certainly not this would put him at a direct risk of prosecution someone marquardt trusts preston song i think maybe my immediate boss gail bunchkin is also possible but i think song his being chinese helps the company if it is investigatedkeeps the charges off a foreign executive which would look very bad it is most likely marquardt would have received only a verbal report on anything to do with lu haos activities okay he said compartmentalizing so as soon as we turn this over the bribes will likely begin again without a doubt this will allow the xuan tower project to get back on schedule sensing a change in her he said what is it grace as we have discussed if the berthold group is working against us then the moment they have lu haos accounts they no longer need lu hao with all the attention being paid to him it might be more convenient if he disappeared the police will want to speak to lu hao maybe others in the government yes knox said ive been thinking the same thing and now with sarge out of the equation maybe theres no ransom money anyway i remind you of marquardts trip to chongming island again i suggest this trip had nothing to do with the xuan tower yet possibly everything to do with lu haos disappearance explain my mother claims lu hao was on chongming island on the sixteenth for a fourday fete the seventeenth he left me the voice mail youre beating yourself up over that call he was on chongming island on the seventeenth the bribes she said pointing to the laptop are for favors inspectors suppliers there is a banker on here knox nodded he knew the participantsup close and personalfrom his earlier visits i suggest she said the two payments of two hundred thousand us had something to do with chongming island my home lu haos home i believe the payments were made through an intermediarythe mongolians lu haos phone call to mehe was frantic maybe he got stupid and pushed too hard got himself into trouble my point is that he had seen something my mother confirmed he was on chongming island the day he phoned me only days behind mr marquardts trip knox liked this as a possible motive for the mans kidnapping and said so that has teeth i have the name of the driver marquardt hired on chongming island she said marquardts credit card statement she supplied we can follow his trail we need to determine the purpose of this trip of his perhaps it leads to lu hao and mr danner its beyond our purview he cautioned you talk about the power this accounting holds she said and of course you are right this was her first such concessionthat possession of the information more than even the information itself gave them leverage with which to negotiate but knowledge of whatever secret exists whatever secret they wanted hidden would give us far more understanding and possible leverage marquardt is not the enemy hes who hired us did he play it close to the vest of course but we can use this trip of his without knowing the exact details its called finesse once i deliver the accounts she said there may be no lu hao no danner finesse that what if marquardtsberthold groupsonly interest in working through rutherford risk is to find out how much if any of this malfeasance can be discovered by thirdparty investigators knox had already considered this same ideathat he and grace were being used as proxy investigators expendable investigators sarge wouldnt do that to me he said marquardt wouldnt do that to rutherford risk it doesnt make sense please john we must find out how marquardts visit to chongming island fits into this i believe this is the key to the kidnapping no time he said the accounts give us all the leverage we need a bird in the hand we go with what we have were going to dangle the accounts i promise that neither lu hao nor danner will suffer for it to suffer one must be alive she reminded we need randy to make two copies he said encrypted copies on thumb drives you will see to that when hes finished amy and randy will leave separately randy by the back amy out front we must make it abundantly clear to them that they need to leave the city immediately no returning to work or their apartments they must go now the mongolian she said she too had spotted the surveillance yes ill handle him but thats why they must leave now understood five minutes later with everyone in place and briefed knox left by the back door taking the sublane behind the shop to a dead end where he climbed a wall and up into a tangle of bamboo scaffolding he moved through a work crew repairing a tile roof to where he had a view of the street including the mongolian who hadnt moved from his post knox searched the street carefully for others eventually spotting a second mongolian at some distance the closest mongolian carried a policemans arrogance almost daring his mark not to spot him the intimidation factor had the mongolian relocated over the course of the past hour knox might have missed him so why make knoxs job so easy what could the man hope to win knox texted amy and a minute later she left the salons front door walking confidently neither mongolian moved knox sent a second text and grace left screening herself with an umbrella surprising him she stood at the curb attempting to hail a taxi scarce because of the light rain they had agreed to avoid taxis following the dulwich setup but as it turned out the ruse was simply to give the mongolian a good long look at her as she turned and hurried toward a bus stop the mongolian slipped onto his motorcycle knox sent a third and final text this time to randys mobile go pm for melschoi staying with a bus was childs play the simplicity of the exercise lulled him into complacencyit was like trying to spot an aircraft carrier amid the barges on the yangtze river the flow of bikes and scooters maintained its usual controlled chaos melschois attention remained divided between the bus and his rearview mirror when a helmeted rider closed from behind him melschoi slowed testing had this man been watching the hair salon as well the bus gained pulling away in the flow of vehicles to his left the helmet behind him kept comingit did not slow with him as a surveillant would melschoi jockeyed for position in order to stay with the bus knowing the move would also give him a better view of the approaching helmet he checked his outside mirror nothing the rider must have turned or pulled over he happened to glance over to his inside mirror too late the helmeted rider had jumped the sidewalk to pass the slow mass of bikes the rider reentered the bike lane now only feet from melschoi who instinctively swerved right toward the curb knocking some bikes out of his way the resulting crash worked against himhe gave the scooter a virtually empty space to navigate impressively the scooter rider leaned heavily to his right and came alongside of melschoi avoiding any collision but melschoi had the advantage a slight nudge from him and the scooter would be thrown into the traffic only then did he catch sight of the construction barricade blocking the bike lane the rider had distracted him and had boxed him in the bike lane was narrowing and being forced into the traffic that splitsecond of realization cost him the rider raised his leg like a dog pissing on a hydrant and kicked out melschoi attempted to block the effort but lost control as his front wheel tangled with a bike he went down hard wheels forward his front rim caught the curb catapulting him and the bike airborne the last thing he saw was a plywood barricade pm hongqiao district shanghai amy xue climbed the concrete back stairs of the international pearl city market navigating past the litter abandoned by lunchtime employees knox be damned there was no way she could leave the city without some money she cursed the trouble knox brought her though did not dismiss his warning entirely shed entered through the back of the mall her jewelry store was one of only two that had stair access she surprised lishu and mihho two of her best stringers at work knotting customdesigned necklaces unaccustomed to their boss using the back stairway they sat up amy greeted them and headed directly to the safe her back to them amy said has anyone asked after me mihho answered some regular customers of course strangers no if they should you have not seen me understand the safe opened she slipped off a necklace and used the two keys hanging from it to open an inner door yes both girls answered you will text me immediately if you see anyone suspicious or asking after me is that clear yes certainly mihho answered for them both is everything okay does it look like everything is okay i am not kidding around so sorry neither girl had ever seen their boss in such a fit lishu caught a glimpse of the stacks of yuan amy transferred into her purseforty thousand or more a fortune store hours as normal amy instructed relocking the safe and then closing and securing its outer door if anyone asks i am with a client appraising an estate collection you do not know the location you will offer to call me only if necessary and then report that you were unable to reach me i am gone for the national day holiday very well tell the others exactly as ive told you of course and no wagging tongues she directed this at lishu this is not a game secondcousins daughter lips sealed pure mind pure heart your rumormongering could do me great harm lishu blushed embarrassed to be so easily read yes auntie i promise lock this door behind me why was it not locked what kind of fools leave this door unlocked lock it and leave it locked according to the sign it was never to be locked neither woman said a thing amy slipped out the back of the shop and into the stairway hearing the lock turn behind her she began her descent her senses on immediate alert an offensive cologne she hadnt noticed before now permeated the air superstitious by nature and on edge because of knox she hurried down damn the maintenance men for allowing so many lights to be burned out had it been so dark a moment ago she wondered rapid footfalls came from behind her she arrived at the next stairway landing and encountered a man standing there she gasped involuntarily the man grabbed her wrist spun her and slapped his hand over her mouth she tried to call out but only groaned the shop door is shut and locked she thought no one will hear me she reared back to hit him but was no match he lifted her off her feet like a rag doll and carried her down the stairs paralyzed with fright she fought to keep from passing out it felt like swimming for the surface when deeply underwater her feet bounced down the steps another man caught her legs they arrived at the ground level to a set of doors she kicked free caught the door as it came open and smacked it into the forehead of the man at her feet he dropped her the one behind her let go of her right arm she elbowed this man in the throat and fell to the stairs as he dropped her completely the door to the outside thumped shut she scrambled to her feet and ran into the building a grid of aisles and shop stalls amy knocked shoppers aside trying to distance herself from her pursuers she had the advantage of familiarity she knew these shops and their keepers the two coming behind her split up taking parallel aisles they were attempting to box her in she hurried dropped to her hands and knees and crawled into a clothing stall to her left cousin she called out moving for the back wall muggers thieves you must help me the door the door the woman shopkeeper did not hesitate she raced to the back wall slid some dresses aside and popped open the hidden door to the storage room most shops had such hidden doors not a word amy said still crawling the door clicked shut behind her pm at the intersection of aisles the two men met with a silent exchangetheyd lost her the leader waved his partner forward and together they began a search stall by stall they tipped over racks pulled down shelves and cursed at the top of their lungs pm amy heard the shopkeeper cry out followed by the sound of destruction a smack silenced the woman then a rake of hangers the door to the hidden room broke open amy struck the first man with the tine of a metal hanger punching a hole in his chest he screamed and jumped for her but she ducked and avoided him smacking the second man she ran her nails down his neck and let go squeezing past and out into the shop she ran just as she reached the first intersection of aisles she was tackled from behind her arm was twisted behind her and she found herself being carried out the back at the moment she was struck by the fresh air there came a sound like a melon hitting the kitchen floor warmth speckled her face blood the men dropped her one lay on the concrete out cold and bleeding a monster with half his face scraped offa mongolian or northernerbrutalized the second man before she fully came to her feet someone grabbed her from behind and dragged her into a van she was thrown inside and her abductor followed in behind her the door slid shut the tires squealed a flurry of shanghainese cursing the driver said something to the man hovering over her about going back for him more cursing a rag was stuffed down her throat followed by duct tape across her face she blacked out pm melschoi dragged the man deeper down the alley already softening him up by kneeing him repeatedly in the chest the man bounced away from him like a puppet who do you work for melschoi asked in passable mandarin feng qi yang chengs man melschoi said holding him tightly dui melschoi contemplated the angles like a mathematician where have they taken her these men the road rash on his face had not had time to scab leaving him looking like hed made out with a cheese grater the mans eyes rolled back in his head melschoi was losing him melschoi lifted him off the ground and kneed him in the groin jolting him awake where melschoi said his hand now clenching the mans throat the man volunteered an address on moganshan road a former warehouse district that had been partially gentrified into art galleries melschoi knew the area he leaned in close to the man you work for me now we always have eye on you you try to run or doublecross me and i will cut off your manhood melschoi took the mans mobile phone onehanded and dialed in his own number in order to save it into the mans phone whatever you hear you will pass along to me immediately melschoi said if i do not hear from you regularly you will hear from me he held up the mans wallet so hed be sure to remember melschoi possessed it he let him fall if you try to warn your associates i come back for you pm amy xue vaguely recalled swallowing something bitter her limbs were numb she tried to speak but her words were slurred she took a moment to place herself in her surroundings two men one bruised and beaten her shirt hung open exposing her breasts and belly she could see she wasnt wearing pants but couldnt feel anything her wrists were held to a bamboo pole with plastic ties the pole tied between pipes a mans low voice spoke mandarin close to her ear the american and the chinese woman names mobile numbers and where to find them she perceived a need to lie but surprised herself john knox she answered the woman is called grace we have your phone which are their numbers he held her mobile phone up in front of her but she couldnt focus the room was swirling and fuzzy she felt physically numb and mentally emptyas if all resistance had been bled out of her her tongue had a mind of its own the top number she said finally seeing the screen though dimly is his she considered herself such an expert liarperhaps the best bargainer in all the pearl market she didnt know this woman she heard speaking the lighting changed as if a door had come open a gray hue spread along the ceiling whatever it was it caused the man in front of her to turn around for which she was extremely grateful do something she willed her body but it was gone all sensation gone melschoi recognized the minivan from the abduction at the pearl market amateurs it was parked in a muddy lot on the back side of a storage building that according to the sign was leased to yang construction idiots melschoi climbed atop the van and had a look inside no guns three men without so much as a knife between them he guessed theyd stripped the woman naked which offended melschoi he thought back to the rape of his dead brothers wife he gained a newfound energy he kicked in the door shouted police and headed straight for the one whom hed seen was in charge the announcement bought him enough time to cross the space without being attacked their expressions changed as melschois torn face caught the lights two of them had just met him an hour earlier he grabbed an electric drill off the wall and swung it by its cord like a chain mace one of the men made for the door the drill clubbed him at the base of the neck and he fell next he said in mandarin moving inexorably toward a man who hoisted an office chair melschoi used the flying drill to break his ribs and then club the side of his head the third produced a knife melschoi stepped onto the fallen mans back using him like a doormat he swung the drill in a figure eight in front of him be certain she is worth it he said his opponent circled to his right tell your employer he should leave this to others it is a cemetery for those who stay he motioned an invitation toward the open door the man backed out of the warehouse slowly moments later the van started and raced away melschoi tied up the fallen pair with electric cords he faced her having noted the spilled pills and gatorade on the desk mandarin did not come naturally when his adrenaline flowed i can leave you here he said maybe they return maybe someone else comes along we both know what they will do with you he ran his eyes over her she stared into space unblinking i know you can hear me it must be agony not to be able to move so where do i find the foreigner he started the drill swinging again i do not know she said he trusted her answers knowing the effects of rohypnol the hair salon he said computer files what kind of files he asked spreadsheet the foreigner has the spreadsheet he said she stared off into space he was losing her his name he stepped closer knowing she could hear he raised his voice his name the words reverberated in the space john not john not he could see the light go out he closed her eyelids for her touched her carotid artery and felt a weak pulse he picked up her discarded pants and purse from which a pile of money spilled he took the purse cut her down and carried her like a sack over his shoulder to his bike he drove her up the road to a bus stop and sat her down on a bench covering her lap with her pants and buttoning her shirt he patted her on the cheek halftempted to thank her pm hongqiao district shanghai this had better be good allan marquardt declared glaring at grace as she stood at his front door elegant gardens a gated expatriate compound in the hongqiao district was home to several dozen threestory mcmansions on small manicured lawns grace had announced herself at the compounds main gate forced to wait to see if marquardt would admit her now his eyes irreverently inspected her my apologies mr marquardt she said it is urgent reluctantly he showed her inside a television played somewhere within a thin and beautiful middleaged woman in white linen pants and an aquamarine silk top approached marquardt introduced his wife lois he introduced grace as an employee tea please darling marquardt said he led grace into a sitting room filled with crowded bookshelves and asian art the yinyang love seat he offered was more than two hundred years old he sat in a leather chair facing her from across an indian elephantsaddle coffee table grace said may i talk freely yes the house is secure my associate and i she said avoiding naming knox have located and obtained lu haos accounting of the incentives marquardt seemed to float for a moment excellent she opened her hand revealing a usb thumb drive then closed her hand trapping it inside i will turn it over to you along with the encryption code necessary to read the files as soon as you explain the reason for your trip to chongming island this had not been part of knoxs plan marquardts composure flagged i beg your pardon chongming island iknow the place you went there with preston song i need to know why it has become critical to our saving the hostages i remind you that you are indirectly my employee if youd like me to call brian id be happy to extortion is not your best option i looked into the reasons for the two hundred thousand dollar payments at our lunch i was stonewalled you and mr song visited chongming island after the first payment a payment mr lu never accounted for in the xuan tower incentives why not a second such payment preceded mr lus kidnapping by a matter of hours according to your own records that also needs explaining lois marquardt arrived with the tea she fixed two cups and turned to leave my associate and i have been followed grace said appealing to the mans wife who turned to listen my apartment is under video surveillance i cannot return there i have been followed repeatedly from work i can no longer risk going there anywhere for that matter one of my associates has been hospitalized in serious condition presumably much of this relates to the files on this thumb drive and i believe your trip to chongming island with preston song allan marquardt eyed his wife clearly wanting her gone ive got it dear thank you for the tea if you need anything she said to grace give a holler she left i dont see how our trip could possibly be connected to the kidnapping then you admit it how did you find out it is not important it is to me more important than you can possibly imagine you need not know the details part of my job is to protect you she said i cant tell you a thing about it youve wasted a trip over here im afraid thats unacceptable ms chu we are on the same side what youre asking is impossible if i could i would but i cannot he paused the thumb drive please we have lost the ransom due to a complicationour associate being hospitalized your trip to chongming islandwhatever took you there is relevant to the kidnapping i assure you not possible and yes brian updated me on the ransom its a bum deal first you will explain chongming island grace said levelly then you will raise as much us cash as possible before tomorrow morning at nine am the rest we will raise from other parties interested in the drives contents marquardt coughed the content of that drive is my property you will most certainly not be auctioning it off i will detain you here if necessary youve overstepped your bounds young lady marquardt produced a blackberry from a waist clip and worked it onehanded i would not do that sir grace said your phone is being monitored by the chinese count on it you do not want them knowing we have located lus accounts grace paused they will descend upon us like locusts then turn it over marquardt said his thumb hovering over the green key i cannot do this youre out of your depth ms chu you dont want to threaten me ill have you detained unlikely she said ive spoken to brian and were trying to raise as much cash as possible the proofoflife comes at the storefront on nanjing road you will be there with the money but it looks as if itll fall short of fifty thousand threatening me does not help your cause less than fifty thousand unacceptable they are expecting five times that brian believes they might accept one hundred we wont know until you deliver it too risky this is a game of risks im told the thumb drive please grace caught a glimpse of the phone the blackberry was already connected more tea he asked shed barely touched her cup he wanted her to stay the call had been to security the compounds team his own did it matter grace stood highest bidder wins the drive and its contents do not do this marquardt said calmly you will be crushed security would post men at the front and back doors providing there were at least two men which she doubted more like a single bodyguard with contact to the compounds team if indeed a single bodyguard he would pull back to a position with a view of both doors that or hed enter the house save your career while you still can he opened his palm to her she hurried from the room and nearly plowed over lois marquardt whod been in the hall within eavesdropping range lois and graces eyes met lois glanced at the front door and she shook her head grace scanned the stairs lois nodded and said softly fire ropes in the window seats grace bounded upstairs there was a child asleep in the first room she tried she moved on to the end of the hallwaythe master suite spotted the window seat and pulling off its cushion opened it a chain ladder was bolted to the wall the window faced the access lane and the drive men watching the front and back doors would not see her here she fed the ladder through the window and followed it outside it danced unpredictably it took all her strength and balance to descend without whipping it against the house and revealing her position she dropped into the landscaping and ducked keeping low plotting her escape the support team would arrive momentarily if she werent out of the compound by then they would have her the compound was essentially a twentyacre culdesac with a gated single entrance surrounded by a twelvefoot rock wall topped with broken glass set in concrete designed to keep people out it also kept them in she crept through shadow in the direction away from the gated entrance reaching the end of marquardts house no security man in sight it was a oneman show until support arrived and the bodyguard had chosen the front doorand the compounds entrance sideto guard grace took off at a run housetohouse keeping in shadow whenever possible she had taken the bus to come here now she was on foot there was no way she would make it past the gate without closequarter combat the gate guards were untrained in anything but raising their hands and checking documents if there were just two she could take them but if theyd summoned their patrolsanother two or three keeping watch within the compoundshed be outnumbered she spotted a bicycle dumped in a driveway carried it to the access road and climbed on she circled around the western side of the compoundthe booth guards would be expecting her from the east it might buy her an extra few seconds porch lights from houses lighted the lane only in patches she held the bike to the far curb beneath towering bamboo and therefore mostly in shadow street noise intensified as she approached the gate and the only break in the high wall lights blazed around the small guardhouse where she now spotted two uniformed men they spotted her one stepped in front of the redandwhite striped pole arm blocking the vehicle entrance he raised his hand for her to stop the other man kept to just outside the guardhouse a gap in the entrance for pedestriansnannies and ayisblocking this as well grace slowed wishing to appear cooperative she swung a leg off but remained balanced on the left pedal the bike coasting a matter of yards from the guard at the pole she hopped off and launched the bike into him running for the surprised booth guard he too comically raised his hand for her to stop she broke his left knee drove her own knee into his nose as he wrenched forward he went down hard the guard whod gone down with the bike was up and running he caught sight of his buddy reeling and when grace turned to face him stopped stiffly unsure how to proceed she juked a hard step toward him and he flinched backward she knew she had him i am not worth it she said speaking shanghainese jilted mistress nothing more i will put your nut sack in your intestines if you come after me she turned but did not run the guard took several steps toward her but as she shot him a look he stopped again his friend groaned he turned to help him grace lowered her head and fought to contain her adrenaline wanting so badly to run but knowing it would only give her away a dark blue van slowed to turn into the compoundtwo chinese in the front the right age and look for corporate security she waited for the van to turn into the gate area and then took off at a run in the distance a bus approached the bus stop pm huangpu district shanghai in the glow of dimmed ceiling lights yang cheng paced past an oil painting by eddie lim a violent eruption of red white and black behind him was the panoramic view of the huangpu river and the colorful neon from the tourist ferries plying its waters rain pelted the window i am most disappointed in you yang cheng brimming with anger said to feng i understand do you know where i was just now a dinner with two investors from brussels they have agreed in principle to supply me up to one billion euros in capital for the new city construction one small problem i have not yet won the bid reason i have not yet won the bid i have not submitted bid reason i have not submitted bid tragic lu remains in captivity of kidnappers in possession of magic number pearl lady was connection we needed and nowwhere is pearl lady i am to blame said feng still suffering from the pain of the bruises inflicted by the mongolian inexcusable i offer my resignation i will not let you off so easily yang cheng continued pacing one man a northerner mongolian perhaps scum inbreds of course pearl lady feng said nothing at first we must assume the mongol has her in our favor she will be of no help to him for another twelve hours perhaps longer not an entire failure then feng awaited more admonishment when it wasnt forthcoming he dared to say if i may suggest no you may not yang spun his wedding ring go ahead he said feng considered his words carefully if the ransom exchange takes place if tragic lu is recovered alive then likely the new city bid numberthe magic numberif in fact lu hao has it as we suspect is in marquardts possession this is nothing i do not know but should the ransom delivery fail we are given additional time to find lu hao before the others a mans ears are never shut yang said looking at feng for the first time in the past twenty minutes we have the video and audio recordings of chu youya in her apartment she clearly received corporate books of a suspect nature from a woman professing to be marquardts assistant this alone could get her fired perhaps even investigated by banking authorities yang nodded beginning to follow a smile struggled onto his otherwise anguished face yes the videos could be delivered anonymously of course feng said i also have photographs of chu youya taking lunch with the waiguoren papers exchanged here as well and we have waitress as witness the waiguoren might find himself sought for questioning as well making the ransom exchange impossible yang nodded you are shit for brains but your shit smells sweet at this moment i mentioned such tactics earlier yang said always needing to claim authorship of course you did i am only reminding you of your worthy recommendation it was stupid of me not to recognize its brilliance at the time the authorities will not take kindly to such thirdparty surveillance the recordings must not be traceable back to us not ever it will be handled like eggshells all measure of secrecy and security you will handle this yourself a career death sentence for feng should it fail hed be a department store rentacop if he failed i am honored to be valued with your trust he lied yangs mobile phone rang where hed left it on his desk he checked the caller id it was his secretary katherine late for her to be calling perhaps shed reconsidered his most recent advances he waved feng out of his office dismissively in the distance the flashing lights of a jet descended into the pudong airportanother plane full of waiguoren no doubt the poison continued they spoke in shanghainese yes i have had a call from the woman chu youya she wishes to meet with you yang thought it had to be some kind of disturbing joke he and feng having just spoken of her sir youve spoken to her directly yes tonight if possible i informed her i thought you available he found his voice my office fifteen minutes he checked the clock can you arrange it yes of course i will want you here at your desk face my pleasure she said make it thirty minutes he said giving katherine added time to reach the office building bring her up the private elevator he tossed a crumb her way no one used the private elevator but him she said brightly thirty minutes youve done well another crumb if he played his cards right he might even win her services by the end of the night as well he called feng back into his office you will have video or audio set up in this office in the next thirty minutes but its feng caught himself glancing at his watch his mind reeling right away he said friday october the exchange am the bund an unexpected pleasure yang cheng said addressing grace in shanghainese she reached into her purse and came out with the thumb drive lu haos accounts she said in mandarin finding shanghainese too coarse and rapid for business negotiations yangs eyes flared slightly otherwise he was a picture of executive comportment interested but not overly excited am i supposed to know what youre talking about perhaps not she said returning the drive to her purse and since you do not and might be considering other means to explore the topic let me just say the drives contents are encryptedhighly encryptedthe key to which requires me to make a certain call from a specific phone at a specific time and not before lunchtime today at any rate he nodded glumly let us assume i can imagine what you mean by mr lus accounts grace eased her purse shut its magnet snapping sharply i require a bid in excess of one hundred thousand usd by nine am delivery before noon yang smiled catlike is that so i warned you about working for mr marquardt you should have accepted my job offer perhaps it is not too late it is very much too late selling corporate secrets is a punishable offense ms chu so is buying them i imagine she said she looked around the office and for the sake of whatever recording devices you have in place she said let me just say you are the one calling these files corporate secrets not me to my knowledge these files are not from a corporation but an individual one lu hao and i believe you will find he grants me access to these files insomuch as he is presently captive and in dire need of funds to secure his safe release yang felt his forehead perspiring if the camera hadnt been running he might choke the life out of this pest shed been nothing but trouble for him what you askit is a great deal of foreign currency to raise on such short notice he said perhaps yuan would suffice usd she said highest bid wins nine am one hundred thousand a week or two at the earliest the banks you see noon today never noon she said standing katherine has my phone number she will show you out i look forward to hearing from you tread lightly this is a great risk for you chu youya she quoted a proverb that translated how can you catch tiger cubs without entering the tigers lair how many others he inquired enough she said same conditions i will accept bids up until nine am the cash by noon she nodded if im followed from hereand believe me ill know ityou are off the list am changning district shanghai grace microwaved some frozen bi feng tang barbecue pork buns she and knox ate on the half balcony of the safe house apartment overlooking other peoples laundry they drank beer you are dressed in all black she said you have been sweating and your eyes are dilated from adrenaline as are yours he said did you confront him she asked the mongolian was he there tell me about marquardt yang cheng they both sipped their beer she said i am waiting as am i this is childish she said i paid a visit to the mongolians room as we discussed and yes i made sure he wasnt there knox said i had a look around and if you crossed a monk with a marine youd have this guy nailed neat and tidy and very few possessions if you discount the false wall behind the prayer rug he said please explain she said four screws in a false panel the mans a pack rat knoxs wound made him wince there was a video camera hidden in there a professional camera pretty beat up two handgunsboth russian and a considerable amount of yuan maybe eighty or a hundred thousand the missing cameraman she said the one the iron hand seeks yes and if hes as damaged as his camera we can cross him off the list of the living any footage on the camera he passed her his iphone excuse the quality i videotaped the little monitor on the side of the thing he upended his beer and drank loudly asphalt crew she said i do not understand neither did i but keep watching her eyes flared who are they too small to see we need a much bigger monitor and a better copy but the guy on the left is big enough to be our mongolian and the other guy is fat enough and well dressed enough to be rich you brought the tape she made it a statement its a disk but no i left it in the camera she glanced at him frustrated but why we know where to find it and if it goes missing weve played our hand you need to keep watching she returned her eyes to the phones video an asphalt crew at night he said in what looks like a light industrial area he rolled up his sleeve revealing chinese characters written in pen on his forearm this character is seen on a sign on the building in the background chong she said this means honor esteem chongming island yeah that occurred to me keep watching its coming up any second why film asphalt being laid she asked why hold on to a camera if this guy is dead and if hes missing a hand hes likely dead he said if the mongolians working for the police for this inspector then i can see it cops retain evidence in order to convict or to extort yes he said or as insurance agreed and if that fat guy with the mongolian is a beijing party member she gasped loudly youve got good eyes knox said i didnt see him until the second time i watched she rewound the video and paused when a mans head appeared on the far left of the framea man hanging on to the wall and peering over into the compound the frame then moved to encompass the spy and the lens zoomed to capture his face in closeup i recognized him from the pictures in the digital frame knox said a pixilated lu hao stared into the camera lens looking like a deer caught in headlights shed gone a pasty color oh lu hao whoever laid that asphalt did not want it being seen in china she said angry with him we work all hours this is nothing theyre hiding something he said count on it and lu hao saw it and the fat dude knox said he saw the fat dude and whoever that other guy was this is why he called me she went suddenly very quiet you cant beat yourself up over it she had tears in her eyes when she looked up at him knox felt fatigue drag him down over the next several minutes of her brooding silence for his part knox was celebrating that the video hed shot was clear enough to make out some detail he thought that on a bigger and better screen he might be able to make out faces he touched her arm seriously theres nothing you can do about it now except fix it were going to fix it she filled him in on her meeting with yang cheng and marquardt one of them will come through he said if not well drop a duffel of newsprint and improvise they will kill them they wont get the chance youll see there is only the two of us marquardt should not have made that call by now the chinese know we have lus records we are marked we knew thered be speed bumps you do what you have to do she eyed him curiously an american proverb he said what now john he wanted another beer maybe five i need to call randy he said for the encryption code i thought he gave it to you she sounded defeated he did yes not the encryption code the new proof of life he said primer will demand a final proof of life before making the drop thats our chance am shanghai the friday start of national celebration day coincided with the midautumn festival resulting in a migration involving over three hundred million chinese nearly a hundred million roundtrip train tickets would be purchased accounting for one hundred eighty million passengers in less than three days two hundred million others would travel to their family homes by bus car bike motorcycle boat or by foot flights would be added to every route and every plane was overbooked ferries would be jammed their passenger count well exceeding the posted limits chinese citizens were duty bound to return to their ancestral homes expats seized the weeklong celebrations as opportunities for vacation travel in and out of the country china would effectively shut down first was the celebration in honor of the founding of the peoples republic then the autumnal equinoxa holiday dating back three thousand years the human exodus would empty the streets and sidewalks of shanghai and the citys population of twenty million would be drained to less than half that among those not going anywhere were knox and grace with knox having contacted primer they slept in shifts awaiting a return call waiting for bids for the lu hao accounts from marquardt or yang cheng at seven they showered ate baozi from a street vendor and drank starbucks coffee the sun shone brilliantly though knox had read the forecastthe receding edge of typhoon duan a storm that had devastated the philippines three days earlier was on track to sweep onto the mainland by afternoon and stall dumping rain amid hurricaneforce winds for construction projects like the xuan tower the timing of the storm couldnt have been worse with no manpower due to the holiday exodus there was no labor force to secure the hundreds of sites to batten down equipment or secure scaffolding the government put out a call over the radio and television for all workers to return to the city it would go largely ignored graces iphone rang she and knox stared at it briefly before she answered hello wait pleasei will put it on speakerphone you out of your mind primers voice was tight extorting a client pitting him against his competition knox heard the mans venting but thought only of dulwich holding out an identical phone and showing him the tracking location of the mongolian without introduction or apology knox said you got my text about demanding a final proof of life who the hell do you think youre talking to any progress with pushback knox asked calmly a long pause on primers end i dont deal with rogues if wed gone rogue we wouldnt have recommended you require a final proof of life and we wouldnt have answered your call ask marquardt about chongming island hes been withholding on us were fucked here we could use someone with some spine we need the deets of the drop a long pause then time is clearly their bugaboo theyre in a hurry we negotiated it down to a hundred k its to be grace only she arrives fifteenthirty with the money and no one following peoples square metro station its a dirty harry a run and drop the proof of life will be a storefront video with realtime tags hostages to be released within twentyfour to fortyeight hours following a successful drop it works for us knox scribbled out the details the storefront proofoflife intrigued him what the hell were you two thinking primer asked knox answered without guangzhou were a little light on funds and it occurred to us with the hostages accounts turned over the value of the hostages diminishes substantially were contracted to make the drop you are yes knox said were committed to extraction and were a little shorthanded here sarges situation our own situationwere improvising marquardt can raise forty its not nearly enough knox said you will not auction off the accounts im afraid we will honor whichever bid comes in higher but more importantly we can now eliminate yang cheng from our suspect list for the kidnapping if he had lu hao he wouldnt need to pay for the accounts hed have beaten it out of him primers breathing could be heard i can see that for a moment no one spoke grace primer said turn the accounts over to allan you know the drill she looked into knoxs eyes i am afraid ithat is we must accept the highest bid knox relaxed noticeably and smiled at her shit primer had tried to keep it from being heard knox said the plan is for extraction by the time the drop is made i should have them back dont be a fool youll get them killed wait you know their location knox reached over and ended the call grace suppressed a smile i should have taken yangs offer of employment at graces personal phone rang and she clapped it up answering immediately ms wu she said so that knox understood it was yangs assistant katherine wu she listened yes thank you i will call you right back she disconnected the call two hundred thousand us impressive on such short notice knox allowed but i am afraid we must not accept it she said because mr primer the berthold group is the client we do not know the repercussions of turning that information over to yang he could use it so many ways no matter what he is certain to use it to destroy the berthold group this is our client much face would be lost an american firm accused of bribing officials this is not good for anyone first the kidnapper is our client we serve the kidnapper second they are expecting a hundred thousand do you want to deliver marquardts forty we take forty from marquardt and sixty from yang were up front about it we let them both know the other guy is getting lus accounts we give marquardt an unencrypted version itll take yang days or weeks to decrypt that gives marquardt time to be ready for whatever yang throws at him its the best we can do we promised it to the highest bidder he shrugged it is an interesting compromise she said ill take that as a compliment knox had been unable to raise amy his concern for her compounded with each passing hour but hed hired randy to consult on the proofoflifes delivery to a storefront were good you and me he asked grace she nodded we are good am zhabei district a blue buick minivan pulled to the curb cutting through a thick column of bikes and scooters and motorcycles all burdened with extra passengers and belongings knox threw open the side door a duffel bag was strapped by seatbelt into the captains chair knox unclipped it and swung the door shut the van sped off he and grace met three blocks to the east she arrived carrying a similar duffel they sat side by side on a park bench the hundred thousand us on their laps knox kept a constant watch his eyes shielded by a pair of knockoff raybans grace said nervously the metro station i am expected there for the drop its a runaround knox said i heard mr primer refer to this i do not understand exactly its dirty harry he could see her disconnect a moviea character in a moviea cop inspector harry callahan he had to make a drop hes forced to run pay phone to pay phone to separate him from his backup she inhaled sharply as if shed been punched what he asked nothing scared maybe a little but her eyes said differently he saw concentration heated thought anything but fear are you going to tell me tell you what she said he nodded whatever had shook her up shed quickly recovered and did not want to discuss it but the question remained melschoi rubbed the stubs of his two fingers lost to frostbite over eighteen months earlier warding off the shooting pain that foretold an impending storm he praised the gods for his good fortune grateful to be moving on his motorcycle instead of caught in traffic as he headed toward the intersection hed received a call from feng qis man his yang cheng insider it was the fourth such call hed received from the man authorities intercepted communication from a berthold group executive the man reported a woman chu is handling the ransom drop she is to go to a store along nanjing road to receive proof the hostages live what store is unknown your team will be watching nanjing road is long many stores here is how it will work if your team spots her you will call me immediately if i should call you you will report seeing the woman where i tell you the line remained open i have your wallet your address the address of your family melschoi said reminding the man not appreciating his hesitancy do not think just do feng has given police a video of the woman why figure it out the man disconnected the call the ransom drop was set feng wanted the chu woman arrested before the ransom could be paid melschoi felt poised on the verge of a great success the bee would not be far from the honey he could nearly taste the air of the steppes could see his childrens smiles

kozlowskis eyes narrowed his daughter tucker enjoying a holiday from the shanghai community international school was at a play date with a friend he was considering calling their driver peng and having tucker picked up before the storm hit at that moment his phone rang kozlowski he answered im close to making a deal on the bike the voice on the other end said he heard a series of soft clicks and a change in the voice quality as knox said you still there kozlowski slid open his desk drawer and glanced at the white iphone taken from the hospitalized imposter hed placed a call on the phone to test it he recognized the sound of the serviceshifting sound quality that made the call impossible to trace or eavesdrop that knox possessed such a phone surprised him i warned you there might come a time i couldnt help you that time has arrived he eased the drawer shut dont hang up please is this line secure what do you think how about on your end he said knowingly knox didnt answer i was shown some video of a westerner putting the hurt on some locals not once but twice i dont take kindly to being called to task by the city police knox wasnt going to lie to him so he said nothing word to the wise the chinese have the most advanced face recognition system out there on your way out of the country stay away from the airports and train stations and keep your head down when out on the streets youre a marked man knox i would get the hell out of dodge while the gettings good the guys were mongolians not chinese knox said wondering if the face recognition explained his being tracked to the

role yet had no desire to annul all the tedious hours that had led to this moment four years from retirement at the age of fortynine a lifetime ahead but the video camera and what it represented was a gold ring solving the disappearance of the cameraman was paramount ill evaluate the video camera kozlowski said after my friends and i are safely out of here a pause if you get yourself arrested im left with nothing no deal the camera then ill do what i can the subtle shifting of tone punctuated the line can it be done knox asked a contact could be arranged how it works outwell no promises this is china what kind of contact i give you a company number to dial its a real estate front i can walk you through it company number cia knox realized so start walking he said first the location of the camera ill sit on it until i hear from you or i hear youve been taken into custody but i must have it in advance those are the terms knox described the narrow lane in the muslim quarter he told kozlowski it would be easier to lead him there in person this is my city knox he took several minutes to walk knox through making contact with the company you still owe me a motorcycle kozlowski said ending the call pm i emailed product inquiry to store randy said over the phone in his chopped english the store emailed me back this gives ip address and routing in the source code which means knox said his patience taxed it was your idea to track possible video transmission to source whats that got to do with email technical matter only this helps me you no problem for you tracing video back to source will take time maybe quarter hour maybe half thats too long knox said he could picture himself arriving to find danner and lu hao ten minutes dead the minute they send that videoproviding they do at allill have less than thirty minutes to arrive at the location it is possible go on knox encouraged when randy failed to say more you see if i am this person i would test bandwidth ahead of time maybe one hour maybe thirty minutes ahead be certain transmission goes successful which gives me the time i need yes it is true it was a hell of a risk to take and if they email a video instead of a live transmission knox asked file size very large but email moves in packets this piece here that piece there all pieces join and arrive to your computer make problem for us knox had surveyed the electronics store to be used for pol in the front window was a television and camera setup that showed the window shopper standing on the sidewalk looking in the moment hed spotted the arrangement hed pictured the hostages being shown on that same television the kidnappers could have a second camera or a team watching the streets making sure grace was alone it struck him as a quick and efficient way to deliver the proofoflife theyd used video twice before people stuck to what they were comfortable with maybe i make suggestion go ahead knox said i could crash the stores email server this would then force them to use live video knox worried the effort might tip their hand and told randy so better to leave them believing it was business as usual pm luwan district nanjing road grace had never seen the streets so crowded with the friday holiday rush fully underway the sidewalks and streets remained in their crush hour state as they had all day carrying the duffel bag of money she approached the electronics store named by the kidnappers and fought to remain stationary flattening herself against the window knox had advised her to keep alert the proofoflife might come in the television screen currently reflecting her image or an image in one of the many digital frames or in the lcd on the back of one of the many cameras it might be something presented or shown to her by a clerk beyond the cluttered window display perhaps even lu hao or danner himself briefly making an appearance she waited there at the window time moving more slowly weighed down by her performance over the next hour she was responsible for a human life it was no longer drills or practice or textbooks or lecture she pushed away the credit she might gain with lu jian if successful until knox had verbalized it earlier she hadnt fully seen her ulterior motives hadnt fully acknowledged them perhaps there had been hidden motivations for her taking the assignment so what perhaps otherseven relative strangerscould see her more clearly than she could see herself she took in every camera every display her eyes ticking one to the next she watched for movement or a signal from the clerks inside all the while jostled and bumped and her feet trodden upon by inconsiderate passersby twice she was knocked away from her post and had to fight the human stream to reposition herself amid the noise of traffic and pedestrians no one heard her gasp as the screen of a portable dvd player flickered to life lu hao she gasped as he and a waiguoren appeared side by side they sat on scuffed threelegged wooden stools their arms at their sidestheir hands no doubt bound behind their backsagainst a backdrop of a bedsheet they each had several days growth of beard the waiguorens eyes pinched in fatigue the bedsheet wavered with a breezesomeone entering or leaving the roomand briefly stuck to the wall behind them a jagged shape appearing in shadow a phone was shoved into the frame covering lu haos face the small screen clearly showing the date and timea website the phone stayed there long enough to be read and then disappeared the screen went blank grace breathed again for a second time a sickening nausea spread through herthe first having occurred following knoxs reference to the dirty harry ransom delivery a film reference the letters scratched into the hostage chair at the empty warehouse were not but initials she had not shared her suspicion with knox even now she could not fully admit it to herself unable to define and articulate what felt like a poison running through her she was brought out of it by the sound of a phone ringing nearby it took her another two rings to realize it came from the duffel bag she reached down into a side pocket and came out with a mobile phonenot her phone in the jostling of the crowded sidewalk someone had planted the phone on her she answered dui go to robert de niro clothing store three doors down enter changing room number one pull the curtain and wait for instructions the call disconnected she moved forward robotically knox was somewhere out there watching her with little choice but to follow orders she made her way to the boutique and entered changing room pulling the curtain closed she expected the drop would take place here before she ever reached the peoples square metro station a ruse the new phone rang again we are watching you she glanced overhead and saw the crude hole carved in the ceiling tilebig enough for a small camera strip everything off now naked dress in the clothes you will find there she set down the phone and hurried out of her clothes offering her back to the overhead camera she heard the voice in the phone and picked up keep the phone to your ear until i tell you now turn around i must see you fully naked kuai kuai fast fast she showed herself spreading her arms and turning feeling violated then she quickly donned the loosefitting clothes that had been left for her the male voice directed her to transfer the ransom money into a nike duffel left under the bench they wanted to see the money move between the two bags while also removing any chance the original duffel contained a tracking device their final check before the drop a stationary dropleaving the money here in the shopwould be considered too great a risk they wanted her moving they wanted the confusion and chaos of the metro stationthe multiple exits and trains as she dressedno underwear no brashe found a travel card in the pocket of the workout pants they had her in an orange tank top she juggled to get into it while keeping the phone in place the bright color would make her easy to track in the suffocating crowds she was certain to encounter in the metro a pair of illfitting rubber sandals would make it difficult for her to run keep the phone close now you go to the metro she left the boutique weakened somewhat by the embarrassment of disrobing but regained her strength quickly she was more determined than ever to defeat these people and yet fully aware she would need knox for that pm melschois man whose mongolian nickname was rabbit for the six children hed sired spotted the electronics store on nanjing road and immediately recognized its significance an electronics store he told melschoi over their phones what of it what better place to send proof of the hostages condition there are dozens of computer and television screens in the window you see melschoi didnt enjoy being beaten to the punch yes it does seem a strong candidate okay you stay with that and if i see her follow her what else you fool but whatever you do watch out for the ebpon hes nothing but trouble pm from the window of a secondfloor cantonese restaurant knox watched grace through a pair of tendollar binoculars as she emerged from the robert de niro boutique she raised her arm and scratched her headtheir signal that she still had the money a surprise given the switch of duffel bags she now carried a black duffel a knockoff given that the nike swoosh was absurdly oversized and its tail smudged making it look like a plucked eyebrow he hurried downstairs and battled the tsunami of human flesh cramming the sidewalks in order to stay ahead of her putting himself between her and the metro station entrance knox wore blue jeans wraparound sunglasses and running shoeslooking like any other waiguoren they were a few minutes into the play and he and grace had already been outsmartedan endaround that had her in new clothes and carrying a new duffel her iphone would be turned off her private phone didnt answer if he lost sight of her he lost her and yet his back was to her aware that the kidnappers the mongolians and possibly the chinese police might have her under surveillance knox maintained his lead a fiftyyard bumper and entered the station first he traveled through a crowded corridor loud and smelling of human sweat he held his phone in his right hand watching its reception bars reduce the deeper he penetrated he needed the message from randyneeded to know if the kid had managed to trap and trace any data flow involving the electronics shop at the time of graces standing at its window knox had no intention of disrupting the drop but he intended to protect grace through the process or for as long as possible and to make any observations he could he queued up in the rapidly moving security line all purses totes and bags were placed onto an xray conveyor the process involved nearly everyone given it was the start of the national holiday and the security was lax the magnetometer sounded its warning beep with each person yet no one was stopped the xray conveyor ran constantlyits operator giving only a passing attempt to pretend he was studying the monitor knox funneled into a single file with the others and with nothing to xray slipped through the magnetometer causing it to sound he carried three phones and a mongolian switchblade in dulwichs gray jacket if they patted him down it was going to get ugly no one blinked he continued toward the turnstiles waited in line and swiped his travel card he was in he checked his phone which now read in chinese no service no randy he couldnt stay down in the bowels of shanghai for long he waited and watched the security check finally an orange tank top appeared grace arrived at the longer security line awaiting the conveyor a hundred thousand dollars strapped over her shoulder pm rabbit followed the woman to the metro station entrance allowing her to descend the stairs a good distance before following he would try to time it so that he passed through the turnstiles ahead of her people rarely looked in front of them for tailsthey were always craning their heads to look back pm luwan district shanghai the kfc franchise on huaihai middle road was well over its legal seating limit by the time steve kozlowski pushed his way inside inspector shen stood at a counter along the wall eschewing the window area he had shoulders as wide as a vending machine kozlowski abandoned the idea of waiting in any of the lines all thirty people long simply for the sake of appearances he cut through the crowd making directly for the man he was not easily intimidated hed spent his career in remote outposts of the world managing others and learning to put the fear of god into them but the presence of inspector shen raised his hackles the peoples armed police was a department unto itself reporting to no one its officers wielded too much power often worked unsupervised and were known to hide their deeds the closer he got to the man the more he felt his intensity they acknowledged each other with a nod the din in the place covered their low voices kozlowski said the video cameras been found shen looked him in the eye kozlowski saw nothing in there like squinting into an empty steel pipe i have an address but am not free to turn it over for at least a few more hours i wanted to give you time to pull your men together no men inspector shen said only me kozlowski had never heard of peoples armed police officers working solo it caused him to wonder if he werent speaking to an mss agentministry of state security the chinese equivalent of the cia first the hand now the camerafound in bad condition by the way kozlowski said it does not bode well for the cameras operator we would like to find him as much as you would for different reasons shen said i will expect your cooperation in this matter both men knew that was unlikely volunteering the camera was as close as kozlowski would go pursuing such evidence in the name of the us government was impossible without serious repercussions as much as he might have wanted to his hands were tied by embassy protocol i will pass along location the moment i can if hes found dead i request a thorough investigation that includes my people as agreed previously yes it had long since occurred to kozlowski that shen had killed the man himself and was in the process of unofficially cleaning up his own evidence such a scenario prevented kozlowski from getting too knowledgeable about the case without the risk of his scooter being hit by an army truck how certain are you the camera is his i have not seen it kozlowski clarified however from what ive been told it could be no other shen shot the man a look he has violated the terms of his visa the man said his use of present tense made it sound as if a man with no hand and no camera might still be alive if the cameraman was already in custody and the chinese were seeking evidence to bring charges then kozlowski was playing directly into their hands the smell of the deepfat fryers was getting to his stomach he coughed up some bile his fucking stomach had been a wreck since a bout with dysentery four months earlier jokes about bowel movements were more common in the consulate than blonde jokes only lies put us in this situation shen said lies and secrets kozlowski said they could agree on something you will write down the location for me he said please when i have confirmation kozlowski vamped now please i will not act until i receive your call my word to you on this kozlowski understood the fragility of the moment this mans word was as reliable as the fbi warning on a bootleg dvd but cooperation between governments and departments of those governments transcended individual need it was the same whether in somalia or athens or shanghai he could get more from creating longterm good relations with the pap than he ever could from saving the hide of john knox he was gaining guanxi the most elusive and important aspect of any chinese business relationship kozlowski hesitated only briefly as he took out his pen and wrote down the address on a kfc napkin he hoped he had not just signed knoxs death warrant pm luwan district amid the sweltering crush of thousands of people hellbent on cramming their way onto an arriving metro car knox kept his back planted against a cylindrical post like clutching a fallen tree in a spring flood any of these people could be kidnappers the choice of this particular day and time was brilliant millions of people released from work and determined to leave the city as quickly as possible with the slightest spark the chaos would turn into pandemonium he checked his watch for the tenth time he had to get back into cell phone rangeawaiting a second call from randyif he were to have any chance of extraction randy had picked up a test video signal and had been datamining it hoping to give knox a location fix but if grace were abducted all was lost danner would be executed and grace along with him the ransom would be gone knox would be found and imprisoned he wanted to keep an eye on grace at least through the drop very much aware of the ceilingmounted security cameras he kept the bill of his hat low heeding kozlowskis warning of the sophistication of chinas face recognition capability the last thing he could afford was the police bearing down on him he maintained his position flashes of graces orange shirt jumping from the horde while keeping an eye on the man whod entered ahead of grace of average height but sturdily built the man had stopped at a support post using it to separate him from the crowd while taking a look back then hed made a brief call too brief the kind of call reporting ones position right or wrong knox tagged him as one of the mongolians men and added him to his list of complications grace moved through the turnstiles instantly swallowed up by the crowd wary of the mongolian knox cut against the flow following the occasional flash of orange when a khaki security cap appeared behind him at the same post where knox had just been standing knox took note they were onto him incredibly quickly a wink of orange grace headed for a stairwell down to the line platform knox kept the mongolian between him and grace his cell phone vibratedhed been in and out of coverage he viewed the small screen hongkou randy had narrowed the origin of the proofoflife video signal down to a neighborhood north of suzhou creek that included the new cruiseship port as well as the former jewish ghettoan area home to more than a quarter million people knox returned a text more specific moments later his phone buzzed a second time need more time knox no more time then nothing knox faced the choice of abandoning grace in favor of the hostages it would take ten or fifteen minutes to reach the hongkou district by taximore given the congestion his feet told him it was a race for danners life his head that he couldnt abandon one partner in favor of another that he couldnt leave her with the mongolian tailing her consumed by the phone hed lost sight of her searching frantically he spun around and came eyetoeye with the security guard standing where knox had been only a minute before there was no mistaking the flash of recognition on the guards face as he saw knox a wall of human impatience separated them again knox lowered his shoulders to blend in he joined the flow overhearing the guard shouting for people to move aside knox knew it wouldnt happen on a chinese holiday break it was every man for himself another speck of orange up ahead grace spotted him too her face wormed with anxiety knox pushed people aside and gained on her he endured elbowing and cursing but drew close enough as the subway car arrived at the platform a thick wall of people the mongolian among them separated them xintiandi is next ice cream parlor she called out to him in english caught in the flow of bodies knox shook his head trying to stop her from saying any more the mongolian spun his head around and spotted knox and the two locked eyes on the videoa bedsheet behind them broken glass broken glass behind the sheet both alive knox shoved ahead to reach the mongolian but the crowd was practiced at stopping line jumpers the collective would not allow him forward progress the train pulled in and stopped a river of passengers disgorged coming directly at knox grace and her tail were carried onto the train car by the crush grace held to the duffel tightly tugging its strap higher onto her shoulder the bag briefly jumped into view the nike swoosh was the correct size and unsmudged knox stood frozen on the platform trying to process this change as the doors closed the mongolian looked back at knox cocky with his achievement knox had lost sight of grace he grabbed his phone but there was no signal he looked to his right the security guard pushed closer to him a walkietalkie held to his mouth his memory replayed like film her leaving the boutique carrying a knockoff duffel beating her through the turnstiles and watching her go through security following her to the platform he rewound the film the boutique the knockoff duffel the platform a different knockoff duffel it hit him security his mind replayed that part of his visual memory his attention had been on grace and her orange shirt shed deposited the duffel onto the xray machines black rubber conveyor belt shed picked up the duffel on the other side amid a dozen people grabbing and fighting for their handbags a different duffel had come out the other side the switch had been made inside the xray machinethe original duffel trapped a second duffel released and allowed to pass through the machine knox turned and fought the tide of bodies heading straight for the guard who wore his surprise openly on his face knox grabbed him kneed him and slammed him into a concrete pillar he stole the mans walkietalkie and released him leaving him to slump to the platform he lowered his head like a running back and parted the sea once that money was delivered danny was a dead man pm melschois phone intercom beeped the woman boarded a train line two rabbit said i am in the next car back excellent and the ebpon unable to board i left him on the platform line two melschoi confirmed yes watch for him melschoi warned in an ominous tone i left him behind im telling you watch for him rabbit im telling you chances are you did not pm xintiandi shopping area shanghai xintiandi a highend commercial development set in a renovated shanghainese lane neighborhood of the s occupied eight city blocks its buildings and now wide concourses home to luxury retail stores and fourstar restaurants an important tourist destination it was also a home for the platinum card set on the start of the national day holiday it looked like a mosh pit at a rock concert into this chaos arrived grace claustrophobia already wearing on her the shoves the cigarettes the body odor the perfume all served as catalysts for her anxiety she bullied her way forward the heavy duffel slowing her down as it collided with others in the crowd a light rain began falling she pushed for the cold stone creamery around the corner fighting the dense crowds she arrived at the ice cream parlor gripping her phone tightly in her hand waiting for the next call and waited and waited the phones screen remained blank she mentally urged it to ring silence the rain fell harder had she been too late she glanced around immediately spotting two uniformed police moving methodically through the throng had the kidnappers spotted the police canceled the drop the isolation from knox was killing her she wondered when she had allowed herself to become dependent upon john knox she dropped the heavy duffel to the concrete clinging to its strap tightly no call no contact she looked down at the duffel the two zipper tabs met dead center in the bag this was not right she had pulled them both to one side having had experience of heavy bags coming open when the zippers were centered like this she distinctly recalled pulling the zippers to one side she knelt the rain beginning to pour down she hardly felt it there in the middle of the crowds flowing around her in the middle of an allout downpour soaked to her bones grace nervously grabbed hold of the zippers and separated them hesitated only briefly before tugging the two sides apart she saw a bag filled with stacks of newspaper bundled together with twine unable to breathe she looked up into the rain as if expecting answers when where how she had put the money into this duffel herselfher reaction went far beyond bewilderment to outright denial this was impossible impossible or not it was she dug through the newspapers just to make sure the two cops were closing in on her the mongolian was back there somewhere she had but a matter of seconds the orange shirt gave her away she abandoned the bag she had no money only a travel card with twenty yuan left on itabout three dollars she hurried away from the police approaching a tshirt kiosk she stole a shirt not by lifting the hanger off the peg but by bending over and pulling the shirt down off the hanger ten yards later down on one knee she delighted a pair of high schoolaged boys by peeling off the orange top and donning the stolen tshirt she returned to the metro entrance passing within a few yards of the police who seemed to be looking for her behind her lying wet atop the plazas concrete pavers they would soon come across the orange tank top trod upon dirty and already torn pm huangpu district knox prodded the taxi driver to stay with the blue volvo sedan sandwiched in traffic up ahead hed returned to the metro security station in time to catch the four pm shift change had watched as one of the uniformed security men had left carrying a heavy black duffel with the oversized smudged nike logo on its side the guard cut through peoples square indifferent to the steady rain and the gloom it produced knox skillfully avoided being seen reveling that the shoe was on the other foot the guard continued two blocks on foot until meeting the blue volvo the first decent break of the past week came as a woman and her daughter disembarked from a taxi heading the same direction on dagu road as the volvo in the rain in friday rush hour knox took it as an omen now his taxi driver ran a light as its timer expired the man used the right lane to pass two vans nearly paving two cyclists in the process hen hao very good knox called out from alongside the driver theyd caught back upless than a block separating them from the volvo the driver smiled widely his few remaining teeth cigarettestained and crooked pm xintiandi a defeated grace descended into the metro station her legs burned her throat was dry the soaking wet green tshirt stuck to her like unwanted skin acutely aware of the probing electronic eyes and the possibility of a mongolian still following she hung her head and attempted to blend in with the hundredsthousandsof chinese swarming the underground station the operation was blown her face was known to police shed lost knox shed lost the cobbledtogether ransom money one of the mongolians was following her lu hao would be killed danner along with him shed come to believe the switch had been made in the xray machine back in peoples square it was the only place shed been removed from the bag it was a devious clever deceit she knew there was only one person to blame for it coming off so flawlessly pm north of the confluence of suzhou creek and the huangpu river knoxs taxi sped through the area northeast of the garden bridge that in the past years had been home to american traders russian refugees japanese merchants and then military occupiers and the european jews whom the chinese required to live in squalor during the war an uninspiring and neglected part of the city for decades it had recently undergone gentrification and was now home to hotels coffee shops and office buildings he tapped the drivers forearm slowly cousin he said speaking shanghainese straight on excuse me the car straight knox repeated turn around and pull to the curb but kuai kuai kuai fast the volvo had slowed and taken two successive rights evasive action to check for tails knox was betting it would take two more returning to its former route the pause to look for tails was a good sign they were getting close hed had the taxi turn around so he could see through the volvos windshield in order to confirm its passenger had not left the vehicle the sleightofhand trick with the duffel weighed heavily upon him knox checked his watch forgetting it had stopped hours ago the moment that money was delivered danner and lu hao would be killed close wasnt going to cut it the stopped watch suddenly seemed prescient the driver his face animated waited for him to say something knox could hardly think too long the volvo hadnt been trying to lose surveillance the two consecutive rights had been the result of a missed turn or oneway streets it was nearing its destination he texted randy need location a moment later a text returned soon knox directed the driver in the direction theyd last seen the volvo recalling graces mention of broken glass in the background of the video he realized they were in the wrong neighborhood abandoned building or old lilong near here he asked the driver broken windows the drivers face contorted power station by river many years he said made new most recently new does not work knox said he pointed for the taxi to take another right the volvo nowhere to be seen his phone buzzed south of kunming rd east of dalian knox defined the area for the driver we are close the driver said accelerating and crossing dalian road two blocks later is large area yes knox said peering through the smeared windshield the driver offered a thumbsup then pointed out his side window it wasnt the volvo hed spotted but a brick fortress set back from the curb with hundreds of broken windows huangpu district rabbit had lost the woman in xintiandi leaving melschoi wanting to break something starting with rabbits head he called his source inside feng qis group what can you tell me the line went dead the man couldnt talk minutes later the man called back we are monitoring police radio the foreigner has been spotted in peoples square metro station tell me something i dont know our people are headed there youre too late hes gone the ebpon would suffer for thisif he ever found him again hongkou district knox faced a pair of crumbling fourstory brick blocks the roof and windows were riddled with holes given the location provided by randy and the description by grace it was a strong candidate danners time clock was quickly expiring knox had to test the waters the compound was set back from the street across a patch of bare dirt and weeds and surrounded by high brick walls that met at an elaborate archway where a wroughtiron gate hung open inside the archway were aluminum lawn chairs occupied by a handful of overweight women smoking and cackling in shanghainese electric wires had been strung through several of the second and thirdfloor windows in the building on the left the structure on the right appeared fully abandoned a nailhouse by all appearancesa residence condemned to demolition where a few determined squatters had nailed themselves down refusing to be relocated he had no great desire to confront a group of shanghainese matrons they were considerably more frightening to him than the mongolians but they would know everything going on in those buildings he crossed the street and approached them soaking wet now the woman closest to the street wore an armband symbolizing her affiliation with the government as a neighborhood observer only in china he thought could a squatter hold a community position on the dry concrete protected by the archway he saw fresh wet tracks leading into the compound the security guard he thought or a courier who had met the volvo and taken possession of the duffel he was tempted to follow the tracks and ignore these women but he knew they could be paid sentries no time to shorten danners time clock heavy rain he said in english the youngest of the five womenmildly attractivenodded faintly though the one in charge shot her a penetrating look apparently not wanting a language bridge between this waiguoren and their group rain knox said in intentionally poor mandarin the head matron cocked her head he tried again improving only slightly she nodded and then rattled off in shanghainese that waiguoren spoke with rocks in their mouths the other women chuckledall but the youngest knox had an ally in her you live here knox asked sticking with intentionally poor mandarin these building the lead woman stared at him through suspicious eyes in shanghainese she let him know it was none of his damn business her language so foul that one of her friends looked to the brick walkway demurely in shanghainese the younger woman said be polite you old witch he is guest in our country he and his kind bring commerce and prosperity they bring the avian flu and kfc to hell with them all the older said carrying on the national rhetoric that had pinned the avian flus origin on the united states indeed we live here the younger woman said to knox in slow halting mandarin spoken so that he might understand any young men men my age or younger recently join you he asked her in rapidfire shanghainese the lead woman said shut your mouth pretty flower or i will report you and your tribe as running a brothel and have you imprisoned for generations do not test me her admonishment sobered the others while telling knox all he needed to know he caught the eye of the young woman who was blushing what floor he asked in english knowing the matrons could not understand him show me with your fingers i will not betray you what does he say what does he say snapped the old bitch you will not speak you will not answer him but knox had already turned away from them having seen the young womans left hand resting on her knee touch thumb to pinkythe chinese hand signal for three he took two steps stopped and turned now back in the rain addressing the lead woman speaking perfect shanghainese he said you are a bitter old cow with the brains of a potato i had five hundred yuan i was prepared to offer you to help me with the magazine article i am writing now it remains in my pocket and you remain in the chair poorer for your rudeness he tromped off through the standing puddles immediately the women were on their leader with vicious crude remarks and admonishments knox knew the arguing would continue for a good fifteen minutes with luck time enough for him to get in and out without detection ironically the only one of them he worried about was the youngest fearing she might see through to his intentions at the end of the compound was a wall shared with a fivestory apartment building wet to the core knox turned at the apartment building and went up and over the wall he slurped through mud to the far edge of the brick tenement finding an opening where a door should have been he entered a dark hallway rainwater coursing down the interior wall the warped floor was littered with trash and broken beams and pieces of brick all covered in layers of filth faded printers proofs of posters were held to the wall by rusted thumbtacks improvised wiring snaked in tangles up the banister knox fingered the tangle the cleanest of the wires was a phone linenew the residents of such places werent the kind to install phone service but a gang of kidnappers might pirate the service from a nearby pole in order to have internet knoxs confidence built as he crept silently up the staircase pausing every few feet to listen the pounding of the rain covered all sound if the money had been delivered then danners time was up at the firstfloor hallway he checked two nearby rooms their doors missing or open both were unoccupied and cluttered with construction debris the second floor was darker the result of cardboard blocking a hallway window the wires separated here and ran like grape tendrils to various rooms two one thickelectricitythe other thinthe phone linewere tied in a pair leading still higher adrenaline charged through his system as he anticipated the action at the end of the wires the moment hed come for danner he climbed following the wires moving more cautiously now he was led to a door third down on the left a set of wet shoe prints had soaked into the wood floora recent arrival his eye fixed onto a shiny new brass key lockan amateur move ever so gently he turned the doorknob and applied the slightest amount of pressure to the door locked pm hongkou district knox heard muted voices in a heated discussion from the other side of the locked door he leaned his good ear against the wood muted shanghainese from at least two possibly three mandarin spoken by at least one he stared at the footprints saturating the worn wooden floorboards as he listened his fingers involuntarily counted out the number of voices four difficult odds given that he was armed with only the mongolians switchblade he considered using the window at the end of the hall and working from outside the building increasing his element of surprise but the building face was sheer and the old witches at the gate might see him he dropped to his knees and peered through the space at the bottom of the door covering his right eye four pairs of feet by table legs two pairsscuffed dress shoes so typical of shanghainese men standing one a pair of nikes the sitting mans feet tapped nervously his legs dancingnot bound to the chair knox noted the fourth pair of shoes by the table was black and rubbersoled above a cuffed pair of pants a fifth pair of shoes could be seen to the right against an exterior wall what held them closely together knox couldnt see but they were large size thirteen or fourteen danny that made five knox sat back against the wall and exhaled he fought the impulse to kick the door and let adrenaline rule think but hed not come here to think hed come here for danny he stood and kicked the door alongside the lock shattering the jamb the second kick flung the door open three men standingtwo to the left of a central table one at the back one man sitting to the right danny was blindfolded and ducttaped to a chair to knoxs right he looked haggard but alive knoxs elation at seeing danner nearly cost him the man on the far side of the table pulled a knife the duffel was open a stack of bound bills alongside it one of the three men on the left had his hands in the duffel knox took him out first while hipchecking the table and slamming its edge into the man with the knife he flopped over knox chopped at this mans hand dislodging the knife while fighting through the next mana wiry guy who took a punch poorly but the man possessed sharp exact movements and was fast he landed a blow in knoxs sidehis woundand knoxs knees went out from under him the one whod had the knife stood up now weaponlessit was twotoone against knox threetoone as the man in the chair leaped to his feet knox returned to standing using his back to overturn the table onto the one coming out of the chair the duffel fell the cash spilled he throatpunched the wiry man causing the man to blanch and grab for his own throat knox defended a blow coming from the knife man countered and then blocked again this man was the most practiced fighter knox defended well and managed to make the man take a step back establishing knox as the dominant his opponent kicked for knoxs right knee and might have broken it had the table not moved putting a table leg between them the table leg broke not knoxs the remaining blows came fast knox drove the man back one final step and took him down with a left to the kidney and a right to the heart a man jumped onto his back knox caught the flash of the fallen knife he blocked the attempted blow elbowed the man off of him and turned to finish him the man lying on the floor coweringthe man whod been sitting in the chair watching the money being countedwas lu hao pm hongkou district shanghai knox towered over lu hao his foot raised and ready to break the mans rib cage sternum and all the mix of surprise and anger was toxic lu hao hostage and kidnapper all in one lu hao dropped the knife threw it to the side like a person waking from a dream a bad dream at that you knox said you piece of shit i must explain lu hao said his voice quavering as he pushed away from knox damned right and you will knox surveyed the damage hed done took in danner you okay over there the gagged danner nodded slightly knox took up the knife kept it where lu hao could see its tip twisting toward his eyes used shoelaces to tie hands behind the backs of the three men who were on the floor stuck banded bunches of hundreddollar bills in their mouths as gags instructed lu hao onto his stomach and patted the man down found two mobile phones on the man and pocketed them worked his way carefully over to danner and cut him loose never taking his eyes off lu hao handed danner the knife and then took out his own so they were both armed danner tried to stand and fell over knox reached an ice cooler where some chips and cold pizza had to be moved to open it he handed danner bottled water and a red powerade seriously knox said you okay go easy on him danner said meaning lu hes an asshole but he treated me good wait until you hear his story the guys fucked six ways to sunday knox noticed the bloody bandage on danners hand seven he said not taking his eyes off the man its complicated danner said ive been getting a lot of that you sound like a stockholm syndrome victim to me danny youre free now were out of here the three of us danner said yeah i suppose but only because i owe someone they fed me they kept me bound but moved me it could have been a lot worse im telling you its better than it looks they cut your finger off he would have killed you nono cried lu hao never shut it knox said lunging for the man lu hao scooted backward eyes wide in terror knox felt like those first few moments in a fun house when the lights are dim and mirrors distort your own image danny defending lu lu hao not a hostage all the money spread around the floor shit he said lit by adrenaline and wanting to destroy lu hao he kicked the overturned table it skidded across the floor and slammed into one of the downed men who groaned danner had cut the duct tape and was peeling it from his wrists just do me a favor danner said and wait to kill him its not like i forgive him or anything knox breathed loudly thats better he looked back at danner and allowed the shadow of a smile if you want to kill him after youve heard his story danner said im first in line this is not coming down on you not after all youve done i think youd better shut up too knox said dismissing danner suddenly with a heated glance it hadnt been that danner had scratched into the arm of the first chair hed occupied it had been initials lh his brain was set to a high boil he couldnt make sense of things the fatigue the wound the risks lu hao had kidnapped himself knox still wanted to pulverize him punish him he thought of grace he wondered what came next knowing the answer dulwich he couldnt leave dulwich behind repack that bag knox said the money comes with us pm huangpu district to the right of the number entrance of the nanjing road east metro station was an unmarked oversized black metal door pasted with stickers for music albums american guitar and amplifier manufacturers and posters for local rock bands a door easily overlooked grace knocked and the door was opened by a bald middleaged man with a crooked but flat nose and clear eyes from behind him came the muted but grating strains of heavymetal rock and roll being played grossly out of tune the man recognized her from earlier when she and knox had rented the underground practice room he swung open the heavy door admitting her to a landing and a set of dimly lit metal stairs she was sixty feet underground by the time she reached a long concrete corridor passing through a pair of blast doors hung on heavy hinges an overhead tube light flickered with each pulse of the music not one band but two or three this was but one of the dozens of such bomb shelters built under mao to house city residents and his army in fear of a soviet missile strike the memory of the japanese occupation and slaughter had never left the chinese consciousness and never would some of the bunkers were now open as minimuseums around the city others like this had been taken over by squatters and were open for commercerehearsal space for wannabe rock stars she reached bunker number and opened another heavy metal doorappropriate to the music thumping down the hallway she moved inside and shut it behind herself the room smelled foully of sweat cigarettes and stale hefan eggshell foam rubber was glued to the gray concrete walls carpet samples covered the floor electric conduit and outlets had been crudely retrofitted two dim compact fluorescent lightbulbs hung from the ceiling it had come to this she thought hiding out in a hole dug underground like some kind of animal reduced to lie and bribe ones way into a small dismal room all because of anothers lying and bribing evil begets evil she felt a shudder of release swell within hergrief sorrow the aftershock of the adrenaline that had built up during the ransom run her failure of having moved around the city with nothing but newspaper inside the duffel how would that affect knox and his efforts at extraction wet and shivering she glanced over at the closed door wondering when knox might arrive or if by losing track of the money shed compromised their mission pm knox delivered lu hao and danner to the subterranean music rooms arranging for grace to care for danner and keep a close eye on the turncoat lu hao few words passed between him and grace the contrition with which shed met him at the bunker door told him she knew lu haos storya realization that sucked knoxs lungs dry he couldnt make sense of her expression couldnt reason his way to how she might possibly know but she didnt so much as flinch at the sight of lus hands bound and she treated him like a wet dog as she dragged him inside later knox said patting the duffel bag containing one hundred thousand dollars where are you going she called out possession is ninetenths of the law he returned knox arrived at the muslim quarter dressed in the pale blue jumpsuit worn by city sweepers and trash collectors he carried a nike duffel bag his face was covered with the ubiquitous surgical mask worn against smog along with the brim of a ball cap pulled down low he hid his race as best as possible the duffel was somewhat out of place on a street sweeper but with the start of the national day holiday no one paid attention to anyone else it was every man for himself he splashed through the rainflooded lane the full force of the approaching typhoon yet to arrive moving toward the mongolians small apartment he was less concerned with the mongolian and far more with the police or whoever kozlowski had likely already sold him out to for he knew hed been thrown under the bus hed traded kozlowski the mongolians address for a chance to leave the countryand had filled danner in on the details of the contact in case he didnt make it back to the bomb shelter but the final piece of the frame was worth the risk if the kidnapping and ransom collection fell onto the mongolian neither he nor gracenor lu haowould be accused of involvement furthermore kozlowski seemed the only one powerful enough to get dulwich out of the country in one piece he moved down the narrow lane quickly now feeling eyes boring into his back knox broke off the tip of the switchblade jimmying the mongolians lock and getting the door open but was inside without too much telltale damage to the jamb he relocked it behind himself and made quick work of opening the wall panel that hid the video camera and chinese currency hed seen here before he removed the disk from the video cameraevidence that might come in handyand pocketed four yuan packs of currency enough cash to buy favor the space was too small to accept the full duffel leaving knox no choice but to take the time to unpack the dollars and stack them into the available space in an orderly fashion when completed it looked as if the wall was insulated with hundreddollar bills he folded and stuffed the empty duffel into the remaining space inside neat and tidy he was tightening the panels last screw when he heard the splash of footfalls in the alley they came to a stop by the door to the room knox grabbed a pair of socks and rubbed out his wet tracks that led to the wall panel no matter what the mongolian must not discover the cash ahead of the police the lock rattled knox slid open a dresser drawer and messed up the contents to give the impression hed been rummaging the door swung open rain blew in from behind the mongolian the man withdrew a blade knox wrapped his left hand in a tshirt from the drawer do you know why im here knox asked in mandarin i think you wish to negotiate but you have nothing i want except your life of course i want to end that badly the mongolian answered i have lu hao and his accounts knox said dropping it like a bombshell i think otherwise i can make a call why buy what i can take the man said because you dont know where he is knox answered oh but i will in a matter of minutes that or you will be dead either way it is satisfactory to me you have been a pain in the ass ebpon i will be glad to be rid of you if that is your choice you will kill him knox said the mongolian laughed a legitimate laugh he shrugged but not until you have his accounts you are less stupid than you look round eyes knox did not speak as the mongolian shut and locked the door behind himself his manner relaxed his demeanor calm the man understood strategyhe made no move toward knox instead he blocked the only way out knox would have to come to him giving the mongolian a formidable advantage knox backed up a step a man that size would have a hell of a reach the room felt impossibly small we have interests in common knox said you want lu hao gone i want lu hao out of the country tonight if possible you have caused me much trouble the mongolian said you exaggerate i am but one man up against many the mongolian huffed your math amuses me i counted four at the hair salon and then there is the one you put in the hospital by making that stupid switch you put him in the hospital knox said i owe you for that i am standing right here the mongolian said knox charged his left hand outstretched to take the blade that winked as the big man wielded it knox struck him with his shoulder and drove him into the door the knife flashed nicking knoxs cheek he blocked the second swipe but was cut on the arm a flurry of knife thrusts blocks and counterpunches they were well matchedknoxs speed and agility against the mongolians power knox had fought such men he appreciated the challenge at hand he wasnt often the underdog he understood the punch he had to land had to be effective the mongolian would expect the jaw all fighters expected the blow to the jaw and worked to defend against it but knox would break his fingers and hand on a jaw like that all for winning a few loose teeth the routine required of him was like a physical chess game he had to work the abdomen and the groin trying to pull the mans arms down in defense trying to open the jaw and make the man focus on its defense as well all of it a ruse to gain an opening to the heart punch you didnt stop a truck by smashing its windshield or even popping its tiresyou killed the engine like his colleagues the mongolian had been trained as a wrestler knox had the advantage of that knowledge a big man he was also likely accustomed to throwing people around at will by blocking the doorway he trapped himself in the corner of the ringup against the ropes knox used this against him throwing punches dancing back and trying to tease the man out into the more open space of the room he dodged welldelivered knife thrusts wincing with two more cuts both on his wrists knox landed a good blow just inside the mans hip joint it had to hurt the mongolians face went scarlet and he craned forward unable to stand straight hed pee blood for that one he swung out with the knife a little clumsily still trying to catch his breath knox took advantage of the opening and punished his lower ribs feeling one crack the mongolian roared and knox knew hed scored hed ticked him off as well lost composure was a lost fight knox landed a third straight blow low on the mans abdomen just above the lower pelvic bone the mongolian understanding his vulnerability bent over as he was overreacted and stood up too quickly knox finally had his opening he stepped forward risking the close quarters and delivered the heart punch as if trying to put his fist out the mans back the mongolians eyes rolled back in their sockets as his heart skipped a beat he went down like the air had been let out of him knox stole the mans phone but left his id for the police to find he pulled the door shut behind him he tried to run but he was spent he crossed his arms to hide the blood and walked briskly he texted kozlowski believing it an act of futility but a promise was a promise and he needed kozlowskis connections to get dulwich free the camera is yours pm shen deshi spotted the waiguoren still wearing the same street sweepers blue coveralls that hed worn on the way in he came out of the lane and joined the horde hed spotted him on the way in not because of the sanitation worker coveralls but because of his height and the spring to his step shen understood the importance of criminal informers knew this man was significant to kozlowski the police and secret police thrived off information gleaned from such sources the waiguoren matched the description of a man they were looking for to collar him would be a credit to all other iron hands and would put shen in good favor with his superiors but ultimately his departments relationship with the americans superseded any one arrest he had given his word he would not move until contacted he did not move when only minutes later he received the highly anticipated call from kozlowski shen referenced the police captains business card and phoned him he reported to the captain that hed seen the wanted waiguoren only minutes earlier he provided cross streets once he is arrested i would appreciate the sharing of any information the suspect may volunteer yes of course sir any such information will be immediately forthcoming the captain sounded like a man given a second chance at life a favorite credo of inspector shens why do the dirty work when others will do it for you hed let the worried captain beat the shit out of the foreigner and keep the blood off his own hands now he moved with deliberate haste down the crumbling lane to the mongolians door he never considered knocking he threw the sole of his shoe into the door and it exploded inward the mongolian sat on the edge of the floor mat that served as his bed he raised his head defensively hands out in front but the fight had been beaten out of him shen could see it in his eyes special police he said slowly in mandarin you understand he displayed his id if you strike me the mongolian swung his right leg deceptively fast shen blocked it and undercut the effort by hooking the mans leg he threw the mongolian over backward shen placed his foot into the mans crotch and kneeled pinning the arm holding the knife with his free hand he seized the man by the throat if you strike me he began again you will face charges and serious jail time you yakfucking mongol piece of shit you understand the mongolian glared shen could feel his opponents strength returning he rolled the man over and cuffed him facedown you so much as twitch shen said and ill use your own knife to castrate you he searched the small room methodically and quickly coming across the panel in no time he used the mongols knife as a screwdriver and loosened the screws us currency fell out as the panel gave way what the fuck the mongol moaned shen complimented the waiguoren hed underestimated the mans resourcefulness an excellent strategy hed have to compliment the man once the police captain had had the snot beaten out of him his day was looking up there behind all the money he located his prize the video camera he smiled privately nearly a week of gumshoe work and worry and now this he took a photograph of it in the secreted hole with his phones camera several more as he emptied the cash into a duffel lying there the mongol was screwed the duffel would no doubt show up on one or more surveillance tapes involving the ransom drop the waiguoren had framed this guy well this is not mine the mongolian shouted shut your hole shen hollered fuck but its a lot of money shen considered the amount it had to be fifty sixty seventy thousand us dollars a fortune retirement passing through his hands he had carefully navigated a career prone to bribery had turned it down waiting his turn instead hed worked the system using guanxi and favor but this amounthis throat went dry at the thought he regarded the piece of shit on the floor temptation plagued him even more currency in yuan perhaps two hundred thousand he discovered a plastic bag containing a mongolian passport some family photographs and a small amount of mongolian currency alongside the passport was a policemans id wallet the sight of it stopped him briefly ah ha he said i see we are brothers he sat down on the mat surrounded by moneydrugged by itthe mongols head at his feet so let me ask you this brother put yourself in my position all this cash you are alone with a suspect who is a spineless kidnapper an illegal foreigner and by the existence of this camera more than likely a murderer huh do you wait for the long arm of justice or take matters into you own hands the mongol shook his head and squirmed for the sake of conversation shen said humor me whats your next move he eyed the money five years salary ten twenty hed avoided the pennyante stuff all these years but now the jackpot was he supposed to turn it over to someone only to have them make it disappear and maybe him along with it just to tidy things up he could strike a compromise share it with a superior and ensure no one questioned his sudden retirement actionable intelligence shen said you tell me all you know and then we take a drive you and me okay brother a small ferry on the huangpu a man i know if i am happy with your cooperation i deliver you to the police over in pudong if i am not happythen no one can save you i have someone i have to call the mongolian said one call and we are both rich and you promoted this i promise a call to beijing shen deshis blood flowed hot what had he walked into beijing he eyed the money and then regarded his hostage wondering what to believe pm luwan district danner was asleep on the floor by the time grace finally overcame her anger she sat down next to lu hao his hands and ankles bound by plastic ties concealing her true emotions something every chinese child learns at a young age she said calmly what have you done lu hao a thousand pardons chu youya i beg your forgiveness i have made a mess of everything my familys honor most of all i deserve whatever punishment you wish to bring upon me he kept his head down staring at the stained carpet squares explain yourself before i turn you over to the american and allow him to do to you what i too feel you deserve it was a matter of bad luck nothing more happenstance i saw a facea man i knew from my deliveries for mr song for the berthold group the employment you offered me i should have left it at that you paid out large sums to the mongolian lus eyes went wide impressed with her he nodded yes all for the envelope that is now in my back pocket four hundred thousand us all for a number a number i swear all that money for a single envelope a number nothing more grace fished the red envelope from the mans pocket refusing to believe the events of the past week could have their origin in nothing more than a number she examined the envelope you opened it she said fourteen billion seven hundred million what does it mean what was i to do once inside the building he beat a man beat him until he fell killed him i assure you while the other one watchedthe government man what government man he arrived in a government car i saw the platethe number six nothing more a highranking government official i was scared terrified i trusted no one i called you chu youya who else you got me this work you of all people must know did you not get my call she remained silent his eyes pleaded with her for an explanation she had none the second deliverytwo hundred thousandi was told to accept an envelope but this manthe look he gave me during the exchange i must have betrayed myself i swear he knew id witnessed him and the other man and the killing dont ask me how the video she was thinking just as she and knox had identified lu lu hao sounded on the verge of crying little lu hao always depending on his brother or father to pull him along i envisioned a story i would be kidnapped the envelopes contents would give me great value to my employer certainly in excess of four hundred thousand us i would demand a ransom and my father would be returned the money i owe him then of course tragedy would strike i would be believed killed my body never found he paused my parents regain their future and our family face i vanish australia america perhaps it was a plan not without sacrifice he looked over at the sleeping danner thenhim grace looked over as well slow down she said a number staring at the envelope im telling you four hundred thousand us for that she looked at lu hao puzzled while thinking back to selena mings explanation of marquardt and song traveling together due diligence on future projects the mongolians reported connection to beijing where all important decisions were made dear god she mumbled taking in the size of the number too big to be a bribe but a bid on a government construction project it was large extremely large but not out of the question lu hao the american if wed only left the american but all such plans are doomed tell me it isnt so he said lu hao they will kill me youya what is to become of my family i have failed them all i had no choice grace tried to process all that shed learned the size of the number the berthold group had paid for indicated what no bribe could be in the billions of rmb what could such a number represent the waiguoren took the ransom money get it back cousin get it to my father it is too late for that lu hao it has gone to buy you your freedom i should have realized the depths they would go to these people who are they grace asked who are these mongolians lu hao shrugged i am but the messenger the delivery boy how should i know but i tell you the man is cruel his eyes dead this factory she said the one in the video youve seen the video lu hao rose to his knees where is it tell me its location this place seemed the center of the storm wherever whatever it was she was splattered with something warm lu hao slumped forward his head thumping onto the foul carpet clete danner stood over lu hao holding a mike stand he recoiled reloading his strength to strike a second time grace sprang off the floor and caught his wrist in her hands preventing the second blow the mans eyes were glazed stop it stop it she shouted he possessed the size and strength to knock her aside grace used leverage to prevent the next blow but could be easily overpowered enough enough danner was dazedhalf sleeping half waking his eyes werent tracking he didnt speak didnt seem to hear sleepwalking a traumainduced narcosis he tried again to lower the bloodied stand onto lus head but the effort was halfassed the adrenaline retreating she managed to wrestle the stand from him danner stumbled back into the wall and sank down burying his face in his hands its going to be all right she said calmly but lu hao remained unconscious on the floor bleeding badly in fact he looked halfdead pm knox arrived to the bunker with two bags of athletic clothes and a pair of umbrellas he knocked on the bunker door grace answered despair on her face i wasnt paying attention she said as knox saw the unconscious lu hao his head bloody and sporting a bloodied stack of paper towels from the bathroom your friend came awake in a rage she said knox took it all in danner slumped against the wall sleeping lu hao on his back with his head propped up a bloody mike stand lying on the carpet jesus christ an hour ago he was defending him shock who knows he wanted to kill him fuck lu haos out he is hurt badly no no no knox muttered running his free hand through his hair lu haoit was all lu haos idea it wasnt fortyfour scratched into the chair it was lhlu hao lu hao all along they talked for several minutes grace relating her brief discussion with lu she had more questions than answers were getting him out of here knox said he patted his coat i have the diskthe video that should buy dulwichs freedom i need to call kozlowski if anyone can arrange iti brought everyone dry clothes we leave in five for the rendezvous inside he danner and grace stripped and donned the fresh clothes and ball caps they got a ball cap over lus wound to hide it the mans eyes were open but his brain was on hold he had yet to utter a word it was imperative he get medical attention as soon as possible danner remained in a stupor his eyes glazed over knoxs attempts to communicate won little but distant stares well travel in pairs heads down im going to need help with lu you understand danner nodded you try to fuck him up anymore and you answer to me knox said danner spoke for the first time in several minutes im sorry boss knox placed an understanding hand on the mans shoulder no sweat nearly there hang in danner nodded again grace flashed knox a look of concern one man barely conscious another traumatized yet another in a hospital room were good he said reassuringly even he didnt believe it they climbed the stairs to the street knox waiting for a decent cell signal halfway up he had it and he focused on the instructions kozlowski had provided knox dialed white star realty a chinese woman speaking good english im calling for frances frances is not in i should have called last night knox hung up a moment later his phone rang and he answered white star realty the same voice said im looking for a twobedroom condominium in shanghai with a river view he said a shanghai extraction water travel preferred over rail air or surface one moment please he waited the iphone shifted the faint sounds of lines being switched carriers changed i can help you a different womans voice any restrictions she said no higher than the twentyfourth floor no later than midnight how many beds how many traveling three beds let me check our listings please four you mean four grace said knox indicated for her to sit down and be quiet he had given the correct count more clicks and pops on the phone line the womans voice returned to the line we have a nice flat with a lovely view that may fit your needs its zhongshan south one of my representatives could meet you to view the property there was no zhongshan south road but hours equaled six pm which meant it was zhongshan south the dongmen lu ferry terminal was at that address and the hotel indigo next door what floor he inquired what time the twentyfirst floor eight pm hours he ignored the time an intentional miscue to mislead any eavesdroppers thank you knox had no idea how they would make the connection once to the terminal but that was for later we appreciate your inquiry and the chance to serve you the line went dead knox pocketed the phone three beds she repeated first of all it wasnt beds it was people three people same question im not leaving sarge behind he told her we get you three out now he and i will follow shortly mr dulwich can handle himself she said mr primer will not allow anything to happen to him just like nothing has happened to us knox said sarcastically sarge is expendable we all are we went over this youre leaving you and danner and lu they both need medical attention sarge and i will follow no arguments she looked poised to object but theyd reached the street and the chaos of the crowds and the downpour of rain pm knox flagged down two pedicabssafer than taxis or public transportation grace and danner climbed onto wet plastic benches beneath a windtorn canopy knox helped lu hao into the front cab the drivers kept the threewheeled motorized carts to the bike lanes twenty minutes later they approached the ferry terminal and the hotel just beyond thousands of chinese were queued out into the street awaiting ferries darkness had fallen quickly and the crowd seemed anxious bordering on turning into an angry mob the four entered the hotel indigo wet all over again knox informed the desk attendant white star realty had sent him they were shown to two secondfloor roomsnever above the fifth flooracross the hall from one another the decor was eurochic lots of stainless steel and frosted glass knox and grace inspected lus wound grace tried speaking to him in mandarin but lu hao was hiding somewhere behind the blinking bloodshot eyes he is bad off she said yeah not long until we get him some help knox said grace excused herself to the toilet and returned with her hair combed danner was asleep on a bed in seconds they propped up lu hao and put ice on his wound knox ordered room service including black tea as it promised to be a long night we must talk grace said across the hall we cant leave these two he said five she said i have a bargaining chip he said touching his coat the tape from the video camera i should be able to buy sarge a ticket home but im running out of time here can we put a pin in it and ill get back to you she shook her head but did not counter i promise well talk he headed out the door and into the room across the hall knox placed the call to dulwichs iphone after four rings kozlowski answered go ahead kozlowski said its me knox said these phones are safe he reminded youve been busy you have moved yourself right to the top of the city polices most wanted list i gave you the place and the people responsible and i called it in for you but with no hostages and no ransom money it looks more like another assault one of a string attributed to you i cant worry about that just beware of it i would lay real low if i were you i want the person you took that phone off tonight with me here first i dont want to know where you are kozlowski said second its not going to happen they caught one of the drivers they know it was a conspiracy and theyve posted a cop outside your friends room hes not going anywhere you have to change that knox said do you happen to remember a conversation we had one in which i warned you about how far you could take this i have the video your missing cameraman shot before he went missing a long pause on the other end come again you heard right it shows lu hao as an eyewitness to a possible crimea murder lu hao claims it shows an individualthe mongolianrushing the camera and after that night your cameraman is never seen again am i right another long silence wouldnt you like to close that disappearance knox asked in the video the mongolians clearly doing business with some kind of fat cat rich portly chinese this whole mess has something to do with marquardt and the berthold group paying out huge sums on the sly to obtain a number the mongolians the middleman the fat cats got to be the source what kind of number a big number knox said a very big number i dont get it neither do i knox admitted but my best guess is the mongolians job was to see the number reach the people who paid for itthe berthold groupand he understood lus importance to that end who knows what might have happened once it reached the buyer but the kidnapping came along so well never know he withheld lus culpability in his own kidnapping the disk for my friend he has to be delivered tonight circumstantial evidence isnt going to convince anyone of anything i wish i could help you i really do but i know these people its not going to happen knox had been so profoundly convinced hed bought dulwich his freedom that he felt the wind knocked out of him i have the video he repeated and i for one can get mileage out of it yes youre right about me wanting to close this disappearance but as we both know im forbidden from investigating i cant even ask probing questions so id have to play the video right and even then it will maybe help start a dialogue but that dialogue is not going to lead to the release of your friend he was the target of a commissioned crime the authorities are going to want answers from him youve got to get him out of there knox knew dulwich wouldnt cooperate and that if he didnt hed serve jail time i know what youre thinking youre thinking youll bust him out of huashan hospital but guess what you wont hes wellguarded and hes in bad shape pal hes going home on a stretcher right now it takes two to carry a stretcher last time i checked you and me knox said right knox searched for some kind of solution every time he advanced an idea it ran into a wall this fat cat you described kozlowski said a businessman not according to lu government pool car shanghai do you have that on film thats exactly what we need negative knox said but what he heard was we any way to make that id my guy is comatose at present even if he knew which he doesnt ive got wheelsup at eight pm never going to happen kozlowski added some storm huh been here six years havent seen one like this and if i brought you this guys name knox tested his mind reeling kozlowski prevented by law from investigating wanted knox to do his dirty work for him knox didnt need it in neon lights it made him wonder how inaccessible dulwich really was it would change things kozlowski said change things how listen if he really is governmenta minister lets sayor someone prominent in the partyand hes involved or even partially responsible for a pair of killings that shit sells knox that right there buys your buddy a free pass no question youll guarantee that tic no guarantees passage out if i stick around to do this for twoone on a stretcher same answer but will i try of course i will youre using me no no pal were using each other you gain enormous cred knox said no whatever you dig up it cant come from me that suggests i investigated it myself but there are ways around everything bring me that namea corrupt official match that to your eyewitnessa chinese eyewitness at that are you kidding me in this country in the current environment thats currency serious currency trust me i dont knox said you know for a while there i had you figured for a fool kozlowski said are we done here keep that phone charged knox said im going to be calling you back on it remember pal i dont know you love you too knox said ending the call pm the bund the rain hit the hotel room windows like water from a fire hose the river view was supposed to look across to pudong but all knox saw was the swarm of people on the docks below so she said inquiring about a phone call knox had placed to rutherford risks brian primer he wants us out knox confided see but he has nothing in place for sarges extraction he was unaware of his detention it clearly put him back on his heels i pushed for some kind of plan and said first things first wanting us out and i agree and i dont knox said he doesnt have a plan nor will a plan do any good if sarge is moved to a chinese jail kozlowski knows the ins and outs better than anyone and he said its going to take leverage and i believe him im staying youre leaving i doubt it with these winds the river like that they will close the ferries if they have not already grace said we should be making alternative plans she sat on the corner of the bed slurping down a bowl of wonton soup this is the alternative plan besides they wont have us on a ferry knox said theyre just using these docks for the rendezvous you cannot identify this party man without me she said repeating an argument shed championed for the past hour watch me knox said how can i watch you from hong kong touché you have to understand we discussed this you wanted lu hao out i wanted danny out weve got them both and now you need to see them out i made sure the blame for the kidnapping wouldnt fall onto lu hao by now the mongolian is likely under arrest if we could get to him maybe hed give up the name but we wont see him again end of story we she said quoting him this is nonnegotiable he said what if danny wakes up in a rage again someone has to be there they can keep them separate on the boat she said you know that do you i know you need me he knew it too but wasnt about to admit it i need you to be there when lu hao can finally talk to us i need the location where that video was shot i need some leads lu jian his brother can help if lu hao was on the island on the seventeenth then it was because he was there with his family lu jian can help us fill in the blanks but they will not help you not without me he hadnt considered the family angle when lu hao wakes you can get at least the location of the factory out of him you need to be there to listen someone needs to be there she said it does not have to be me not necessarily it could be danner she was right about that as well danner had expressed remorse over his assaulting lu he wasnt going to do that again and danner spoke the language fluently hes weak malnourished exhausted traumatized do you question his abilities for even a moment she asked you do not do you neither do i he can do this for us were going down to those docks and the three of you are getting on that boat we do not know if a boat is there im done arguing do not be ridiculous she said you enjoy the arguing pm dongmen lu ferry terminal the ferry terminal teemed with several thousand soaking wet and terribly unhappy chinese with nowhere to go debris rain and the spray of filthy river water were carried by a ferocious wind that gusted at eighty kilometers an hour ferry service had been suspended from the milling crowd pressed bellytoback arose the sense of an impending riot knox grace danner and the rag doll that was lu hao entered the melee knox worried that given the crowd they would not be spotted by their contact but he said nothing to the others at least they were among the only caucasians well try the ticket booth first he shouted to grace both danner and lu hao had regressed rather than recuperated during their brief stay in the hotel room lu hao could walk though barely the concussion serious danner was drained and tapping all his reserves to keep up the four found themselves moved against their wills with each shifting wave of the crowd if this comes apart on us knox shouted to be heard when it comes apartwe dont fight it we go with the flow and try for the edge as quickly as possible maybe the others hadnt heard him no one said a thing no matter what he said dont fall we lock arms and we stay standing its the stampede that kills knox locked elbows with danner on his left and lu hao on his right grace had lus other arm holding him upright it was cumbersome and difficult to move the situation deteriorated quickly from crowd to mob as resentment anger and claustrophobia created its own personality knox a head taller than most could see the crew of a ferryboat trying to hold back the leading edge of the mob all of whom were determined to board the boat and escape the crush a crew member swung a fender banging heads and a fight broke out it spread quickly fed like flames stranger turned on stranger only minutes later the peal of police sirens announced the arrival of a riot squad the mass surged from the street and away from the police lu hao raked forward and nearly went down knox and grace righted him and allowed themselves to be carried by the flow a line of police appeared on the upper plaza blue helmets and plexiglas shields a second line of police appeared from around the hotel indigo and sealed off the possibility of escape to the south here we go knox said mostly to himself with elbows locked knox leaned into the effort as the crowd shifted away from the police to the south his team worked against the pressure aiming for the ticket terminal the police strategy proved to be flawed as the lines squeezed the crowd the only release of pressure was to the docks and the river forcing more people to leap for the empty ferries whipping up the fighting knox wiped rain from his eyes as they worked toward the ticket terminal he spotted a tourist sign held by a slender arm white star adventures there he shouted the woman was chinese petite overdressed and soaking wet she shook knoxs hand and welcomed him to the tour if she were playing a role it was to a t she never broke from her smile never referenced the weather our boat is tied up other side of third ferryferry to the south she said terminal is crowded today four traveling knox had referenced three passengers over the phone he hollered to be heard three will be traveling john grace called out sharply knox silenced her with a look the guide caught it all we together then the guide said yes very well you follow me if you please she said still hoisting her sign knox gently lowered her arm and the sign i think its best if we dont advertise rain coursing down her cheeks she nodded and grinned very well this way please the south line of riot police stretched shoulder to shoulder from the hotel to the river the crowd moved away from them leaving a gap between themselves and the brewing mob knox steered their tour guide toward that gap knowing the police would not rough up westerners he and the others slipped down the gap nearly unimpeded the scuffle now approached a brawl leading to increased pressure from the line of police nearest the road with the river as the only release point the result was catastrophic those positioned at the rivers edge of the docks were pushed off people reached for boat railings and missed ferry crews slapped them off they fell into the water in droves some caught and crushed between the concrete wharf and the bouncing ferryboat bubbling screams cried out driving an already terrified mob into a frenzy the woman led knoxs group to the southern edge of the wharf where it wasnt much better she calmly placed them on the lee side of a steel containment railing chinese rammed into the docks final railing and tried to clamber over as they were crushed more people slipped through the boarding gates in the railing and fell into the water crying out for help the huge ferries buffeted by gusting winds banged against their bumpers crushing more of the fallen among those in the front line knox spotted two small kids terrified and helpless against the power of the crowd he lunged and snagged the first just before the boy went into the river he passed him to grace and grabbed the othera girl who clung to him in a vise grip he and grace held the children using the railing to shield them from the crowd raising her voice their tour guide called out we cross deck of last ferry to reach boat ferry crew know mewe have arrangementthis could make difficult situation difficult knox was thinking try impossible we must act quickly and rely upon crew do not pause please must go directly to boat the black water now foamed with the efforts of the fallen and drowning the sickening sounds of people drowning filled the air mixed with wind and the drumming of torrential rain on boat decks panic infected the crowd violence spread down the quay scores more were heaved into the water we go together as group the guide cried out the first sound of frailty in her voice knox the child holding fast to him glanced over into graces dark eyes the rain running down her face like tears she implored him two of us are staying knox cried out well get these children to safety happiness flowed from grace for a moment it was only the two of them on the dock this was not arrangement the guide shouted to be heard its the new arrangement go take these two and go knox cried get them medical attention as soon as possible the guide looked at knox and grace then out into the sea of violence and chaos her look said it all come with me please she shouted taking danner by the arm danner in turn held the unresponsive lu hao danner glanced back over his shoulder at knox if he spoke knox did not hear it with great difficulty the ferry crew held back the throng with billy clubs while admitting the guide danner and lu hao to the deck it was a horrific moment as chinese were beaten back onto the wharf grace looked away the three scrambled across the deck and were gone knox edged along the rail and grace followed he steered them toward the police line and reaching it cried out in shanghainese to be allowed through to his surprise two of the policemen parted he and grace and the children pushed through knox knowing his skin color had saved them they placed the children into the care of the hotel staff and then headed for the upstairs room grace was toweling off her hair youre a fool to have stayed knox said you are welcome she said continuing with the towel well stay here for the night he said ill take first watch ill wake you in three hours grace said a chinese woman traveling during national day holiday is no problem but with a waiguoren and one wanted by police thank you he said turning his back allowing her to change out of her wet clothing pm the bund just beyond the dongmen lu ferry terminal barges plowed through the whitecapped huangpu river despite the storm passing between them was a fourcar flatbed ferry with only one car on deck it was tossed like a toy as it crossed from the western banks of the bund toward the eastern banks of pudong inspector shen deshi had remained behind the wheel of the vehicle but only briefly he hadnt wanted to be separated from the duffel bag presently hidden beneath the back seat but the strain of the chains binding the car to the deck as the small ferry was tossed proved too terrifying for him hed paid the pilot a small fortune for the tenminute crossing but had no desire to show him the mongolians face he led his hostage out onto the stern amid the downpour it felt far safer out here for twelve years inspector shen had served the ministry of state security while carrying a peoples armed police id as cover twelve years of a pathetic salary of skillfully sidestepping troublethe protection rackets the smalltime scams and backroom payoffs that complicated a career twelve years of watching his fellow agents prosper around him for the past four years hed been one of a very few officers trusted to pursue corruption at all levels during that time he had uncovered tens of millions of yuansome of which had been offered to him as hush money hed never taken a fen now the decision of his career of a lifetime one he made without hesitation a hundred thousand us dollars another hundred and forty thousand yuan the mongol had carefully stacked into plastic bags and hidden in his wall all counted more than twenty years of salary finally an amount that could not be passed up he would be rich for the rest of his life provided he came up with an exit strategy that would not arouse suspicion he thought he knew just the man to approach about this but at present he had some tidying up to do he accepted the complications that came with such a decision some lives would be lost by his hand starting with the mongolian and the ferry pilot evidence would be destroyed lies would need to be carefully crafted throughout his career hed been required to beat suspects nothing new there no doubt some of them had died this wasnt so very different by now the waiguoren should be in jail or beaten at the hands of the precinct captain he would have to follow through with that the waiguoren would need silencing along with his companion simple enough if other obstacles surfaced they would be handled opportunity knocked he intended to answer i need for you to pay attention he said to the mongolian over the roar of the rain and the steady grind of the boat engine he unhooked a linchpin and opened the boats railing this ferry is going to pudong it is up to you whether one or two of us get off melschoi glowered searching for a way out of this he tested his wrists and ankles bound so tightly they were never coming off his only possible advantage in this impossible situation was that the cop was clearly uncomfortable on a boat he looked about to puke where was the video shot inspector shen hollered chongming island melschoi hollered back as a cop himself he knew this was no time to play coy who hired you i met the man only once no names a pig civil servant was threatening blackmail i took care of him a waiguoren no chinese a surveyor i killed the man a waiguoren was spotted he was making a video he did not belong killed him too you severed his hand i severed it all fucking journalists melschoi said excellent i dumped him like fish chum into the river inspector shen delighted in what he was hearing you are winning much favor with me neh and as to what he was filming i believe you must know then humor me inspector shen said what was the purpose of this laying of the asphalt a man does what he is paid to do why kill a man over something so mundane inspector shen asked i do as i am told but who orders such a thing my payments were left in the back of taxicabs or placed into sacks with takeaway food orders it was never the same and dont think i havent tried to find out i met the man and still do not know his name the fruit falls not far from the tree he is located in beijing this i know he is someone very powerful obviously his car carried shanghai plates but the car was loaned to him for certain shen deshi licked his chops if he could only identify the man he could use him to leverage his own situation the phone number then the fucking ebponthe foreignertook my phone the waiguoren would most definitely have to be found and dealt with shen owed the police captain another call certainly you must have memorized it my wrists and ankles then once ashore we will talk at a distance inspector shen grinned i should know better than to try to question a former policeman he crossed his arms to make his point but by doing so he lost his balance and staggered forward melschoi rocked and headbutted the mans knees inspector shen went over backward melschoi aimed for another head butt he took a shoe in the face his nose bent and bleeding shen deshi seized him by his hair and dragged him to the opening in the rail no melschoi screamed kicking out the phone number shen deshi thundered yours if you free me ill free you forever if youre not forthcoming shen deshi repeatedly kicked him in the chest and belly behind him the car groaned and cried on its chains the boat lurched side to side the fucking number shen deshi roared melschoi opened his mouth to answer but the ship rocked heavily and shen deshis next kick caught melschoi in the throat crushing his trachea and collapsing his larynx melschoi sucked for wind the boat rose and shifted again shen deshi lunged to stop him but melschoi slid off the wet deck and out through the open rail swallowed by the black waters of the huangpu saturday october am the bund by midnight the brunt of the storm had passed riot police had contained arrested and dispersed pieces of the mob knox monitored it all from the window while grace snored gently from the bed as the rain subsided the streets quickly drained and recovered from the flooding and thenonly in shanghaithe city sprang back to life as if nothing had happened detritus was cleared traffic began moving again people appeared on the streets from all directions taxis were running it was like kicking an anthill only to see the ants swarm back to work minutes later and begin rebuilding the hill he never woke grace for her shift he let her sleep when morning finally came and theyd eaten and knox had drunk multiple cups of black tea they spoke so here we are indeed she said i take it you have a plan the island he said she nodded your friend she eyed him furtively i know that i suggested this but i would rather not my preference is to start with marquardts hired driver or the hotel where he and song stayed you still love him he said westerners think in terms of love beginning and ending it is not so for the chinese the shortest distance between two points is a straight line whatever the driver can tell us is good youll call him and arrange a time to meet but the brother will know more than anyone i know about brothers time is critical sarge will be jailed if he hasnt been already i do not believe mr primer will allow him to be in such trouble she said even his reach only extends so far she shook her head in disbelief a single day in a chinese jail is one too many he said you will have no disagreement from me the brother then but call the driver first and arrange for him to drive us again that putupon look of hers please he said i believe that is the first time i have heard you use this word she said theres a first time for everything knox hotwired a toyota in the indigos parking garage he wore a pair of sunglasses to hide his eyes and a headband that covered his ears and makeup applied by grace that widened his cheekbones and narrowed his chinall in hopes of avoiding the prying eyes of computerized face recognition grace drove knox in the back seat so only a chinese face could be seen through the windshield the city had already emptied out by half traffic was lighter than usual they drove the tunnel to pudong headed for the ring road and eventually the hushan expressway toward chongming island the wind had died down the rain continued at a drizzle dark clouds threatened the farm roads of chongming island were debrisstrewn and partially flooded residents milled about looking dazed they reached the town of chongming for which the island was named thirty minutes later grace pulled the toyota into a semicircular driveway of a fivestory apartment building and parked she reached for the door handle be careful she paused to look back at him he saw sadness bordering on grief she said do not leave the car john you will stand out in this city this is not shanghai so marquardt would have stood out here as well he said knowing she exaggerated hotels and private car companies didnt exist for the pleasure of the locals much of the island was soon to be urbanized i can be less memorable than you might think there are closedcircuit cameras here as well she reminded she left the car knox looked around at the plain buildings that were a holdover of the mao era the gray skies the litter he wanted outside the apartment building wasnt much to look at its location nothing special chongming was a backwater island that no matter what amount of funds the government injected into its economy would never be much more than an outpost of rice paddies and pig farms grace knew all this had considered it important once but what she would have given what she would have changed in order to possess a key to the door she now faced her heart beating wildly she raised her hand to knock only to lower her arm to her side this was no ordinary door it opened to her past she wanted it to open to her future shed imagined and dreamed of this moment for six years now it suddenly felt too soon the doors fisheye security lens winked hed heard heror sensed her her heart fluttered she forced a smile for appearances sake and then knocked lightly wondering what was taking him so long hoping the lump in his throat was as big as hers the door opened slowly and there he stood before her imperiously formally capable of english or shanghainese they would speak their chongming dialect jian she said hed aged hardly at all though he had always looked older than he was he wore his hair shorter now more in keeping with his job as a civil servant his hands appeared smoother his nails immaculate the same quiet confidence showed in his eyes she felt slightly faint youya it warms my heart to see you you are as lovely as ever he sounded more formal than sincere she read meaning into his every gesture his every look he paused and said you will please come in she entered removing her shoes and placing her purse alongside them he showed her into a modest living room tea it would be my pleasure to prepare it she said sincerely i will be but a minute his rebuff hit her hard he wanted no such intimacy five minutes passed as he worked in the kitchen out of sight she took in the flatpanel television and dvd player the elliptical workout machine a rack of free weights the rainstained windows looked out on a seagray sky that was some storm she called out loudly we lost power for most of the night it has only come back on in the past hour she noted the apartment showed no sign of a womans touch perhaps the woman shed seen him with in lu haos digital frame had been but a fling on the other hand if he had married her mother never would have told her fearing she might do something drastic she spotted photographs of his family her breath caught spotting her own image among them she remembered the exact day at the market together remembered his smile she saw no other woman among the photos and took this as a very good sign this is oolong he said placing the tea tray down before her this is uncomfortable she said he laughed for you as well she inquired he tried to suppress his smile and she wondered why yes i suppose you never answered my letters she blurted out she had a million things to say but hated herself for breaking the formality what could i say he asked it was my fath i do not need to hear it again he said cutting her off your father is an honorable man i respect his wishes liar she wanted to shout you did not respect them at the time and had you come after me i would have eloped with you have you seen them he asked your parents no i came here first she paused to you he clearly didnt know what to say he made himself busy with the tea pouring it too soon lu hao is free she said he is by now out of the country and safe lu jian set the teapot down and bent over throwing his head into his hands sobbing she reached out and tentatively placed a hand on his shoulder wanting so much more sitting up wiping tears away he said how could you possibly know this distrustful she wondered how much to reveal it was i who arranged the job as you will remember i have heard nothing my parents have not been contacted no it is not official but you are certain yes of course will you excuse me please i will call my parents now and end their grief no jian pleasethere are complications i need your help with tears brimming in his eyes he said you bring me great joy chu youya great joy indeed i needa favor anything he bordered on euphoric you are an important civil servantif my mother does not spread foul rumor she exaggerates as always i am of little consequence i am afraid his ambition or lack thereof had been a sticking point for her father i hear you have risen quickly she had heard more much more but wasnt sure how to play her cards i have the benefit of unusual motivation he said his eyes boring into her his ambition was now to show her father wrong lu hao was over here in september yes visiting the family my mothers birthday you must congratulate her for me what of this visit lu hao saw a man he followed him to a remote location did he he spoke nothing of this with you lu jian shook his head this man he followed met with a prominent official did lu hao mention such a man to you i am sorry youya this placeit is a large blue building old like a factory chongming is in its title as in so many companies he said i do not know of such a place this official she said i believe it is possible that he may be connected to the construction industry that he may oversee or be connected to in some way such projects projects in the billions of yuan indeed with the selection of chongming as the seventh city it is entirely possible i do not doubt it such powerful men visit our city often these days fifteen years before the party authorities had identified seven cities all suburbs of shanghai to be incorporated into the city by rail highway and commerce thereby expanding shanghais territory chongming was the final area to be developed in the master plan it is important i identify the man lu hao observed at this meeting you have asked lu hao of course just a face to him nothing more she hesitated a life depends upon this information the life of a man who helped win lu haos freedom my immediate superior he sucked in air sharply his eyes lingered on her and she felt like a flower in the sun but then he looked off concentrating construction he echoed so much of it now in planning this is large very large something worthy of deception and betrayal of fierce competition among the heavyweights a hotel an office building what bigger my sense is land development something in the tens of billions of yuan his eyes flared tens of billions if you could ask around i need a lead to follow quickly i need to know what project might attract the attention of foreign construction companies foreign i have evidence that supports this you saved my brother i will do anything i do not wish you to take any risks these peoplewe suspect them of serious crimes we a coworker are you still betrothed he said as if the words simply escaped his eyes told her he wanted to take the question back she hung her head yes six years this man waits for you yes and sixty more you shame your parents it is true why must you ask she said he looked away i will make inquiries my brothers life is a debt i cannot ever repay there is no debt between us she said only the past he recoiled shed overstepped her bounds how do i reach you she wrote down the number for knoxs iphone you should not call from your phone buy a new sim card before you call for safetys sake he nodded you are in trouble i take precautions so should you you have come here at personal risk it is now a risk for both of us i am afraid your efforts must be quiet jian you must take great care trust no one the police not them either you can stay here with me her heart nearly burst this is very kind of you but sadly i cannot many know our historyyours and mine if inquiries were made authorities would look here first is it that bad i am afraid so if questioned you must take great care jian do not deny my visit tell them you sent me away tell them i came out of love not business that you sent me away never you must not incite their interest in you i have much guanxi here i have made many friends i would never believe otherwise tears threatened i must leave she said you have not touched your tea she reached out her hand and placed it onto his i have not touched you he allowed their touch to linger then he withdrew his hand and eased back his chair if such a project exists there will only be one that size i will look into it carefully he stood from the chair she walked to the door waiting for him to stop her instead she found herself awkwardly fumbling with her shoes she located her purse and stepped into the hall he closed the door behind her without a goodbye am chongming knox knew it wasnt easy stealing something in chinathere were too many eyes everywhere both human and electronic ignoring graces plea to stay in the car he hunted down side lanes where closedcircuit cameras were unlikely to be from there he stole two sets of license plates and slipped them up the back of his shirt speedtrap cameras routinely captured license plates if the toyota had been reported as stolen a data trail might already exist what brian primer said was true it wasnt worth having two or three people wind up in chinese jails in an effort to save one he had no intention of giving primer the satisfaction of being right because of this even after switching plates the toyota would have to be abandoned accommodations would need to be found with each challenge the probability of mistake escalated the longer they remained on the islandby definition a place with limited egressthey increased their chances of capture grace approached the car looking like shed been mugged knox kept quiet eyeing her from the back seat as she drove he will call if he uncovers anything she finally said providing he tries to uncover anything of course he will try face demands this of him we have rescued his brother he cannot repay this debt if he passed on you hes an idiot knox said her eyes flicked to the mirror marquardts driver knox asked he wasnt as convinced as she that marquardts secret trip to the island connected to the party member seen in the video the one whose name they needed but marquardt was connected to the mongolian through lu haos deliveries and the mongolian was connected to the heavyset government man so it wasnt impossible that marquardts trip here was related and they had nowhere else to turn he is to meet us in front of a mens club she said it is known to be frequented by the influential it is therefore one of very few places we can be sure has no cameras clever of you one of the advantages of island life very few secrets what about you grace what are your secrets and youre not allowed to say that if you told me they wouldnt be secrets anymore hed hoped he might win a smile from her he got nothing i will park the car we will leave separately and meet inside the club she turned a corner and slowed keep your head down you go first the establishments waiting area smelled of sandalwood incense there was an electric fountain plugged into the wall spilling water over a miniature landscape carved out of jade there was a curtained window above the back of a couch and two lovely young women in maroon qipaos behind an elegant counter a red dragon inlaid into black lacquer was coiled on the wall knox was greeted and welcomed both womens smiles slipping into girlish giggles a waiguoren in poor choppy english knox was asked if he would like a cocktail it was not yet lunchtime he ordered a beer the women in charge sat down across from him and explained the cost of club membership which was discounted if visits were purchased as part of a package he was told the cost of entertainment would be discussed once he was upstairs and his membership had been approved the beer was fantastically cold and easy to drink and if the hostesses looked anything like these two there was no questioning the popularity of the place grace entered and she sat next to knox the senior woman in the qipao clearly accustomed to female clients began pitching the membership to her as well vodka rocks grace ordered she rattled something in the chongming dialect at the hostess so fast that knox only caught a piece of itsomething about knox being her man and that after a drink shed be taking him home she laid a hundredyuan note on the coffee table and sat back comfortably her vodka arrived grace hit it hard and easily we all have our secrets he thought knox pulled out a fiftyyuan note and asked the hostess to sign him up and show him upstairs grace grabbed him by the wrist what are you doing the driver isnt here we cant just sit well attract attention what the hell was she thinking he drank half the beer in a few neat swallows ive been looking for a place like this my kind of relationship intense but quick then he added not too quick dont get the wrong idea shortlived is more what i meant sweetheart she said playing her part why dont you join me he offered us she released his arm i will not be here when you come down the vodka was gone the ice barely melted if you change your mind he said you know where to find me knox headed upstairs with the hostess below he heard grace calling for another vodka the secondfloor lounge housed seven womengirls some of themsome prettier than others some shopworn while trying hard not to look vacant he sat between two of them and ordered another beer he was nearly through the beer when grace arrived at the top of the stairs looking slightly drunk she said something caustic in shanghainese to the pretty girl next to him and took her place moving the girl over whats taking you so long she said pick one to be honest the oldest profession has never interested me call me a contemporary then why come up here to punish me you it has nothing to do with you then why i pinched a good deal of money off the mongolian if were caughtmore likely when were caught that money will be confiscated and end up in some cops home entertainment system here maybe it buys one of these fine specimens he said running his finger into the cleavage of the girl sitting next to him who grinned and placed her hand on his inner thigh a second career grace put her own hand into knoxs crotch and moved the girls hand things were getting interesting acting noble doesnt make one noble she said working the vodka thanks for that clarification he swilled more beer and drew an abstract pattern on its sweating glass so pick one he said someone deserving me why not im an equal opportunity employer the joke was lost on her he felt sorry for her and then wondered how many of her jokes he missed only to realize she didnt make jokes at which point he felt sorry for her again do you honestly believe we are not going to get through this he thought that was the vodka talking so he let the beer answer im hedging my bets you turn over rocks bad things crawl out and no thats not an american proverb just an observation he placed the beer down promising himself no more she drained the second vodka mmm she said im still waiting for you to pick one he answered when her look turned cloudy she will just send the money home she will be on her back once again tomorrow thats her choice how much ten thousand you would not how much did you take more than that she stared at him for what felt like several minutes he met her gaze looked away from it and met it again this one she said pointing across the narrow room the girland she was just a girlmisunderstood and rose her face beaming because shes the youngest knox said its not like that grace said its not her age the young girl stood in front of knox lightly swaying her hips and smiling devilishly you realize im missing out on the mileage points here he said whatever you do do not give it to her in front of the others grace said i trust youre talking about the money the vodka apparently caused immunity to his humor the girl clearly delighted in winning the favor of the waiguoren knox allowed her to lead him down the hall and into a comfortable though spare room he was studying the sad bed considering sleep and nothing more when he turned around she was naked having slipped out of the dress it lay at her feet small high breasts a flat hungry stomach more like nineteen or twenty comfortable with her nudity confident in her smile knox kneeled in front of her and she misunderstood widening her stance he lifted the dress up slowly covering her he turned her around securing the frog and loop at the top he passed her the bundle of yuan from behind speaking proper mandarin he said this is to be spent on the future not the present neh do not tell the others there are many jobs it is a bountiful time in all of china he kissed her at the base of the neck and drank in her intoxicating scent a knock advanced the opening of the door hes here grace said noon chongming grace negotiated with the cleanshaven young man who had driven allan marquardt for one weekend in midseptember she and knox occupied the center bench of the blue buick van the driver must have sensed the assumed value of the information he possessed yet grace bought his cooperation for seventyfive us dollars with another seventyfive promised on top of his hundredaday rate the driver remembered three men two foreigners from his description grace identified preston song and allan marquardt but was stumped by the third song had done most of the talking marquardt had had his head in his blackberry most of the time you will take us there now grace said we have an agreement lady the driver said something is not right grace told knox speaking in english because knox said why is he reminding me of the agreement knox leaned forward and spoke mandarin your mother will not recognize her son if you fail to hold up your end of agreement he leaned back in the seat but there is nothing to see the man replied craning back to look at grace i swear you will be disappointed farmland nothing more but you recall which farm roads she stated yes of course i grew up here so did i she said so do not try to play with me farm roads cousin i swear nothing more show us knox said grace looked at knox excitedly farm roads land development he heard her pride the sense of victory maybe the vodka grace leaned her head back sighed and fell quickly to sleep a smile faintly on her lips a few minutes out of town they timetraveled back two or three hundred years halfacre rice farms manicured to precise detail formed an uninterrupted patchwork decaying dwellings lined the roads young children led beasts of burden by nose rings or carried live chickens hanging by their feet where are we she asked the driver opening her eyes river road on way to chongan cun the driver said this is chongan cun precisely cousin you are indeed an islander he pulled the van to the side of the road this was our first stop how was it identified knox asked how did they direct you here village name the driver said only that knox asked nothing more specific village was name enough the driver replied only this one village grace inquired no next we went to wan beicun knox took pictures with the iphone take us there please knox said the going was rough and slow on narrow mud roads meant for tuo la ji and water buffalo they traveled through a halfdozen poor villages and arrived twenty minutes later at a crossroads again the van stopped this is it grace asked this was last stop before return to chongming your gps knox said pass it to me please knox accepted it and wrote down the current latlong location he asked the driver to point out their position on a map he carried knox spoke english to grace softly so the driver could not hear there was a second car service they took a second car grace faintly nodded damn she said it was the first time hed heard her swear that way no one driver had the full picture of the land parcel he said she nodded yes but not a single parcel too big for that it must be a project involving the expansion of several small towns something like that we will never know they have defeated us she said while she considered their failure knox was wondering how long it would take once they left the car for the driver to contact preston song and sell him the information that two people were trying to retrace his steps how long after that for song to notify the police we need more than this she said marquardt and song werent taking a sunday drive your instincts were right we have nothing but a pair of small villages the fortyminute drive back to chongming was interminable both of them exhausted knox fought to stay awake while she slept off the vodka they were dropped off and walked two blocks to the toyota knox was switching out the plates as his phone rang she listened spoke softly and hung up cradling the phone to her chest so knox asked lu jian has found nothing involving a land deal big or small nothing beyond the seventh city projects already announced and underway none involve chongan cun or wan beicun thats depressing but in the process of his asking around he turned up a news story worthy of our interest because a hitandrun fatality last month a surveyor by the name of yao xuolong a civil servant this man was struck and killed along the roadside near yuan liu qidui the driver was never found and it means yuan liu qidui is a small village also surrounded by nothing but farms she snatched the map from knox and took a moment to find it here you see when combined with the two locations they had just visited three quarters of a perfect rectangle were formedthat or a rightangled triangle it was impossible to miss the symmetry its massive knox said he provided me the mans familys home knox said im game it may be nothing a twentyminute drive a waste of time we need to get out of here knox reminded i trust that driver about as far as i can throw him you switched the toyotas registration yeah knox said but believe me theyre not that stupid pm huaxin zhen in a small office cubicle one of a hundred identical cubicles in a warehouselike facility in a northwestern district of shanghai a woman was alerted to a priority status license plate match she called up the source video recorded less than six hours earlier the plate belonged to a stolen toyota crossing over the bridgetunnel to chongming island in one video the face of a waiguoren was spotted looking out a rearseat side window her chest pounding she called her manager who assigned her additional eyes to help inspect plate capture video in an everwidening grid within twenty minutes the information was texted to the phones of all law enforcement officers including that of inspector shen who had traveled to chongming island because of the mongolians remark with the text shen now had reason to visit the local precinct and solicit manpower and information if during the arrest or incarceration or questioning of the waiguoren the man was killed accidentally it would be viewed as official business perhaps even attributed to the local police instead of him pm chongming island off a narrow hardpacked dirt road marked by a crumbling pair of stacked stone columns a rutted lane led into a compound of five timberbuilt houses the exteriors scabbing paint smoke rose from chimneys and hung in the air tasting of cooking oil knox and grace approached on foot a withered woman greeted them she wore a loosefitting white cloak under which could be seen the wide legs of simple threequarterlength pants of coarse cloth and ancient black cloth shoes that might once have been embroidered with colorful birds and peonies the grandmother grace said she is getting her daughter the white she wears is for mourning a woman in her forties wore her grief as fatigue in what had once been spirited eyes knox and grace were shown into a dim room and offered low stools around an open fire pit where a carbonencrusted teapot boiled and steamed knox kept up with introductions despite the womans difficult accent the grandfather was a clay potter this womans husband his apprentice the couples son yao xuolong had attended the local school and had gone on to be a surveyor grace explained that she and her foreigner friend had heard that the son had been involved with a project of enormous significance bringing great honor to the family and that his importance in the project could not be easily measured that they were interested in documenting the sons achievements the mother showed them a photograph of her son and then proudly carried on for fifteen minutes while knox and grace sipped green tea grace did not interrupt displaying an unusual patience a quality knox did not share with her now this charade the mother said angrily her eyes brimming with tears please explain grace said they know nothing of my son i explain to police many times and yet they sweep me out the door like dust what do they not know of your son his clothes lady he dies in his finest clothes those saved only for evening for town for courtship business he is found by the side of road in finest clothes but with the equipment for work not his own equipment either how is this possible i tell you it is not i do not know why these lies are told about my son but a lie is a lie the tears arrived she wiped them away how recent is this photo knox asked her not so very the woman said did he wear his hair like this shorter the woman answered you know the young people nowadays knox tried imagining this same man with shorter hair working to match him with the man in the video seen entering the factory it wasnt an impossible match how tall was your son knox asked one hundred sixty centimeters she said a little more knox did the conversion in his head fivefootfour or five a decent match with the victim he sat up taller his blood pumping tell us about this problem with the equipment knox said softly you said it was not his own what do you mean indeed not his the woman motioned to her husband whod been standing in shadow he immediately headed upstairs she then explained that her father had given the son the latest surveyors equipment upon his acceptance into civil service the equipment was expensive representing years of savings on the grandfathers part the dead man had taken great care of the equipment but hed been found on the side of the road in possession of stateowned equipment a contradiction that hadnt been explained the husband came downstairs holding a common plastic tote in one hand and a large plastic case in his other the tote contained the clothes the son had died in the shoesdress shoes knox notedhad adhered to the totes plastic knox pulled the shoes free and studied the clothing passing each piece to grace the mother sobbing spoke of her sons watch and shoes how he would nevereverhave worn either in his fieldwork knox had a tarlike substance on his hands from handling the shoes the father offered him a soiled rag and he cleaned up he opened the large case revealing a clean neonorange tripod and a hightech sextant knox studied the equipment its a sextant knox told grace with gps he emphasized sophisticated stuff must have cost a fortune knox asked the mother and father if he might inspect the sextant more closely he was granted permission knox switched it on a small green screen lit up revealing menus with chinese characters he moved through the menu as the others watched it records and saves the ten most recent locations he said speaking english something wrong the mother asked its all good knox said in english then mandarin this information helps us greatly he ran his finger along the second latlong wondering if grace recognized how close it was to the number knox had taken from the drivers navigation device only a few seconds off grace wrote down all ten coordinates do you have your sons cell phone knox asked the father returned upstairs and came down minutes later wearing a look of bewilderment he and his wife exchanged some heated questioning it is lost the mother told them ill bet said knox knox wanted to leave them money but grace stopped him from offering it was agreed they would buy several pieces of the grandfathers pottery which they did each piece was carefully wrapped in newspaper a timeconsuming process that left knox anxious as they reached the toyota knox already had the iphone out he input the first of the sextants coordinatesthe most recently recorded waypoint a blue pin dropped onto the phones map a second a third the line pointed back toward wan beicun hes a shrimpthe right height for the guy in the video knox said yes the guy in the video was also wearing decent clothes yes grace said so maybe its him and they dumped him away from the factory it is possible she said climbing behind the wheel knox worked the finger of his right hand shit he said what is it grace asked looking over my fingers are on fire he spit onto them crap pull over she gasped at the sight of the raw flesh chemical burn he said having seen similar things during his time in kuwait she pulled the car to a stop and knox jumped out washing his hands in a puddle he returned five minutes later better barely he said caustic stuff the shoes she said yes our boy was someplace nasty before he died like a factory she said we plot all the coordinates whoever did thisproviding were rightwanted his death to look like an accident a hit and run while he was surveying otherwise he just disappears so his disappearance would raise unwanted questions she said questions we must now answer for the next several hours they passed through tiny farming villages as they tracked the surveying equipments gps coordinates across a large area two of the ten latlongs closely matched locations theyd visited with marquardts driver chongan cun and wan beicun they stopped there grace studied the map upon which knox had drawn connecting lines are you still thinking its a group of small towns he asked hed sketched three sides of a perfect rectangle it is so large so much land measured in square miles not acres knox said he watched her studying it any ideas grace looked up and outside at the flat expanse of rice paddies stretching to the horizon it is a new city she said a resettlement city the chinese government occasionally created a new technology center or manufacturing district in a remote area and relocated millions of people to live and work there doesnt that fly in the face of chongming being the seventh city he asked not actually it supports it it is to be a resettlement city she said her voice more confident similar to one i once saw outside chengdu it was a new term knox had not heard and he said so china is no longer able to feed her people we import even basic food like rice the problem is farming efficiency we have over seven hundred million farmers yet the average farm is less than half a hectare our government has calculated we need a minimum of onepointfive hectare per farmer to be selfsufficient it means we must find new work for one out of every three farmers we are in the middle of the largest migration of humanity in the history of world she said sounding somewhat proud resettlement he said yes resettlement cities are built on empty tracts of land just like this she indicated the open fields highrise housing typically four to five million people million knox said trying to wrap his mind around it such a construction project would be worth billions of yuan he said fourteen billion seven hundred million to be exact the number the prize they sat in the idling car neither of them speaking for both it was an epiphany the weaving together of frayed ends for both their fatigue suddenly weighed even heavier i owe you an apology knox said marquardts trip meant something accepted lus red envelope knox said passed along by a beijing official the first two hundred thousand was likely for the coordinates so marquardt could visit the proposed property the process would be closed bids by seeing the property beforehand hed know the approximate cost of developing it refining his bid the second two hundred thousand was perhaps to buy the bid amount acceptable to the resettlement committee the fourteen billion seven hundred million this would allow marquardt to undercut all other bidders yao xuolong understood what he was looking at knox said its a small island he figures it out just as we have maybe he offers to sell the coordinates to yang cheng or another berthold group competitor or maybe he wants money to keep his mouth shut whatever his move it gets him killed but he knew who to contact she said he knew who to call how would he know the mongolian maybe he didnt knox said the government official she proposed its possible and if he figured out who it was so can we the only flaw in the trapezoidal shape formed by the coordinates was at the southeast corner where an irregular box connected the parcel to the shores of the yangtze river both of them spotted it i am familiar with that area of the island she said a long time ago it served as a ferry dock now it is warehouses and light industrial so they annex a piece of ground onto this new city ground thats already zoned for light industrial it offers a manufacturing area and river access makes sense to me she took knox by the hand your fingers burning light industrial chemicals he said chemicals she echoed pm hongqiao district goddamn chinese kozlowski blurted out to his wife as he hung up the phone honey she motioned to their daughter tucker who was playing on a dsi its saturday he said of a national holiday weekend and of all the days the lab chooses today to return a forensics report so theyre working but youre not if only please i have to theres a heavyweight cop involved with this and knox you know knox hes in trouble he is up to his keister i should have never answered the phone the call had explained that the severed hand retrieved from the yangtze was cut from a dead man not a living one the dna ided him as a caucasian with onegative blood flesh burns on the wrist were consistent with chemical burns soil samples taken from beneath two of the fingernails returned high traces of heavy metals mercury lead cadmium chromium and arsenic which means kozlowski had asked the lab technician the man replied these metals are in densities twentythree percent higher than shanghai garden soil shanghai garden soil who the fuck asked about shanghai garden soil this is soil from chongming island say again kozlowski said soil on chongming island is the only location for a radius of several hundred kilometers with this same approximate concentration of heavy metals kozlowski swallowed hard hed had two men following inspector shen deshi since their meeting at the kfc his men had lost him to a river crossing in the storm but had reconnected and followed him onto chongming island what kind of chemicals exactly kozlowski had asked continuing the conversation in combination with the chemical agents discovered on his wrist sodium hydrosulphide soda ash and sodium metabisulphite i might suggest a livestock tannery a tannery on chongming island kozlowski had mumbled correct the lab man said kozlowski had hung up fearing shen deshi was about to beat him to the physical evidence of an american videographers murder evidence the man would destroy as quickly as possible any chance at justice lost kozlowski made contact with his two agents hes in a police precinct in chongming stay with him kozlowski ordered if he so much as farts i want to hear about it pm chongming chongming island inspector shen deshi sat imperiously legs crossed in the corner of the brightly lit assembly room of chongmings psb fifth precinct he wore dark glasses he studied the group amazed at the youth of the precincts few patrol officers trying to remember if hed ever been that young his decision to keep the money had put him in a reflective mood the surprise on the mongolians face as hed slid off the ferry would not leave him perhaps hed been too hasty if wellconnected the mongolians employer could make hell for him so could kozlowski if any evidence surfaced that the mongolian had chopped the american cameraman to pieces he needed to pull a blanket over all of this and let it go to sleep a deep sleep and quickly before it got out of hand the police captain called his group to order their uniforms were loose and illfitting three were women two old dogs not yet thirty and one quite the stunner who managed to fill out her uniform nicely he thought this woman might accompany him on his rounds he listened to the captain detail the situation a fugitive foreigner considered dangerous in league with a chinese woman both wanted for questioning on multiple assaults possible kidnapping extortion and a homicide a big case on chongming island was a stolen water buffalo the patrol officers were collectively drooling at the thought of pursuing a reallife fugitive not because they would enjoy the pursuit which they would but because the only way out of a hellhole like chongming island was to gain the attention of ones superiors and request reassignment for the nine officers gathered their captain was waving a lottery ticket in their faces shen considered the stop a necessary diversion he wanted to establish himself with the local police in the event things went as badly as he expected they might and he hoped to wave the scent of the fox in the face of the hounds and send them scampering in the wrong direction leaving him to pursue the prize alone or almost alone the young female officer seemed worth taking along fifteen minutes later they were seated side by side in his car she hung on his every word knowing better than to ask where they were going i have contacts in the private sector he told her knowing he impressed her in this case its a crime lab used by the europeans and americans i was offered information an hour before the americans were to receive it i am looking for a tannery on the island one in operation in the recent past chongming tanning she said immediately what of it my late uncle on my mothers side worked there until it was closed by authorities the closing brought his family much hardship a blue building he said near water hed seen the mongolians video he was guessing it was near water because the cameramans hand had been found in the river the same please direct me to this place take a right at the next street she said shen steered the car sharply right she reached out to brace herself and leaned against him exactly as hed wanted how long he said ten fifteen minutes at the outside she said i like your mouth he said the shape of your mouth she blushed and looked away thank you he took her by the hair and turned her head to face him i would like it better in my lap she flushed her lips went white you do not wish to displease me neh he enjoyed seeing terror on her face the sense of power it instilled officers took sexual favors all the time but not shen deshi he intended to make up for lost time he slid his seat back and pulled her face into his lap you are about to earn yourself a promotion he said he nearly drove off the road as she finished him off his right hand down her shirt his left choking the steering wheel she collected herself and then it was as if it had never happened you will direct me to within a quarter mile of the tannery he said i will park someplace out of the way you will stand watch and notify me of anything out of the ordinary it is a deserted area she said after the tannery closed other companies moved out as well land any land was too precious to abandon why would they do this local committee declared the area a future park what was the real reason he asked there was no point in building a park on a sparsely populated island this was the only reason i ever heard tell me how did your uncle meet his end she said nothing for a moment illness cancer of the blood was he alone in this shen deshi said youll turn left soon she said pointing he swung the car left this road leads to river road then right on river road i see i picked the right partner he said you have done well she flushed with anger and embarrassment i am glad for the chance to work with you he said cooperation between departments is to be rewarded take the next right he traced her jawline we work well together is it not true he said she shivered looked as though she might be sick pull over please she called out softly shen deshi yanked the car to the side of the road the woman threw open the door and vomited pm chongming island through the haze the air over shanghai bulged as a pink smudge on the horizon nearing the confluence of the yangtze river and the china sea the shipping traffic spread out lowslung barges lumbered alongside towering container ships jets floated on final approach into pudong international grace drove the toyota now sporting a third set of license plates she turned the car off the river road onto a rutted mud drive entering an area of dirt and weeds and abandoned warehouses a gravel yards towering equipment was silhouetted by the last vestiges of the sunset its a ghost town he said climbing out grace joined him national day holiday cinderblock walls separated the abandoned buildings grace kept close to one as she led them away from the gravel yard i suggest you take up position there on the sand pile said the former army officer pointing to the gravel yard from there you will be able to see all the buildings it is good cover agreed knox said but youll be the one standing guard not me a chinese woman wandering around these places will be treated much more gently than a waiguoren she stopped too small to scale the wall but i can climb the walls without someones help he said smugly knox helped her over the wall then followed they cut across a mucky foulsmelling stretch of saw grass and mud and scaled a second wall into the gravel yard the sun sank into the layer of smog night fell quickly dusk lasting all of five minutes together they crawled up the sand pile winning an elevated view of the industrial buildings to their left third building over knox said thats not dirt asphalt i cannot read the sign from here if you could it would be the same sign as in the mongolians video speculation if you climb that conveyor youll have an even better view you have an extra phone or two so what give one to me and call me from up there if you see anything knox smiled at her nice try as a woman she said and a native of this island i have much better chance of talking my way out if caught as a man i dont talk my way out knox said my point exactly should talking fail neither will i if i need help i have you and how do you intend to get over the walls there is only the one wall she said pointing you see the second wall is crumbling not a problem then we go together he said you are a waiguoren i noticed it would be asking for trouble be reasonable dont ask the impossible help me over that first wall if i am not approached we will investigate together it was a compromise he could live withthough reluctantly knox handed her the phone minutes later he helped her over the wall and then watched as she climbed the conveyor that rose on a steep angle into the sky reaching the freshly paved compound grace stayed in shadow close to the wall her chosen route screened her from knox but was preferable to crossing the yard out in the open as she worked around the interior perimeter the buildings faded blue sign became not only legible but also recognizable chongming tanning only the first word had been captured in the video she bided her time in a dark corner and watched five minutes stretched to ten in the background she heard the rumble of passing ships the slap of river water the steady roar of frogs and night insects finally she positioned herself to match the angle of the video wondering about the latenight paving she crossed the asphalt trying to do so casually not sneaking up on the place but just out for a walk in case she was spotted she felt knoxs eyes on her back a pair of huge sliding doors formed the center of the structure they were padlocked with a new lock a second door for people was to the right it too was padlocked all the windows barricaded with a grid of welded rebar she returned to the center doors and found a few centimeters of play in the assembly she improvised a pry bar out of a section of discarded pipe with upward pressure the door on the right pulled off its track revealing a gap at the bottom she rested and then pried a second time when she leaned hard on the pipe the door swung out a foot at the bottom if she could block it there she thought there might be enough room to crawl through a twoperson job no doubt knox was watching her thinking the same thing she resented needing him to ask for his help was to invite him to join her and she did not want that the phone hed given her vibrated in her pants pocket she made no effort to retrieve it she didnt need his cynicism and sarcasm she spotted a pile of discarded cinder blocks ingenuity she thought focus commitment her army training returned effortlessly minutes later she heaved once again on her pry bar and simultaneously shoved a cinder block into the gap with her foot she lay flat and crawled through the narrow space elated that knox would never have made it she was inside perched on the exoskeleton of the conveyors steeply angled arm knox willed grace to answer the damn phone hed lost a pair of headlights coming up river road from the direction of chongming of the many explanations he considered the most likely was that the vehicle had pulled off the road and switched off its lightsa pair of teenagers seeking backseat romance a cop settling into a speed trap or something much worse as if to confirm her independence she wouldnt answer her goddamned phone never mind that hed been impressed by the ingenuity of her entering the building hed have gone after her if hed thought he might squeeze under those doors as she had but there was no way instead he concentrated on locating the vehicle belonging to the missing headlights a minute passed two three nothing maybe it had been lovers after all using the phones screen as a flashlight grace followed the bluish glow deeper into the tannery she passed steel carts fixed to tracks laid in the concrete floor giant metal vats lined the aisle on either side of her a tangle of plumbing the stench of bleach and chemicals over which hung the unmistakable fetid odor of decay her eyes adjusted allowing her to navigate by the phones glow more easily she passed beneath an elaborate network of catwalks tracks and winches a pair of forklifts sat like tusked animals alongside a central doublewide trailer an array of dozens of stacked fiftyfivegallon steel drums only as the buzzing of bluebottle flies rose like a chorus and the decomposition choked her did she sense what had happened rounding the corner of the doublewide she faced a line of steelframed butcherblock dressing tables beneath a set of fluorescent tube lights the dressing tables had their own sets of knives and cutting tools drains and pvc tubing ran to grates set into the floor she turned and retched the table nearest her had been cleaned too hastily flies clustered around bits of bone and flesh blood coagulated along the edges and the drains but it was the shredded pieces of bloodstained clothing that caught her eye frayed cotton and bits of denim a human slaughter not cattle for tanning yao xuolongs death had appeared to be a hitandrun not a butchering instinctively she backed away from the crime scene her shoes caught and she tripped reaching out for purchase she grabbed at a hanging chain but let go immediately the chain sticky with what she was certain was blood she brought the phones screen close not red or black but a leathercolored brown goo whatever it was came from overhead as a steady drip to the floor where it collected in a syrupy puddle by a drain she wiped her hand on a butchers apron hanging within reach her fingers began to warm then sting then feel as if they were rotting off her she hurried through the maze of floor machinery left right down a narrow aisle in search of a sink she reached an emergency chemical wash station placed her hands under the sunflower showerhead and bumped the lever with her knee nothing she hurried along the wall halfblind knocking tools and cans to the floor she found a wall sink turned the faucet and plunged both hands beneath the spit of water just as her phone rang the pain was too great to remove her hands she would call him back as soon as she got the chemical off her skin she grabbed a worn bar of soap and worked up lather slowlytoo slowlythe pain subsided her palms were raw and close to bleeding she connected her burns with knoxs from handling the surveyors shoes she wanted to tell knox what shed found but as she withdrew her hands from the water they hurt so badly she doused them again her phone buzzed for a third time she braved the pain and reached for it stuffing it into the crook of her shoulder and thrusting her free hand back into the water she awkwardly worked the phone shoulder to ear the device slipped and squirted out landing with a clunk and the sound of shattered plastic its screen went black pm chongming island an imposing figure took long strides toward the tannery and made no attempt to conceal himself a cop he was largeheaded but not wideshouldered enough to be the mongolian not tall enough for kozlowski knox called grace for a second and third time the phone jumped to chinese voice mailthe buildings superstructure defeating the reception he thought he kept track of the cop as he backed down the conveyor arm fearful he was silhouetted against the sky the cop turned once he made it through the yards front gate carrying something at his side a gun a tire iron chinese police were not permitted to carry handguns although peoples armed police officers were could this possibly be kozlowskis guy knox paused as the man angled toward him then continued down the rock conveyor as the intruder turned toward the tannerys doors a moment later a pair of loud metallic pops pierced the air knox vaulted one wall then the next he pulled himself up and held his head over the wall of the compound the man had pried the lock off the doors he was headed inside with the loud sounds at the doors grace shut off the water and ran for cover only as the pulleys whined did she realize it had been the doors coming open she cowered within the equipment as footfallsknoxmoved deeper into the building not knox the man trained a small flashlight on the floor she caught punctuated glimpses of his dark silhouette walking past the vats not as tall as knox but thicknecked with a head like a caveman the mongolian she wondered police security she slowed her breathing in an attempt to squelch her adrenaline rush she used the shifting light to plot her own course out of the building staying low she inched her way down the aisle dodging the boxes and tools shed spilled halfway to her freedom her curiosity got the better of her she turned and followed him like her he seemed to be taking inventory of the placehardly the actions of a man returning to a crime scene or a security man who knew his beat she knew better than to stay but was drawn to him he reached the dressing tables and like her studied them long and hard a cop judging by his confidence and his methodical nature his flashlight swept the tables and the cutting tools the drain in the floor it found the chain and followed the dripping goo to the puddle then up to the drums he removed his leather coat and hung it carefully over a valve stepping incredibly close to where she hid she could see a wellworn leather shoulder holster beneath his left arm if he was a cop then maybe he was an officer of the peoples armed police kozlowskis iron hand the man ran a faucet and got a stream of water going from a hose she hadnt seen he washed down the soiled dressing table she choked back her surprise he was destroying the very evidence that kozlowski had told knox both men wanted why not preserve evidence that might work against the mongolian the answer seemed obvious because there was no mongolian his mobile phone pealed metallica he returned to his coat and answered the call speaking curtly knox hung from the compound wall peering inside he didnt want to jeopardize grace if shed managed to hide or escape he didnt want to leave her if shed been discovered and abducted he schooled himself to have patience to let the situation develop he had just climbed to the top of the wall as a pair of headlights swept the asphalt he lay down flat a range rover swung onto the fresh asphalt aimed at the open doors the driver climbed out steve kozlowski knox nearly called out but stopped himself as he realized kozlowski was meeting up with some chinese copa badass cop according to kozlowski himselfand on a saturday night on a holiday weekend at a remote location kozlowski bent the consulate man left the range rover running and the headlights filling the doors he entered the tannery with a commanding authority a takenoprisoners stride knox rolled and dropped off the wall he ducked low and ran for the range rover headlights lit the tannerys interior walls as grace moved to the far aisle and climbed a ladder to an overhead catwalk she lay down on her belly and watched the man hosing down the dressing table he worked quickly now in an almost maniacal effort a second man appeared in silhouette at the doors he walked like he owned the place turning she caught him in profile and nearly gasped he fit knoxs description of the consulate security chief kozlowski interesting bedfellows kozlowski broke his stride to grab a length of pipe as he continued deeper into the facility led by the spray of water maybe not bedfellows he arrived to within several meters of the chinese man the water ran red into the drain dont do that kozlowski said in english step away now shen continued his work go away mr kozlowski it is no concern of yours you are destroying physical evidence of a possible homicide of a us citizen step away and desist shen deshi said coolly i advise you to go away now you are trespassing you have no authority to be here i will not have you destroying evidence you will stopor i will make you stop kozlowski raised the pipe if you remain here in this place you do not belong i will bring the charge of industrial espionage a government spy do you really want such trouble destroying the blood evidence will not make the case go away i assume you intercepted the forensic evidence intended for me i know nothing of what you speak shen deshi turned around the hose splashing water onto the concrete floor do not be naïve mr kozlowski you have a hand found in the river no body you are prohibited from investigating in this countryan act you are currently engaged in you are inside a facility of a private company which constitutes industrial espionage how much trouble do you want for yourself kozlowski said chemicals and soil samples from the hand link directly to this facility the hand is caucasian the dna will come back for the missing videographer an american i am within my rights to protect evidence the scientific link caused graces heart to flutter a murder had taken place here possibly more than one lu hao would never be safe his plan to kidnap himself seemed suddenly much more understandable when do you expect the results of a dna test six weeks eight weeks do you want to spend eight weeks in a chinese prison be my guest even if you prove such a connection this cameraman was far from his assignment this too smells of us spying you will be tied to him and him to you is this what you want for us consulate this is violation of agreements made between our sovereign nations very bad for everyone step away shen trained the hose back onto the dressing table you must leave now he said last chance i do not wish such trouble on you of all blessings charity is the highest a us citizen has been murderedmost likely by a chinese we both know this kozlowski said he lowered the pipe raised his phone and took a photo destroying evidence is also a crime with the flash of the camera phone shen deshi dropped the hose and marched toward kozlowski withdrawing his handgun stupid fool drop the pipe keep both hands in view you cant be serious your cia uses a cameraman a member of the xuan tower documentary crew to attempt to embarrass chinese government or to challenge the wto environmental agreement who knows what might be the reason more american tricks thats nonsense lower the pipe kozlowski lay down the pipe it clattered against the concrete hands behind your back he waved the gun onto your knees you arrest me it will be a national incident think how that will affect your career it is already a national incident espionage is no game do not worry about my career mr kozlowski worry about your health in chinese prison how your family will cope i have diplomatic status shen deshi stepped forward with astonishing speed for such a big man he pistolwhipped kozlowski stunning him he cuffed the mans hands behind his back removed kozlowskis cell phone and disassembled it onehanded he smashed all the parts with an angry foot up shen said ordering kozlowski to move grace used the commotion to cover the sounds of her climbing down from her perch she hurried toward the open doors staying low and moving fast a second car arrived trapping her she settled into a tight spot alongside one of the large vats the driver of the second car was a young woman wearing a police uniform she entered and helped inspector shen move kozlowski toward the yard shen directed her to drive the prisoner into shanghai and drop him at an address he recited i will call ahead he said to her much will be made of your cooperation kozlowski said to the inspector you are bringing a shit storm onto yourself this foulmouthed waiguoren will tell you a dozen lies shen told the young woman all foreigners have golden tongues pay him no mind yes sir commendation and promotion must certainly follow on the heels of such loyalty and the expert conduct of ones duties it sounded like a rehearsed speech she slipped behind the wheel of the range rover shen put kozlowski into the back seat tying the seatbelts shoulder strap tightly around the mans neck the recoil mechanism held kozlowski upright if he leaned forward he choked beat the damn spy with your flashlight if you have to he told her he deserves every blow gladly she answered shen shut the car door banged on the side of the vehicle and it drove off he returned inside holstering his weapon and then lengthening his stride as the second car arrived knox slid beneath kozlowskis range rover and hid he overheard much of what went on inside and moved to the second car in hope of stealing its keys or rendering it useless if he could get kozlowski and grace into the range rover he quietly opened the sedans door he punched the jambs interior switch preventing the inside light from turning on the keys were in the ignition he banged his head into the rearview mirror dislodging it reached up to try to leave it close to where it had been it was aimed into the back seat knox froze as he saw a black strap protruding alongside the center seatbelt clasp a nike swoosh from the back seat of the range rover kozlowski realized his diplomatic plates would work against him no traffic cop would dare ticket the car or pull it over she drove around the tannery and aimed for the front gate one of his daughters puzzle books stuck up from the seat pocket the sight of which caused a knot in his throat hed run out without so much as a goodbye for all the fairytale endings as a man in service to his country he knew how the final acts to most such lives played out a blindfolded and handcuffed body found slumped and collecting flies in a city dump or along a shoreline pleading his case with his driver wasnt going to cut it once he was in chinese custody his life was all but over the range rover slowed to clear the posts defining the compounds front gate kozlowski leaned the seatbelt tightened around his neck the driverside window exploded a mans hand appeared and the cadets head rebounded off the steering wheel the hand tripped the door locks and the drivers door came open the car still rolling the slumped cadet was pulled from the seat and john knox took her place knox must have tried for the clutch but he hit the brake and the car stalled knox reached for the ignition a shot rang out exploding the rear window shen deshi screamed in mandarin stop or i will shoot he was close he had a good shot at the back of kozlowskis head with his neck held by the seatbelt kozlowski wasnt moving i will shoot him shen called out again this time in english maybe you make it maybe not knox gripped the ignition key more firmly he slipped the gearshift into reverse now out of the car you the driver you shoot him ill run you over knox called through the blownout window so youd better make the first shot count knox kozlowski hissed from the back seat youd better make damn sure you kill me too because im only going to cripple you with the car ill save the good stuff for last you talk too much shen called out get out of the car now knox swung his legs out are you out of your mind kozlowski said grace swung the pipe intending to strike the mans right arm and break it while simultaneously crushing his ribcage shed come up from behind the man while knox bought her time by keeping the conversation going she wasnt going to kill a chinese copbut if she had her way he might wish she had she drove the pipe with the power of a tennis serve she felt things disintegrate with the contact the cop folded in onto the blow dropped the gun and then sagged left tumbling over grace kicked the gun away and raised the pipe where he could see her prepared to take a head shot if necessary shen deshi had no intention of going down at the hands of a woman his broken and dislocated arm clutched to his fractured ribs he sprang from the asphalt and knocked her back the pipe clattered he reached for it instinctively but screamed behind the pain his right arm useless grace rolled over the fallen pipe the cop kicked out but only grazed her the next kick landed however just below her ribs and the next in her hip knox connected with the cop in a football tackle knocked him five yards into the backfield and hammered three consecutive rights into the mans dislocated shoulder the cop let out a cry the cop then backhanded knox across the cheek wheeled around pivoting on the ball of his left foot and connected his heel into knoxs face knox hit the asphalt hardtoo hardand saw stars shen blocked the pipe as grace swung it he took hold of it and twisted it from her catching her off guard he owned it he took a swing but she jumped back the waiguoren was up on his feet but dazed the mans nose was bleeding his eyes unfocused he lowered his head and charged like a bull shen couldnt believe itthe waiguoren was a dead man he hoisted the pipe high overhead bearing down with all his power the pipe stuck behind him wouldnt pull forward he spun around it was the cocksucking cadet both hands on the pipe a defiant look in her eyes she held to the pipe the waiguoren hit him so hard he lifted up off the asphalt and landed with two hundred pounds atop him he cried out as his opponent took him by the shouldersthe shouldersand smashed him to the pavement once twice darkness grace held the cops gun trained on the cadet who stood there with the bloody pipe in her hand breathing heavily her eyes locked onto the fallen man for a moment the three of them looked back and forth at one another exhausted paralyzed there will be no killing here knox told the cadet in mandarin enough killing grace was thinking surprised by knox again he will not dare to report this grace said to the girl too much he cannot explain drop the pipe and walk away drop the gun the young woman said grace ejected the magazine and placed it down onto the asphalt by her feet she retained the handgun and the one bullet remaining in its chamber together she offered the cadet nodded grace and the woman moved in concert placing the pipe and the gun down nearly simultaneously we can drop you somewhere knox offered in mandarin the woman spat onto shen deshi she backed up facing them until reaching the range rover she finally turned and walked off into the headlights and down the river road in no particular hurry what if he can give us the name grace asked knox looking at the fallen policeman this guy it would take a lot of good drugs and a couple weeks to get his own name out of him we justleave him im open to suggestions knox said rubbing his head to make sure it was still attached to his body we have nothing for all this we gain nothing we have kozlowski we have the tannery and whatevers beneath the asphalt the waypoints of one massive chunk of land the chinese have this place she corrected any evidence will be long gone by morning americans cant investigate anyway grace walked closer to the fallen iron hand and kicked him hard enough in the shoulder to make sure he wasnt playacting ill do it knox said grace reloaded the magazine into the handgun and held it on the man as knox searched him he found his phone and smashed it he found a wallet and a passport belonging to a mongolian he passed these to grace that answers that knox said every bone in my body says not to leave him herenot alive she said not like this hey the girls prints are on the pipe you want to cap him be my guest we can put this on her but you said listen that was for her sake im trying to be supportive here she allowed a small laugh to bubble up from inside her for the second time she disassembled the handgun this time throwing the pieces into the field thats the first time ive seen you laugh knox said his car she asked knox reached into a pocket and dangled the keys always a step ahead john knox not always he said sometimes sometimes is good she said very good knox slammed the range rovers hatchback into place hed taken a moment to put the section of pipe into the backthe pipe containing the cadets fingerprintsas evidence in the event the inspector did not survive his injuries he wanted all the bases covered what the hell are you doing here kozlowski said immediately after being untied from his noose knox occupied the front passenger seat grace pulled the drivers seat forward and adjusted the rearview mirror she drove youre welcome knox said im serious kozlowski said i saw you pull up i thought you were bent imagine my surprise what the fuck were you doing here knox your work for you the work you asked me to do dont mess with me a surveyor here on the island knox said was killed and his death made to look like an accident chances are he was attempting to blackmail the beijing higherup you and i discussed this because hed figured out what he was surveyinga new city development that will eventually hold four million people my guess he wanted money to keep his yap shut so the mongolian shut it for him what mongolian and lu hao saw the whole thing so did your onehanded cameraman only the onehand part came later kozlowski leaned back and rubbed his neck youre an asshole knox and grace spent the next hour filling kozlowski in on what they knew and still had yet to find out you demanded i find the name of the government type in the video knox said you put dulwichs life in hock for that how do you think i feel about that and i care because kozlowski said more to the point how would the consul general feel about that this is not the road you want to go down kozlowski said he wasnt talking mapquest we give you everything weve got you let the intelligence community run with it but you get sarge out of huashan hospital and the three of us out of the country by noon tomorrow weve put in our time he saved your life grace said the car engine hummed the highway was alive with a million cars again it was as if the storm had never happened they sat in traffic for twenty minutes trying to get over the lupu bridge i love this city knox said i hate this place kozlowski complained after a moment he spoke again you said the berthold group was attempting to buy the acceptable bid price on this new city project and that thats where the government official comes in i said thats how it looks grace tossed the mongolians credentials into kozlowskis lap my guess knox said is your best witness is going to report late for work youre right about our guys if theres a connection between the tannery and a committee member in beijing theyll find it its there knox said but its not like we can out him regardless of who it is because because were americans we dont investigate kozlowski reminded and there is the matter of face grace said knox sighed it would be great dishonor and shame for the chinese governments internal corruption to be exposed by a bunch of foreigners it would never be admitted no matter how obvious so we did all this and we have to sit on it knox asked irritably allan marquardt started all this kozlowski said hell pay allan marquardt played the hand he was dealt give me a break like hes the only american company paying out incentives hes the only one weve caught kozlowski said this week by the time marquardts books are audited knox said glancing over at the driver theyll be clean as a whistle thats not right kozlowski said tic knox answered i know a way grace said winning the attention of both men a way to keep this chinese believe me kozlowski said its already very chinese you have my attention knox told grace if mr kozlowski can determine the identity of the corrupt official there is someone who will gladly turn over this official to authorities without revealing his sources several minutes passed traffic picked up some kozlowski said youre telling me lu hao ended up at that tannery the same night as the videographer go figure knox said you make your own luck lu haos turned bad very bad grace said its a toxic site knox said rubbing his burned fingers together its not much of a stretch to see them paving it over to hide the contamination this has a much greater significance grace said again winning their attention chinese law is very specific as to cleanup of such sites it falls upon the developer of any land parcel not the owner knox said how could that be shes right kozlowski said its only been on the books a couple years a us firm tested this law and lost i might add the original owner of the property is held responsible to protect the public from contamination and thats all in any subsequent development of the property the developer is responsible for the cleanup the idea being as warped as it is to us that the original owner may lack the funds for full cleanup so had marquardt won the bid he would be stuck with the bill knox asked thats not right shit kozlowski said waiguoren grace said you see apparently not knox said mr marquardts own greed is used against him mr marquardt wants to win the new city bid so badly and the tract of land is so enormous he cannot do the proper due diligence time is of the essence its entrapment in fact there are millions of us dollars worth of hidden costs in the cleanup of the tannery marquardt wins the bid but loses money when his costs run over loses face this works out well for chinese who wish to see waiguoren like marquardt fail and its damn convenient for the original owner of the tannery knox said so thats where we start kozlowski said we knox said fuck you kozlowski said knox leaned his head back against the headrest grinning and immediately fell asleep pm the bund the ministry of state security superintendent occupied a red leather chair behind a plain and unattractive desk in a small gray office with no view overweight and jowly he had wet lips an auditors scowl and an impatient disposition shen deshi wearing a sling a piece of his head shaved and stitches showing tried to look confident in the uncomfortable chair facing the man what a cockup the superintendent said speaking shanghainese i would ask you to repeat all that but i dont wish to hear it if the americans push to bring charges against you yes i understand you took him at gunpoint shen kept his mouth shut his forehead and upper lip were perspiring telltale signs of weakness the superintendent could cut his balls off if he wanted you were to secure any evidence of environmental contamination to tidy up any loose ends before this hand recovered from the river spread trouble like a disease shen deshi shrank in the chair instead we face a possible inquiry from the americans if id wanted this kind of attention id have hired a public relations firm shen looked to buy his way out he collected himself and spoke with courage i have some physical evidence outside he said that implicates the american cameraman his video camera destroy it you fool of course as you wish the last thing we need the superintendent said there is another matter shen said leading up to his moment of truth explain one hundred thousand us he said also one hundred forty thousand yuan the superintendent lit up like a dragon boat festival parade he squinted at his major and rubbed the back of his pudgy right hand across his lips what is it you propose he pulled open a drawer and lit a cigarette located a chocolate bar and broke off a chunk and stuffed it into his pink hole smoke escaped as he spoke and chewed please major i retired last week should an inquiry arise i was acting on my own i was thinking the same thing the superintendent said i will have the paperwork prepared lay low for a day or two i will call off the search for you within fortyeight to seventytwo hours just long enough to look like we gave it an effort shen deshi nodded as you wish this is good for us the superintendent said us was all shen heard indeed your integrity has never been questioned shen swallowed dryly i thank you superintendent and the evidence the contents of the duffel remain unreported i came to you directly as you advised therefore not filed not recorded we do not want such evidence filed its a fucking mess smoke surrounded him now precisely so sir so it must be decided what to do with thisevidenceno doubt no doubt the man wanted shen to propose the alliance he would not do so himself i could turn the funds over to pap one possibility or attempt to return it to those who paid it out kidnapping ransom a western insurance company no doubt they will hardly miss it this had occurred to me also shen said his heart quickening yes there must be another solution the superintendent said the moistness of his lips had spread to the butt end of his cigarette which was now smeared with chocolate hmm he said encouraging his major it had occurred to me how much good such funds could do for schools for earthquake and flood victims but of course it could never be seen to come directly from the ministry heaven forbid but individuals thats another matter entirely the superintendent said if we were to saydivide the sumsin a percentage that takes into consideration your seniority of course superintendent my ten years with the ministry your fifteen say sixty forty seventy thirty sixtyfive thirtyfive agreed we could oversee the distribution of the sums far more responsibly than any bureaucracy like the ministry your point is well taken well said major yes i see the clarity of your thought on this matter he hesitated when can we see to this resolution at your convenience of course not here the park this evenings tai chi a bench in the park of course shen deshi said do not disappoint me no second thoughts hmm no sir shen deshi could only imagine the hell that would befall a man who crossed ho pot dismissed the man said shen deshi stood painfully and slowly the ministry of state security was commissioned to combat corruption and corporate environmental abuse he marveled at the irony lets get one thing straight the superintendent said technically this is not blood money he was asking not telling he didnt want to hang for the offense shen deshi thought of the mongolians face as he slipped off the boat he thought of the butcherblock table inside the tannery where the mongolian had filleted the cameraman the buzzing of the flies no of course not he said just lost and found lost and found yes well then lets get on with it shen dragged himself to his car with great difficulty he unlocked it and deciding to check on his future opened the back door and leaned inside opening the back seat could be a hassle the mechanism jammed even when a duffel bag was not packed beneath it and so it did again given his cracked ribs and bad arm shen could hardly move much less heave the hinged seat forward but he finally gave it one strong pull and the seat came open it was said that when one died his life passed before him from childhood to the present that the gates to heaven were more a mirror than a door shens life flashed before him and yet except for some broken bones he lived the back seat was empty it took him a moment to process not only the reality of his situation but its enormity he moved the seat back and forth as if a heavy duffel might have slipped out onto the car floor when the seat came open hed hidden the money there himself had been in the car with it all but the few minutes the whore hed left her in the car while hed gone to inspect the tannery shed pulled the car around following the americans arrival he brooded over what the hell to do about it while from the back of his mind raised the greek chorus run sunday october am luwan district shanghai shortly after breakfast the following morning grace received a call from lu jian shed told neither knox nor kozlowski about soliciting her former lovers help as a civil servant lu jian had access to information it would take even us intelligence days or weeks to collect and analyze wei she asked it is not a single owner lu jian began as if midconversation the tannery it was owned and managed by a company with a tenperson board of directors the company ceased doing business and the tannery was closed two years ago when the environmental laws went into effect she said the timing would be right are you going to tell me what this is about are you able to identify the members of the board of directors i have done so already i really do love you you know that it was the wrong thing to say and she regretted it immediately shed been on a high since arriving safely at the consulate for a moment she thought hed hung up on her i can give you the names do you have a pen he asked all business she wrote down the chinese characters slowly and carefully and read them back to lu jian and he listened and did not correct her is that it then he asked was it she wondered i hope not she said i received word from lu hao he is indeed safely out of the country as his older brotherhis familyour debt to you please there is no debt i wish to express our sincere appreciation he said very formally for a starter you could visit me in hong kong she said chinese women were expected to be much more guarded than this she hoped it wouldnt push him even farther away yes of course that is if you want to she said what one wants and what one accepts are very different you have my address she said it has not changed you are leaving the country then he asked somewhat anxiously she reveled in hearing that tone from him she said nothing allowing it to replay in her head over and over as soon as possible today tomorrow i see its a short flight an easy flight but for me a journey ill be expecting you he hung up grace placed the phone down and stared at it again reliving the conversation looking for nuance recreating it in ways that revealed hidden meaning a knock on her door brought her back it was knox pm grace passed the board member names on to kozlowski and rode the next several hours on a roller coaster of emotions knox napped for twenty minutes then worked down two more cups of tea she spent her time alone by a window of the consulate guesthouse living room looking out into sunlit gardens steam rose from the soil it was going to be a hot day a while laterit seemed liked hours but it was nota marine led them across to the mansion house they were shown into kozlowskis office it felt to knox like the last time hed visited had been six months earlier it had been a matter of days first kozlowski said hed showered and shaved and changed clothes though had not yet been home to his family the us government has no knowledge of the members of the prcs resettlement committee understood knox said he was telling them he had full knowledge of that very information second im continuing to explore the possibility of using back channel diplomacy to expose this official but im told that will likely not happen i have a way around that grace said please continue kozlowski passed a handwritten note across his desk to grace we have a match one of the tannery board members serves as chairman of the resettlement committee his name is zhimin li chairman zhimin li grace broke into tears tears of relief knox thought grace has a plan knox said which is kozlowski asked do you really want to know kozlowski shook his head i suppose not youre going to have to smuggle us out of here knox said in case shen deshi and his boys are watching the place grace explained to a perplexed kozlowski this cannot be done over the phone and the contact i have in mind would never allow himself to be seen entering the us consulate pm with knox wanted for questioning on multiple assaults and grace having been identified as an accomplice the idea of leaving the protection afforded by the consulates diplomatic immunity was gutwrenching any number of ideas had been put forward from grace acting aloneher idea to the use of consulate vehicleskozlowskis to a simple ruseknox in the end it was the consul general a woman of outstanding character whose husband ran a b b in northern idaho and who had come to the job in a time of turmoil because of the world financial meltdown who stepped up at four pm with dusk approaching the consulate generals marinedriven black suburban pulled out of the consulate gates as it often did at this hour she jumped out of the car and began railing in mandarin at the chinese national guard up the street about the lax security at this same time the day laborers left the compound on foot as they always did gardeners mechanics maintenance men waitstaff housecleaning among them were knox and grace he slouched and wore makeup to darken his face and a tam to cover his head twelve workers walked the length of the street and rounded the corner to a bus stop two of them kept on walking pm the bund on the deserted seventhfloor terrace of m on the bund knox looked down through binoculars at the congested swarm of people populating the bunds riverside promenade the sunlit afternoon had brought twenty thousand tourists mostly chinese crammed in to get a piece of the famous view across the huangpu river among the steel and glass towers rising into the sky was the xuan tower its scaffolding torn and dangling shredded tarpaulins flapping in the aftermath of the typhoon there was no manpower to clean it up every construction project in the city had suffered staggering losses due to the storm his iphone in hand knox kept watch on the promenade for a red umbrella carried as a parasol despite the setting sun eventually he spotted it coming from the proper direction knowing grace hid beneath it as she climbed the promenade steps to join the masses on the river walk it joined other umbrellas and parasols along with baby strollers balloons and stick kites the umbrella stopped in the center of the choke and waited a black bentley arrived at the curb a man wearing a dark suit was let out the back by a busy chauffeur though the passenger appeared to be alone knox and grace knew better yang cheng was never alone ive got you hes on his way up knox said speaking into the iphone it is so crowded came her reply police ive got two by the subway entrance on your side of the street two more up by the peace hotel this is normal yes all right stand by she left the call open as planned allowing knox to overhear she would dangle the ear budmicrophone around her neck like an ipod on pause grace hid below the red umbrella finally angling it to make eye contact with yang cheng as he stood next to her the claustrophobic press of chinese tourists disturbed her she tried to blot them out to make it only her and this man as shed been trained but it wasnt so easy they spoke english because the majority of those around them did not i can deliver the name of a minister with accompanying evidence to the anticorruption authorities there will be no choice but to void the berthold groups contract on the xuan tower and reassign it he drew in sharply as if shed hit him if there hadnt been so many people around she might have heard his heart beating from three feet away while interesting it is not this i seek he said calmly what you seek is fools gold the strike price for the new city bid she said his eyes widened despite his attempt to keep them from doing so it is a trap meant for the waiguoren is that so the parcel was annexed to include what will turn out to be a contaminated site he whistled unintentionally as he drew a breath in through his teeth i save you much face and a great deal of money you would say anything to improve your situation you and the foreigner are wanted by police fourteen billion seven hundred million yuan she said he was focused on her unmoving as people teemed around them but if you act upon it you will rue the day believe me the plan was to have the expense fall upon marquardt what i have for you is far better the name of the person who leaked the number you may not be praised publicly but we both know you will be richly rewarded for bringing such a man to ground and in return an insignificance he huffed that i doubt an american in hospital a trifle its a standing request of the consulates this american his release yes from the hospital there may be the intent to question him to trouble him but he is not well an insignificance hardly by comparison she said yang cheng debated all this internally the choice is yours but the offer will be made elsewhere if you pass what else yang cheng asked sensing it in her the four of us will not appear on any watch lists or wanted lists my citizenship and visa status and that of lu hao remain unblemished clean slate face yes a man cannot promise such things these take time and expend much guanxi precisely why i have come to you honorable yang you have twentytwo hours to free the man hospitalized she said absurd two weeks or more a single week if im lucky you will explore possibilities when the man called david dulwichthe american in hospitalarrives to the consulate you shall have the name of the corrupt official and all evidence by this time tomorrow i will seek another to do business with this is not business it is extortion business makes for strange bedfellows she said we will always have a place at yang construction for one as cunning as you ms chu you have my number grace collapsed the umbrellaher signal to knoxand moved into the throng yangs man joined him at his side and shot a look back at her she recognized him as one of the two from the alley attack she pushed north through the crowd trusting that knox was watching her she returned an ear bud do you have me she asked wave he said she lifted her arm i have you youre clean he paused what was all that visa nonsense this is my family home lu haos family home we cannot return here if we are fugitives you attached it to sarge that wasnt our agreement we did not have an agreement john we had an understanding ten minutes later a black range rover pulled to the curb in front of the peace hotel the cars rear door swung open a tall man and a petite woman climbed inside and the door closed the range rover pulled back into traffic monday october am luwan district shanghai the rain had begun falling heavily again an hour earlier knox grace and kozlowski stood on the mansion steps under the cover of an awning just beyond the consulate gates still in chinese territory an ambulance waited a single red light spinning above the windshield the gates opened and the security blocks lowered the ambulance did not move come on knox said willing it to cross onto american soil grace held knoxs iphone to her ear katherine please she said the ambulance is at the gate she rolled her eyes at knox they had been waiting for yang cheng to pick up she covered the phone with her palm and whispered he is not going to do this over the phone he is too careful then what here knox said where i believe it is more a question of how grace said yang will not risk being seen or overheard taking a name of a chinese official from an american and then later turning this same man over to authorities he obviously understands we could be playing him that it all could be an elaborate trick of us intelligence and of course hed be right kozlowski allowed given that us intelligence was smart enough to dream up such a ploy to remove a top official by rumor and innuendo would be a coup grace cradled the phone to her cheek katherine please inform mr yang the offer is good for forty minutes i will be waiting at the front gate at the us consulate on wulumuqi i will turn over the information to either you or mr yang no one else she ended the call the red light pulsed across their faces why knox said imploring her she answered if they send someone from the ministry for instance there is no guarantee the deal for mr dulwich will be honored but yang will honor it knox asked sarcastically of course because face she answered absolutely he will not go back on his word this i promise knox carried an umbrella for grace as he escorted her to the front entrance security check and then stood at the gate to get a better look at the ambulance the music of u escaped from a humvee manned by a lone marine who guarded the gate the wipers of the humvee were out of sync with the music the engine was not running it was one of the longer walks of knoxs life careful to remain on the consulate side he craned to peer through the ambulance windshield its wipers thumping the ambulance driver believing knox was looking at him pointed to a cutout of kobe bryant hanging from a mirror and pointing to it offered his index finger to signify number knox was looking past the spinning kobe at the man on a side bench in the back a paramedic a woman sat next to him while the knees of a dark blue uniform could be seen sitting across police dulwich held his arm in a sling and was wearing gauze on his head like a yarmulke he looked like shit knox nodded faintly at him and dulwich squinted back either not seeing him or choosing not to acknowledge him behind and alongside the ambulance were two police cars each with four officers inside knox considered an extraction but eightagainstone nine counting the cop inside were not the best odds still if the ambulance backed upif the brokered deal fell through he didnt rule it out he looked both ways down the unusually quiet street searching for yangs black bentley hed seen at the bund a few cars and taxis moved in both directions along with a few dozen bikes but no bentley he cursed the chinese for erecting walls within walls of honor and shame defenses to rival an umbrian hill town rules within rules codes within codes they seemed to shift according to need despite his claims he did not understand it ten minutes passed more like forty and he was still standing in the same spot rain drumming on the umbrella he was still looking when a taxi pulled to the curb a woman climbed out shielding her hair from a distance she could easily have been katherine if memory served but his memory was crippled by fatigue and he couldnt be sure the woman went through to security knox waited the taxi idled she couldnt have been inside more than thirty seconds before she reappeared on the sidewalk and climbed back into the waiting taxi which then drove off knox looked to the ambulance expecting it to move it did not grace came out of security and hurried across the carefully manicured pebble walk and atop the closecut grasslike a putting greenand joined knox under the umbrella it is done she said so now it is up to yang cheng to judge and value the information perhaps verify even partially that zhimin could be culpable to determine if he is important enough for yang to risk his reputation and the expenditure of guanxi perfect you are considering a move on the ambulance she said knox stewed he didnt appreciate being read like that it is all well and good that is the expression is it not it is the expression its not the case if the ambulance leaves then we know we have failed said so calmly if the ambulance backs up it wont make it ten feet john grace she placed her hand on his upper arm and stood close to him out of the rain there has not been a minister to fall in many years the government will gain great value from it the party no but the number one grievance of the chinese people is corruption the government cannot possibly resist such a trophy as chairman zhimin but bringing down a politician knox said you will see but the ambulance did not move forward or back the driver toyed with kobe bryant while dulwich hung his head looking defeated another five minutes passed yang is not going to do it knox said give it time grace said through beating wipers knox saw one of the policemen respond to a dashboard radio call and watched as a heated discussion ensued between him and the driver who pointed back clearly explaining they were boxed in the cop whod taken the radio call climbed out of the police car and headed for the second cop car the one blocking the ambulance this man shot a smug look in knoxs direction in that look was confidence and spiteful victory knox saw it in slow motionmalicious superiority knox looked back through the gray toward the mansion where kozlowski stood keeping his distance back at the ambulance then to the marine behind the wheel of the humvee and finally to the winch mounted on the front of the humvee knox jogged to the winch slammed down the release lever and spooled off fifteen feet of steel cable he walked the hook on the end of the cable toward the gate knox grace called out anxiously the marine was out of the vehicle hey knox slid through a puddle across the threshold into chinese territory where he was a wanted criminal and partially under the ambulance as beneath the vehicle he saw the police car to the rear backing up he hooked the ambulances tow bar and scrambled back out as the sound of car doors signaled the police coming for him he crawled and dove back across the gate line a border defining the consulate property and rushed to the winch opening a plastic box and throwing a switch the chinese police had missed him by inches you cant do that the marine said to knox but the man was clearly more engaged with the two chinese policemen whose toes were nearly touching the consulate boundary the marine marched toward them and stood nose to nose the winch cable tightened the marine held himself rigid the spit from his words mixing with the rain on the face of the policeman directly across from him but his message was for knox cease and desist sir he shouted that is united states property the slack out of the winch knox hurried to the open door of the vehicle and set the brake as the cable tightened the ambulance groaned and jumped the humvee buckled and skidded forward a tug of war knox dislodged a large stone that defined the pebble walkway and used it to block the vehicles front tire now it was all humvee the ambulance crept forward skidding on the wet surface slowly drawn toward the gate the two policemen understood the physics and the mechanics they grabbed hold of the steel cable but to no avail kozlowski arrived at a run out of breath he headed straight for the door to the humvee where knox blocked him one of the chinese policemen ran to the police car he pounded on the trunk and the driver released it and the trunk popped open the policeman came away with a pair of bolt cutters the ambulances front bumper was only inches from the gate thats a us service veteran in that ambulance marine knox hollered hes headed to chinese jail if we dont get him across that line the message was meant for kozlowski as well who stood eye to eye with knox as the humvees electric winch ground steadily away and the ambulance slid forward it was clear to knox that the distance between the ambulance and the humvee wouldnt allow the ambulance to make it all the way inside the compound he waved dulwich forward and watched as a man with a head compress and an arm in a sling took out a police guard sitting across from him on the opposing bench dulwich ducked and moved to the front of the ambulance as the cop with the bolt cutter aimed the tiny jaws at the steel cable the marine kicked out across the line knocking the bolt cutter off its mark the ambulance bumper crossed into us territory the policeman stepped across the line in an effort to cut the cable and the marine pulled his weapon the cop backed off resigned now to watching corporal kozlowski shouted leaving knox but not before whispering you motherfucker under his breath at him knox smiled at a worried grace the ambulance windshield was in the compound the rear door of the ambulance flew open and three cops piled inside and rushed the front of the vehicle after dulwich dulwich threw himself up onto the dash of the ambulance while the driver recoiled kozlowski was shouting for the marine to holster his weapon sir this is my duty sir the marine called back as he raised the weapon and trained it on the first of the cops in the ambulance hey the marine hollered winning the cops attention the man blanched remove yourself from us soil the marine shouted the ambulance skidded forward at an angle snagging the wroughtiron gate and collapsing it inward in a metallic cry the marine held his weapon on the policeman who did not move it took two more minutes for the ambulances passenger door to cross the threshold knox stopped the winch dulwich climbed out of the vehicle met there by kozlowski and grace who helped him deeper into the compound knox released the cable the marine kicked at the cable knox reached under and cleared it the marine shouted at the ambulance driver looking down the barrel of his pistol at him sir your vehicle is improperly on us soil i ask that you remove it at once it was doubtful the driver understood english but the ambulance jumped back so quickly that the cop in front lost his balance and fell over and the ambulance then rammed the police car behind it knocking the cop fully to the ground six marines raced from the mansion carrying ms and joined the corporal including the staff sergeant who took charge knox and kozlowski supported dulwich between them a marine approached knox and offered to take his place no thank you knox said tightening his grip around the wounded man tuesday october am chongming island shen deshi sat behind the wheel of his car across from chongming police precinct awaiting the shift change hed been parked there nearly nine hours going over and over it in his head this woman cadet had doublecrossed him she would return his money shen deshi would divide it as agreed with his superintendent and he would officially retire there was still hope she emerged a few minutes later unlocked and climbed onto a bicycle and rode off shen deshi followed giving her a good lead she lived in a rundown fourstory building of a kind he was well familiar with there would be five or six families in all each occupying what was essentially one large room he climbed out of the car and followed her no one was better at foot surveillance when she entered the thirdfloor flat she did so blissfully unaware of him shen deshi did not want to give her time to get settled he marched to the door and kicked it in with a single blow the door bounced against the wall and came back at him and shen deshi danced to the left allowing it to try to close on its broken jamb he held a rock in his right hand she held a baby sight of the child stopped him the woman was so young hed pictured her sharing the apartment with four or five other women just like her instead he faced a second policeman to his right a mana large man his uniform shirt unbuttoned an unhappy man a man holding a

abandoned his quest for his money but he would not allow himself to be intimidated by a pair of common country thieves the money he said and im gone but hed gravely miscalculated the husband who came not at him but moved to block the door the exit the wife had put the toddler in a portable crib she too now brandished a knife we can negotiate shen said the rock feeling useless in his hand it wasnt that he couldnt imagine defeating a man and a woman both with knives he might be cut and stabbed but he could survive the outcome it was the look in the husbands eyes that stopped his blood from

offered knox drinks and finger food while cnn international played on a flat screen hed asked to file a flight plan back to cambodia he had business there to tidy up but the thought of it troubled him the lure of selling bronze statuettes wasnt exactly calling out to him the skyline was the distant shimmer of a few million people competing for the same few square miles of land the same few tons of rice and fish and tea there was something narcissistic and primitive about the drive for survival that appealed to him more to the point he wasnt thrilled to be alone he barely recognized himself his phone rang and he hoped it would be her but he recognized his brothers voice immediately johnny shei screwed up tommy easy evelyn that bitch their accountant evelyn ritter tommy she jacked all the

the us with a refuel in hawaii yes sir knox returned to the phone tommy was running at the mouth working himself into a frenzy stumbling over apology after apology he sounded about ready to cry knox

well see said bad things came out of her friendship with you what does that mean its been a busy week here tommy ill sort it out its what i do he thought i like the pearl lady so do i a silence formed

wind steve kozlowski rose from the couch and his dvred eagles game to answer a knock on the front door the events of a month before were all but forgotten swept aside by more urgent mattersan impending state visit by the vice president chief among them liz came out from the kitchen not realizing her husband could be broken from the spell of football she was driven in equal parts by a sense of responsibility and a curiosity what neighbor might be calling on them if the knock was an outside visitor the compounds gate guards would have notified them by telephone as she saw her husband approach the door she stopped but she didnt turn back she wanted to see who this was anticipating that her husband would want nothing to do with any of their neighbors kozlowski opened the door and just stood there sweetheart liz called out who is it her husband did not move silhouetted by the pale gray air and the pale gray security wall in the distance that surrounded the compound she tried for a second time steve a friend he answered determined to see whatever was going on she approached get a scarf he said its raining she complained thats why youll need a scarf he said still not turning toward her and grab a ball cap for me im not going out there yes we both are were going to get wet and were going to enjoy it what the hell are you talking about her patience with him was sapped kozlowski stepped through the door and out into the drizzle and as he did liz could finally see beyond him to the object in the front yard it was a spitshined black motorcycle and sidecar an antique with polished chrome and new leather steve circled admiring it from every angle she gathered the scarf and ball cap called upstairs to tucker that she and daddy were going out for a few minutes and would be right back she walked out into the rain envious of the bike for the smile it brought to her husbands face she closed the door behind her ridley pearson
