hatton chapter it was the day my grandmother exploded i sat in the crematorium listening to my uncle hamish quietly snoring in harmony to bachs mass in b minor and i reflected that it always seemed to be death that drew me back to gallanach i looked at my father sitting two rows away in the front line of seats in the cold echoing chapel his broad greyingbrown head was massive above his tweed jacket a black armband was his concession to the solemnity of the occasion his ears were moving in a slow oscillatory manner rather in the way john waynes shoulders moved when he walked my father was grinding his teeth probably he was annoyed that my grandmother had chosen religious music for her funeral ceremony i didnt think she had done it to upset him doubtless she had simply liked the tune and had not anticipated the effect its nonsecular nature might have on her eldest son my younger brother james sat to my fathers left it was the first time in years id seen him without his walkman and he looked distinctly uncomfortable fiddling with his single earring to my fathers right my mother sat upright and trim neatly filling a black coat and sporting a dramatic black hat shaped like a flying saucer the ufo dipped briefly to one side as she whispered something to my father in that movement and that moment i felt a pang of loss that did not entirely belong to my recently departed grandmother yet was connected with her memory how her moles would be itching today if she was somehow suddenly reborn prentice my aunt antonia sitting next to me with uncle hamish snoring mellifluously on her other side tapped my sleeve and pointed at my feet as she murmured my name i looked down i had dressed in black that morning in the cold high room of my aunt and uncles house the floorboards had creaked and my breath had smoked there had been ice inside the small dormer window obscuring the view over gallanach in a crystalline mist id pulled on a pair of black underpants id brought especially from glasgow a white shirt fresh from marks and sparks the packlines still ridging the cold crisp cotton and my black s id shivered and sat on the bed looking at two pairs of socks one black one white id intended to wear the black pair under my nineeye docs with the twin ankle buckles but suddenly i had felt that the boots were wrong maybe it was because they were matt finish the last funeral id been to here also the first funeral id ever been to this gear had all seemed pretty appropriate but now i was pondering the propriety of the docs the s and the black bikers jacket id hauled my white trainers out of the bag tried one nike on and one boot unlaced id stood in front of the tilted fulllength mirror shivering my breath going out in clouds while the floorboards creaked and a smell of cooking bacon and burned toast insinuated its way up from the kitchen the trainers id decided so i peered down at them in the crematorium they looked crumpled and teastained on the severe black granite of the chapel floor ohoh one black sock one white i wriggled in my seat pulled my jeans down to cover my oddlypackaged ankles hells teeth i whispered sorry aunt tone my aunt antonia a ball of pinkrinse hair above the bulk of her black coat like candy floss stuck upon a hearse patted my leather jacket never mind dear she sighed i doubt old margot would have minded no i nodded my gaze fell back to the trainers it struck me that on the toe of the right one there was still discernible the tyre mark from grandma margots wheelchair i lifted the left trainer onto the right and rubbed without enthusiasm at the black herringbone pattern the oily wheel had left i remembered the day six months earlier when i had pushed old margot out of the house and through the courtyard past the outhouses and down the drive under the trees towards the loch and the sea prentice what is going on between you and kenneth the courtyard was cobbled her wheelchair wobbled and jerked under my hands as i pushed her weve fallen out gran i told her im not stupid prentice i can see that she looked up at me her eyes were fierce and grey as they always had been her hair was grey now too and thinning the summer sun cleared the surrounding oaks and i could see her pale scalp through the wisps of white no gran i know youre not stupid well then she waved her stick towards the outhouses lets see if that damn cars still there she glanced back at me again as i wheeled the chair round on its new heading towards the green double doors of one of the courtyard garages well then she repeated i sighed its a matter of principle gran stopping at the garage doors she used her stick to knock the hasp off its staple pushed at one door till its planks bowed slightly then wedging her stick into the resulting gap levered the other door open a bolt at one corner scraping and tinkling through a groove worn in the cobbles i pulled the chair back to let the garage door swing inside it was dark motes swirled in the sunlight falling across the black entrance i could just make out the corner of a thin green tarpaulin draped angularly about level with my waist grandma margot lifted the edge of the tarp with her stick and flicked it away with surprising strength the cover fell away from the front of the car and i pushed her further into the garage principle she said leaning forward in the chair to inspect the long dark bonnet of the car and pushing the tarp back still further until she had revealed the auto up to its windscreen the wheels had no tyres the car rested on blocks of wood what principle the principle of not entering your fathers house your own family home another flick of the cane and the covering moved up the screen then fell back again let me do that gran i stepped to the side of the car and pulled the tarpaulin back until it lay crumpled on the boot revealing that the car had a missing rear window more dust revolved in the light from outside turning grandma margot into a seated silhouette her almost transparent hair shining like a halo she sighed i looked at the car it was long and quite beautiful in a recentlyoldfashioned way beneath the patina of dust it was a very dark green the roof above the missing rear window was battered and dented as was the exposed part of the boot lid poor old thing i whispered shaking my head grandma margot sat upright it or me she said sharply gran i said tutting i was aware that she could see me very well sunlit from behind her while all i could see of her was a dark shape a subtraction of the light anyway she said relaxing and poking at one of the cars wire wheels with her walking stick whats all this nonsense about a matter of principle i turned away rubbing my fingers along the chrome guttering over a rear door well dads angry at me because i told him i believed in god or in something anyway i shrugged not daring to look at her he wont well i wont were not talking to each other so i wont come into the house grandma margot made a clucking noise with her mouth thats it i nodded glancing at her thats it gran and your fathers money your allowance i i began then didnt know how to put it prentice how are you managing to survive im managing fine i lied on my grant another lie and my student loan yet another lie and im doing some bar work four in a row i couldnt get a bar job instead id sold fraud siesta my car it had been a small ford and kind of lazy about starting people used to imply it looked battered but i just told them it came from a broken garage anyway that money was almost gone now too grandma margot let out a long sigh shook her head principles she breathed she pulled herself forward a little but the wheelchair was caught on part of the tarp help me here will you i went behind her pushed the chair over the ruffled canvas she hauled open the offside rear door and looked into the dull interior a smell of musty leather wafted out reminding me of my childhood and the time when there was still magic in the world the last time i had sex was on that back seat she said wistfully she looked up at me dont look so shocked prentice i wasnt i started to protest its all right it was your grandfather she patted the wing of the car with one thin hand after a dance she said quietly smiling she looked up at me again her lined delicate face amused eyes glittering prentice she laughed youre blushing sorry gran i said its just well you dont well when youre young and somebodys past it she said and slammed the door shut dust duly danced well were all young once prentice and those that are lucky get to be old she pushed the wheelchair back over the toe of my new trainers i lifted the chair clear and helped complete the manoeuvre then pushed her to the door i left her there while i put the tarpaulin back over the car in fact some of us get to be young twice she said from the doorway when we go senile toothless incontinent babbling like a baby her voice trailed off grandma please och stop being so sensitive prentice it isnt much fun getting old one of the few pleasures that do come your way is to speak your mind certainly annoying your relatives is enjoyable too but i expected better of you im sorry grandma i closed the garage door dusted off my hands and took up my position at the back of the wheelchair again there was an oily tyre print on my trainer crows raucoused in the surrounding trees above as i pushed my gran towards the drive lagonda sorry gran the car its a lagonda rapide saloon yes i said smiling a little ruefully to myself yes i know we left the courtyard and went crunchily down the gravel drive towards the sparkling waters of the loch grandma margot was humming to herself she sounded happy i wondered if she was recalling her tryst in the lagondas back seat certainly i was recalling mine it was on the same piece of cracked and creaking buttoned and fragrant upholstery some years after my grans last full sexual experience that i had had my first this sort of thing keeps happening in my family ladies and gentlemen of the family on the one hand as i dont doubt you may well imagine it gives me no great pleasure to stand here before you at this time yet on the other hand i am proud and indeed honoured to have been asked to speak at the funeral of my dear old client the late and greatly loved margot mchoan my grandmother had asked the family lawyer lawrence l blawke to say the traditional few words pencilthin and nearly as leaden the tall and still dramatically blackhaired mr blawke was dressed somewhere in the high nines sporting a dark grey doublebreasted suit over a memorable purple waistcoat that took its inspiration from what looked like mandelbrot but might more charitably have been paisley a glittering gold fob watch the size of a small frying pan was anchored in the shallows of one waistcoat pocket by a bulkcarrier grade chain mr blawke always reminded me of a heron im not sure why something to do with a sense of rapacious stillness perhaps and also the aura of one who knows that time is on his side i thought he had looked oddly comfortable in the presence of the undertakers i sat and listened to the lawyer and in short order wondered a why grandma margot had chosen a lawyer to make the address b whether hed be charging us for his time and c how many others of my family were wondering the same things long history of the mchoan family in the town of gallanach of which she was so proud and to which she so usefully and and industriously contributed throughout her long life it was my privilege to know and serve both margot and her late husband matthew well in matthews case first as a school friend back in the twenties i well remember grandma i mean good grief what my grandmother drew deeply on the dunhill flicked her wrist to close the brass zippo then put the lighter back in her cardigan grandma youre smoking margot coughed a little and blew the smoke towards me a grey screen for those ashcoloured eyes well so i am she inspected the cigarette closely then took another drag i always wanted to you know she told me and looked away over the loch towards the hills and trees on the far side id wheeled her down to the shore path at pointhouse near the old cairns i sat on the grass a soft breeze disturbed the water seagulls flew stiffwinged and in the distance the occasional car or truck disturbed the air making a lazy throatclearing noise as they emerged from or disappeared into the channel the main road drove between the trees hilda used to smoke she said quietly not looking at me my elder sister she used to smoke and i always wanted to i picked up a handful of pebbles from the pathside and started throwing them at the waves lapping against the rocks a metre below us almost at high tide but your grandfather wouldnt let me my grandmother sighed but gran i protested its bad for you i know she smiled broadly that was another reason i didnt ever take it up after your grandfather died theyd found it was unhealthy by then she laughed but im seventytwo years old now and i dont give a damn i chucked a few more pebbles well it isnt a very good example to us youngsters is it whats that got to do with the price of sliced bread eh i looked at her pardon youre not really trying to tell me that young people today look to their elders for an example are you prentice i grimaced well i said youd be the first generation that did she pulled on the cigarette a look of convincing derision on her face best do everything they dont thats what tends to happen anyway like it or lump it she nodded to herself and ground the cigarette out on her cast near the knee flicked the butt into the water i tutted under my breath people react more than they act prentice she said eventually like you are with your dad he raises you to be a good little atheist and then you go and get religion well thats just the way of things i could almost hear her shrug things can get imbalanced in families over the generations sometimes a new one has to adjust things she tapped me on the shoulder i turned her hair was very white against the rich summer green of the argyllshire hills and the brilliant blue of the sky beyond dyou feel for this family prentice feel for it gran does it mean anything to you she looked cross anything beyond the obvious like giving you a place to stay well when you arent falling out with your father does it of course gran i felt awkward she leaned closer to me eyes narrowing i have this theory prentice my heart foundered yes gran in every generation theres a pivot somebody everybody else revolves around understand up to a point i said noncommittally i hoped it was old hugh then your grandfather then it was me and then it got all confused with kenneth and rory and hamish they each seem to think they were it but dad certainly seems to think hes paterfamilias aye and maybe kenneth has the strongest claim though i still think rory was more clever your uncle hamish she looked troubled hes a bit off the beaten track that boy she frowned this boy was nearly fifty of course and himself a grandfather it was uncle hamish whod invented newtons religion and who had taken me in when my father and i had fallen out i wonder where uncle rory is i said hoping to divert my gran from areas that sounded portentous and daft with the familiar game that anybody in our family can play making up stories conjectures lies and hopes about uncle rory our onetime golden boy professional traveller and sometime magician whose most successful act had been his own disappearance who knows my gran sighed might be dead for all we know i shook my head no i dont think so you sound certain prentice what do you know we dont i just feel it i shrugged threw a handful of pebbles into the waves hell be back your father thinks he will margot agreed sounding thoughtful he always talks about him as though hes still around hell be back i nodded and lay back in the grass hands under my head i dont know though grandma margot said i think he might be dead dead why the sky was deep shining blue you wouldnt believe me what i sat up again swivelled to face her looking over the muchscribbledupon greywhite cast as well as signatures getwellsoon messages and silly drawings there were at least two shopping lists a recipe copied down from the radio and detailed instructions on how to get by car to the flat i shared in glasgow grandma margot pulled up her sleeve to expose her white darkly spotted right forearm i have my moles prentice they tell me things i laughed she looked inscrutable sorry gran she tapped her wrist with one long pale finger there was a large brown mole there her eyes were narrowed she leaned closer still and tapped the mole again not a sausage prentice well i said not sure whether to try another laugh no not for eight years not a hint not a sensation her voice was low almost husky she looked as though she was enjoying herself i give in gran what are you talking about my moles prentice she arched one eyebrow then sat back with a sigh in her wheelchair i can tell whats going on in this family by my moles they itch when people are talking about me or when something remarkable is happening to the person she frowned well usually she glared at me prodded me in the shoulder with her stick dont tell your father about this hed have me committed gran of course not and he wouldnt anyway i wouldnt be too sure of that her eyes narrowed again i leant on one of the chairs wheels let me get this right your moles itch when one of us is talking about you she nodded grim sometimes they hurt sometimes they tickle and they can itch in different ways too and that moles uncle rorys i nodded incredulously at the big mole on her right wrist thats right she said tapping the stick on one footrest of the wheelchair she held up her wrist and fixed the raised brown spot with an accusatory glare not a sausage for eight years i stared at the dormant eruption with a sort of nervous respect mingled with outright disbelief wow i said at last survived of course by her son kenneth by hamish and by ah roderick the good lawyer blawke had helpfully nodded at my dad and my uncle when he mentioned them dad kept on grinding his teeth uncle hamish stopped snoring and gave a little start at the mention of his name he opened his eyes and looked round a little wildly i thought before relaxing once more his eyelids started to droop again almost immediately at the mention of uncle rorys name mr blawke looked about the crowded chapel as though expecting uncle rory to make a sudden and dramatic appearance and sharing im sure in the familys grief the husband of her late only daughter fiona here mr blawke looked very serious and did indeed grasp his lapels for a moment as he nodded gravely at uncle fergus mr urvill mr blawke said completing the nod that had developed pretensions to a bow i thought and then clearing his throat this genuflection completed the reference to past tragedy duly made most of the people who had turned to look at uncle fergus turned away again my head stayed turned uncle fergus is an interesting enough fellow in himself and of course as mr blawke knew to his benefit probably gallanachs richest and certainly its most powerful man but i wasnt looking at him beside the thicknecked bulk of the urvill of urvill soberly resplendent in what i assumed was the familys mourning tartan blackish purple blackish green and fairly dark black sat neither of his two daughters diana and helen those longlegged visions of moneycreamed honeyskinned globetrotting loveliness but instead his niece the stunning the fabulous the goldenhaired vellusfaced diamondeyed verity upwardly nubile scionette of the house of urvill the jewel beside the jowls the girl who for me had put the lectual in intellectual and phany in epiphany and the ibid in libidinous such bliss to look i feasted my eyes on that gracefully angular form just this side of her uncle and sitting quietly in black she had worn a white quilted skiing jacket outside but now had taken it off in the unfittingly chilly crematorium and sat in a black blouse and black skirt black tights stockings my god the sheer force of joy in just imagining and black shoes and shivering the slick material of the blouse trembling in the light from the translucent panes overhead black silk hanging in folds of shade from her breasts quivering i felt my chest expand and my eyes widen i was just about to look away reckoning that i had gazed to the limits of decency when that shavensided crophaired head swivelled and lowered her calm face turning this way i saw those eyes shaded by her thick and shockingly black brows blink slowly she looked at me small smile and those diamond eyes piercing marking me then the gaze removed refixed directed somewhere else once more facing the front my neck felt unoiled as i turned away blasted and raddled by the urge of that directed consideration verity walker eating my heart out consuming my soul and dads mole here grandma margot said tapping her left shoulder she laughed a little as we went along the path between the shore and the trees that one itches fairly often and mine i asked plodding after the wheelchair id taken my bikers jacket off and it lay now on my grans lap she looked up at me her expression unreadable here she patted her tummy looked forward again pivotal wouldnt you say prentice ha i said still trying to sound noncommittal could be what about uncle hamish wheres he at knee she said tapping the plaster on her leg how is your leg gran fine she said tetchily plaster comes off next week cant happen soon enough the wheels of the chair sighed through the grass on either side of the narrow path i remembered something id been meaning to ask what were you doing up that tree anyway gran trying to saw a branch off what for to stop those damn squirrels using it as a diving board to get to my bird table thats what for she used her stick to whack a crumpled drinkingyoghurt bottle off the path and into the water you could have asked somebody else im not totally incapable prentice id have been all right if that hoodie hadnt started divebombing me ungrateful wretch oh it was a birds fault was it i had a mental picture of some beetleeyed carrion crow swooping on my gran knocking her off her ladder maybe it had seen the omen yes it was grandma margot twisted in her wheelchair and raised both her stick and her voice and a few years ago id only have been bruised as well brittle bones are one of the things that make getting old such a damn nuisance too especially if youre a woman she nodded brusquely so think yourself lucky okay i smiled damn birds she muttered glaring at a stand of ash trees on the edge of the plantation with such severity that i half expected to hear a parliament of crows cry out in answer ach well she shrugged lets head back to the house i need to go right you are i said and wheeled the chair around grandma margot lit another cigarette that branch is still there by the way ill deal with it good lad a lark trilled high overhead i wheeled my gran back along the path by the water over the main road and up the gravel drive through the sunlit cobbled courtyard towards the tall house with the crowstepped gables i cut the offending branch down that afternoon before i went back to gallanach to my uncle hamishs house for tea my dad arrived while i was up the ladder sawing away at the sappy oak and swatting at flies he stopped and looked at me when he got out of the audi then he disappeared into the house i kept on sawing my greatgreatgreat grandfather stewart mchoan was buried in a coffin made from black glass by the craftsmen he had commanded in his capacity as manager of the gallanach glass works a post now filled by my uncle hamish grandma margot had gone for the more conventional wooden model it slid away into the wall as bachs mass reached one of its choral climaxes a woodfronted door slid back up to block the hole the coffin had disappeared into then a little purple curtain lowered itself over the doorway the head honcho of the undertakers supervised us as we all formed up for what was obviously the important and formal business of leaving the chapel my father and mother left first i told you we sat in the wrong place tone i heard my uncle hamish whisper behind me aunt tone just went ssh outside it was a calmly sombre day chill and a little damp i could smell leaves being burned somewhere the view down the crematoriums birchlined drive led towards the town and the ocean in the distance through the haze north jura was dark pastel and flatlooking on the unruffled grey blanket of sea i looked around darkdressed people were everywhere amongst the parked cars talking quietly their breath rose in clouds through the still air uncle hamish was talking to the lawyer blawke aunt antonia to my mother dad was with the urvills the wonderful verity was mostly hidden by my father her snowwhite ski jacket in eclipse behind the old mans tweed coat i considered shifting my position so i could see her properly but decided against it somebody might notice at least i thought brightly she was here alone for the last two years that id been worshipping verity from afar shed been going out with a gormfree creature called rodney ritchie his parents owned ritchies reliable removals in edinburgh and were keen on alliteration my father had met them once and coined a new collective noun an embarrassment of ritchies anyway urvill family gossip had it that verity might be coming to her senses regarding rodneys removal and it was a positive and encouraging sign that she had turned up here without the geek in tow i thought about approaching her maybe when we got back to the castle i also thought about talking to james but little brother was leaning against the crematorium wall looking bored but cool in his borrowed greatcoat earplugs in getting his walkman fix at last still mainlining the doors probably for a moment i almost missed my elder brother lewis who hadnt been able to make it back for the funeral lewis is betterlooking smarter and wittier than i am so i dont miss him often i was standing beside uncle hamishs jaguar maybe i should just get into the car or find somebody else to talk to i could feel that an attack of awkwardness the kind of episode i am unhappily prone to was imminent hi prentice you okay the voice was deep and throaty but female ashley watt strolled up put her hand on the side of my shoulder patting her brother dean was just behind i nodded yeah yeah fine hows yourself hi dean hi man you just back for this ash asked nodding her head at the low grey granite of the crematorium buildings her long fawn hair was gathered up her strong angular face dominated by a blade of a nose and a pair of large roundlensed glasses was concerned and sad ash was my age but she always made me feel younger yeah back to glasgow on monday i looked down wow ash i dont think ive ever seen you in a skirt before ash always wore jeans wed known each other since wed used to crawl around on the same carpets together but i couldnt remember seeing her in anything else but jeans yet there were her legs all right pretty goodlooking ones too under a kneelength black skirt she wore a big navallooking jacket with the cuffs turned over and black gloves mediumhigh heels made her the same height as me she grinned short memory prentice recall school oh yeah i nodded still looking at the legs apart from then though i shrugged smiled warily at her id gone through a protracted unbearable stage while id been at high school it had lasted from my first day through to about fourth year and the most vivid memory i had of ash from that time was when i and her two brothers had carried out a highly successful snowball ambush on her her sister and their pals as theyd walked back from school one dark evening somebodys snowball had broken that long sharp nose of ashleys and i suspected it had been one of mine if for no other reason than because as far as i knew nobody else had been deploying snowballs whose ballistic properties had been enhanced by the judicious reinforcement of their cores with moderately sizeable chuckie stones her nose had been reset of course and wed got on better since wed each left school ash frowned a little her slightly magnified grey eyes searching mine i was sorry to hear about the old lady all of us were she swivelled briefly to dean standing lighting up a regal behind her he nodded black jeans and a dark blue crombie that looked like it had seen better decades i wasnt sure what to say ill miss her i said eventually id been trying not to think about it ever since id heard the news was it a heart attack aye prentice dean inquired through his cloud of smoke no i said she fell off a ladder i thought she did that last year ash said she did off a tree this time she was clearing the gutters the ladder slipped and she went through the conservatory roof she was dead by the time they got her to the hospital shock from bloodloss apparently oh prentice im sorry ash said and put her hand on my arm dean shook his head and looked mystified ah thought she had a heart attack she did have one i nodded about five years ago got a pacemaker fitted maybe she had a heart attack while she was up the ladder dean suggested ash kicked his shin ooya he said excuse mr sensitivity here ash said but like i said we were all really sorry to hear prentice she looked around havent seen lewis here could he not make it hes in australia i sighed being funny ah ash nodded smiling faintly well thats a shame for the australians perhaps i said ash looked sad even pitying aw prentice dean prodded his sister in the back with the hand he wasnt rubbing his shin with hoi what was that about yon guy ye bumped into in that jacuzzi in berlin said ye were goantae tell oh yeah ash turned from frowning at her brother to frowning at me took a breath then let it out hey you fancy a pint later prentice well maybe i said i think were ordered up to the castle for drinks and a bite to eat i shrugged this evening okiedokie ash nodded a jacuzzi i asked looking at dean and ash in turn berlin dean grinned broadly and nodded ash said aye prentice watchin the wa come doon and a shocking and decadent tale it is too let me tell you see you in the jacobite about eight right you are i said i leaned close and nudged her what jacuzzi i saw the expression on deans face then heard the noise then watched ashleys gaze rise from my face to fasten somewhere over my left shoulder i turned slowly the car came screaming up the crematorium drive leaves swirling into the air behind it was a green rover and it had to be doing sixty probably exceeding the previous speed record within the crematorium grounds by a factor of at least three it was heading more or less straight for us and braking distance was running out fast that no doctor fyfes car dean said as ash grabbed my sleeve and started to pull me back at the same time as the rovers engine note fell from its wail its nose dipped and the rear end wavered as the tyres tried to bite the moist tarmac i thought he had an orion i said as ashley pulled dean and me past the rear of uncle hamishs car and onto the grass everybody in the crowd outside the crematorium was watching the green as it skidded to a stop avoiding a headon collision with the urvills bentley eight by only a few centimetres the tyres rasped on the tarmac doctor fyfe for indeed that was who it was jumped out of the drivers seat he was as small rotund and bewhiskered as ever but today his face was red and his eyes were staring stop he yelled slamming the door and running for the chapel entrance as fast as his little legs would carry him stop he shouted again a little unnecessarily i thought as everybody had quite entirely stopped whatever theyd been doing some time before his car had even begun braking stop i still insist that i heard a muffled crump at this point but nobody believes me that was when it happened though the sensitive morticians who run the gallanach corporation crematorium usually wait until night before they burn the bodies to avoid the possibility of resulting smokeplumes sending overwrought relations into unsightly paroxysms of grief but grandma margot had specified that she wanted to be incinerated immediately her cremation was therefore genuinely under way as we stood there ah said doctor fyfe stumbling just before he was intercepted before the door of the chapel by a concerned undertaker ah he said again and crumpled first into the undertakers arms and then to the ground he was on his knees briefly then turned and sat down clutched at his chest stared at the granite flagstones outside the chapel and to the assembled still stunned and quieted crowd of us announced im sorry folks but i believe im having a coronary and keeled over on his back there was an instant when nothing much seemed to happen then dean watt nudged me with the hand holding his regal and said quietly theres a funny thing eh dean hissed ashley as people crowded round the doctor ooya call an ambulance somebody shouted use the hearse yelled my dad och its only a bruise dean muttered rubbing vigorously at his shin ooya will ye quit that they used the hearse and got doctor fyfe to the local hospital in ample time to save his life if not his professional reputation the muffled crump which i still maintain that i heard was my grandmother exploding doctor fyfe had neglected to ask the hospital to remove her pacemaker before she was cremated like i say this sort of thing keeps happening in my family chapter these were the days of fond promise when the world was very small and there was still magic in it he told them stories of the secret mountain and the sound that could be seen of the forest drowned by sand and the trees that were timestilled waters he told them about the slow children and the magic duvet and the welltravelled country and they believed all of it they learned of distant times and longago places of who they were and what they werent and of what had and what had never been then every day was a week each month a year a season was a decade and every year a life but dad mrs mcbeath says there is so a god and youll go to a bad place mrs mcbeath is an idiot no shes no dad shes a teacher no shes not or better still no she isnt dont use the word no when you mean not but shes no a niddyott dad she is a teacher honest he stopped on the path turned to look at the boy the other children stopped too grinning and giggling they were almost at the top of the hill just above the forestry commissions arbitrary tree line the cairn was visible a lump on the skyline prentice he said people can be teachers and idiots they can be philosophers and idiots they can be politicians and idiots in fact i think they have to be a genius can be an idiot the world is largely run for and by idiots it is no great handicap in life and in certain areas is actually a distinct advantage and even a prerequisite for advancement several of the children giggled uncle kenneth helen urvill sang out our daddy said you were a commie her sister alongside her on the path and holding her hand gave a little squeal and put her free hand up to her mouth your father is absolutely correct helen he smiled but only in the pejorative sense and not the practical one unfortunately diana squealed again and hid her face giggling helen looked puzzled but dad prentice said pulling at his sleeve dad mrs mcbeath is a teacher really she is and she said there is so a god and so did mr ainstie too dad lewis added yes ive talked to mr ainstie mchoan told the older boy he thinks we should send troops to help the americans in viet nam he an idiot too dad lewis hazarded decoding the sour expression on his fathers face definitely so there isnae a god eh no mr mchoan no ashley there isnt whit aboot wombles mr mchoan whats that darren the wombles mr mchoan of wimbledon common darren watt was holding the hand of his little brother dean who was staring up at mchoan and looking like he was about to burst into tears are they real mr mchoan of course they are he nodded youve seen them on television havent you aye aye well then of course theyre real real puppets but theyre no really real naw no darren theyre not really real the real creatures on the real wimbledon common are mice and birds and maybe foxes and badgers and none of them wear clothes and live in nice welllit burrows with furniture a lady made up the wombles and made up stories about them and then people made the stories into television programmes thats whats real see ah told ye darren said shaking his little brothers hand theyre no real dean started to cry face screwing up eyes closing oh good grief mchoan breathed it never ceased to amaze him how quickly a small childs face could turn from peach to beetroot his own youngest james was just leaving that stage thank goodness come on dean up you come up here and well see if we can get to the top of this hill eh he lifted the howling child up after hed been persuaded to let go of his brothers hand and put him on his shoulders he looked at the little upturned faces were nearly there arent we see the cairn there was a general noise of agreement from the assembled children come on then last one theres a tory he started off up the path dean was crying more quietly now the other children ran round and past him laughing and shouting and scrambling straight up the hillside over the grass towards the cairn he quit the path and started after them then holding deans legs turned to look back at diana and helen who were still standing quietly handinhand on the path you two not playing helen identically dressed to her sister in little new green dungarees and staring out from under her preciselytrimmed black fringe shook her head frowned we better go last uncle kenneth oh why i think were tories you might well turn out to be he laughed but well give you the benefit of the doubt for now eh on you go the twins looked at each other then still handinhand started up the grassy slope after the rest earnestly concentrating on the business of clumping one foot in front of the other through the long rough grass dean was starting to cry loudly again probably because he thought his brother and sister were leaving him mchoan sighed and jogged up the hill after the kids shouting encouragement and making sure he trailed the last of them to the top and the cairn he made a great show of being out of breath and wobbled as he sat down collapsing dramatically on the grass after setting dean to one side oh youre all too fit for me ha mr mchoan darren laughed pointing at him youre the toerag so ye are he was mystified for a moment then said oh right toerag tuareg tory he made a funny face tora tora tory he laughed and so did they he lay in the grass a warm wind blew what for are all these stones mr mchoan ashley watt asked she had climbed halfway up the squat cairn which was about five feet high she picked up one of the smaller rocks and looked at it kenneth rolled over letting prentice and lewis climb onto his back and kick at his sides pretending he was a horse the watt girl perched on the cairn bashed one rock against another inspected the struck whitened surface of the stone she held grinned she was a tyke dressed in grubby handmedowns like rest of the watt tribe she always seemed to have a runny nose he liked her he still thought ashley was a boys name wasnt it from gone with the wind but then if the watts wanted to call their children dean and darren and ashley he supposed that was up to them could have been elvis and tarquin and marilyn dyou remember the story of the goose that swallowed the diamond aye it was one of his stories one hed tried out on the children market research his wife called it why did the goose eat the diamond please uncle kenneth diana urvill said holding up one hand and trying to click her fingers yes diana it was hungry naw ashley said scornfully from the cairn she blinked furiously it wiz fur teeth it swallowed it smartypants so there diana said leaning towards ashley and shaking her head hey mchoan said youre both sort of right the goose swallowed the diamond because thats what geese do with things like pebbles that they find they swallow them so that they go into their anybody know he looked round them all as best as he could without disturbing lewis and prentice gizzurd mr mchoan ashley shouted waving the stone she held diana squealed and put her hand to her mouth again well a gizzard is part of a bird too thats right ashley he said but the diamond actually went into the gooses crop because like lots of animals and birds geese need to keep some wee stones like pebbles or gravel in their crop down here he pointed so that they can grind their food up small and digest it better when it goes into their tummy please mr mchoan ah remember ashley shouted she clutched the stone to her chest getting her ragged thin grey jumper a little dirtier me too dad prentice shouted and me me too well he said rolling slowly over and letting lewis and prentice slide off his back he sat up they sat down way back a long long time ago there were these big enormous animals that used to live in scotland and they what did they look like dad prentice asked ah mchoan scratched his head through his brown curls like like big hairy elephants with long necks and these big huge animals what were they called please uncle kenneth they were called mythosaurs helen and they would swallow rocks big rocks way down into their crops and they used these rocks to help crunch up their food they were very very big animals and very heavy because of all the rocks they carried around inside them and they usually stayed down in the glens because they were so heavy and didnt go into the sea or the lochs because they didnt float and they stayed away from marshes too in case they sank but please mr mchoan did they up climb trees naw no ashley naw ad didnae think so mr mchoan right anyway when they were very very old and they were going to die the mythosaurs would come to the tops of hills hills just like this one and theyd lie down and they would die peacefully and then after they were dead their fur and their skin would disappear and then their insides would disappear too af where aboots did their fur and their skin go please mr mchoan well ashley they turned into earth and plants and insects and other wee animals oh and eventually there would just be a skeleton left eek said diana and put her hand over her mouth again until even that crumbled away and became dust and and their tusks mr mchoan pardon ashley their tusks did they go intae dust as well umm yes yes they did so after a while everything was dust except for the stones that the big animals had carried in their crops those lay in a big pile where the mythosaurs had laid down to die and that he turned and slapped one of the larger stones protruding from the base of the rock pile behind him that he grinned because he liked the story he had just thought up and told is where cairns come from ah ashley youre standing on stuff thats been in a animals gizzurd darren shouted pointing eaurgh ashley laughed and jumped down throwing the stones away and rolling on the grass there was a deal of general tomfoolery and wee high squealing voices for a while kenneth mchoan looked at his watch and wound it up as he said all right kids time for your dinner anybody hungry me me dad we are uncle kenneth ah could eat a missasore so ah could mr mchoan he laughed well i dont think theyre on the menu ashley but not to worry he took his pipe out and stood up filled the bowl and tamped it down come on you horrible rabble your aunt marys probably got your dinner ready for you by now will uncle rory be doing tricks uncle kenneth if youre good and eat up your vegetables helen aye he might oh good they trooped down dean had to be carried because he was tired dad prentice said falling back to talk to him while the rest whooped and yelled and capered on the slope are miffasores real as real as wombles kiddo as real as dougal in the magic roundabout every bit well almost he drew on the pipe no just as real because the only place anything is ever real is inside your head prentice and the mythosaur exists inside your head now does it dad yes it used to just exist in my head but now it exists in your head too and the others so is god in mrs mcbeaths head then yep thats right hes an idea in her head like father christmas and the tooth fairy he looked down at the child did you like the story about the mythosaur and the cairns was it just a story then dad of course it was prentice he frowned what did you think it was i dont know dad history histoire seulement what dad nothing prentice no it was just a story i think the story about you meeting mums more better dad just better will do prentice the more isnt required still a better story dad glad you think so son the children were entering the forest funnelling into the path between the pines he looked away then across the rough geography of bough and leaf to the village and the station just visible through the trees the train chuffed off into the evening the red light on the final carriage disappearing round the bend in the cutting through the forest the steam and smoke climbed into the sunset skies beyond he let the feeling of return wash over and through him looking across the deserted platform on the far side of the tracks down across the few lights of lochgair village to the long electricblue reflection that was the loch its gleaming acres imprisoned between the dark masses of the land the noise of the train faded slowly and the quiet susurration of the falls seemed to swell in recompense he left his bags where they lay and walked to the far end of the platform the very edge of the platform dropped away there angling down to the deck of the viaduct over the rushing water beneath a chesthigh wall formed the furthest extent of the rest of the platform he rested his arms on the top of the wall and looked down the fifty feet or so to the tumbling white waters just upstream the river loran piled down from the forest in a compactly furious cataract the spray was a taste beneath the river surged round the piers of the viaduct that carried the railway on towards lochgilphead and gallanach a grey shape flitted silently across the view from falls to bridge then zoomed turned in the air and swept into the cutting on the far bank of the river as though it was a soft fragment of the trains steam that had momentarily lost its way and was now hurrying to catch up he waited a moment and the owl hooted once from inside the dark constituency of forest he smiled took a deep breath that tasted of steam and the sweet sharpness of pine resin and then turned away went back to pick up his bags mr kenneth the station master said taking his ticket at the gate its yourself back from the varsity are you aye mr calder thats me done with it youll be coming back then will you aye maybe well see indeed well ill tell you now your sister was here earlier but wi the train bein late an that ach its not far to walk indeed not though ill be shutting up shop very soon now and i could offer you a lift on the back of my bike if you liked ill just walk thank you as you will kenneth its good to see you back thank you ah that might be her actually mr calder said looking down the curve of the station approach kenneth heard a car engine and then headlights swung white light across the iron railings holding the rhododendrons back from the tarmac road the big super snipe growled into the car park heeling as it turned and stopping with the passengers door opposite kenneth hello again mr calder a voice called out from the drivers seat evening miss fiona kenneth threw his bags onto the back settled into the passenger seat and accepted a kiss from his sister he was pressed back into the seat as the humber accelerated off down the road okay big brother just grand sis the car skidded briefly as it swung onto the main road he clutched at the grab handle on the door pillar looked at his sister sitting hunched over the big steering wheel dressed in slacks and blouse her fair hair tied back you have passed your test havent you fi course i have a car coming in the opposite direction honked at them and flashed its lights hmm she said frowning try the dip switch ah hah they swept off the main road and into the house drive roared up between the dark masses of the oaks fiona took the car grinding over the gravel past the old stable block and round the side of the house he looked back over his shoulder is that a wall fiona nodded as she brought the car to a halt in front of the house dad wants a courtyard so hes building a wall by the stables she said turning off the engine were going to have a conservatory overlooking the garden if mum has her way which i dare say she will i think your rooms all right but hamishs is being redecorated heard from him getting on famously with the piccaninnies apparently fi really theyre rhodesians theyre little black rhodesians and i shall always think of them as piccaninnies blame enid blyton say i come on uncle joe youre just in time for supper they got out there were lights on in the house and a couple of bikes lying against the steps curving up to the front door whose are those he asked taking his bags from the back of the car couple of lassies camping over there fiona pointed and he could just make out a dim orange shape lit from inside under the elms on the west side of the lawn friends of yours fiona shook her head no just turned up asked to camp think they thought we were a farm theyre from glasgow i think she took his briefcase from him and bounded up the steps to the opened double doors of the porch he hesitated reached into the car and took the keys out of the ignition then glanced at the tent ken fiona called from the door he made a tutting noise and put the keys back then shook his head and pulled them out again not because there were strangers around and certainly not just because they were from glasgow but just because it was irresponsible to leave keys in the car like that fiona had to learn he pocketed the keys and picked up his bags he glanced over at the tent just as it flared with light oh he heard fiona say and that was when he first saw mary lewis running out of a tent in her pyjamas with her hair on fire screaming christ he dropped the bags ran across the gravel drive towards the girl haring across the grass hands beating at the blue and orange flames crackling round her head he leapt down to the lawn pulling off his jacket as he went the girl tried to run past him he tackled her bringing her down with a ragged thump he had the jacket over her head before she properly started struggling after a few seconds while she whimpered and the stink of burning hair filled his nostrils he pulled the jacket away fiona came running another girl dressed in toobig pyjamas and a fawn duffle coat and holding a small flat kettle followed her from the house wailing mary oh mary nice tackle ken fiona said kneeling by the girl with the burned hair who was sitting quivering he put one arm round her shoulders the second girl fell to her knees and put both arms round the girl shed called mary oh hen are you all right i think so the girl said feeling what was left of her hair and then burst into tears he extracted his arm from between the two girls he brushed his jacket free of grass and burned hair and put it round the shoulders of the crying girl fiona was pulling bits of hair away and peering at her scalp in the gloom think youve been lucky lassie but well call the doctor anyway oh no the girl wailed as though this was the worst thing in the world now now mary the other girl said her voice shaking come on lets get into the house kenneth said rising take a look at you he helped the two girls to their feet maybe get you a cup of tea eh oh thats what caused all this in the first place mary said standing pale and shaking eyes bright with tears she gave a sort of desperate laugh the other girl still hugging her laughed too he smiled shaking his head he looked into the girls face finally seeing it properly and thought how bizarrely beautiful she looked even with half a head of frizzy whitened hair and eyes red raw with crying then he realised he was seeing her and seeing her better all the time in the light of a flickering glow that was blooming in the west of the garden under the elms her eyes widened as she looked past him the tent she howled oh no and i missed it damn damn damn i hate going to bed this early shush ive told you now go to sleep no what happened next did you have to take all her clothes off and put her to bed no dont be ridiculous of course not oh thats what happened in this book i read cept the girl was wet from being in the sea shes fallen in the water rory completed the latter part of this sentence in his bluebottle voice shes fallen in the water the wee voice said again in the darkness of the room kenneth wanted to laugh but stopped himself please shut up rory go on tell me what happened next thats it we all came into the house mum and dad hadnt even heard anything i got the hose going eventually but by that time it was too late to save much of the stuff in the tent and anyway then the primus really blew up and what in an explosion thats the way things normally blow up yes holy smoke oh damn hell and shite i missed it rory mind your language weeeellll rory turned over in the bed his feet prodding kenneth in the back and mind your feet too sorry so did the doctor come or not no she didnt want us to call him and she wasnt badly hurt just her hair really waa rory gave a squeal of excitement shes not bald is she no she isnt bald but shell probably have to wear a scarf or something for a while i expect so theyre staying in the house are they these two lassies from glasgow theyre in the house yes mary and sheena are staying in my room which is why ive got to sleep with you ffworr rory shut up go to sleep for petes sake okay rory made a great bouncing movement turning over in bed kenneth could feel his brother lying still and tense beside him he sighed he remembered when this had been his room before his dad had unblocked the fireplace and put a grate in it the only heating during the winter had been that ancient paraffin heater they hadnt used since the old house back in gallanach how nostalgic he had felt then and how distant and separated from gallanach at first even though it was only eight miles away over the hills and just a couple of stops on the train that heater had been the same height as him at first and hed been told very seriously never ever to touch it and been slightly frightened of it at the start but after a while he had grown to love the old enamelled heater when it was cold his parents would put it in his room to heat it up before he went to bed and they would leave it on for a while after theyd said goodnight to him and hed lie awake listening to the quiet puttering hissing noise it made and watching the swirling pattern of flameyellow and shadowdark it cast on the high ceiling while the room filled with a delicious warm smell he could never experience after that without a sense of remembered drowsiness it had been a precious light back then must have been during the war at first when his dad was using the probably illegal stockpile of paraffin hed built up before rationing began rory nudged him with one foot he ignored this he ignored another slightly stronger nudge and started snoring quietly another nudge what ken rory whispered does your tassel get big sometimes eh you know your tassel your willy does it get big oh good grief he groaned mine does its gone big now do you want to feel it no he sat up in the bed looking down at the vague shape of his brothers head on the pillow at the other end of the bed no i do not only asking does it though what your willy get big rory im tired its been a long day and this isnt the time or the place rory sat up suddenly bob watt can make stuff come out of his and so can jamie mcvean ive seen them do it you have to rub it a lot ive tried but i cant get any stuff to come out but twice now ive got this funny feeling where its like heat like heat coming up as if youre getting into a bath sort of do you get that kenneth sighed rubbed his eyes rested his back against the low brass rail at the foot of the bed he drew his legs up i dont think its really up to me to have to go into all this rory you should talk to dad about it rab watt says it makes you go blind rory hesitated and he wears glasses kenneth stifled a laugh he looked up at the dim roof where dozens of model aircraft hung on threads and whole squadrons of spitfires and hurricanes and me s attacked wellingtons lancasters flying fortresses and heinkels no it doesnt make you go blind rory sat back legs drawn up too kenneth couldnt make out his brothers expression there was a soft glow from the small nightlight candle on rorys desk near the door but it was too weak to let him see the boys face clearly ha i told him he was wrong kenneth lay back down rory said nothing for a while then rory said i think im going to fart well youd better make damn sure it goes out the way cant got to keep it under the covers or it might ignite on the nightlight and blow the whole house up rory shut up im serious sall right rory turned over settled down it went away there was silence for some time ken fitted his legs round rorys back closed his eyes and wished that his father had concentrated on restoring more rooms in the old house rather than building courtyard walls after a while rory stirred again and said sleepily ken rory please go to sleep or ill kick you unconscious no but ken whaaat he breathed i should have beaten him up when we were younger he isnt scared of me at all have you ever shagged a woman thats none of your business go on tell us im not going to please i wont tell anybody else promise cross my heart and hope to die i wont no go to sleep if you tell me ill tell you something oh im sure no really something dead important that nobody else knows im not buying it rory sleep or die honest ive never told anybody and if i do tell you you mustnt tell anybody else or i might get put in the jail kenneth opened his eyes whats the kid talking about he turned over looked to the head of the bed rory was still lying down dont be melodramatic rory im not impressed its true theyd put me in jail rubbish ill tell you what i did if you tell me about shagging he lay there thought about this apart from anything else the horrible and ghastly truth was that at the ripe old age of practically twentytwo he had never made love to a woman but of course he knew what to do he wondered what rorys secret was what he thought he had done or what story he had made up they were both good at making up stories you tell me first kenneth said and felt like a child again to his surprise rory said all right he sat up in bed and so did kenneth they waggled closer until their heads were almost touching and rory whispered you remember last summer when the big barn burned down on the estate kenneth remembered it had been the last week of his vacation and he had seen the smoke rising from the farm a mile away along the road towards lochgilphead he and his dad had heard the bell sound in the ruined estate chapel and had jumped into the car to go and help old mr ralston and his sons theyd tried to fight the fire with buckets and a couple of hoses but by the time the fire engines arrived from lochgilphead and gallanach the old hay barn was burning from end to end it stood not far from the railway line and theyd all assumed it had been a spark from an engine youre not going to tell me that was me youre joking promise you wont tell please please please please ive never told anybody and i dont want to go to jail ken rory sounded too frightened to be lying kenneth hugged his young brother the boy shivered he smelled of palmolive i didnt mean to do it ken honest i didnt i was experimenting with a magnifying glass there was this wee hole in the roof and this beam of sunlight and it was like a sort of searchlight falling on the straw and i was playing with my beaufighter not the airfix one the other one and i was melting holes in the wings and fuselage cos they look dead like bullet holes and you can melt a big long line of them and they look like twenty millimetre cannon holes and i pretended the sunshine really was a sort of searchlight and the plane crashed and id thought id see if i could make the straw go on fire just a little bit round where the plane had crashed but i didnt think it would all burn down really i didnt it just all went up dead sudden you wont tell will you ken rory pulled back and kenneth could just make out the boys eyes shining in the gloom he hugged him again i swear on my life ill never tell anybody ever the farmer wont have to sell his car to buy a new barn will he no he laughed quietly its old urvills farm anyway really and being a good capitalist im sure he had it well insured oh okay it was an accident honest it was ken you wont tell mr urvill will you dont worry i wont it was only a barn nobody hurt it was an accident sssh he held the boy rocked him i was that frightened afterwards ken i was going to run away so i was there now sssh after a while rory said groggily going to tell me about shagging ken eh tomorrow all right he whispered dont want you getting all excited again you promise i promise lie back go to sleep mmmm okay he tucked the boy in then looked up at the dull crosses of the planes poised overhead young rascal he thought he lay back himself toyed briefly with his own erection then felt guilty and stopped he closed his eyes and tried to sleep but couldnt stop thinking of the girl whose hair had gone on fire hed seen quite far down her pyjama top when hed put his arm round her shoulders he forced himself to stop thinking about her he reviewed the day the way he often had since childhood trying to fill the time between the light going out and his brain finally relaxing letting him go to sleep well so much for his plan to tell his parents as soon as he got home that he too wanted to travel that he didnt want to stay here or get a job at the factory managerial or not or become a teacher like hamish maybe something settled and bourgeois like that could come later but he wanted to taste the world first there was more to it than this wee corner of scotland more to it than glasgow and even britain the world and his life were opening up before him and he wanted to take full advantage of both apart from anything else there was always the bomb that lurking presence forever threatening to close it all back down again with one final filthy splash of light that heralded the long darkness and made a nonsense of any human plan any dream of the future eat drink and be merry because tomorrow we blow up the world he had intended to tell his parents all this as soon as he got in but the incident with the girls and their tent and that poor shocked bonny lassie with her hair on fire had made it impossible it would have to wait until tomorrow there would be time there was always time he wondered what her skin would feel like it had been the colour of pale honey he wondered what it would feel like to hold her he had touched her he had been sprawled on top of her dammit but that wasnt the same thing not the same thing at all she had been slim but her breasts soft globes within the shadows of those silly pyjamas had looked full and firm there had been something fit and limber about the way shed moved even when shed been shivering after her ordeal he would have believed she was an athlete not a student of what had she said geography he smiled in the darkness touching himself again hed like to study her geography all right the contours of her body the swelling hills and deep dales her dark forest and mysterious moist caves the girls stayed at lochgair for another six days the mchoans were used to keeping open house and wouldnt hear of the girls just packing up what was left of their possessions and cycling or taking a train back to glasgow och no you must stay margot mchoan said at breakfast the next morning they were all sat round the big table mary with a towel round her head looking prettily embarrassed her friend sheena bigboned blonde and applecheeked happily wolfing down sausage and eggs fiona and kenneth finishing their porridge rory searching for the plastic toy concealed somewhere in the sugar smacks packet dad had left for the glass factory earlier oh mrs mchoan we couldnt mary said looking down at the table she had only nibbled at her toast nonsense child margot said pouring rory another glass of milk and smoothing the herald on the table in front of her youre both very welcome to stay arent they she looked round her three children certainly fiona said she had already found sheena to be a kindred spirit when it came to rock n roll which might provide her with a valuable ally when it came to displacing dads folk songs and kenneths jazz on the turntable of the family radiogram of course kenneth smiled at mary and at sheena ill show you around if you like much better to have a local guide and my rates are very reasonable muuuum theyve forgotten to put the wee boat in this box rory complained arm deep in the sugar smacks packet face dark with frustration and ire just keep looking dear margot said patently then looked back at the two girls aye stay by all means the two of you this big house needs filling up and if you feel guilty you can always help with a bit of decorating if theres any wet days and if my husband gets round to it fair enough kenneth glanced at his mum margot mchoan was still a strikinglooking woman though her thick brown hair was starting to go grey over her forehead she had dyed it at first but found it not worth the bother he admired her he realised and felt proud that she should be so matteroffactly generous even if it might mean that he had to keep sleeping in the same bed as his young brother thats awful kind mrs mchoan sheena said wiping her plate with a bit of fried bread are you sure totally margot said your parents on the phone mine are mrs mchoan mary said glancing up good margot said well call them tell them youll be here all right oh thats awfully nice of you mrs mchoan mary said and flickered a wee nervous smile at the older woman kenneth watched her and the smile ended up albeit briefly directed at him before mary looked down and crunched into her toast and marmalade he drove the two girls round the area in the humber when his dad wasnt using it sometimes fiona came too the summer days were long and warm they walked in the forests south of gallanach and in the hills above lochgair a puffer captain let them travel through the crinan canal on his boat and they took the family dory puttering over to otter ferry for lunch one day over the smooth waters of lower loch fyne one windless day when the smoke rose straight and cormorants stood on exposed rocks wings held open like cloaks to the warm air and seals popped up black cones of blubber with surprisedlooking faces as the old open boat droned slowly past there was a dance on in gallanach town hall that saturday the day before the two girls were due to return to glasgow kenneth asked mary to go with him she borrowed one of fionas dresses and a pair of his mothers shoes they danced they kissed they walked by the quiet harbour where the boats lay still on water like black oil and they sauntered handinhand along the esplanade beneath a moondevoid sky full of bright stars they each talked about their dreams and about travelling to faraway places he asked if she had given any thought of maybe coming back here some time like next weekend for example there is a loch in the hills above lochgair loch glashan reservoir for the small hydro power station in the village matthew mchoans friend hector cardie a forestry commission manager kept a rowing boat on the loch and the mchoans had permission to use the boat to fish the waters rory was bored he was so bored he was actually looking forward to school starting again next week back in the spring he had hoped that ken being back home would make the summer holidays fun but it hadnt worked out that way ken was either up in glasgow seeing that mary girl or she was here and they were together all the time and didnt want him around he had been in the garden throwing dry clods of earth at some old model tanks the clouds of dust the clods made when they hit the hard baked earth looked just like proper explosions but then his mum had chased him out because the dust was getting the washing dirty he hadnt found anybody else around to play with in the village so hed watched a couple of trains pass on the railway line one was a diesel which was quite exciting but hed soon got bored there too he walked up the track by the river up to the dam it was very warm and still the waters of the loch were like a mirror he walked along the path between the plantation and the shore of the loch looking for interesting stuff but you usually only found that sort of thing down at the big loch there was a rowing boat out in the middle of the little loch but he couldnt see anybody in it he was banned from making rafts or taking boats out just because hed got a bit wet a few times it was unfair he sat down in the grass took out a little diecast model of a gloster javelin and played with it for a while pretending he was a camera tracking the plane through the grass and over the pebbles and rocks by the loch side he lay back in the grass looked at the blue sky and closed his eyes for a long time soaking up the pinkness behind his eyelids and pretending he was a lion lying tawny and sated under the african sun or a sleepyeyed tiger basking on some rock high over a wide indian plain then he opened his eyes again and looked around at a world gone grey until that effect wore off he looked down at the shore little waves were lapping rhythmically at the stones he watched the wavelets for a while they were very regular he looked along the nearby stretch of shore the waves hardly noticeable but there if you looked were coming ashore all along the lochside he followed the line they seemed to indicate out to the little rowing boat near the middle of the loch now he thought about it it was very odd that there was nobody in the boat it was moored he could see the wee white buoy it was tied to but there was nobody visible in the boat the more carefully he looked the more certain he became that it was the rowing boat that all these little rhythmic waves were coming from hadnt ken and mary been going fishing today he had thought theyd meant seafishing in loch fyne but maybe he hadnt been paying attention what if they had been fishing from the rowing boat and fallen overboard and both been drowned maybe that was why the boat was empty he scanned the surface of the loch no sign of bobbing bodies or any clothing perhaps theyd sunk anyway what was making the boat make those waves he wasnt sure but he thought he could see the boat moving very slightly rocking to and fro maybe it was a fish flopping about in the bottom then he thought he heard a cry like a bird or maybe a woman it made him shiver despite the heat the boat seemed to stop rocking then moved quite a lot and then went totally still the little waves went on then a few slightly bigger less regular ones lapped ashore then the water went still and was as flat as a pane of glass a gull a white scrap across the calm sky flapped lazily just above the blue loch it made to land on the prow of the little rowing boat then at the last second even as its feet were about to touch it suddenly burst up into the sky again all panic and white feathers and its calls sounded over the flat water as it flapped away what sounded very like laughter came from the little rowing boat rory shrugged put the model plane in the pocket of his shorts and decided to go back down to the village and see if there was anybody around to play with yet kenneth and mary held hands at tea that evening and said they wanted to get married mum and dad seemed quite happy fiona didnt seem in the least surprised rory was nonplussed it was years before he made the connection between those tiny rhythmically lapping waves and that blushing excited announcement chapter gaineamh castle home of the urvills once again stands amongst the alders rowans and oaks that cover the northern flanks of the cnoc na moine due south of the carbuncular outcrop that supports the first millennium fort of dunadd and a little northwest of the farm rejoicing in the name of dunamuck the castle a moderately large example of the scottish zplan type with cannonshaped stone waterspouts has a fine view through the trees and across the parkland and fields to the town of gallanach which spreads round the deep waters of inner loch crinan like some slow but determined beachhead of architecture somehow landed from the sea the sound of gravel crunching beneath a car tyre has always meant something special to me at once comforting and exciting of course the one time i tried to explain this to my father he suggested that what it really signified was the easy rolling pressure the middle and upper classes thought it was their right to exert upon the multitudinous base of the workers i have to confess that the entire counterrevolution in world affairs has come as something of a personal relief to me making my dad seem no longer quite so remorselessly wellcluedup but rather if anything any more just quaint it would have been sweet to tackle him on that subject at the time especially given that gorbys unleashed restructuring had just resulted in the spectacular and literal deconstruction of one of the ages most resonantly symbolic icons but at the time we werent talking prentice rumbled the slightly bloated urvill of urvill taking my hand and briefly shaking it as if weighing my mitt i felt for a moment the way a young bull ought to feel when the man from mcdonalds slaps its haunch but then probably doesnt so very sorry fergus urvill said i wondered whether he was referring to grandma margots death itself her detonation or doctor fyfes apparent attempt to upstage the old girl uncle fergus let my hand go and how are your studies going oh just fine i said good good and the twins are they both well i asked fine fine fergus nodded presumably allocating his two daughters a word each in his reply fergs gaze went smoothly to my aunt antonia i took the hint and like margot passed on antonia i heard behind me so very sorry helen and diana uncle fergs two lusciously lissom daughters sadly couldnt be here diana spent most of her time either in cambridge or the least touristy part of hawaii which is the bit thirty kilometres away from the beaches four of them vertically at the mauna kea observatory studying the infrared helen on the other hand worked for a bank in switzerland dealing with the ultrarich prentice are you all right my mother took me in her arms held me to her black coat still splashing on the no by the smell of it her green eyes looked bright my father had been at the head of the reception line i had ignored him and the compliment had been returned im fine i told her no but are you really she squeezed my hands yes im really really fine come and see us please she hugged me again said quietly prentice this is silly make it up with your father for me mum please i said feeling like everybody was looking at us ill see you later okay i said and pulled away i walked into the hall taking off my jacket blinking hard and sniffing coming from cold into warmth always does this to me the entrance hall of gaineamh castle sports the business end of a dozen or so beheaded male red deers perched so high up on the oakpanelled walls that attempting to utilise them for their only conceivable practical purpose in such a location hanging coats scarves jackets etc on their impressively branched antlers only exposes them as the venue for a kind of nonreturnable sport rather than a sensible amenity rather more prosaic brass hooks like smooth unsuitable claws beneath the glasseyed stares of the stags accepted our garments in their stead my much bezippered black leather pretendbikers jacket seemed a little out of place amongst the sober wools and furs veritys snowwhite skiing jacket looked well just sublime i stood and stared at it for a second or two longer than was probably fit but it really did seem to glow in the dark company i sighed and decided to keep my white silk mobius scarf on i entered the hammerbeamed solar of the castle the great hall was filled with a quietly chattering crowd of mchoans urvills and others all nibbling canapes and volauvants and sipping whisky and sherries i suspect my grandmother would have preferred panloaf sarnies and maybe a few slices of hamandegg pie but it had i suppose been a kind gesture of the urvill to ask us back here and one should not carp somehow the mchoan home still bearing the scars of grandmas sudden unorthodox and vertical reentry into the conservatory following her abortive attempt to demoss the gutters seemed unfitting as our postcremation retreat there i caught sight of verity standing looking out of one of the solars tall mullioned windows the wide grey light of this chill november day soft upon her skin i stopped and looked at her a hollowness in my chest as though my heart had become a vacuum pump verity conceived beneath a tree two millennia old and born to the flare and snap of human lightning emerging to emergency making her entrance and duly entrancing whistling or humming the first phrase of deacon blues born in a storm whenever i saw her had become a sort of ritual with me a little personal theme in the life lived as movie existence as opera see verity play them tunes it was in itself a way of possessing her i hesitated thought about going over to her then decided id best get a drink first and started towards the sideboard with the glasses and bottles before i realised that offering to refresh veritys glass would be as good a way as any of getting talking to her i turned again and almost collided with my uncle hamish prentice he said in tones of great import and sobriety he put one hand on my shoulder and we turned away from the window where verity stood and away from the drinks to walk up the length of the hall towards the stainedglass height of the gableend window your grandmother has gone to a better place prentice uncle hamish told me i looked back at the vision of wonderfulness that was verity then glanced at my uncle yes uncle hamish dad called uncle hamish the tree because he was very tall moved in a rather awkward way as though made out of something less flexible than the standard issue of bone sinew muscle and flesh and so he claimed at any rate because he had seen him act in a school play once and he had been very well wooden anyway my dad had insisted when hed originally confided this private piece of nomenclature only half a decade earlier on the occasion of my sixteenth birthday when wed got drunk together for the first time he just lumbers about she was a good woman and did little that was bad and much that was good so im sure she has gone to a reward rather than a punishment living amongst our anticreates i nodded and as we strolled amongst them looked around at the various members of my family the mcguskies grandma margots maidenfamily the urvill clan and sundry worthies from gallanach lochgilphead and lochgair and pondered not for the first time what on earth or anywhere else for that matter had given uncle hamish the idea for his bizarre homemade religion i really didnt want to go into all this right now and anyway found the whole subject a little awkward because i wasnt actually quite as gungho for hamishs personal theology as he seemed to think i was she was always very kind to me i told him and therefore your anticreate will be kind to her uncle hamish said still with one hand on my shoulder as we stopped and looked up at the stainedglass monstrosity at the far end of the hall this showed in graphic form the story of the urvills from about the time of the norman conquest when the family of urveille from octeville in cotentin had crossed into england percolated northwards swirled briefly around dunfermline and edinburgh and finally come to rest perhaps afflicted by some maritime memory of their ancestral lands on the seam of the manche in what had been the very epicentre of the ancient scots kingdom of dalriada losing only a few relatives and a couple of letters on the way swearing allegiance to david i here they have stayed to mingle their blood with that of the picts the scots the angles the britons and the vikings who have all variously settled colonised raided and exploited this part of argyll or maybe just arrived at one time and forgotten to leave again the peregrinations and subsequent local achievements of the clan urvill make interesting history and would make fascinating viewing if the giant window telling the tale wasnt so badly done the fashionable but untalented son of one of the previous head urvills school pals had been commissioned to execute the work and had taken the brief all too literally deadly dull and eyesquintingly garish at the same time the stained glass window made me want to grit my teeth yes im sure youre right uncle i lied of course i am prentice he nodded slowly uncle hamish is balding but of the school that believes long wisps of hair grown on one side of the head and then combed delicately across the pate to the other edge look better than naked sin exposed to the elements i watched the coloured light from the stained glass window slide over shiny skin and hardly less luminescent oiled hair and thought what a prat he looked i inadvertently found myself humming the appropriate piece of music from the hamlet cigar adds and thinking of gregor fisher will you join me in worship this evening prentice oh shit i thought perhaps not actually uncle i said in tones i hoped sounded regretful have to pop down the jac to talk to a girl about a jacuzzi probably go straight from here another lie uncle hamish looked at me the grainlike lines on his forehead bunching and tangling his brown eyes like knots a jacuzzi prentice he pronounced the word the way the lead in a jacobean tragedy might pronounce the name of the character who has been his nemesis yes a jacuzzi thats a form of bath isnt it it is not meeting this young lady in a bath are you prentice uncle hamishs lips twisted slowly into what was probably meant to be a smile i dont believe the facilities of the jacobite bar run to such a thing uncle i told him theyve only recently got round to installing hot water in the gents the relevant jacuzzi is in berlin the german city i thought about this could i have misheard ash and she have been talking about the briefly famous charttopping band of the same name i thought not yes uncle the city where the wall was i see uncle hamish nodded berlin he stared up at the violently clashing leaden imagery of the great stainedglass window isnt that where ilsa is i frowned aunt ilsa no shes in patagonia isnt she incommunicado uncle hamish looked suitably confused as he contemplated the garish gable glass then he nodded ah yes of course he looked back down at me however shall we see you for supper prentice i dont know i admitted just as likely to end up with a kebab i imagine or a fish supper well you have your key with you oh yes thanks and ill be you know quiet when i come in right uncle hamish gazed back up at the crass glass right well probably be off in a halfhour or so let us know if you do want a lift surely right you are then uncle hamish nodded turned then looked back with an intensely puzzled expression did i hear somebody say mother exploded i nodded pacemaker thats what doctor fyfe was rushing to tell us told dad in the ambulance but it was too late by then of course uncle hamish looked more baffled than ever but nodded eventually and said of course and walked off over the parquet with a startlingly treelike creaking noise which i realised with a small but welcome surprise was issuing from his black brogues i made straight for the sideboard with the drinks but a quick inspection of the casement of the relevant window on my way there revealed that verity the comely had gone fortingall is a modest hamlet in the hills north of loch tay and it was there in the winter of that my aunt charlotte was determined to consummate her marriage specifically she wanted to be impregnated beneath the ancient yew tree that lies in an enclosure within the graveyard of the small church there she was convinced that the tree two thousand years old according to reliable estimates must be suffused with a magical life force it was a dark and stormy night no really the grass under the ancient straggling gnarled yew was sodden and so she and her husband steve had to settle for a kneetrembler while charlotte held onto one of the overhanging boughs but it was there and then despite the effects of gravity that the gracile and quiveringly prepossessing verity was conceived one loud night under an ink black sky obscuring a white full moon at an hour when all decent folk where in their beds and even the indecent ones were in somebodys in a quaint little perthshire village back in the fag end of the dear old daft old hippy days so my aunt says and frankly i believe her anybody wacko enough ever to have bought the idea that there was some sort of weird cosmic energy beaming out of a geriatric shrub in a backendofnowhere scottish graveyard on a wet monday night probably hasnt the wit to lie about it naw shes great i mean really really great im in love i love her im hers verity take me put me out of my misery o god i was drunk it was getting on towards midnight in the jacobite bar and at my normal rate of drinking that meant id had about ten pints of export ash and dean watt and another couple of old pals andy langton and lizzie polland had all drunk about the same as i had but then theyd been home for their tea and they hadnt been swilling back the urvills whisky for a significant part of the afternoon so have you told her prentice ash said putting down another set of pints on the pocked copper table we were hunched around ah ash i said slapping the table i admire a woman who can carry three pints at the same time i said have you told this lassie you love her prentice ash said sitting down she took a bottle of strong cider from one breast pocket of her navy shirt and a glass of whisky from the other wow i said ash i mean like wow wicked i shook my head took up my old pint and finished it answer the lassie dean said nudging me no i havent i confessed ya coward said lizzie ill tell her for you if you like droid offered there is an entire generation of andrews with the shared nickname of droid post star wars na i said but she is just fabulous i mean why not tell her liz asked im shy i sighed hand on heart eyes heavenward lashes fluttering get out a here so tell her ash said also i sighed shes got a boyfriend ahha ash said looking at her pint i waved one hand dismissively but hes a wanker thats all right then liz said i frowned actually thats the only flaw verity seems to have her lousy taste in men so you are in with a chance then liz said brightly yeah i said i think shes going to chuck him prentice ash insisted tapping the table tell her i cant why not because i wouldnt know how to i protested ive never told anybody i love them before i mean how do you the words sound so corny so devalued its so its just such a cliche ash looked scornful what rubbish well smartypants i said leaning over to her have you ever told anybody you love them hundreds of times darling ash said in a deep voice pouting dean guffawed ash drank from her pint then shook her head well actually no ha i said ash leaned over to me her long nose almost touching mine tell the girl you idiot i cant i said sitting back i just cant shes too perfect what ash frowned infallible too perfect ideal sounds like misogynist romantic shite to rne snorted liz whos always taken a hard line on such things it is i admitted but shes just incredible dyou know where she was conceived dean and ash exchanged looks andy spluttered into his beer while lizzie rolled her eyes aw yeah dean said nodding and looking quite serious doesnt everybody i was shocked and almost cut short my next gulp of beer you dont really do you course not prentice ash said shaking her head her long fair hair spilled from over one shoulder what diff aw its just incredible i told them her mum told me aunt charlotte bit of a nutter but okay i mean totally aff her heid really but anyway i took another gulp of beer she had this thing about psychic energy or some crap like that and about scottish history aw runs in the family does it prentice dean asked naw shes not a mchoan anyway shed married this english guy called walker and they hadnt consummated the marriage right not on their wedding night she wanted to wait and when they did get it together she made sure it was in this wee village called fortingall right near loch tay thing is shed heard something about fortingall being where pontius pilate wait a minute dean said how long was it between them getting married and them humping eh i scratched my head i dont know a day or two oh i mean theyd done it before like it wasnt their first time or anything it was just aunt charlottes idea that itd be more special if they hadnt done it for a while and then did it under this tree but they had been fucking before i mean good grief this is the love generation were talking about here right dean said apparently mollified anyway fortingall is where some people say pontius pilate was born and whit andy said wiping his beard away ye go so they say i insisted his dad was in the shit the seventh legion the ninth damn i scratched my head again looked down at my trainers and thought with some relief that at least tonight i would not have the long struggle to undo the buckles and untie and then loosen the laces on the docs which were my usual drinking gear these days or was it the seventh legion i pondered still staring at my nikes never mind if it was the fuckin foreign legion droid said exasperated youre no trying to tell us pontius fucking pilate was born in scotland well maybe i said spreading my arms wide and almost spilling ashs whisky his dad was in the legion stationed there apparently i mean the romans had a military camp and pontius pilates pa was stationed there maybe and so young pontius could have been born there why not youre making this up laughed ash youre just like your dad i remember those stories on a sunday afternoon i am not like ma dad i yelled hey shoosh lizzie said well im not im telling the truth aye well ash said maybe people get born in funny places david byrne was born in dumbarton anyway pontius pi whit dean grimaced the guy that wrote tutti frutti listen pontius na that was john byrne lizzie said david byrne the guy in talking heads ya heidbanger look anyway forget ponti anyway it was little richard will you shut up this isnt about pon what in talking heads shut up im telling you po na that wrote tutti frutti i give in i said sitting back i sighed supped my export aye the song but no the film it wasnae a fillum it was a series ah know you knew what ah meant i hate these drunken rambling conversations i breathed aye but ive heard worse ash nodded anyway it wasnae fillum at all it was video it was naawwwt dean drawled scornfully ye could see it was fillum what sort a telly have you got i crossed my legs crossed my arms and swivelled to look at ash i rubbed my rather greasy face and focused on her hi come here often ashley pursed her lips and studied the ceiling just the once she said frowning at me in the toilets she gathered my shirt lapels in her fist and pulled me close to her face so who talked fnarr fnarr i breathed over her ashs face wrinkled quite attractively actually but then it was late hi youse a deep voice said bending over us yer oan on what i asked the very large fellow with very long hair who had spoken the pool table pm and aw thats youse is it no shit aye right enough ash and i went to play pool id been just about to ask her about the jacuzzi in berlin but now didnt seem like the right time uncle fergus had the observatory built back in when the heavenly verity was four the idea was twofold first of all according to my father fergus wanted a bigger and better telescope than he had dad had a threeinch refractor in a shed in the garden at lochgair fergus ordered a sixinch reflector also it was a business sample the lenses and mirror were to be made in the new specialist glass division of the gallanach glass works the urvillowned factory which even yet provides the town with a significant proportion of its employment not only therefore would uncle fergus have a fascinating and unique additional feature for his notlong restored castle it would be both an advertisement for his glass works and taxdeductible the fact the telescope was a wee bit close to gallanach itself and so possibly prone to light pollution from the towns sodium vapour lamps was less of a problem than it might appear with uncle ferguss connections he could have the offending lamps shaded at the councils expense so uncle fergus was prepared if necessary and only selectively of course to dim his home town his niece had already bettered that when the diminutive bloody and bawling form of verity walker had appeared on the scene the lights had actually gone out id met the sublime verity for the first time in some years in the observatory one coalsackblack moonless night in a few days before i left to go to university when i was already full of the exhilaration and fear of departure and independence and the whole huge world seemed to be opening up before me like some infinite blossom of opportunity and glamour the twins had taken to having stargazing parties in the cold cramped hemisphere which protruded from the summit of the compact castle and id arrived late after being out on the hill with little brother james during the afternoon and then suffering a delayed tea because some friends of dads had showed up unannounced and had to be catered for aye its yourself prentice boomed mrs mcspadden informatively and how are you mrs mcspadden was the urvills housekeeper a rotundly buxom lady of perpetual middleage with a big bawface that gave the impression of being freshly scrubbed she had a very loud voice and dad always told people that she hailed from fife a ringing noise in ones ears after a close encounter with the lady tended to enforce the impression this was literally true the rest are up there will you take this tray up theres coffee in these pots you just turn the wee spot to the front here ken and she lifted the corner of a heavy napkin smothering a very large plate theres hot sausage rolls under here right thanks i said lifting the tray id come in through the castle kitchen entering through the main door after it had been shut for the night could be a performance i made for the stairs here prentice take this scarf up to miss helen mrs mcspadden said flourishing the article that lassiell catch her death of cold up there one night so she will i bowed my head so that mrs s could put the scarf over my neck and mind them theres plenty of bread and some chicken in the fridge and cheese and plenty of soup forbye if you get hungry again right thanks i repeated and jogged carefully upstairs anybody got any roach paper i squeezed into the brightlylit dome of the observatory it was about three metres in diameter made from aluminium the telescope took up a lot of it and it was cold despite a wee twobar electric heater a modestly proportioned ghettoblaster was playing something by the cocteau twins diana and helen bundled in enormous mongolian quilted jackets were crouched round a small table with darren watt playing cards my elder brother lewis was at the telescope we all said our hellos this is cousin verity remember her helen said as she draped the scarf id brought her over darrens head helen pointed at a cloud of smoke and as it blew towards me and cleared i saw her there was a sort of cubbyhole in the nonrotating part of the observatory built into the attic of the castles main block it was just a long cupboard really but you could coorie down into it to make more space in the dome proper verity walker was lying in a sleeping bag there only her upper half protruding into the dome she was smoking one joint and rolling another on the cover of a pictorial atlas of the universe evening she said got any roach paper yeah hi i said i put the tray down searched my pockets pulled out some stuff the last time id seen verity walker maybe five or six years earlier shed been a scrawny tyke with a mouth full of orthodontic bracework and a serious shakin stevens habit now once seen through the smoke she had short pure blonde hair and a delicate almost elfin face which tapered to an exquisite chin that looked like it had been made to be grasped lightly in three fingers and pulled closer to your lips well to my lips anyway her eyes were the blue of old seaice and when i saw her complexion all i could think was wow lloyd cole city because she had perfect skin thatll do she took something from my hand thanks hey thats a library ticket i grabbed it back here i handed her half a book token my mother had given me thanks she started cutting it with a little pair of scissors its just a tokin token i told her squatting down beside her she grunted with laughter and my heart performed manoeuvres that the connecting plumbing makes topologically impossible all set for the big move bro lewis grinned down from the wee seat under the eyepiece of the telescope he reached over to the table where id set the tray down and started pouring coffee into the mugs my big brother has always seemed more than two years older than me a little taller than my and a little more thickset he looked bigger still at the time thanks to a beard of the burstsofa persuasion back then it was his turn to be in disgrace with my father because hed just dropped out of university yeah all set i told him found a place to stay i nodded at the telescope anything interesting tonight got it on the pleiades just now take a look we took turns stargazing playing cards crouching round the little electric heater and constructing joints id brought a half bottle of whisky and the twins had some brandy which we used to beef up the coffee the munchies struck again an hour or so after wed polished off the last of the sausage rolls the twins mounted an expedition into the depths of the castle in search of the mythical soup dragon we spoke in clanger while they were gone and returned with a steaming tureen and a halfdozen bowls wherere you staying in glasgow prentice darren watt asked hyndland i said slurping my soup lauderdale gardens ah thats no far from us going to be around on the thirtieth were having a party oh ah yeah probably actually id been going to come home that weekend but i could juggle things ah well come along should be fun thanks darren watt was in his last year at art school and for me at least had been the epitome of cool since new year two years earlier after the bells mum had driven lewis and me into gallanach we went to a party droid and his chums were giving darren had been there blond lean dropdead bone structure and exuding style id admired the looped silk scarf hed worn over a red velvet jacket that would have looked silly on most people but in which he looked totally poised hed given me the scarf and when id tried to demur explained he was growing bored with it better it went to somebody who would appreciate it though he hoped id hand it on too if i ever tired of it so i took it it was just an ordinary silk scarf given a half twist and the ends carefully sewn together but that of course made it a mobius scarf the very idea of which i just thought was wonderful i thought darren was pretty wonderful too and for a while wondered if maybe i was gay too but decided against it in fact a large part of the attraction of an invite to a party at darrens place was due to the fact his flatmates were three salivatingly attractive and reputedly enthusiastically heterosexual female arts students id met them when hed brought them to gallanach on a day trip the previous year you still making models of these wavepowered hoodjiemaflips i asked him finishing my soup darren was wiping his plate with a bit of bread and i found myself copying him aye he said looking thoughtful looks like ive found a sponsor for the real thing too what really darren grinned big cement companys interested talking about a serious money grant wow congratulations for the last eighteen months or so darren had been making these tenthscale wood and plastic models of sculptures he wanted to build full size in concrete and steel one day the idea was to construct these things on a beach hed need planning permission ots of money and waves the sculptures were wavepowered mobiles and fountains when a wave struck them a giant wheel would revolve or air would be forced through pipes producing weird chestshaking cathedraldemolishing bass notes and uncanny howls and moans or the water in the waves themselves would be channelled funnelled and emerge in a whalelike spout of spray bursting from the top or sides of the sculpture they sounded great perfectly feasible and i wanted to see one work so this was good news i went downstairs for a pee and came back to a goodnatured but confused argument what do you mean no it doesnt verity said from her sleepingbagged cubbyhole i mean what is sound lewis said the definition is what we hear so if theres nobody there to hear it sounds a bit anthrothingy to me helen urvill said from the card table but how can it fall without making a sound verity protested thats crazy i leaned over to darren who was sitting looking amused we talking trees falling in forests i asked he nodded youre not listening lewis told verity maybe youre not making a sound shut up prentice lewis said without bothering to look at me what im saying is what is a sound if you define it as yeah interrupted verity but if the tree hits the ground that must make the air move ive stood near a tree when its felled you feel the ground shake doesnt the ground shake either when theres nobody there the air has to move there must be movement in the air its molecules i mean compression waves i provided nodding to verity and thinking about darrens wavepowered organpipe coast sculptures yeah producing compression waves verity said with an acknowledging wave at me oh my heart leapt which birds and animals and insects can hear ah lewis said supposing there arent well it got silly after that dissolving into the polemical equivalent of white noise but i liked the robustly commonsensical line verity was taking and when she was talking of course i got to stare at her without anybody thinking it odd it was wonderful i was falling in love with her beauty and brains wow more sounds more spliffs more stargazing lewis did his impression of a radio being tuned through various wavelengths fingers at his lips to produce the impressively authentic betweenstations noises then suddenly putting on silly voices to impersonate a news reader compere quiz contestant singer rrrrsssshhhh reports that the london chapter of the zoroastrians have firebombed the offices of the sun newspaper for blasphemy zzzoooowwwaaanngggg athangyou athangyou laze an gemen andenow please put your hands together for the siamese twins rrrraaasshhhwwwaaaassshhhaaa uh can you eat it bob ah no you cant im afraid the answer is a pot nooddle bllbllbllbl hey hey were the junkies zpt and so on we laughed we drank more coffee and we smoked the gear was black and powerful like the night the hollow aluminium skull of the observatory tracked the scopes single eye slowly over the rolling web of stars or handcranked swivelled the universe about our one fixed point soon my head was spinning too the music machine played away far away and when i started to understand the lyrics of a cocteau twins song i knew i was wrecked the stars shone on in mysterious galactic harmonies constellations like symphonies of ancient trembling light lewis told weird and creepy stories and bizarrely apposite jokes and the twins hunkered over the little cardtable in their quilted jackets their nightblack hair straight and shining and framing their broadboned beautiful faces looked like proud mongolian princesses calmly contemplating creation from the nbbed dome of some fumefilled yurt midnightpitched on the endless rolling asian steppe verity walker professed sceptic though she was read my palm her touch like warm velvet her voice like the spoken ocean and in her eyes each iris like a bluewhite sun stationed a billion light years off she told me id be sad and id be happy and id be bad and id be good and i believed all of it and why not and she told me the last part in clanger the tinwhistle pretend language from one of the childrens programmes wed all watched as youngsters and she was trying to keep a straight face and lew and dar and di and hel were snorting with laughter and even i was grinning but id been singing happily along to the cocteau twins otherworldly words for the past hour and i knew exactly what she said even though she might not have known herself and fell completely in love with her irisblue eyes and her wheatcrop hair and her peatdark voice and the peachskin fuzz of infinitesimally fine hairs on her creamy skin what was all that stuff about pontius pilate anyway ash said aw i waved my hand too complicated ash and i stood on a low little mound overlooking what had been the slate mine wharf at the northwest limit of gallanach where the kilmartin burn flows out of the hills meanders without conviction then widens to form part of gallanach bay before finally decanting into the deeper waters of inner loch crinan here was where the docks had been when the settlement had exported first coal then slate then sand and glass before the railway arrived and a subtle victorian form of gentrification had set in the shape of the railway pier the steam packet hotel and the clutch of seafacing villas only the fishing fleet had remained constant sporadically crowded amongst its inner harbour in the stony lap of the old town swelling dying burgeoning again then falling away once more shrinking like the holes in its nets ashley had dragged me out here now in the wee small hours of what had become a clear night with the stars steady and sharp in the grip of this november darkness after the jacobite bar and after wed trooped victorious at pool by the way back to lizzie and droids flat via mcgreedys actually mccreadies fast food emporium and after consuming our fishpieblack pudding suppers and after a cup of tea and a j or two and after wed got back to the watt family home in the rowanfield council estate only to discover that mrs watt was still up watching allnight tv does casey casen never sit down in that chair and made us more tea and after a last wee numbrero sombrero in deans room im going for a walk guys okay ash had announced coming back from the toilet cistern flushing somewhere in the background pulling her coat back on id suddenly got paranoid that i had overstayed my welcome and in some dopey drunken excess of stupidity missed lots of hints i looked at my watch handed the remains of the j to dean aye id better be off too i wasnt trying to get rid of you ash said as she closed the front door after us id said goodbye to mrs watt ash had said she would be back in quarter of an hour or so shit i thought maybe i was being thickskinned i said as we walked the short path to a wee garden gate in the low hedge thatll be the day prentice ash laughed you really going to walk at this time of night i looked up the night was clear now and colder i pulled on my gloves my breath was the only cloud nostalgia ash said stopping on the pavement last visit to somewhere i used to go a lot when i was a wean wow really how far is it can i come i have a fascination with places people think powerful or important if i hadnt been still fairly drunk id have been a lot more subtle about asking to accompany ash but well there you are happily she just laughed quietly turned on her heel and said aye come on isnt far so here we stood on the wee mound only five minutes from the watt house down bruce street through a snicket across the oban road and over the weedy waste ground where the dock buildings stood long ago the dockside was maybe ten metres away the skeletal remains of a crane stood lopsided a little way along the cancered tarmac its foundations betrayed by rotten wooden piling splaying out from the side of the wharf like broken black bones mud glistened in the moonlight the sea was a taste and a distant glittering that all but disappeared if you looked at it straight ash seemed lost in thought staring away to the west i shivered unstudded the wide lapels of the fake bikers jacket and pulled the zip up to my right shoulder so that my chin was encased mind if i ask what were doing here i asked behind and to our left the lights of gallanach were steady orange like all british towns forever warning the inhabitants to proceed with caution ash sighed her head dropped a little she nodded down at the ground we stood upon thought you might know what this is prentice i looked down its a wee lump of ground i said ash looked at me all right i said making a flapping action with my elbows id have spread my hands out wide but i wanted to keep them in my pockets even with my gloves on i dont know what is it ash bent down and i saw one pale hand at first stroke the grass and then dig down delving into the soil itself she squatted like that for a moment then pulled her hand free rose brushing earth from her long white fingers this is the ballastmound the worldhill prentice she said and i could just make out her small thin smile by the light of the gibbous moon when the ships came here from all over the world for whatever it was they were shipping from here at the time they would sometimes arrive unladen just ballast in them you know she looked at me i nodded ballast yeah i know what ballast is stops ships doing a herald of free enterprise just rocks picked up from wherever the ship last set sail from ash said looking to the west again but when it got here they didnt need it so they dumped it here i breathed looking at the modest mound with new respect always here thats what my grampa told me when i was a bairn ash said he used to work in the docks rolling barrels catching slings loading sacks and crates in the holds drove a crane later ashley pronounced the word cran in the appropriate clydeside manner i stood amazed i wasnt supposed to be getting ashamed at my lack of historical knowledge until monday back at uni hen hed say theres aw ra wurld unner yon tarp a grass i watched from one side as ashley smiled remembering i never forgot that id come out here by myself when i was a kid just to sit here and think i was sitting on rocks that had once been a bit of china or brazil or australia or america ash squatted down resting on her heels but i was whispering or india to myself just then and for one long swimheaded instant my veins seemed to run with oceanblood dark and carrying as the black water sucking at the edges of the tumbledown wharf beneath us i thought god how we are connected to the world and suddenly found myself thinking about uncle rory again our family connection to the rest of the globe our wanderer on the planet i stared up at the broken face of moon dizzy with wonder and a hunger to know when he was younger than i am now my uncle rory went on what was supposed to be a world trip he got as far as india fell in love with the place went walkabout circulating to kashmir from delhi then along the hem of the himalayas crossing the ganga at patna asleep on the train then zigzagging from country to coast and back again but always heading or trying to head south collecting names and steam trains and friends and horrors and adventures then at the very hanging tip of the subcontinent from the last stone at low tide on cape comorin one slack dogday reversing heading north and west still swinging from interior to coast writing it all down in a series of school exercise books rejoicing in the wild civility of that ocean of people the vast ruins and fierce geography of the place its accrescent layers of antiquity and bureaucracy the bizarre images and boggling scale of it recording his passage through the cities and the towns and villages over the mountains and across the plains and the rivers through places i had heard of like srinagar and lucknow through places whose names had become almost banal through their association with curries like madras and bombay but also through places he cheerfully confessed hed visited for their names as much as anything else alleppey and deolali cuttack and calicut vadodara and trivandrum surendranagar and tonk but all the while looking and listening and questioning and arguing and reeling with it all making crazed comparisons with britain and scotland hitching and riding and swimming and walking and when he was beyond the reach of money doing tricks with cards and rupees for his supper and then reaching delhi again then agra and a trek from an ashram to the great ganga head fuddled by sun and strangeness to see the great river at last and then the long drift on a barge down to the farakka barrage a train to calcutta and a plane to heathrow half dead with hepatitis and incipient malnutrition in london after a month in hospital he typed it all out got his friends in the squat where he lived to read it called it the deccan traps and other unlikely destinations and sent it to a publisher it very nearly sank without trace but then it was serialised in a sunday newspaper and suddenly with no more warning or apparent cause than that traps just was the rage and he was there i read the book when was thirteen and again tour years later when i understood it better it was hard to be objective still is but i think it is a good book gauche and naïve in places but startling vivacious he went with his eyes open and not having taken a camera just tried to record everything on the pages of those cheap exercise books straining to make it real for himself as though he could not believe he had seen and heard and experienced what he had until it was fixed somewhere other than in his stunned brain and so he could describe walking towards the taj mahal hohum thinks the reader immediately in the realm of the tacky postcard and still give you a wholly fresh impression of the exact scale and actual presence of that white tomb delicate but powerful compact and yet boundlessly imposing epic grace with those two words he encapsulated it and you knew exactly what he meant and so our rory became famous at that moment on the very lip of the escarpment of his fame the rosy cliffs forever at his back as he wandered on ash squatted down resting on her heels she tore a piece of grass from the mound ran it through her fingers and id come here when my daddypaddy was beating the living shit out of my mum and sometimes us too she looked up at me stop me if youve heard this one before prentice i hunkered down too shaking my head as much to clear it as to deny well not exactly but i knew it wasnt all sweetness and light chez watt fuckin right it wasnt ash said and sounded bitter the blade or grass ran through her fingers was turned round passed through again she looked up shrugged anyway sometimes i came out here just because the house smelled of chipfat or the telly was too loud just to remind myself there was more to the world than bruce street and endless arguments about fag money and which one of us got a new pair of shoes aye well i said at a loss really to know what to say maybe i get uncomfortable being reminded there are worse backgrounds than coming from a family of mostly amiable overachievers anyway she said again theyre levelling the lot tomorrow ash looked back over her shoulder i followed her gaze thats what all that plants for i remembered the triffid jokes we used to make about heavy plant crossing and only then saw the dim outlines of a couple of bulldozers and a jcb a little way off down the piece of waste ground aw shit i said eloquently an exclusive marina development with attractive fishingvillagestyle one and twobedroom flats with dedicated moorings double garages and free membership of the private health club ash said in a kelvinside accent fffuck i shook my head what the hell ashley said rising i suppose the glasgow middle classes have to go somewhere after theyve braved the treacherous waters of the crinan canal she gave her hands one final dust hope theyre happy there we turned to leave the mound me and the ash then i grabbed her arm hi she turned to me berlin i said the jacuzzi i just remembered oh yeah she started walking down the slope back to the weeds the junk and the anklehigh remains of old brick walls i followed her i was in frankfurt she said seeing this friend from college we heard things were happening in berlin so we hitched and trained it met up with well its a long story but i ended up in this fancy hotel in the swimming pool and had a big whirlpool bath in a wee sort of island at one end and this drunken english guy was trying hard to chat me up and making fun of my accent and cheeky basturt i said as we got to the main road we waited while a couple of cars sped north out of town thats what i thought ashley nodded as we crossed the road anyway when i told him where i came from he started saying he knew the place well and hed been shooting here and fishing and knew the laird and do we have a laird i didnt know perhaps he meant uncle fergus maybe though when i asked him that he got cagey and said no but the point is he was acting all mysterious about something and hed already said there was somebody here who was having the wool pulled over their eyes and had been for a long time and he thought their name was ash stopped at the snicket that led up to bruce street my route back to uncle hamishs house went straight along the main road i looked up the wee path lit by a single yellow street lamp half way up then i looked back into ashley watts eyes not mchoan by any chance i asked yep ash nodded hmm i said because mchoans are fairly thin on the ground around here or anywhere for that matter who was this guy journalist there to cover the big knockdown what was his name rudolph something i think somebody called him he wouldnt say you might have used your feminine wiles well at the time they were more or less fully employed on a systems analyst from texas with shoulders wide as the prairie sky and a gold company amex card to be perfectly honest prentice ash smiled sweetly i shook my head saucy bitch ash grabbed my balls through my s and squeezed gently my breath baled out language prentice she said then released covered my mouth with hers wiped my teeth with her tongue then swivelled walked away wow i said the old testes were complaining but only slightly i cleared my throat night ashley i said cool as i could ash turned grinning then reached into her big navallooking jacket with the brass buttons and fished something out threw it i caught the projectile a little lump of grey concrete smooth and dark on one side die mauer she said walking backwards actually from the section near the brandenburg gate where it said viele viele bunte smarties the red paint on one surface used to be in the middle of the dot in the last i bit of the world that used to be between germanics she waved night prentice i looked at the grainy chunk of concrete in my hand wow i breathed ashs fair hair flared briefly under the street light then dimmed as she walked away wow chapter he looked round the solar of the castle the big new window at the gable end of the hall was still covered with a translucent plastic sheet which rustled in the wind and crackled as the rain blew onto it a shifting grid of dark lines was the shadow of the scaffolding outside the highceilinged hall smelled of paint varnish new wood and drying plaster he walked over to one of the mullioned windows and stood there looking out at the low clouds as they drifted over gallanach soaking the dull town with the curving veils of rain they dragged beneath them like the train of some vast grey gown daddy daddy uncle fergus says we can go up on the roof with mum if were careful can we please can we promise we wont jump off lewis skipped into the hall dragging little prentice behind him lewis had his anorak back on and prentice was dragging his behind him over the shining parquet floor aye son i suppose so kenneth said sitting on his ankles to pull the younger boys jacket on and zipping it up lewis went leaping and whooping round the hall while this was going on not so loud lewis kenneth said without much conviction prentice smiled at his dad daddy he said in his slow croaky voice need the toilet kenneth sighed pulled the childs hood up then pushed it back down again aye well your mum will take you lewis he shouted lewis darted guiltily away from the paint pots hed been examining at the other end of the hall and came running over this is great daddy can we get a castle too aye no we cant afford it take your brother back to his mum he needs the toilet aww whined lewis staring accusingly at his young brother who just grinned at him and wiped his nose on one cuff of his anorak lewis prodded prentice in the back youre always spoiling things do as youre told lewis mchoan said straightening his knees complained as he did so on you go and be careful on that roof he waved them both towards the double doors theyd entered through lewis made a show of plodding off clumping one foot in front of another body swaying exaggeratedly he was pulling prentice by one toggle of his anorak hood by the hand lewis kenneth said wearily youre a pest boy lewis told his younger brother as they reached the doorway prentice turned and waved to his dad with his free hand bye daddy the wee voice said then he was pulled out of the room bye son mchoan said and smiled then he turned back to the window and the rain its a bit damp still ach yer no afraid of a bit a wet ur ye yer no a girrul ur ye no im not a girl but if i get my clothes mucky your dads rich he can buy you new clothes aye yer paws rich you could probably have new claes every day if you wantit dont be ridiculous all im saying kenneth could see both points of view lachy in a grimy shirt held together by odd buttons and a safety pin and tattered patched short trousers that drooped below his knees and had probably belonged to at least two elder brothers was already grubby and sporting the vivid remains of a black eye no one had mentioned because it had probably been his dad who gave it him fergus had nice wellfitting clothes on grey serge short trousers a new blue jersey and a tweed jacket with leather patches sewn on the elbows even kenneth felt a little dowdy in comparison his shorts had been darned at the back though he was getting a new pair when the next clothes rations came through the girls all wore skirts blouses and jerseys their socks were white not grey emma urvill had a coat with a little hood that made her look like a pixie are we playing this game or not she asked patience lachy said turning to the girl still standing holding her bike patience lassie emma looked skywards and made a tutting noise beside her kenneths sister ilsa also on her bike shook her head the castle stood on the side of the hill the tall trees around it were still dripping and its rough uneven stones were dark and wet from the rain that had not long stopped a watery sun gleamed on the dark leaves of the ivy that clung to one side of the ruin and in the forest behind a wood pigeon cooed softly oh what the heck fergus urvill said and rested his bike against a tree lachy watt let his bike fall to the ground kenneth lowered his to the damp grass alongside the girls propped theirs against the wooden rails at the start of the bridge the short wooden bridge about wide enough for a cart crossed a steep bushchoked gully about thirty feet deep at the bottom of this tiny dank glen a burn splashed and foamed it rushed out of the woods curled round three sides of the rock and grass knoll the roofless castle stood upon fell over a small waterfall then progressed gently afterwards joining the river add near the main road so that eventually its waters flowed through and beneath the town of gallanach and into the bay near the railway pier sun came suddenly making the grass bright and the ivy leaves sparkle the wind pushed through the forest with a quiet roar releasing drops of water all around kenneth watched a train on the viaduct at bridgend about a mile away the west wind was keeping its noise from them but he could see the steam rising quickly from the dark locomotive and whipping back over the halfdozen burgundy coaches in little white clouds that spread and were torn apart and flung away by the wind right lachy said whos het het fergus said you mean it you know what ah mean whos goin het first do one potato two potato suggested emma oh goad all right lachy said shaking his head and you shouldnt take the lords name in vain emma told him christ ahm sorry lachy said you did it again you a tim or sumhin im a christian emma said primly and i thought you were too lachlan watt ahm a protestant lachy said thats what am are can we get on with this please lisa said they all lined up fists clenched lachy ended up being it much to his own annoyance kenneth had never been inside the old castle you could just see it from the house if you knew what you were looking for and you could see it quite well if you used dads binoculars but it was on the urvill estate and even though their families had been friends for years generations dad said which meant even longer mr robb on whose farm the castle stood didnt like children and chased them off his fields and out of his woods whenever he could threatening them with his shotgun he couldnt chase fergus and emma urvill off though so they were all safe kenneth had wondered if mr robb was secretly a fifth columnist or even a nazi and was hiding men washed up from a sunken uboat or preparing a place for paratroopers to land but despite him and some of the other children watching mr robb very carefully from the woods a few times they had never been able to prove anything but they had explored the hidden garden a bit and decided the castle looked worth investigating the castle had dark intact dungeons at ground level and a stone staircase in a circular tower that rose to the open heart of the ruin where a few jumbled stones and a floor of earth and weed looked up to the sky the stairs wound further up inside the corner tower pausing at each longcollapsed floor above where a doorway looked out onto the central well another stairway pierced the walls themselves on the far side of the shell of the keep rising through their thickness past another three doorways hanging like internal balconies to a couple of small rooms at the top of dark chimneys which led to the base of the walls outside the castle held a variety of other dark nooks and shadowy crannies you could hide in as well as windows and fireplaces set high in the thick walls where you could climb if you were good at climbing and if you were really good you could climb up from the circular stairs to the very summit of the ruin where you could walk if you dared right round the thick tops of the walls over the weeds and the ivy sixty feet or more above the ground from there you could look out to sea over gallanach or into the mountains to the north and the forested hills to the south closer there was the overgrown walled garden across another bridge behind the castle where tangles of rhodies crowded under monkeypuzzle trees and a riot of exotic flowers attracted buzzing clouds of insects in the summer the rules were that you could hide anywhere in the castle kenneth and the others left lachy at the track side of the bridge counting slowly they laughed and squealed bumping into each other and shushing each other as they tried not to shout too loudly while they dithered and giggled over where to hide kenneth climbed up into a high window and crouched down eventually lachy came into the open hall of the castle looking around kenneth watched him for a moment then ducked back in flattened himself down as close to the stone sill of the window as he could he was the last to be found and for a while delighted in the fact that none of them could find him even after lachy had caught the rest and they were all shouting at him to come out so they could have another go he lay there feeling the damp breeze coming through the window and tickling the hairs on his bare legs he listened to the shouts of the others echoing in the castles emptied shell and to the voices of the crows and the wood pigeons in the trees and he smelled the dark wet smell of the moss and weeds that had found a foothold amongst the ruins grey stones he kept his eyes tightly closed and as he listened to them search for him and call on him there came a strange tight quivery feeling in his tummy which made him want to clench his teeth and bring his knees together and made him worry about wetting his pants i love this here he thought to himself i dont care if there is a war on and ferguss uncle got killed in north africa and wullie watt got killed in the north atlantic and lachy gets hit by his dad and we might have to move to another house because mr urvill wants ours back and i dont understand trigonometry and the germans do invade us i love this if i died right now i wouldnt care wouldnt care at all lachy climbed right up onto the top of the walls eventually and only then did he see kenneth kenneth came down yawning widely and rubbing his eyes and claiming he had fallen asleep hed won had he oh jolly good they played some more and made fun of fergus after hed won a game because kenneth had worked out what the two little rooms at the top of the second set of stairs were they were toilets and that was why the chimneys led down and went out of the castle it was so all the number one and numbers twos could fall down there fergus had hidden down a latrine and him worried about getting his clothes dirty too fergus denied they were toilets they were completely clean and didnt smell at all and they must be chimneys chimneys ma arse lachy laughed theyre shiteholes emma tutted but couldnt help smiling chimneys fergus insisted desperately blinking hard he looked at kenneth as though expecting him to agree kenneth looked down at the trampeddown earth under his feet theyre shiteholes so they are laughed lachy and youre just a big jobbie chimneys fergus protested his voice rising his face going red big jobbie big jobbie big smelly jobbie lachy chanted kenneth watched fergus shake with anger while lachy danced round the interior of the keep singing out big jobbie big jobbie big smelly jobbie fergus stared angrily at his sister and at kenneth as though betrayed then just stood and waited for lachy to get bored with his taunting and as kenneth watched a blank emotionless expression gradually replaced the anger on ferguss face kenneth had the fleeting extraordinary impression of seeing something buried alive and felt himself shake suddenly almost spastically shivering jobbie jobbie big smelly jobbie in the last game kenneth hid with emma urvill in one of the dungeons showing her how to turn her back to the light and put the hood of her coat up to hide her face and sure enough when ilsa came to the door of the dungeon and he felt that quivering scary glorious feeling in his tummy again she didnt see them and they hugged each other once she had gone and the hug was warm and tight and he liked it and she didnt let go and after a while they put their mouths together and kissed he felt a strange echo of that terrifyingly wonderful sensation in his belly and his heart and he and emma urvill held onto each other for ages until all the others were caught later they played in the tangling undergrowth of the walled garden and found an old overgrown fountain with the stone statue of a naked lady in it and an old shed at one corner where there were ancient tins and jars and bottles with victorianlooking writing on them the rain came on for a while and they all stayed in there fergus complaining about his bike rusting his sister and kenneth exchanging the occasional sly look ilsa staring out at the rain and saying there were places in south america where it hadnt stopped raining for hundreds of years and lachy mixing various sticky treacley subtances together from the shelves of old bottles and tins trying to find a combination that would explode or at least burn while the rain hammered then whispered then dripped on the tarred roof overhead and plopped through holes onto the springy wooden floor of the shed of course we havent moved all the bottles yet fergus said pointing with his pipe at the still unfilled racks that covered the wall of the cellar the cellar was painted white and lit by naked bulbs wires hung and there were unplastered holes for cables and plumbing leading through the walls and up to other floors the wood and metal wine racks gleamed as did the two hundred or so bottles that had already been stored should keep you going for a bit eh fergus he grinned once youve filled this lot up mmm we were thinking of touring a few vineyards next summer urvill said scratching his thick chin with his pipe bordeaux the loire that sort of thing dont know if you and mary fancy making a foursome or not hmm fergus blinked kenneth nodded well perhaps depends on holidays and that sort of thing and the kids of course oh fergus said frowning as he picked a little sliver of tobacco off his pringle sweater we werent thinking of taking the children ah well no of course not kenneth said as they went to the door fergus switched the lights out in the various cellars and they went up the stoneflagged steps towards the utility room and kitchen it was that cellar he thought to himself as he followed ferguss hush puppies up the steps that was where i hid with emma urvill and kissed her that cellar im sure it was that one and that window i was looking out earlier that was the one i hid in that day nearly thirty years ago im certain he felt a terrible weight of time and loss settle on him then and a slight feeling of resentment at the urvills in general and fergus in particular for having with so little thought stolen part of his memories from him at least malice might have acknowledged the value of his nostalgia ferg this dishwashers like a chinese puzzle fiona stood up from the recalcitrant machine then saw her brother and smiled broadly came towards him hugging hiya ken been getting the guided tour have you yes very impressive kenneth kissed his sisters cheek how old had she been when hed come out here with fergus and the rest about two he guessed not old enough to come all this way on a bike he must have been eight or nine he wondered where hamish had been ill maybe hed always been taking colds fiona urvill nee mchoan wore old flared levis and a loose green blouse knotted over a white tshirt her coppercoloured hair was tied back howre you oh im well kenneth nodded he kept an arm round her waist as they walked over to the dishwasher where fergus crouched consulting the instruction booklet the door of the dishwasher was hinged open like a drawbridge appears to be written in code my dear fergus said scratching the side of his head with his pipe kenneth felt a smile form on his face as he looked down at the man fergus seemed old before his time the pringle jumper the hush puppies even the pipe of course kenneth could remember when he used to smoke a pipe but that had been different looked like fergus was losing his hair already too hows school fiona asked her brother och getting on he said getting on he had been promoted to principal teacher in english the previous autumn his sister always wanted to know how things were going at the high school but he usually felt reluctant to talk about work around her and fergus he wasnt sure why and he suspected he probably wouldnt like acknowledging the reason if he ever did work it out he was even more chary about revealing he was writing down some of the stories hed told the kids over the years hoping to publish them some day he was worried people might think he was trying to outdo rory or worse still think he hoped to use him as a contact an easy way in no i tell a lie fergus admitted heres the english bit well american anyway he sighed then looked round talking about englishspeaking furriners mchoan you still all right for the international next saturday oh aye kenneth nodded they were meant to be going to the scotlandengland rugby game in a weeks time whos driving umm thought wed take the morgan actually oh god fergus must we im not sure i can find my bobblehat oh come on man fergus chuckled thought wed try a new route down to kintyre across to arran lochranza to brodick land ardrossan and then the a to the a of the n strikes and power cuts permitting of course fergus kenneth said putting one hand to his brow it sounds enormously complicated he refused to rise to the bait about strikes and power cuts he guessed that a of the n meant athens of the north are you sure the lochranza ferry runs outside the high season anyway fergus looked troubled stood up oh it must mustnt it well i think it does might be best to check rightyoh will do anyway couldnt we take the rover kenneth wasnt keen on the morgan its stiff ride hurt his back and gave him a headache and fergus drove too fast in the ancient opentop maybe it was the sight of all that british racing green paint and the leather strap across the bonnet the rover though it was seemed to calm fergus a little oh come on man wheres your sense of occasion fergus chided the hotel wont let us into the car park if we show up in the rover oh god kenneth sighed and squeezed his sisters waist the morgan it is then he looked at fiona those green eyes sparkling im getting old sis do you think im getting old positively ancient ken thanks howre the twins oh glowing still taking them to windscale for their hols then are you ha oh ken youre still so comparatively witty have you tried switching it on fergus suggested squatting on the floor in front of the dishwasher again his voice echoed inside the machine as he tried to stick his head inside amongst the racks dont be catty ferg fiona told him she smiled at her brother havent seen young rory out here for a while and he never calls us he okay still in that squat in camden last we heard living off his illgotten subcontinental gains a squat fergus said words muffled thought he made a packet on that travel book thingy he did ken nodded about india wasnt it yep ferg fiona said exasperated you bought the book remember of course i remember fergus said reaching into the dishwasher to fiddle with something just havent read it thats all who needs to read a book to find out about india just go to bloody bradford whats he doing living in a squat ken ground his teeth for a second looking appraisingly at ferguss ample rear he shrugged he just likes living with the people there hes a social animal ferg have to be a bloody animal to live in a squat fergus muttered echoing hoi dont be horrible about my brother fiona said and tapped ferguss backside with her foot fergus glanced quickly round and glared at her his plump slightly reddened face suddenly grim kenneth felt his sister stiffen next to him then fergus gave a little wavering smile and with a quiet grunt turned back to the opened machine and its instruction booklet fiona relaxed again kenneth wondered if things were really all right with the couple he thought he sensed a tension between them sometimes and a couple of years earlier not long after the twins had been born hed thought fergus and fiona had seemed distinctly cold towards each other he had worried for them and he and mary had discussed it wondering what might have caused this unhappiness and if there was anything they could do they had decided there wasnt not unless they were asked still he had tried broaching the subject with fergus once after a dinner party while they nursed whiskies in the conservatory of the old urvill house and watched the lights of the navigation buoys and lighthouses scattered around and through the sound of jura as they winked on and off fergus hadnt wanted to talk mary had had no more success with fiona and anyway it had all seemed to come gradually right again maybe im just jealous he thought to himself as fiona pulled away from him and went to the big new aga sitting squat cream and gleaming against one wall of whitewashed stone she put a hand over part of the cookers surface gauging the heat the silence in the kitchen went on kenneth had never given freud much credence mainly because he had looked as honestly into himself as he could found much that was not to his taste found a little that was even just plain bad but nothing much that fitted with what freuds teachings said he ought to find still he wondered if he did resent fergus at least partly because he had taken his sister away made her his well you never knew he supposed maybe everybodys theories were right maybe the whole world and every person and all their relationships within it were utterly bound up with one another in an intricate entangled web of cause and effect and underlying motive and hidden principle maybe all the philosophers and all the psychologists and all the theoreticians were right but he wasnt entirely sure that any of it made much difference mary and the kids with you fiona said turning from the aga to look at him taking in the view from the battlements kenneth told her good she nodded she glanced at her husband were getting an observatory did ferg tell you no he looked surprised at the other man who didnt turn round no i didnt know you mean a a telescope an astronomical observatory bloody astronomically expensive fergus said voice echoing in the dishwasher yes fiona said so ferg can spend his nights stargazing mrs urvill looked at her husband still squatting in front of the opened machine with an expression kenneth thought might have been scorn whats that my dear fergus asked looking over at his wife an open innocent expression on his face nothing his wife said brightly voice oddly high hmm fergus adjusted something inside the dishwasher scratched above his ear with his pipe again jolly good kenneth looked away then to the windows where the rain spattered and ran conceived in a howling gale verity was born howling in one too she came into the world a month before she was due one windy evening in august by the shores of loch awe a birthplace whose title prentice at least had always thought could hardly have been more apt her mother and father had been staying at fergus and fiona urvills house in gallanach for the previous two weeks on holiday from their edinburgh home for the last night of their holiday the young couple decided to visit a hotel at kilchrenan an hours drive away to the north east up the side of the loch they borrowed ferguss rover to make the journey the bulging charlotte had that week developed a craving for salmon and duly dined on salmon steaks preceded by strips of smoked salmon and followed by smoked salmon mousse which she chose in preference to a sweet she complained of indigestion well if in charlottes case rather monotonously fed they began the return journey the evening was dull and although there was no rain a strong warm wind was blowing waving the tops of the trees and stroking lines of white breakers up the length of the narrow loch the gale increased to storm force as they drove south west into it down the singletrack road on the western shore the narrow road was littered with fallen branches it was probably one of those that produced the puncture and so while her husband struggled with overenthusiasticallytightened wheelnuts charlotte went into labour barely half an hour later a stunning blue flash the colour of the moon and brighter than the sun burst over the scene from the hill above the noise was thunderous charlotte screamed above on the hillside stood the lattice forms of two electricity pylons straddling the heather like grey gigantic skeletons wreathed in darkness the black wind howled and there was another blinding flash and a titanic concussion a line of violet incandescence split the night midway between the two huge pylons as energy shortcircuited through the air between the windwhipped powerlines charlotte screamed again and the child was born the tail end of hurricane verity passed over the british isles that night it had been born in the doldrums cut its teeth flooding bits of the bahamas flirted with the coast of north carolina and then swept off across the north atlantic gradually losing energy a brief encounter with the angle between a cold front and a warm front just off ireland refreshed it unexpectedly and it trashed numerous pleasure boats rattled a few acres of windows played frisbee with a multitude of slates and broke many a bough as it passed over scotland the stretch of the national electricity grid down the western shore of loch awe towards gallanach was one of the storms more spectacular victims and charlotte always claimed that it was right on the stroke of the final massive arc between the thrashing cables which tripped circuit breakers in the grid to the north and plunged all of gallanach into darkness that her child wrinkled bloodflecked and salmon pink finally slid out into her fathers hands they named her verity after the hurricane when she was eighteen fergus urvill gave his niece verity a very special present made from one of the exhibits in the museum attached to his glass factory for the child born to the blaze and crack of human lightning her entry into this world marked by the same brilliant arcs of shortcircuited energy that plunged gallanach into powerless gloom he had a necklace fashioned which was made from fulgurite fulgurite is a natural glass like another of the museums minor treasures obsidian but while obsidian is born purely of the earth formed in the baking heat and furious pressure of volcanic eruptions fulgurite is of the earth and of the air too it is made when lightning strikes unconsolidated sand and fuses it vitrifies it in long zigzag tubes gods glass hamish mchoan called it the gallanach glass works museum contained a collection of tubular fulgurites plucked from the sands of syria by walter urvill ferguss grandfather on a visit there in and transported back to scotland with great care and not a little luck so that they arrived intact one of the crinkled gnarled little tubes was over a metre long another just a fraction shorter fergus had the smaller of the two sent to a jeweller in edinburgh to be broken the pieces graded and ground and polished and threaded together like dark little pearls to create a unique necklace for his niece he presented the result to the lightningchild during ner birthday party at her parents house in merchiston in edinburgh in august it was perhaps unfittingly a perfectly fine warm clear and calm night on that anniversary fergus always a rather dour prematurely elderly figure characterised by those collarcontacting jowls improved immensely in the eyes of both kenneth and prentice mchoan with that single elegant and rather unexpectedly poetic act verity had the grace to accept the necklace with a particular gratitude that acknowledged the thought behind the gift and the taste to make it a regular even habitual part of her wardrobe the upholstery of ferguss rover was cleansed of the debris and stains associated with veritys birth and the car continued to serve the urvill family for another five years or so until when it was traded in for what prentice would thereafter maintain was a scandalously small sum considering that the thing ought to have been preserved as some sort of internationallyrecognised shrine to beauty for an aston martin db it was once prentices dream shortly after hed passed his driving test to find that old rover lying in a field somewhere perhaps and to buy it to own the car his beloved had been born in to drive it and to cherish it he realised of course that it had almost certainly been scrapped long before but that had not prevented him harbouring the perhaps irrational notion that somehow a little of its recycled metal must have found its way into at least one of the three old bangers hed owned the defiantly thunderous and lightningfast aston martin db was the car that fergus and fiona urvill were travelling in on the night they were involved in a crash at achnaba just south of lochgair in chapter right now this isnt as bad as it sounds but i was in bed with my aunty janice well actually in one sense its exactly as bad as it sounds because when i say i was in bed with her i dont mean i was in bed with her because wed gone hillwalking together and been caught out in a snow storm and eventually found shelter in some exceptionally wellappointed bothy that just so happened to have only one bed and we had to get into it together to keep warm nothing like that we were fucking but phew she wasnt a real aunt not a blood relation not even an aunt by marriage janice rae had been uncle rorys girlfriend and i just called her aunty however she had been my fathers brothers lover and perhaps more embarrassingly it had been her daughter marion who had initiated me into the whole sticky smelly noisy potentially fatal potentially natal sordid and sublime act in the first place on the dry cracked green leather surface of the garaged lagonda rapide saloons back seat one hot and musty summers afternoon eight years earlier we brought the house down blame lewis the voice has gone quiet deep almost gravelly now a light harsh and white shines from one side so that his lean cleanshaven face looks hard and angular even cruel i have this door in my house he breathes then pauses its a very special door he looks to one side the way he does it you get the urge to look that way too but you dont do you know what i keep on the other side of that door he raises one eyebrow but there is silence in the darkness you wait behind the door i keep he leans forward now towards us somehow confiding and threatening together the rest of the universe a wintery smile and if you were prone to that sort of thing your skin might crawl there is a little nervous laughter he waits patiently for it to subside i have a special name for that door he says eyes narrowing do you know what i call it this is the dangerous bit where it could all end in disaster but he holds the pause and the silence is eloquent i call it he pauses again looks into the darkness to one side then towards the light again my front door there is more laughter like relief he smiles for the first time a thin unimpressed expression perhaps you have one like it in your house he steps back the lights go up and he makes a sort of half nod half bow my name is lewis mchoan good night he walks off to loud applause cheers even i look from the television to my flatmates aye hes no bad gav says pulling open another can of cider hes okay agrees norris and drinks from his that last bit was a bit weird but he really your brother aye i glare at the screen as the mc appears signing off lewis had been the last act yes i say taking my empty export can between both hands and crushing it yes he is the credits roll i throw the squashed can at the litter bin but it misses hits the wall rolls across the floor and dribbles flat beer onto the threadbare carpet i stood in the bookshop reading the story about the magic dressing gown tears in my eyes a hand tapped me on the shoulder i put the book down quickly on the pile and hauled my hanky from my pocket bringing it up to my face as i turned i blew my nose come on slowcoach mum said smiling down at me her gaze flicked to the bookpile reading your dads stories at last eh whats brought this on not waiting for an answer she put one arm round my shoulders and guided me out onto the departures concourse come on lets go and wish your uncle rory bon voyage shall we all right i said sniffing mum frowned down prentice have you been crying no i said vehemently shaking my head and stuffing the hanky back into my trousers mum just smiled i felt the tears try to come again prickling behind my eyes prentice uncle rory said picking me up god youre getting big ill soon not be able to lift you good i thought this is embarrassing i hugged him as much to get my face out of sight as to express any regret at his leaving aye i heard my mum saying i think we had a wee tear or two there we didnt did we uncle rory laughed bringing me back round in front of him holding me there his big face entirely framed by curly auburn hair looked happy and kindly i wanted to hit him and my mum or maybe burst into tears and hug them either would do ah dinnae greet laddy he laughed lapsing into the workingclass scots i had grown ashamed of because my beautiful cousins diana and helen didnt speak like that and those coarse watt children did stop it i beamed at him i was trying to develop a technique for aiming my thoughts at people to get them to do things for me there were promising developments but it was early days still and i was suffering a lot of teething problems that bastard george lucas hadnt had the decency to reply to my letter about the force yet either i have not been crying honest i havent uncle rory i said sniffing of course you havent uncle rory grinned winking at my mum thats right i said now put me down uncle rory put me down with a grunt thats better he said roughing up my hair ah a wee smile of course im smiling you big fool you are prey for my thoughts will you be away awful long uncle rory i asked yes i dare say i will prentice uncle rory said the pa system shouted that the heathrow flight was boarding the voice mentioned something about a gate but i doubted it would be anything as interesting as a stargate uncle rory picked up his shoulder bag and the three of us started to walk towards a big crowd of people a loud roar outside the glass expanse of one wall sounded excitingly like a crash but it was only a plane landing if youre in hollywood and bump into george lucas uncle rory laughed mightily and exchanged one of those infuriatingly knowing adult looks with my mum i dont think thats very likely prentice but if i do will you ask him if he got my letter i said we reached the place where everybody was standing around and hugging and we stopped hell know what its about i certainly will uncle rory laughed squatting down he made a worse mess of my hair and gripped both shoulders of my blazer now you be a good boy and ill see you all in a few months he stood up him and mum had a brief cuddle and she kissed him on the cheek i turned my face away i was glad my father wasnt here to see this how could they do that sort of thing in public i had a look round to see if my dad was watching from behind a potted palm or through holes cut in a newspaper but he didnt seem to be bye rory safe journey bye mary tell ken ill call when i can will do take care now uncle rory grinned yeah he squeezed one of her shoulders and winked at her again bye love see you bye we watched him show his ticket to the man at the gate then with one last wave he was gone i turned to mum mum can i have some more money for the star wars machine i pointed at the video games i got through three stages last time and i almost got to the fourth i think i know how to deal with the big towers now and im getting really good at i think youve had quite enough of that machine prentice mum said as we walked away through the people we were heading for the stairs i tried to pull her towards the row of video games aw mum please come on ill let you watch if you like you will let me play the machine you will let me play the machine she had the nerve to laugh thats very kind of you prentice but ill pass on that we have to get back home can i go home on the train mum please can i you will let your son take the train home you will let your son prentice take the train home something wrong with my driving you wee rascal no mum but can i please no prentice well take the car aww but mum will i buy you a book mum stopped near the bookshop would you like that theres a judge dredd annual out i said helpfully she tssked oh i suppose if itll keep you quiet while she paid for it i went to the pile of dads books and when nobody was looking i tore a couple of pages in one book then put a load of somebody elses books over the top of dads so that nobody could see them how dare he take the stories hed told me and lewis and james and the others and tell them to other people to strangers they were ours they were mine come on terror mum said a hand between my shoulder blades propelled me from the shop but at least it wasnt the vulcan death grip you will change your mind about letting your son take the train mrs mary mchoan you will change your mind about letting your son prentice take the train home and about playing the star wars machine i mean nobody tells you sex is going to be so noisy do they i mean they can be quite specific about the actual act itself there is no gory detail no technical nuance that is not gone into by teachers or parents or books about sex or the joy of lurve or television programmes or just the boys or girls in the year above you at school telling you behind the bike sheds but nobody tells you about the noise they dont the first time i ever got laid it was the summer it was hot we were doing it naked in the old missionary position and there i was trying to pretend id been doing this for years and thinking am i doing this right was that enough foreplay did i devote sufficient time to going down on her or did it look like i was doing it because i read you ought to in cosmopolitan and i did want to spend more time down there but my neck was getting sore and im thinking should i start chewing the other earlobe now and should i sort of pull back so i can get my mouth to her nipples because id like to suck them i would but my necks still sore and just as im thinking about all this and still trying to think about putting this mfi kitchen unit together to stop myself from coming too soon but it isnt working any more more because i keep thinking of screws and predrilled holes and male and female parts and im stroking her and its great and shes panting and im panting and then just then from in between our two naked heaving bodies there is a noise like a rhinoceros farting there is the noise of a fart the like of which you have never heard in your life before it echoes off nearby tall buildings it leaves your ears ringing little old halfdeaf ladies three streets away run to the broom cupboard and start hammering on the ceiling and threatening their upstairs neighbours with the noise abatement society i mean a loud fart okay and she is laughing and you dont know what to do you try to keep going but it happens again and shes in hysterics and it is all deeply deeply deeply embarrassing and you keep going but theres this constant farting noise caused by all the sweat and it just isnt the same any more and youre thinking why didnt they tell me about this why wasnt i told i mean do other people put a towel in between them or what and you come eventually and after a cuddle and youve whispered a few sweet somethings you withdraw holding the old johnny on because thats what it says on the packet after all and you go to the loo to dispose of the horrible dangly greasy thing and you have a very full bladder by now and you think youll have a pee ha ha ha ha ha wrong you think youll have a pee but you cant i shook my head remembering the times lewis had ranted away like this in the past in pubs amongst friends at parties id enjoyed it usually back then id felt almost privileged to witness these chaotic fulminating tirades and even been proud that lewis was my brother but then id come to my senses and decided that my elder sibling was in fact a vainglorious egomaniac with a runaway sarcasmgland problem now he was taking what had been relatively amusing examples of a private wit and exposing them to everybody to make money and amass praise my family are always doing this sort of thing to me i looked at gav gav was standing at my side clutching his pint glass up near his shoulder and howling with laughter he was sweating he had tears in his eyes and his nose was running he was having a great time gavin one of my two flatmates is a chap of the world he has been there he has done all this he has had everything that lewis was describing happen to him too and he didnt mind who knew it this was the comedy of recognition it was mature it was happening it was ideologically correct in terms of sexual politics but it was also extremely rude and gav just thought it was all totally hilarious he was spilling what was left of his pint down his coat but i suspected he wouldnt have cared even if he had noticed i shook my head again and looked back at the low stage where lewis was still stalking back and forth like a caged hyena grinning and sweating and gleaming under the lights and shouting into the microphone and flinging one arm about and smiling wickedly and striding side to side side to side talking to individuals at the front to the people at the side and in the middle of the crowded audience talking to us standing here at the back talking to everybody lewis was dressed in black jeans and a white tuxedo over a white tshirt which had three enormous black letters on it ftt in much smaller letters underneath it read have carnal knowledge of the conservative and unionist party and their supporters you could buy these tshirts at the door gav had one wrapped in polythene and stuffed in one pocket of his coat we were upstairs in randans the latest incarnation of a bar that had previously traded under the name byres market and before that had been called paddy joness premises forever apostrophised that original appellation was before my time and i confess to a degree of yearning for an age when bars had in the main sensible names and did not pride themselves on serving their own creakinglytitled cocktails a choyce selection of our eftimable homemade pies hotpottes and other fyne dishes and twenty different designer lagers all of which taste identical cost the earth and are advertised on the tellingly desperate unique selling points of having a neat logo a top that is difficult to open or a bottle neck whose appearance is apparently mysteriously enhanced by having a slice of citrus fruit rammed down it but if this is the price we have to pay for allday opening and letting women into public bars then i admit it may well be churlish to carp i used to think dad was kidding about bars closing in the afternoon and at ten in the evening ten for christs sake i dont go out until midnight sometimes and about some not having womens toilets at all but apparently its all true and scarcely a decade and a half gone i looked at my watch wondering how long lewis was going to keep this up telling conventionallystructured jokes uses up material appallingly quickly and if that had been what lewis was up to i might not have had the prospect of enduring too much more challenging nonsexist politically aware nearthebone well near the bonehead at any rate alternative humour but this observational stuff telling people things they already know and getting them to pay you for the privilege sort of the light entertainment equivalent of psychoanalysis can go on virtually indefinitely indeed i felt like it already had lewis was moderately big all of a sudden after a series of appearances on that latenight tv show the programmes had been recorded at a comedy festival in melbourne australia which lewis had been invited to hence his inability to make old margots funeral tonight was the premiere date on his first solo uk tour and it looked depressingly likely that it would be totally sold out thanks to the advertising power of television if he hadnt given me the complimentary tickets i doubted that gavin and myself would have stood any chance of getting in but then if he hadnt given me the complimentary tickets a troop of wild clydesdales on speed wouldnt have dragged me here i looked at my watch again half an hour gone so far he had said exactly one thing i found even slightly amusing and that was right at the start at one stage i thought i was a complete asshole there followed the inevitable pause for effect but i passed through that laugh i almost about my family ladies and gents because i come from this very strange family you know very strange family indeed lewis said gav turned big red face beaming he nudged me i didnt turn to look at him i was staring glaring at the stage my mouth felt dry he wouldnt dare would he theres my uncle alfred i started to relax we do not have an uncle alfred still maybe he was going to use some true or embroidered slice of family history and just disguise it with a false name uncle alfred was a very unlucky man he was so unlucky we actually called him unlucky uncle alfred we did unlucky uncle alfred was so unlucky hes the only man in history ever to have been killed by an avalanche on a dry skislope i relaxed a bit more he hadnt dared this was just a joke no really he was skiing down when it sort of started to come undone at the top and roll down crushed to death by three hundred tones of nylon tufting havent been able to look at a swiss roll the same way since another nudge from a highly amused gavin that true prentice aye i gave what i hoped was a suitably withering look then turned back to the stage i drank my heavy and shook my head prentice gav insisted from my side missing the first part of lewiss next mirthinfused effusion zat true aye obviously my withering look needed more work in front of the mirror i turned to gavin every word i told him except his real name was uncle ethelred aw aye gav nodded wisely took a sip from his beer without significantly moving the glass from near his right shoulder and frowned as he tried to catch up with what lewis was saying only to succeed in catching the predictably belowthebelt punchline everybody else laughed so so did gav no less enthusiastically than anybody else and interestingly no less enthusiastically than he had at any other part of lewiss act when hed heard every word remarkable i watched gav for a while from the corner of my eye wondering not for the first and barring serious accidents and justifiable homicide almost certainly not for the last time what i was doing sharing a flat with somebody whose cogitative powers i had last had cause to ponder only a few hours earlier when i had discovered while watching the news with gav that he had believed up until then that the intifada was an italian sports car in a way i envied gav just because he found life such a hoot he also seemed to think that it was like himself perhaps comparatively uncomplicated as is the way with such things these subjectively positive qualities tend to have precisely the opposite effect on the temperaments of those in close proximity to the person concerned this was a man after all who had not yet mastered something as fundamental and as linear in its properties for the most part as running a bath at the correct temperature how many times had i gone into the bathroom in our flat to find that the bath was full almost to the brim of hot steaming water this was an indication that gav was planning to bathe in an hour or so gavin was of the opinion that the way to draw a bath was to fill it entirely from the tap that had the little h on it thereby reducing the flats supplies of immediately available hot water to zero then leaving the resulting body of liquid to cool to something approaching a state in which a human body could enter it without turning instantly the colour of a justboiled lobster this normally took about thirty minutes in the depths of winter and sometimes well over an hour in high summer during which time gav was inclined to amuse himself watching television soap operas and the less intellectually taxing game shows preferably or eating say banana and marmite sandwiches just one example from gavins extensive repertoire of unique snackettes that entirely substituted culinary originality for anything as boring as tasting pleasant my attempts to explain the subtle dialectics of utilising both hot and cold taps consecutively or concurrently to produce a bath that could be used immediately without recourse to the western generals burns unit with the resulting benefits of freeing the bath for the use of others earlier and in the process using a great deal less electric power which both we and the planet could ill afford fell not so much on deaf ears as on openplan ones in automotive terms if lewis was a motormouth then gavin was a crossflow head i drained my glass studied the flattening dregs of foam at the bottom nuther beer big yin no thanks gav ill buy my own gavin i had long ago concluded believed that life revolved around rugby and beer and that especially under the influence of too much of the latter sometimes it just revolved perhaps it might be a mistake to match him pint for pint ah go on heavy aye he grabbed my empty glass and with that he was gone shouldering his way through the pack of bodies for the distant dream that was the bar he was still grinning inanely probably a good point for him to mount an expedition to the bar lewis was in the middle of a long righton fauxnaïve spiel about postisms which gav probably found a little bewildering i mean what is postfeminism eh answer me that what do they mean or have i missed something i mean was there a general election last week and nobody told me about it and half the mps are now women are fifty per cent of the directors of all major industries female is it no longer the case that the only way to hold on to your genitals if youre brought up in sudan is to be born a boy dont saudi arabian driving licences still have a section that says title mr mr or sheik please delete i really had been going to buy my own drink anybody who has ever been hardup will tell you its the easiest way to regulate ones finances while still remaining nominally sociable but gav profligate though he may have been with the heat plumes from his baths and kettles gavins determination to wreck the ecosphere through the generation of copious volumes of unnecessary hot water extended to never boiling a kettle that was less than brimfull even if only a single cup was required was equally generous when it came to buying drink at such moments it was almost possible to forget he was also the inventor of custard and thousandisland dressing pudding my brother seemed to be thinking along the same epicurean lines however to my horror emulsified with a small amount of schadenfreudian delight he appeared to be proposing to sing i closed my eyes and looked down ashamed not just for lewis but for my whole family so this was the cutting edge of british alternative humour finishing with a song good grief shall draw a veil over this performance but let history record that this pretended paean of praise for mrs thatcher comparing her to various foods with only a hint of sarcasm most of the way through as english as blueberry pie ended with the couplet maggie youre a spanish omelette like an egg you just cant be beaten maggie youre all the food that i eat twentyfour hours after its eaten the puzzled patrons of randans who had been worriedly thinking that perhaps lewis wasnt quite so righton after all and had had his head turned by a sniff of fame and a glimpse of the flexible stuff suddenly realised their man was still okay phew and it had all been an elaborate joke ha as well as a knowing dig at more conventional comedians nudge and so duly erupted with applause hurrah i breathed a sigh of relief that at last it was all over barring encores of course clapped lightly looking at my watch as i did so a glance revealed that the besieged bar was under further pressure now that the attacking forces had been reinforced following the end of lewiss act i suspected that for all my scorn i might yet be grateful for gavs rugbying skills that evening not to mention his neanderthal build perhaps that was why he found rugby so attractive he was a throwback i looked at my watch again wondering if lewis would be unduly insulted and gav overly disappointed if we didnt go backstage to see the great performer afterwards things had gone so appallingly well that lewis would undoubtedly be on a high and hence unbearable perhaps i could plead a headache if that wasnt too unbutch for gav to accept ach have another few beers and a whisky or two and itll soon go away ya big poof would be the sort of reply my flatmate would favour as i knew to my cost excuse me are you prentice prentice mchoan id noticed the woman sidling through the crowd in my direction a few seconds earlier but paid no real attention assuming i just happened to be on her route yes i said frowning i thought i recognised her she was short maybe early forties curly brown hair and a round attractive face that looked runin without being worn out i coveted her leather jacket immediately but it wouldnt have fitted me a glint in her eyes could have been animal lust but was more likely to be contact lenses i tried to remember where id seen her before janice rae she said offering her hand remember aunty janice i said shaking her hand i suspected i was blushing of course you used to go out with uncle rory im sorry i knew i recognised you of course aunt janice she smiled yeah aunt janice how are you what are you doing fine i told her at uni last year history and yourself oh keeping all right she said how are your parents are they well fine just great i nodded i looked round to see if gav was on his way back he wasnt theyre fine umm grandma margot died last month but apart from that oh no she said margot oh im sorry yes i said yes well we all were i feel terrible if only id kept in touch do you think it would be all right if i if i wrote to your mum and dad oh sure yeah fine theyd be delighted even if id just made the funeral she said downcast yes big turnout went not with a whimper i nodded at the empty stage lewis couldnt make it but everybody else was there her eyes widened it was like a light went on beneath her skin then started to go out even as she said rory was he oh i said shaking my hand quickly in front of her as though rubbing something embarrassing out on an invisible blackboard no not uncle rory oh she said looking down at her glass no fraid we havent heard anything for well years i hesitated dont suppose he ever got in touch with you did he she was still looking at her glass she shook her head no theres been nothing no word i nodded my head looked around for gav again janice rae was still inspecting her glass broke or not id have offered to buy her another drink but her glass was full i was aware that i was sucking in my lips trapping them between my teeth this is something i do when im feeling awkward i wished she would say something more or just go away i always felt she said looking up at last that your dad knew more than he was letting on i looked into her bright eyes did you yes i wondered if rory was still in touch with him somehow well i dont know i said i shrugged he does still talk about him as though i had been going to say as though he were still alive but that might have hurt her as though he knows where uncle rory is she looked thoughtful that was the way i felt when i was down there after rory left there was one time when she shook her head again i thought he was going to tell me how he knew let me in on his secret but well at any rate he never did she smiled at me and how is lochgair your parents still in that big house still there i confirmed catching sight of gav making his way through the scrum of bodies concentrating on the two full beer glasses in front of him janice rae looked warm and happy for a moment and her eyes narrowed a little her gaze shifting away to one side it was a good place she said softly i have a lot of happy memories of that house i guess we all do uncle rory had met janice rae at some literary do in glasgow she was ten years older than him a librarian divorced and had a tenyearold daughter called marion she lived with her mother who looked after marion while aunt janice was at work i could remember the two of them coming to the house for the first time uncle rory had brought various women to the house before id ended up calling them all aunty and i was calling janice that by the end of the first weekend they spent at lochgair despite the fact that marion was a girl and a couple of years older than me i got on well enough with her lewis also two years older than me was going through an awkward stage during which he wasnt sure whether to treat girls with scorn and contempt or sweeties james born the year after me liked what and who i liked so he liked marion she became one of the rabble the generic and roughly affectionate term my father applied to the various kids he would tell stories to on a family sunday a family sunday was one when either the mchoans or the urvills played host to the other family plus that of bob and louise watt aunt louise had been born a mchoan her father was the brother of matthew my paternal grandfather and husband of grandma margot she of the heart that broke only after she was safely dead bob watt was brother of lachlan whose taunting of uncle fergus concerning the matter of hiding inside a medieval lavatory led to the unfortunate incident with the display case and resulted in lachlan becoming the man with four eyes but who did not wear glasses bob watt never turned up for family sundays though aunt louise did often wearing thick makeup and sometimes dark glasses sometimes the bruises showed through all the same now and again thered be something she didnt even try to hide and i can recall at least two occasions when she turned up with her arm in a sling i didnt think very much about this at the time just assuming that my aunt louise was somehow more fragile than the average person or perhaps excessively clumsy it was lewis who eventually told me that bob watt beat up his wife i didnt believe him at first but lewis was adamant i puzzled over this for a while but at length just accepted it as one of those inexplicable things that other people did like going to the opera or watching gardening programmes which seemed crazy to oneself but made perfect sense to the individuals concerned maybe i thought it was a watt family tradition just as family sundays and at least one person in each generation of our family managing the gallanach glass works seemed to be two of our traditions mum and aunt janice became friends she and dad were much closer in age to janice than rory and they were parents too so perhaps it was no surprise they got on whatever after uncle rory disappeared aunt janice and marion still came down to the house every now and again it was the year after rory vanished that marion then about fifteen got me into the garage where the car was wed been out on our bikes riding round some of the forestry tracks one hot and dusty september day everybody else was in gallanach shopping or in lewiss case playing football marion rae had the same curly brown hair her mother did she had a round healthylooking face which even i could see was quite pretty and was about the same height as i was though a little heavier i was of that age and bodytype concerning which adults help to ease the difficult journey through the age of puberty by making remarks about disappearing if you turned sideways and running around in the shower to get wet wed seen some old burntout wreck of a car abandoned in a ditch up in the hills id said something about the sports car under the covers in the courtyard garage back at the house marion wanted to see it i still maintain i was seduced but i suppose i was inquisitive as well girls were still less interesting to me than models of the millennium falcon and my scalextric set but i had conducted a couple of masturbatory experiments which had set me thinking and when marion exploring the warm dim tarpaulingreen gloom of the old car with me said phew she was hot wasnt i and started unbuttoning her blouse i didnt say no or run away or suggest we get out of the stuffy garage instead i blew on her well she was sweaty and i could see moisture on the top of her chest above the little white bra she was wearing trickling between the white swells of her breasts she seemed to appreciate the gesture and lay back and closed her eyes i remember her asking if i wasnt hot and feeling my leg and her hand running up to my thigh then there was some silly line like oh whats this as she felt inside my shorts expressing what even then i thought was probably fake surprise at what she discovered there my own words were no less inane but something either the heat of the moment or just retrospective embarrassment seems to have wiped them and most of the subsequent relevant details from my memory still i recall being pleased that everything seemed to fit and work as well and if our now i think about it ridiculously fast mutual thrusts hadnt unsettled the car on its blocks that sense of having successfully risen to the occasion and worked out what to do with relatively little guidance would have been my abiding impression of the proceedings instead just as i was both coming and going going wow and marion was making some extremely interesting noises the car collapsed under us it shuddered and fell onto the concrete floor of the garage with an apocalyptic crash wed shaken it off its blocks some bizarre sense of symmetry had made me insist that we should not lie across the back seat but that i should instead squat on the transmission tunnel with marion half on the rear seat and half on me as a result the rapide fell backwards off its wooden supports and its boot rammed into a load of drums and cans stored behind it crushing them in turn against an old welsh dresser that had been consigned to the garage years earlier this loaded up with tins and tools and spare parts and junk until it was top heavy proceeded to overbalance it leant creaking towards the car and although it did not actually fall over distributed most of its load of paint spanners plugs bolts spare bulbs bits of trim hammers wrenches and assorted boxes and tins all over the tarpaulincovered boot rear window and roof of the lagonda the noise was appalling and seemed to go on forever i was dead still my orgasm more quality than quantity completed and my mouth hanging open as the cacophony reverberated through the garage the car and my body dust filled the cars interior marion sneezed mightily and almost squeezed me out of her something heavy hit the rear window and it went white all over crazed into a microjigsaw of tiny glass fragments eventually the noise stopped and i was about to suggest that we ran away very soon and to some considerable distance before anybody discovered what had happened when marion grabbed both my buttocks with a grip like steel stuck her panting sweatstreaked face against mine and snarled those words with which i in common with most men i suspect would eventually become relatively familiar in similar if rather less dramatic situations dont stop it seemed only right to comply but my mind wasnt really on what i was doing another precedent perhaps marion seemed to have some sort of fit it coincided with or perhaps was the cause of the rear window falling in it showered us both with little jagged lumps of glass green under the tarpaulinlight like dull emeralds we both stayed like that for a bit breathing heavily and brushing crystalline fragments out of each others hair and laughing nervously then started the delicate business of disengaging and trying to dress in the back of a tarpaulincovered car full of gravelly glass we completed dressing outside the car in the garage shaking bits of glass out of our clothes as we did so i had the presence of mind to put these fragments back into the car and spread the glass more evenly over the seat removing the shardshadow of marion from the cracked green leather there was i noticed with a little pride and considerable horror a small stain there probably more marion than me to be honest but there was nothing i could do about that beyond wiping it with my hanky we closed the garage grabbed our bikes and headed for the hills it was a week before dad discovered the disaster scene in the garage he never did work it out lewis threatened to tell him but that was only because id been stupid enough to blab to my brother and then been incensed to discover hed screwed marion too twice on the two previous weekends shed been down i immediately threatened to tell the police because lewis was older than she was and that made it statuetory rape id heard of this on tv he said if i did that hed tell dad about the car and so there we were me barely a teenager and already arguing over a woman with my brother it was good to meet you again janice lewis said shaking aunt janices hand then taking her elbow in the other hand kissing her on the cheek you should get in touch with mary and ken again im sure theyd love to hear from you i will she said smiling then fastened the collar of her gloveleather jacket lewis turned to me bro sure we cant tempt you positive i said got a lot of work to do enjoy yourselves aw come on ya big poof gav said breathing beer he put one arm round my shoulders and hugged from the amount of pressure involved i gathered he was trying to fold me in half sno even wan yet yes gavin the night is yet senile but i have to go you have fun all right aye okay taxi shouted lewis we were standing on byres road outside randans which would be closing soon lewis some guy hed been friendly with at uni a girl who may or may not have been lewiss girlfriend and gav had all decided to head for some bar in the centre of town i had demurred as had janice prentice see you at the weekend lewis hesitated as he pulled the taxi door open for the maybegirlfriend then came up to me hugged me good to see you little brother yeah you take care i said patting his back all the best thanks they left in the taxi janice and i walked up byres road to where shed left her car it started to rain maybe i will take that lift i told her good she said she pulled a small umbrella from her shoulder bag opened it as the rain came on heavier she handed it to me here youd better hold this youre taller she took my arm and we had to lean towards each other to keep even our heads dry under the little flimsy umbrella she smelled of obsession and smoke she gav and i had gone to meet lewis holding court in the small dressing room later we had all gone to the downstairs bar then lewis had announced he wanted to keep on drinking after they called time janice had had a couple of fizzy waters and seemed totally sober so i reckoned it was safe to accept a lift you dont really like your brother that much do you she asked yes i do i told her the traffic hissed by heading up byres road he just annoys me sometimes i thought you seemed a bit reluctant when he suggested going back home this weekend i shrugged oh thats not lewis thats dad we arent speaking not speaking she sounded surprised maybe amused why not religious differences i said it had become my stock reply oh dear we turned onto ruthven street away from the bright shop fronts and traffic still a bit further to go she said where are you parked athole gardens really not a good place to live if you had a lisp she laughed squeezed my arm hello i thought i switched the umbrella from one hand to the other and put my arm lightly round her waist i hope im not taking you out of your way i mean i could walk it isnt far no problem prentice she said and put her arm round my waist hmm i thought she gave a small laugh you were always thoughtful but somehow the way she said it i thought no shes just being friendly we got into the fiesta she dumped the brolly in the back she put both hands on the wheel then turned to me listen ive got some some papers rory left with me i did mean to send them to your father but to be honest i lost track of them and then didnt find them again until mum died and i was clearing stuff out i dont suppose its anything you know that the family needs is it i scratched my head dad has all rorys papers i think its just old poems and notes that sort of thing she started the car we put our belts on she took a pair of glasses from her shoulder bag all a bit confusing really hmm i said i suppose dad might want a look at them wouldnt mind looking at them myself come to think of it do you want to pick them up now she looked at me her round face softlooking in the orange blush of the sodium vapour her hair was like a curly halo it isnt far yeah okay i guess so i watched her face she smiled as we pulled away you sound just like rory sometimes janice rae was the last person known to have seen uncle rory one evening in glasgow rory had been staying with friends in london for the previous fortnight he had talked to his agent and seen some television people about doing some travel series but whatever deal hed been trying to set up with the bbc it had fallen through at the time rory was still just living off traps which was attracting a trickle of money even then when hed spent everything hed got for later travel books and occasional articles he was sharing a flat with an old pal called andy nichol who worked in local government according to andy rory had moped around their flat for a couple of days shut in his room mostly supposedly writing then when andy had come back from work one day rory had asked if he could borrow andys motorbike for the night andy had given him the keys and rory had set off hed stopped briefly at janice raes mums place and said something about having an idea some way of saving the project hed been working on adding some new ingredient hed given janice the folder that she now wanted to give me eight years later and then rode off into the sunset never to be seen again her flat was on crow road not all that far away down near jordanhill as she showed me into the place down a hall lined with old movie posters i asked her if shed ever heard grandma margot use the saying away the crow road or the craw rod if she was being especially broadaccented that day it meant dying being dead aye hes away the crow road meant hes dead janice looked away from me when i said those words mumbled about the papers and went to get them idiot i told myself i stood in the living room it was full of heavy old furniture that looked as though it belonged somewhere else and some limited edition modern prints on a sideboard there was a photograph of janice raes dead mother and another of her daughter marion and her husband marion was a policewoman in aberdeen i shook my head grinning and feeling very old and very young at once here aunt janice said she handed me a cardboard folder stuffed with loose papers on the spine it said cr in black felttip the folder was burgundy but the spine was faded to grey cr i said crow road janice said quietly looking down at the folder in my hands i wasnt sure what to say while i was still thinking she looked up brighteyed glanced around at the walls of the flat and shrugged yeah i know sentimental of me eh she smiled no i said its its the words sweet and nice suggested themselves but didnt seem right fitting i guess i stuck the folder under my arm cleared my throat well i said she had taken off her jacket she wore a blouse and cords she shrugged would you like some coffee something stronger umm i said taking a deep breath well arent you tired no she said folding her arms i usually read way past this time of night stay have some whisky she took my jacket poured me a whisky i sat down on a huge surprisingly firm old couch it looked like brown leather but any smell it had had was gone i held the whisky glass up wont you i said this is like playing chess i thought well not if i have to drive you home prentice oh i could walk i smiled bravely cant be more than three or four miles less than an hour youd lend me a brolly wouldnt you or there might be a night bus please have a whisky sit down make yourself at home she laughed okay okay she went to the table where the bottles were poured herself a whisky somewhere in the distance that sound of the city a siren warbling stay here if you like she said slowly putting the top back on the bottle she turned leaning back against the table drinking from her glass looking down at me thats if you want to i dont want you to think im seducing you or anything shit i said putting my glass down on a rather overdesigned coffee table i put my hands on my hips which is rather an unnatural thing to do when youre sitting down but what the hell i was kinda hoping you were actually she looked at me then gave a single convulsive laugh and right until then i think it might still have gone either way but she stood there her back to the table set her glass down upon its polished surface put her hands behind her back and looked down her head forward and a little to the left her weight was on her left leg her right leg was relaxed knee bent in slightly towards the left i could see she was smiling i knew id seen that stance before and even as i was getting up from the couch to go over to her i realised she was standing just the way garbo does in queen christina during the inn sequence when shes sharing the best room with john gilbert playing the spanish ambassador who doesnt realise until that point the disguised garbo is a woman not a man she starts to take her clothes off eventually and gets down to her shirt then gilbert looks round does a double take and looks back and shes standing just like that and he knows it had i recalled even as i went over to her been one of uncle rorys favourite old films it was one of those wonderful first nights when you never really do more than drowse between bouts of lovemaking and even when you do think no more thats it finito you still have to say goodnight which itself means a kiss and a hug and each touch begets another touch more sweet and the kiss on the cheek or neck moves to the lips the lips open the tongues meet so every touch becomes a caress each caress an embrace and every embrace another coupling she turned to me during that night and said prentice mmhmm do you think rorys away the crow road do you think hes dead i turned on my side stroked her flank smoothing my hand from thigh to shoulder then back i really dont know i admitted she took my hand kissed it i used to think sometimes that he must be dead because otherwise hed have been in touch but i dont know there was just enough light seeping in past the curtains to let me see her head shaking i dont know because people sometimes do things youd never have thought they would ever do her voice broke and her head turned suddenly she pushed her face into the bedclothes i moved over to hold her just to comfort her but she kissed hard and climbed on top of me i had up until that point been performing an agonising reappraisal of the indignant signals of total quivering painful exhaustion flooding in from every major muscle i possessed my bodys equivalent of the chief engineer was screaming down the intercom that the system just wouldnt take any more punishment jim and there was no doubt that i really should have been pulling out and powering down just then but on the other hand what the heck all your your nonsenses and truths your finery and squaladoptions combine and coalesce to one noise including laugh and whimper scream and sigh forever and forever repeating in any tongue we care to choose whatever lessened separated message we want to hear it all boils down to nothing and where we have the means and will to fix our reference within that flux there we are if it has any final signal the universe says simply but with every possible complication existence and it neither pressures us nor draws us out except as we allow let me be part of that outrageous chaos and i am her voice was sleepy the hand that had been quietly ruffling my hair had now gone limp the litany subsided the quiet words not echoing in the dark room uncle rorys words apparently at first just thought a mantra to delay ejaculation a slightly more civilised if narcissistic alternative to brother lewiss thoughts about constructing mfi kitchen units then once she had asked him what he thought of when they made love and smoothed over his protestations of eternal inhead fidelity to discover that purely to prolong her pleasure he sometimes recited a piece of his own poetry to himself he was persuaded to repeat it for her and it became a shared ritual always always liked that she said quietly shifting a little to fit her body to mine always hmm i said and felt her breathing alter goodnight janice i whispered night rore she murmured i wasnt sure what to feel eventually i yawned pulled the duvet over the two of us and smiled into the darkness i went to sleep wondering what on earth had possessed uncle rory to write a miserable incomprehensible line your finery and squaladoptions what in the name of hell was a squaladoption for goodness sake there was something else nagging me my conscience the embarrassing truth was that despite having taken a sort of policy decision years ago the gist of which was no condom no sex janice and i had not been using one shed emplaced a cap but that as the leaflets will tell you dont provide no aids protection so here i was indulging in casual if intensive sex with a woman i hadnt even heard anything about for eight years hell she could have been up to anything but she had claimed the opposite and id believed her it was probably the truth but it was exactly such instances of casually misplaced trust that were undoubtedly going to kill better men and women than me over the next decade or so still it was done i drifted away i swear i was asleep when my eyes flicked on their own and in a burst of dark certainty i thought squalid options thats what he wrote squalid options before going instantly back to sleep again chapter they sat stood or lay within the shattered conestump of the old broch looking out over the more recent but just as empty equally abandoned and even more forlorn square crater of the neverused productionplatform yard above a lark just a speck against the blue sang its shrill voice jetting fluid bursts of song aw tell us mr mchoan please yeah dad what is it please uncle ken pleeease yeah come on mistur mchoan tell us whit is it whats what the sound you can see prentice shouted jumping down from the broken wall of the broch ashley was climbing higher the sound you can see he said thoughtfully he leant back on the sunwarmed stones looking across the grass circle inside the old ruin over the spray of grey stones downhill where the broch had fallen or been torn away over the sharp green tops of the pines to the waters of loch fyne a whitehulled yacht ran gullwinged before the wind heading northeast up the loch towards the railway bridge at minard point perhaps heading for inveraray in the distance a few miles behind he could see another boat its spinnaker a tiny bright bulb of pure yellow like a flower on a gorse bush well he said you cant see it from here aw naw where can you see it from then uncle well where we were when i told you about it we could see it from there in the old house diana said looking puzzled thats right it isnt the wind then helen urvill said and sat down beside him lewis snorted derisively the wind he said dont be so stupid aunt ilsa said it might be breeze block but i wasnt to say anything until aw heck prentice flattened his hand and struck it off his forehead with a loud slap he fell over backwards into the long grass very amusing prentice kenneth sighed hi mr mchoan look at where i am good grief ashley be careful she was at the top of the wrecked broch wall rising into the sky like a grey sine on a sheet of blue paper ashley a point im no scairt mr mchoan i bet you arent but i didnt ask you whether you were scared or not ashley i told you to be careful now get down here ill come down if ye tell us whit the sound ye can see is so ah will mr mchoan get down here you wee monkey he laughed i was about to tell you before you started hollering down now aw dinnae get yer knickers in a twist mr mchoan ashley said shaking her blondehaired head and starting to climb down the curved edge of the wall i wont young lady he said diana and helen looked shocked then giggled lewis and prentice sniggered quietly she said knickers mr mchoan dean watt said ahm tellin mum darren told his sister as she made her way feet and bum first down the slope of stone ach away and bugger yourself darren watt the girl said checking on her next footstep haaaw gasped diana ashley kenneth said exasperated oh mr mchoan did you hear whit she said did ye yur a wee bissum so ye are ashley yes i did and thats very rude you know young lady prentice said wagging his finger at the girl oh shut up prentice said lewis ahm no a bissum uncle ken whats a bu waa she said knickers knickers kni buggerlugs all right all right kenneth said raising his voice over a highpitched babble of childish thats enough do you want to hear the answer or not you horrible rabble but she ahm stop it he roared he jumped to his feet and shook one fist in the air dramatically pirouetting so that the gesture included each of them youre all acting like children if id wanted this sort of treatment id have stayed a teacher but dad we are children prentice said rolling his eyes and shaking his head and falling over in the grass again sighing loudly innocence is no excuse prentice mchoan he roared shaking one finger at the prone child that was the motto of my old school and youd all better remember it lewis was the only one not amused by the performance he played with a bit of grass the others were either laughing outright or sat bunched up heads down between shoulders arms tense by sides making snorting guffawing noises and exchanging nodding wideeyed looks oh dear lord kenneth shouted to the bare blue sky his arms wide head thrown back look down upon this awful stupid bairn of mine and teach him some common sense before the world gets him ha mr mchoan you dinnae believe in the lord ashley roared from halfway up the wall almost level with his head he swivelled to her and thats enough of your old buck ashley watt i dont believe in santa claus but prentice still gets presents at christmas doesnt he ah ashley said pointing at him thats different mr mchoan theres hunners of them he took a step back looked shocked you little barrackroom barrister what sort of extramural comment is that he threw his arms out wide again to his shock ashley jumped right into them yelling jurmonimo the girl slammed into his chest clunked her head off his chin little arms whacking round his neck knees hoofing into his stomach he put his arms out to hold her staggered back almost fell aware that behind him were the twins sitting on the grass he bent his knees flexed his back and did not collide with or fall over the twins he wobbled upright with ashley still clinging to him legs round his waist now she smelled sweaty was probably kindest well he wheezed winded thank you for that contribution ashley the others were relatively quiet ashley was rubbing her forehead vigorously with one hand he frowned lifted the girl away from his chest so he could look at her face apart from being grubby it looked all right what did you shout ashley please mr mchoan the wee rough voice said ah said jurmonimo he started to laugh and had to put her down he went to his knees then sat down and rolled over all the rest joined in except ashley who stood arms folded bottom lip stuck out fiercely this isnae funny she said turning away ahm away tae get fed ha ha ha ha kenneth mchoan said holding his tummy ha ha were your classes this hilarious kenneth opened his eyes uncle rory prentice said and ran for the man the boy jumped up onto him rather the way ashley had leapt down onto his father rory laughed and caught him swung him around let go an arm and grabbed a leg whirling the boy round once wheee prentice yelled rory landed him onehanded kenneth went to rory hugged him god man its good to see you you too ken you just get back kenneth laughed ten minutes ago the two men separated kenneth looked his brother up and down uncle rory uncle rory do some magic do a trick rorys chestnut curls had been cut back to what was almost a crewcut his face was tanned cleanshaven rory pursed his lips took a coin from his pocket bent down to the children made the coin progress across the knuckles of one hand then disappear into his fist he waved over it and when the fist became hand the coin was gone squeals rory looked lean and a little tired his jeans were white with wear and frayed at one knee he wore a cheesecloth shirt and smelled vaguely of patchouli the coin reappeared behind dianas ear she put one hand to her mouth eyes wide the others went yaaayy kenneth grinned shook his head as rory straightened a little stiffly more more do it again later rory said looking serious mysterious and winking so kenneth said hows the world rory shrugged still there back for long another shrug and an easy smile dunno maybe well ken said putting one arm round his brothers shoulders and starting to walk towards the path where the stillfrowning form of ashley watt stood arms crossed tight as her brows ken smiled broadly at her glanced at rory better get all the family in the one place before you start answering questions otherwise youll get fed up telling the same stories all the time kenneth turned round waved to the rest of the children come on rabble your uncle rorys back from exotic places and hes got much better stories than me the children started after them the two men came up to ashley rory ruffled her hair she frowned kenneth lifted her up with a grunt held her danglelegged in front of him sorry if i upset you ashley he told her huh okay mr mchoan she said ahm sorry ah swore okay he set her down she looked down the hillside to the forestry track that led back to lochgair glanced up at him then back at the other children and said loudly ah bet ah can be back at the hoose first though but she turned and ran the rest raced after her whooping and hollering past kenneth and rory kenneth shook his head preprandial stampede traditional he told his brother he made a show of squeezing rorys boney shoulder woa feels like you could do with a bit of feeding up yourself yeah rory said looking down at the heather well my stories might be a bit thin too maybe i should tell them to you first let you retell the kids he gave a small laugh youre the professional fictioneer in the family im just a glorified hack hey is that false modesty or even a note of jealousy there young rore kenneth laughed squeezing his brothers shoulder again come on man i stayed here and had weans and taught weans and you were off getting famous consorting with tigers and wandering through the taj mahal and then wowing us all fucking celebrity toast of the town and plenty of bread literary festivals awards travel writing awards rory sighed nothing wrong with that jeez last time i saw you you were on tv what was that line better lionised than mauled ken laughed as they walked down the hill rory made an exasperated noise shook his head ken dont you remember anything ken looked nonplussed what did i get it wrong no but that was your line you said that years ago one night we were drunk i dont know but you said it not me did i yes ken frowned you sure positive rory snapped good grief im wittier than i thought ken shrugged well youre welcome to it but anyway let your poor old brother have his turn dont begrudge me for being able to distract the odd preadolescent from the tv for the odd halfhour rory shook his head i dont ken he said and sighed again im not jealous he looked at his brother bearded hair still dark face cheerfully lined but still younglooking just those endoframble blues rory shrugged the thin shoulders moving under kenneths arm but its good to be back ken smiled they saw prentice walking back up through the grass and fern towards them panting the others were kicking up a cloud of dust on the forestry track a small and highly noisy storm heading lochgairward what is it prentice kenneth called dad the boy gasped from some distance off what what was the sound he took a deep breath you can see the sound of jura he yelled now keep running or youll get no dinner okay prentice called he jogged off shaking his head the rain fell with that impression of gentle remorselessness west coast rain sometimes appears to possess when it has already been raining for some days and might well go on raining for several more it dissolved the skyline obliterated the view of the distant trees and continually roughened the flat surface of the loch with a thousand tiny impacts each moment every spreading circle intersecting interfering and disappearing in the noise and clutter of their successors it sounded most loud as it pattered on the hoods of their jackets ken are you sure fish are going to bite in this weather course they will prentice have some faith well thats good coming from you kenneth mchoan looked at his son sitting looking suitably miserable in waterproofs in the bows of the little boat just a phrase i could have said trust me i suppose huh prentice said thats no better who was it used to say if someone says trust me dont na kenneth said shaking his head that was rory i never said that you did prentice said then seemed to realise he was sounding petulant and looked away again he plonked the rear end of the fishing rod down in the bottom of the boat watched the thin end waggle up and down for a while he folded his arms leaned forward hunching up god im depressed cheer up kenneth said falsely hearty have some more coffee i dont want coffee well you forced me into it i was saving this for later but kenneth opened the poppers on the berghaus jacket unzipped and dug into the deep internal pocket pulled out a hipflask he offered it to prentice prentice looked at it looked away i dont think thats going to solve anything kenneth sighed put the flask away again completed reeling in cast again and slowly wound the lure in once more prentice look were all sorry about darren watt was dead hed been on his motorbike driving to glasgow one bright day he was overtaking a truck on the long straight at the start of glen kinglas a car pulled out onto it from the cowal road darren had assumed the driver had seen him but the driver had only looked one way hadnt thought to check there was nothing overtaking on his side of the road darrens bike hit the wing of the car doing eighty he might have survived being thrown into the open road or the heather and grass at the roadside but he had started to turn as he saw the car coming out in front of him so hit it at a slight angle he was catapulted across the road and into a layby he hit the big concrete litter bin full on and was dead by the time the ambulance arrived its not just darren prentice said its everything its its uncle rory aunt fiona and shit its even doing history dad jesus do human beings ever just get on with each other why are we always at each others throats well i wouldnt worry about rory kenneth said quietly why shouldnt i hes dead he must be its been six years we could probably have him legally declared dead prentice kicked the rod good excuse for a wake and we wouldnt even have the expense of a coffin or anything prentice kenneth said well prentice shouted youre always so fucking smug about rory being alive what do you know what makes you so smart prentice calm down i will not christ dad do you realise how insufferable you can be mr omniscience jeez prentice looked away at the grey landscape of water cloud and dripping trees prentice i dont know for certain rorys alive but im fairly sure in a roundabout sort of way he keeps in touch i think thats all i can say he started to say something else then stopped himself oh i dont know what to say i want to say trust me but looks like rory himself has ruled that out cant say he isnt right about that its true most of the time but im not lying to you maybe not prentice said he looked back at kenneth but you might be wrong about the things youre so busy telling us the truth about i did say i wasnt certain yeah what about darren kenneth looked puzzled he shook his head no youve lost me what do you i cant believe hes just gone like that ken i cant believe there isnt something left some sort of continuity what was the point of it all otherwise kenneth put the rod down clasped his hands you think darrens personality is still around somewhere why not how can he be such a great guy and clever and just just a good friend and some fuckwit forgetting to look both ways cancels out all that probably not even a fuckwit probably some ordinary guy thinking about something else how prentice shoved his hands under his oxters rocked forward head down god i hate getting inarticulate prentice im sorry maybe it sounds brutal but thats just the way it is consciousness goodness whatever they havent got any momentum they can stop in an instant just snuffed out it happens all the time its happening right now all over the world and darren was hardly an extreme example of lifes injustice deaths injustice i know prentice put his hands up to the jacket hood over his ears i know all that i know its happening all the time i know the death squads are torturing children and the israelis are behaving like nazis and pol pots preparing his comeback tour you keep telling us you always told us and people just scream and die get tortured to death because theyre poor or they help the poor or they wrote a pamphlet or they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time and nobody comes to rescue them and the torturers never get punished they retire they even survive revolutions sometimes because they have such fucking useful skills and no superhero comes to save the people being tortured no rambo bursts in no retribution no justice nothing and thats just it there has to be something more than that why kenneth said trying not to sound angry just because we feel that way one wee daft species on one wee daft planet circling one wee daft star in one wee daft galaxy us barely capable of crawling into space yet capable of feeding everybody but nyaa cant be bothered just because we think there must be something more and a few crazy desert cults infect the world with their cruel ideas thats what makes the soul a certainty and heaven a must kenneth sat back shaking his head prentice im sorry but i expected better of you i thought you were smart shit darren dies and you miss rory so you think bugger me must be a geezer with the long flowing white beard after all i didnt say what about your aunt kay kenneth said your mums friend she did believe must be a god prayed every night went to church practically claimed she had a vision once and then she gets married her husband dies of cancer within a year and the baby just stops breathing in its cot one night so she stops believing told me that herself said she couldnt believe in a god that would do that what sort of faith is that what sort of blinkered outlook on the world is it didnt she believe anybody ever died tragically before didnt she ever read her precious fucking bible with its catalogue of atrocities didnt she believe the holocaust had happened the death camps ever existed or did none of that matter because it had all happened to somebody else thats all you can do isnt it prentice shouted back shout people down skim a few useful anecdotes and bitesized facts and always find something different to what theyve said oh im sorry i thought it was called argument no its called being overbearing okay kenneth spread his arms out wide okay he sat still for a time while prentice remained hunched and tenselooking in the bows when prentice didnt say anything kenneth sighed prentice you have to make up your own mind about these things i both your mother and i have always tried to bring you up to think for yourself i admit it pains me to think you you might be contemplating letting other people or some some doctrine start thinking for you even for comforts sake because dad prentice said loudly looking up at the grey clouds i just dont want to talk about it okay im just trying well stop prentice whirled round and kenneth could have wept to see the expression on the face of his son pained and desperate and close to tears if he wasnt crying already the rain made it hard to tell just leave me alone kenneth looked down massaged the sides of his nose with his fingers then took a deep breath prentice turned away from him again kenneth stowed the fishing rod looked round the flat rainbattered waters of the small loch and remembered that hot calm day thirty years earlier on another fishing trip that had ended quite differently he took up the oars lets head back in all right prentice didnt say anything fergus darling youre soaked oh youve brought some little friends with you have you yes mother good afternoon mrs urvill oh its young kenneth mchoan didnt see you under that hood well jolly good come in take off your coats fergus darling close that door fergus closed the door this is lachlan watt his dad works in our factory oh really yes well youve all been out playing have you mrs urvill took their coats handling lachys tattered and greasylooking jacket with some distaste she hung the dripping garments up on hooks the rear porch of the urvills rambling house at the foot of barsloisnoch hill beyond the northwest limits of gallanach smelled somehow cosy and damp at the same time now i dare say you young men could do with some tea am i right mrs urvill was a tall aristocraticlooking lady kenneth always remembered as wearing a headscarf she wasnt that day she wore a tweed skirt sweater and a pearl necklace which she kept fingering she made them tea accompanied by some slices of bread and bramble jelly this was served at a small table in ferguss room on the first floor fergus had one slice of bread and kenneth managed two before lachy wolfed all the rest the war was only over a few months and rationing was still in force lachy sat back belched that was rerr he said he wiped his mouth on the frayed sleeve of his jumper see the breed in our hoose its green so it is what said kenneth what rot fergus said sipping his tea aye it is lachy said pointing one grubby finger at fergus green bread kenneth said grinning aye an ahll tell ye why tae but yeve goat tae promise no tae tell anybudy okay kenneth said sitting forwards head in hands hmm i suppose so fergus agreed unenthusiastically lachy glanced from side to side its the petrol he said voice low the petrol kenneth didnt understand load of absolute rot if you ask me fergus sneered na its true lachlan said see the navy boys oot oan the flyin boat base aye said kenneth frowning they pit this green dye in thur petrol an if yer foun wi that in the tank uv yer motor car ye get the jile but if ye pit the petrol through breed the dye comes oot an ye can use the petrol an naebudy kens a thing its true he sat back an thats why we huv green breed in

you would get the jail aye lachy said but you promised no tae tell didnt ye he smiled thinly over at fergus sitting on the other side of the small table your maw always call ye darlin aye no fergus said sitting straight and drawing a hand across his forehead moving some hair away from his eyes only sometimes kenneth got up and went to stare at a big model ship in a glass case on the far side of the room it was an ordinary steamer not a warship unfortunately but it looked magnificent like one of the ones hed seen in the big museum in glasgow when his dad had taken him there the ship was wonderfully detailed every stanchion and rail was there every tiny porthole even the oars in the tiny shoreboats behind the tall funnel their seats and internal ribs thinner than matchsticks you her darlin ur ye lachy said wiping some crumbs from the plate you her wee darlin that right fergus well what if i am fergus said sniffily weyl whort if a eym lachy mimicked kenneth looked round from the gleaming perfect model ferguss face looked pinched at least my mum and dad dont hit me master watt lachy sneered stirred in his seat aye great fur some he said standing up he walked round the room looking at some wooden aircraft models on a desk tapping them very fancy carpet fergus darling he said going up and down on his heels on the thick pile of the intricatelypatterned rug fergus said nothing lachy picked up some lead soldiers from a couple of trays ranked full of them then stood inspecting some maps on the wall of scotland the british isles europe and the world they red bits aw ours are they no theyre the kings actually fergus said thats the empire theyre not red because theyre commie or anything ach lachy said ah ken that but ah mean theyre british theyre ours well i dont know about ours but they belong to britain well lachy said indignantly ahm british am ah no hmm i suppose so fergus conceded but i dont see how you can call it yours you dont even own your own house so whit lachy said angrily yes but fergus kenneth said it is the british empire and were all british and when were older we can vote for mps to go to parliament and theyre in power not the king thats what the magna carta says and we elect them dont we so it is our empire really isnt it i mean you when think about it kenneth walked into the middle of the room smiling at the other two boys fergus looked unconvinced lachlan rolled his eyes looked at the small single bed then at a couch in one corner you got this room all tae yerself lachy said voice high yes so fergus replied bi christ its all right for some eh ken lachy said winking at kenneth and walking over to the model ship in the glass case aye he said tapping the glass then twisting a little key in a lock at one end of the case the side panel of the case opened ah bet ye can get up tae all sorts aw things in here by yourself at nights he started trying to haul the model out of the case stop that fergus shouted standing up lachy shifted the whole glass on its stand reached in and lifted the model out of its two wood and brass cradles kenneth saw the rear mast bend against the top of the case the black threads of the radio wires sagged how can ye play with it in here lachlan protested straining to pull the model out lachy kenneth said starting over to him its not a toy fergus said running over he swatted lachys arm stop it youll break it ach all right lachy said he slid the model ship back in kenneth noticed with some relief that the mast flexed back into shape hauling the radio antennae taut again keep yer hair on darling fergus locked the door of the case and pocketed the key and dont call me that sorry darling i said stop it fergus shrieked ach dinnae wet yer knickers ya big lassie you disgusting little oh come on you two act grownup kenneth said fergus he pointed over to the window and a slopetopped display case standing under it whats all this stuff thats my museum fergus said glaring at lachy and walking to the window oo a museum lachy said in a pretend posh voice but came over too things ive found locally fergus explained he stood over the case pointing thats a roman coin i think and thats an arrowhead whits that green thing lachy said pointing to one corner that fergus told him is a fossilized pear lachy guffawed its a bit aw bone ya daft bugger whered ye get yon back a the butchers shop

the cabinet go on get out fergus screamed pointing to the door lachy looked sourly at the pitted vaguely green exhibit labelled fossilized pear duntrunne beach th of may im not kidding out fergus began kenneth he put a hand on the other boys arm fergus hit it away face white with fury lachy wrinkled his nose which was almost touching the glass of the cabinet still whit dae ye expect frae a laddy that hides in a lavvy you pig fergus screamed and brought both fists thudding down on the back of lachys head lachys face crashed through the glass into the display case fergus kenneth yelled pulling him away as fergus kicked at lachys legs lachy screamed jerked back spilling glass arms flailing face covered in blood aah ya basturt he wailed staggering ah canny see lachy kenneth shouted hauling his hanky out of his pocket he went to lachy grabbed his shoulders lachy stand still stand still he tried to wipe the blood from the other boys eyes it was all over his jumper dripping onto the carpet but ah canny see ah canny see what on earth is going on in he oh my god mrs urvill said from the doorway fergus what have you been letting him do and get him off that carpet its persian lachlan lost an eye the gallanach glass works ornaments division made him an artificial one fergus was soundly beaten by his father and not allowed out for a fortnight the urvills granted the watt family the sum of one thousand guineas in full and final settlement of the matter the papers drawn up by the firm of blawke blawke and blawke lachlan was still growing and perhaps because of that during his midteens the eye kept falling out so another slightly larger was made lachlan was allowed to keep the old one he had a third glass eye which hed got from the hospital when the first one had been lost for a week it was eventually discovered months later under a chest of drawers in lachy and rabs bedroom where presumably it had rolled during the night but it was of inferior quality duller and less lifelike and he kept it as a spare he was the boy with four eyes and he didnt even need glasses or rather a monocle keep an eye out for us lachy and variations thereof became a popular phrase amongst his schoolmates though not to his face after the first boy to say it within lachys earshot if not sight was held down by a halfdozen powerful young watts and forced to swallow the brownirised orb and then to bring it back up mary mchoan sniffed the air prentice you smell of petrol prentice collapsed into a seat in the living room sorry he said his mother looked over the top of the guardian at him on the television a game of snooker was proceeding silently prentice sat and looked at it mary put the paper down took off her reading glasses wheres ken prentice asked he still had his black leather jacket on in bed reading mary told him she folded the paper went over to her son and sniffed the air above him and smoke you smell of of nonpub smoke she said going back to her seat what have you been up to prentice leaned towards her promise you wont tell dad no prentice she said smoothing her skirt she took a coffee mug from the small table at her side and sipped from it you know im terrible with secrets not like your father hells teeth oh well prentice said whatever we got let off so let off what mary said alarmed we were in the jac and bill gray said hed heard the watts saying well it was ashley he said which was why i didnt believe him at first but hed heard them they were all sitting all the young ones the watts anyway sitting there being antisocial and morose cause of darren getting killed and anyway bill heard ash saying there was only one way to deal with it or theyd never get over it properly and they should all get sledgehammers and stuff sledgehammers mary said clutching at her elbows thats what i said prentice said sitting forward unzipping his jacket sledgehammers and bill said yeah he was sure and crowbars that sort of stuff they were going to get it out of their system and i believed bill because hes so straight no side at all and i looked over and they were all standing up and putting their coats on and drinking up and i tried to talk to ashley but they were out the door and ash said something about coming along too and it was bill had the car and hed dashed for a pee and by the time we got out to the car park they were tearing off in deans cortina and then bill couldnt get his car started and we headed for the watts house but by then theyd been there and they passed us we turned round followed their lights caught up with them at those new houses out by dalvore but they were just throwing stuff in the boot i shouted to them but they got back in and screamed off again so we followed jeez i thought they knew where that guy lived that hit darren but bill said he was from east kilbride and i said but were heading that way and they just kept going past here and up to inveraray and then i thought god i hope i know what theyre really going to do and i told bill and he said shit lets hope so prentice sorry anyway i was right they drove to kinglas glen kinglas with us following and they got parked in the layby and we did too and we all got out and we all stood there for a while and nobody said anything then they got the sledgehammers and the crowbars out and we turned the cars and left the engines running so we had plenty of light then bill and i sat on the bank and watched them oh wow mum you should have seen them they smashed that fucking litter bin prentice sorry but they did they pulverised the mother they whacked and smashed and blasted the damn thing to smithereens then tore them to shreds too hammered the metal bins inside flat turned the concrete shell of the thing to dust and id asked bill if it was okay and hed said in the circumstances so i went to his car and got his spare can of petrol because bills really organised that way and said was it all right and they were all standing there sweating and panting and looking just so drained and ash just sort of nodded and i emptied the petrol all over the remains of the bin and dean threw a match at it and whumph up it went and we just stood there and then this cop stopped i couldnt believe it what were the chances and like only a couple of cars had passed hadnt stopped though one had slowed down certainly but it had gone off again and this enormous fu great sergeant got out and he was like incandescent the bin was nothing on this guy and we all just stood there and i thought oh no this really could end badly because there was just him by himself and he was cursing us up and down and the watts werent taking it too well and i thought i could hear dean starting to growl and i finally managed to get a word in edgeways when he said whod set it on fire and i said me and stepped forward showing him the petrol can and told him what it was all about about darren hitting the thing and it being like well i tried not to use too many long words but like expiation and he listened and i was like in that way when youre really nervous where once youve started you cant stop and i was probably repeating myself all over the place and rambling and not making much sense but i just kept on going and he just stood there with this look like thunder on his face all lit by the fire and i stopped and said we knew it was wrong and wed accept having to be punished for it even though i heard dean growling when i said it but even so although we might be sorry wed done it we were glad too and that was just the way it was and if we didnt normally have respect for public property it wouldnt mean so much to us to destroy it like we had prentice swallowed and i shut up at last and nobody said anything and the fire was nearly out by this time and the big sergeant just says get on your way and pray i never haul any of you up for anything else and im like yessuh massa and kicking dirt over the wee bits of the fire thats left and the watts are still surly but theyre putting all the stuff back in the boot of the cortina and the big guys just standing with his arms folded watching us and im thinking guildford four birmingham six hell theres still a few good apples left and we just got into our cars and drove away with the big sergeant still standing there glowering like colossus in our tail lights prentice spread his hands thats it well mary said good grief she shook her head glanced at the snooker then put her glasses on and took up her paper again hmm well i probably wont tell your father that away and wash your hands try to get rid of that smell theres plenty of milk in the fridge if you want cereal rightoh mum he came over to her kissed her hair yuk what a stink go and wash you vandal thanks for listening mum he said on his way to the door oh i had a choice did i she said pretending primness prentice laughed chapter we passed the layby near the cowal road junction doing about ninety i watched as we went by nothing it was just a damp deserted parking place with a big new concrete litter bin replaced with unusual alacrity in less than six months we swept past trailing light spray it was a dim grey day light drizzle from the overcast mountains hidden past about a thousand feet we were on dippedbeam the instruments glowed orange in front of the delicious straightarmed blackskirted docshoed cropblonde purselipped verity my angelic bird of paradise driving like a bat out of hell yo prentice get you out of bed oh you guessed its a gift pick you up at one umm yeah where are you lewis at the walkers in edinburgh oh is verity there yeah shes coming eh shes coming to lochgair charlotte and steve are off to the states this morning skiing and verity skiing to the states sheesh that packice gets shut up prentice the upshot is veritys going to be festival perioding with the urvills shes going to drive us there and me insane i thought great i said no rodney lewis laughed no rodney verity is finally a rodfree zone couldnt have happened to a nicer chap agree grade and comments see you thirteen hundred hours yeah see you then i put the phone down there was a dartboard above the phone with a picture of thatcher taped over it i kissed it yeeeeeeha i shouted leaping back into the bedroom shut up prentice gav moaned muffled from his bed he was invisible under a heap of duvet my bed was on the other side of the room away from the window and so not quite as cold as gavs in the winter i fell into it bounced technically i should have norriss solo room because ive been in the flat longest but that rooms small and noisy also gav doesnt snore and hes quite happy to retreat to the living room couch if i have female company thats another thing theres only room for a single bed in norriss room put the heater on ya bastard gav mumbled i leapt up ninjad over to gavs bed and wheeched the duvet off aw ya he grabbed the duvet back cocooned himself again bastard gavin i told him you are a skidmark on the lavatory bowl of life but i respect you for it i turned grabbed my dressing gown and made for the door with one mighty ninja kick the side of my right foot connected with all three switches of the fan heater at the same time and it hummed into life i shall make some tea dunno about tea fuckin good at makin a noise thank you for sharing that with us gav i shall return whats the weather like hmm i said staring at the ceiling one finger to my lips good question i said the weathers like a manifestation of the energytransfer effected between volumes of the planets gaseous envelope due to differential warming of the atmosphere at various latitudes by solar radiation surprised you didnt know that actually gavin gavin stuck his head out from under the duvet giving me cause once more to marvel at the impressive way the lads shoulders merged into his head with no apparent narrowing in between this appeared to be the principal physical benefit bestowed by the game of rugby the acquisition of an extremely thick neck just as the most important thing one could take to the sport was a thick skull and from it an intact one still in satisfactory twoway communication with ones spinal cord gav who probably epitomised thickskulledness though admittedly would not be amongst ones first fifteen when it came to offering proof of heavy traffic within the central nervous system opened one bleary eye and focused on me with the same accuracy one has grown to expect from security forces aiming baton rounds at protesters legs what the fucks made you so unbearable this morning i clasped my hands smiled broadly gavin i am in a transport of delight or at least shall be shortly after one oclock this afternoon there was a pause while gavins dutyneuron struggled to assimilate this information the intense processing involved obviously exhausted too much of gavs thinlystretched grey matter to allow speech in the near future so he contented himself with a grunt and submerged again i boogied to the kitchen singing walking on sunshine i watched the orangewhite needles swing across their calibrated arcs ninety jeez i was sitting behind lewis who was in the front passenger seat i kind of wished id sat behind verity i wouldnt have seen so much of her not even a hint of that slim smooth face frowning in concentration as she barrelled the big black beemer towards the next corner but i wouldnt have been able to see the speedometer either lewis seemed unperturbed i shifted in my seat a little uncomfortable i pulled the seat belt tight again i checked verity wasnt watching and adjusted my jeans a little the folder containing rorys work lay on the seat by my side i lifted the file onto my lap concealing a bulge there was a reason for this wed been on the bit of fast dual carriageway between dumbarton and alexandria not long after verity and lewis had picked me up verity made a sort of wriggling motion a couple of times straining back against her seat this force was applied by those long blacknyloned legs and though most of the pressure was provided by her left limb some residual effort pushed her right foot down as well and on each occasion we speeded up just momentarily as her amplysoled doc marten pressed against the accelerator you okay lewis had asked sounding amused shed made a funny face yup shed said shifting down to fourth as a car shed been waiting to pass pulled back into the slow lane we were all pressed back into our seats problem of wearing sussies sometimes they sort of pull a bit you know she flashed a smile at lewis then me then looked forward again lewis laughed well no cant claim i do know but ill take your word for it verity nodded just getting things sorted out here she strained against the backrest again her bum lifting right off the seat the car already doing eightfive roared up to over a hundred the rear of a truck was approaching rapidly verity wiggled her bottom plonked it back down calmly braked and shifted up to fifth dawdling along behind the green parceline truck while she waited for it to overtake an esso tanker parceline parceline she breathed tapping her fingers on the thick steering wheel she made it sound french pronouncing the word so that it rhymed with vaseline that better lewis inquired mmhum verity nodded meanwhile i was fainting in the back seat just thinking of what that tight black midthigh skirt concealed it had taken until the long open lefthander that leads down into glen kinglas before my erection had finally subsided and that had been mostly naked fear verity had lost it just for a second the rear of the car nudging out towards the wrong side of the road as we whanged round the bend sitting in the rear maybe it had felt worse but id been petrified thankfully thered been no traffic coming the concept of striking up an intimate indeed potentially penetrative relationship with the rocks on the far side of the road had been bad enough but even the prospect of a headon with another lump of metal travelling at anything remotely like the sort of speed we were sustaining might have resulted in me making my mark in the most embarrassing fashion on the leather upholstery of the bavarian machtwagen verity just went whoayeah like shed accomplished something jiggled the steering wheel once and accelerated cleanly away anyway its one of the minor unfortunate facts of life that a detumescing willy is prone to trap stray pube hairs under the foreskin as it scrolls forward again and that was why i was adjusting my clothing as we braked for the bend above cairndow i opened the crow road folder lying on my lap and leafed through some of the papers id read the various bits and pieces a couple of times now looking for something deep and mysterious in it all but not finding anything id even done a little research of my own and discovered through mum that dad had some more of rorys papers in his study shed promised shed try and look them out for me i took a sheet of paper out of the folder and held the page of scribbled multicoloured notes up resting it on one raised knee gazing at it with a critical look wondering if verity could see what i was doing i cleared my throat id rather been hoping lewis or verity might have asked me what the file contained by now and what i was doing but annoyingly neither of them had sounds lewis asked sounds verity nodded i sighed i put the sheet back in the folder and the folder back on the other rear seat we rounded the top of upper loch fyne listening to an old madonna tape the material girl singing papa dont preach which raised a smile from me at least back to gallanach for christmas and hogmanay i felt a strange mixture of hope and melancholy the lights of oncoming cars glared in the dull day i watched the lights and the drizzle and the grey pervasive clouds remembering another car journey the year before sounds daft to me prentice ashley said lighting another cigarette it sounds daft to me i agreed i watched the red tip of her cigarette glow white headlights streamed by on the other side of the motorway as we headed north in the darkness darren had been dead a couple of months i had fallen out with my father and id been in london for most of the summer staying with aunt ilsa and her longterm companion whose only name appeared to be mr gibbon which i thought made him sound like a cat for some reason anyway id been staying with them in darkest kensington at mr gibbons very grand threestoreyed townhouse in ascot square just off addison road and working at a branch of mondofood on victoria street they were trying a new line in haggisburgers at the time and the manager thought my accent would help shift them only trouble was when people said gee whats in these i kept telling them i dont believe theyre on the menu any more id saved some money grown heartily sick of london fast food and maybe people too and i was getting out ash had been in london for a programming interview with some big insurance company and had offered me a lift back home or to gallanach anyway as id exiled myself from lochgair her battered motleypanelled cv had looked out of place in ascot square where i think that anything less than a twoyear old golf gti peugeot or renault was considered to be only just above banger status even as a third car let alone a second sorry im late prentice shed said and kissed my cheek she and lewis had been out for a meal the night before big brother was staying in islington making a living from tv comedy shows by being one of the twenty or so names that zip up the screen under where it says additional material by and trying to be a standup comic id been invited to dinner too but declined id hoped shed just pick me up and wed be on our way but ash hadnt seen aunt ilsa for a long time and insisted on exchanging more than just pleasantries with her and mr g aunt ilsa was a large loud woman of forbiddingly intense bonhomie i always thought of her as being the most remote outpost of the mchoan clan unless you counted the still purportedly peripatetic uncle rory a stout bulwark of a woman who for me at least had always personified the dishevelled ramifications of our family a couple of years older than dad she had lived in london for three decades on and off mostly she was off travelling the world with mr gibbon her constant companion for twentynine of those thirty years mr gibbon had been an industrialist whose firm had employed the ad agency which aunt ilsa had worked for when shed first moved to london they met he found her company agreeable she found him a new slogan within a year they were living together and he had sold his factory to devote more time to the rather more demanding business of keeping aunt ilsa company on her peregrinations they had been on the move more or less ever since mr gibbon was a greyhaired pixie of a man ten years older than aunt ilsa and as tiny and delicate as she was tall and bigboned apparently he was quite charming but as the basis of his charm seemed to rest upon the unstartling stratagem of addressing every female he encountered by the fullest possible version of her name so that every julie became a juliana every dot extended to a dorothea all marys became mariana sues susanna etc sorry etcetera as well as the slightly perverse habit of calling all young girls madam and all old women girls it was a charm to which i at least was quite prophylactically immune and you are he asked ashley as he welcomed her in the hallway ash she said pleased to meet you i grinned thinking mr gibbon would have a hard job finding a convincing embellishment for ashs uncommon monicker ashkenazia come in come in he led the way to the library ash turned back to me as we followed and muttered hes a pianist isnt he totally misunderstanding what she meant i sneered slightly at mr gibbons back and nodded yeah isnt he just aunt ilsa was in the library she had a heavy cold at the time and i am tempted to say we discovered her poring over a map but the inelegant truth is that she was searching the shelves for a misplaced book when we entered she spent most of the next half hour or so talking about the extended holiday to patagonia she was planning in an extremely loud voice and with an enthusiasm that would probably have embarrassed the argentinian tourist board i sat fretting wanting to be away by some miracle the cv hadnt been towed away when id finally dragged ash out wed made it to the m picked up a hitcher and rather beyond the call of duty id have said dropped him where he was going in coventry we got lost in nuneaton trying to get back on the m and were now heading through lancashire at dusk still an hour or more from the border prentice there are a lot of better reasons for not talkin to your dad believe me i believe you i said what about your mother no shes still talking to him she tutted you know what i mean youre still seeing her i hope yeah she came to uncle hamishs a couple of times and she drove me back to glasgow once i mean whats the big argument cant you just agree to disagree no we disagree about that i shook my head seriously it doesnt work that way neither of us can leave it alone theres almost nothing either of us can say that cant be taken the wrong way with a bit of imagination its like being married ash laughed what would you know i thought your mum and dad were pretty happy yeah i suppose but you know what i mean when a marriage or relationship is going wrong and its like everything that one person says or doesnt say or does or doesnt do seems to rub the other one up the wrong way like that hmm ash said i watched the red tail lights i felt very tired i think hes angry that having given me the freedom to think for myself ive not followed him all down the line but prentice its not as though you even believe in christianity or anything like that shit i cant work out what it is you do believe in god i shifted uncomfortably in the thin seat i dont know not god not as such not as a man something in human form or even in an actual thing just just a field a force follow the force luke eh ash grinned i remember you and your star wars didnt you write to steven spielberg she laughed george lucas i nodded miserably but i dont even mean anything like that that was just background for the film i mean a sort of interconnectedness a field effect i keep getting this feeling its already there like in quantum physics where matter is mostly space and space even the vacuum seethes with creation and annihilation all the time and nothing is absolute and two particles at opposite ends of the universe react together as soon as ones interfered with all that stuff its like its there and its staring us in the face but i just cant cant access it maybe it isnt accessible ash said fag in mouth holding the steering wheel with her knees and making a stretching circling motion with her shoulders we were on a quiet stretch of motorway thankfully she took her cigarette from her mouth again put her hands back on the wheel i hoped she wasnt getting sleepy the drone of the wee citroens engine was cataleptically monotonous how not i said why shouldnt it be accessible maybe its like your particle inevitably uncertain soon as you understand one part of what it means you lose any chance of understanding the rest she looked over at me brows furrowed what was that routine lewis used to do about heisenberg oh i said annoyed now i cant remember something about being at school and bursting into this office and saying look are you principal here or not heisenberg and him going weellll she gave a small laugh mind it was funnier the way lewis told it a little i conceded but lewis seems to be making it in the old alternative comedy scene doesnt he ash said so were told i said looking away i dont imagine ben elton or robin williams have considered early retiral quite yet though aye but good for him though eh i looked at ash she was watching the road as we roared down a slight incline at all of seventy her face was expressionless that long modigliani nose like a knife against the darkness yeah i said and felt small and meanspirited aye good for him it true youve not seen much of him in london well he has his own friends and i was usually too tired after work a lie i wandered art galleries and went to films mostly and i couldnt have paid my way either ach prentice ashley said chiding she shook her head the long mane of fair hair was tied up so it did not swish and fall over her shoulders hed have liked to have seen you more often hes missed you oh well i said i watched the lights again for a while ashley drove and smoked i felt myself nodding off and shook myself awake ah dear i rubbed my face with both hands asked how do you keep awake i play games she told me oh yeah yeah she nodded licking her lips like name that taillight what i laughed true she said see that car up ahead i looked at the two red lights yeah see how high up the lights are not too far apart renault no kidding mmhmm one its overtaking yeah horizontally divided lights thats an old cortina mark good grief heres a beemer new five series i think about to pass us should have lights that slant in slightly at the bottom the bmw passed us its rear lights were slanted in slightly at the bottom we overtook the old ford and the a little later course ash said its more fun in a fast car when youre doing all the overtaking but even just sitting at seventy youd be surprised how much you pass sometimes now she held up one finger listen and feel as we pull back into the slow lane ash swung the ancient cv to the left then straightened what i said nothing she grinned missed all the cats eyes bumpfree lanechanging a great skill you know she glanced at me mockserious not so easy in a ferrari or whatever the tyres are too wide but skinny wee tyres like this things got are just about ideal allow me to sit back in amazement young ashley i said crossing my arms and twisting in my seat to face her i had no idea it was possible to extract such multifarious enjoyment from a simple nighttime car journey ashley laughed cobbled streets are even more fun if youre a girly huh trust you to lower the tone of the whole conversation and introduce a note of clitoris envy at the same time ash laughed louder ground the cigarette butt out in the ashtray flipped it closed och its a gift id be ashamed of myself if i wasnt just so fucking nice with it she put her head back an roared with laughter at this before shaking her head and restoring her attention to the road i laughed a little too then stared out of the side window wondering suddenly if ash had slept with lewis last night she clicked the indicator on ye olde motorway services come on yer aunty ashleyll buy you a coffee and a sticky bun gee you sure know how to show a boy a good time ash just smirked when i woke about midday in the flat on crow road janice rae had gone to work i assume there was a note on a small blue sheet of writing paper youre the better standup call me sometime if you want j i looked at that qualified second sentence with an odd feeling of sadness and relief drying off after a shower i stood looking at two framed movie posters on the bathroom wall paris texas and dangerous liaisons i had a coffee and some toast washed up and let myself out id put the crow road folder in a tesco bag and walked back to our flat under grey skies and through a mild and swirling wind swinging the carrier to and fro and whistling our flat was in grant street near st georges cross and just off ashley street funnily enough my flatmates were out when i got back which was fine by me i did not relish the prospect of facing the singleentendres that were gavs best approximation of wit and which inevitably followed any sexual adventure of mine or norriss real or imagined gav ever found out about if i was lucky gav would be so shocked at the very idea i had had carnal knowledge of an aunt even one of the notreallyanaunt variety that he would just pretend it hadnt happened hell if i was really lucky he might stop talking to me altogether i thought but that didnt seem likely or preferable to be honest part of me rather looked forward to such taunting id caught a glimpse of my face in the hall mirror once when gav was berating me for such rakish tendencies and id been smiling i made myself another coffee extended myself on the sofa my legs quivery with fatigue opened the folder pulled out the sheets of paper and started to read crow road seemed to be the title of uncle rorys big idea from the notes he seemed unsure whether its final form would be a novel a film or an epic poem there were even some pages discussing the possibility of it being a concept album i lay there on the couch and shuddered at the very thought so seventies the material in the folder seemed to fall into three basic categories notes bits of descriptive prose and poems a few of the notes were dated all between the early and late seventies the notes were on a mixture of papers mostly looseleaf ruled plain squared graph some were on cartridge paper some on pages torn from what looked like school exercise books and some on folded greenlined computer printout napkins and old cigarette packets did not sadly put in an appearance the notes were scribbled in a noless motley variety of differentcoloured pens ball felt and microliner and used a lot of abbreviations and compressions h crshd twn carige tr erlier proph by sr kid by t livng t ded h chrstlk figr chng nm to start with t fml chrst fr new times scot mrtyrf or birnam wd idea disgsd army silly and that was one of the more comprehensible bits silly indeed the prose was mostly about places rory had been they read like outtakes from his travel pieces san josé ca suddenly the winchester house itself seemed like a emblem for the restless american soul about some weird house rory wanted to use in his story judging by some cryptic notes at the end of the passage then there was the poetry we know this life is merely a succession of endless brutal images punctuated for effect by relative troughs whose gutsy heaves at first disguised but power us to the next disgrace not applying for a job with hallmark cards then i muttered to myself sipping at my coffee but i kept on reading my head wasnt really in the right state for assimilating all this stuff but as far as i could gather uncle rory had been trying for years to come up with something creative his capital his italics something that would establish him as a writer scriptwriter poet lyricist for a rock band novelist playwright it didnt matter being recognised for having kept a glorified diary while wandering through india when he was young and naïve wasnt enough for him it wasnt serious this work crow road would be serious it would be about life and death and treachery and betrayal and love and death and imperialism and colonialism and capitalism it would be about scotland or india or an erewhon and the working class and exploitation and action and there would be characters in the work who would represent all of these things and the working out of the story would itself prove the subjectivity of truth there were pages of that sort of stuff there were also pages of poems forced into some sort of rhyming structure so that they might conceivably have worked as songs several paragraphs of references to critical works barthes especially death of the author shouted what looked like a headover one entire page of notes devoted to ideas about a looseleaf novelpoem there were location notes for a film and sheets physical appearance of the characters and the sort of actors who might play them these surrounded by doodles mazes and uninspired drawings of faces there was a list of bands that might be interested in doing an album a musical tonescale running all the way from yes to genesis and a sheaf of sketches for the sets in a stage presentation what there wasnt was any indication whatsoever that rory had actually written any part of this great work the only things that might have been classed as narrative were the poems and they didnt seem to have anything to do with each other apart from the fact a lot of them seemed to be vaguely about death or love tenuous was the word that came to mind i looked in the folder again to see if id missed anything i had there was another small sheet of blue writing paper in janice raes hand prentice had a look at this then the word while crossed out heavily followed by the word before also nearly obliterated cant find any more r had another folder if you find it and work out what its all about let me know he said there was something secret buried in it gallanach i bobbled my head from side to side gallanach i said in a silly highpitched voice as though quoting i stretched grunting with pain as my leg muscles extracted their revenge for having been ignored twelve hours earlier i reached for my coffee but it was cold dear god we beseech ye visit the reactive wrath of their own foulness upon those nasty wee buggers in the khmer rouge in general and upon their torturers and their leader pol pot in particular may each iota of pain they have inflicted on the people of their country heathen or not rebound upon their central nervous system with all the agony they originally inflicted upon their victims also lord god we ask that you remember the dark deeds of any communistic socalledinterrogators in this time of great upheaval in eastern europe we know that you will not forget their crimes when their day of reckoning comes and their guttural slavic voices cry out to ye for mercy and ye reward them with all the compassion they ever showed to those unfortunate souls delivered unto them prentice i jumped id almost fallen asleep while uncle hamish had been droning on i opened my eyes the tree was looking expectantly at me oh i said umm id just like to put in a word for salman rushdie or at least take one out for old ayatollah ruhollah khomeini i looked at uncle hamish who was making quiet signals that i should clasp my hands and close my eyes we were in the front lounge of uncle hamish and aunt tones victorian villa in the attractive gallanach suburbette of ballymeanoch facing each other over a card table i closed my eyes ah i said dear god we pray that as well as suffering whatever part of the general physical unpleasantness involved in the iraniraq war you may judge to be rightly his you can find a spare area in his suffering er anticreate for mr r khomeini late of tehran and qom to experience at least some of the umm despair and continual worry currently being undergone by the novelist mr s rushdie of bombay and london heathen and smartalec though he may well be amen amen echoed uncle h i opened my eyes uncle hamish was already rising from his sear looking positively twinkly with health and good cheer he rubbed his hands very good he said moving in that oddly stiff and creaky way of his for the door let us repair for some repast he chuckled as he held the door open for me i believe antonia has prepared something called cod creole he sniffed the fishy air in the hall we crossed to the dining room not lobster creole or kid i inquired but i dont think uncle hamish heard me he was humming something sombre and looking pleased with himself uncle h has developed a fascinating heresy based on the idea that exactly what you did to other people while you were alive gets done right back to you once youre dead torturers die in agony hundreds maybe thousands of times before their ravaged souls are finally dropped from the jaws of a fearsome and vengeful god those who authorise the dreadful deeds carried out by the torturers or whoever also share whatever proportion of this retrospective agony the deity or his angelic costbenefitcalculating representatives deem they deserve having quizzed the tree on the details of this scheme it would appear that said burden of transferred pain is debited from the account of the guy at or rather wielding the sharp end of the original action which seems only fair i suppose apparently uncle hamish is awaiting divine inspiration on the knotty problem of whether the good things one has accomplished in ones life are also relived from the other side as it were or simply subtracted from the nasty stuff at the moment he seems to be veering towards the idea that if you did more good than bad during your life you go straight to heaven an arrangement which at least processes the merit of simplicity the rest sounds like something dreamt up by a vindictive bureaucrat on acid while closely inspecting something hieronymus bosch painted on one of his bleak but imaginative days still it has its attractions aunt tone and the familys two children josh and becky and beckys infant daughter iona were already in the dining room filling it with bustle and chat said your prayers aunt tone said brightly depositing a steaming dish of potatoes on the table thank you yes hamish replied my uncle worships alone these days and has done ever since his son left home to become a devout capitalist neither his wife nor his daughter had ever bothered with my uncles unique brand of condemnationist christianity as a rule the mchoan women whether so by blood or marriage have displayed a marked reluctance to take their menfolks passions seriously at least outside the bedroom i think that was why uncle hamish had been so delighted when id come to stay with the family and also perhaps why he was in no hurry to help effect a reconciliation between me and my father we dined on spicy fish which repeated on me for most of the evening in the jac meeting pals until i drowned it in an ocean of beer happy new year ashley yelled flourishing a bottle of generic whisky with more enthusiasm than care she cracked the bottle off the oakpanelled wall of the castles crowded entrance hall but without apparently causing damage to either clad in a sparkly jacket and a long black skirt wreathed in silly string and clumps and strands of paper streamers from party poppers her long hair bunned she enveloped me in a very friendly kiss breathing whisky and wine fumes i kissed right back and she pushed away laughing wo prentice she shouted over the noise the hall was packed with people music spilled out from the main hall beyond pipes and fiddles tabors and accordions guitars and a piano several of them playing the same tune i thought you gave up i said pointing at the cigarette she had stuck behind one ear josh and becky were still at the doors greeting people they knew i did she said taking the fag from behind her ear and putting it in her mouth she left it there for a few seconds then restored it to its previous position see still given up no temptation at all ash and i levered our way through the press of people while i undid my jacket and struggled to extricate my halfbottle of whisky from a side pocket we made it into the hall which was actually less crowded though still full a huge fire roared in the grate people balanced on the fireseat which ran around the hearth and on every other available perch including the stairs and the piano a few enthusiasts within the midst of the crowd were trying to dance the eightsome reel which in the circumstances was a little like trying to stage a boxing match in a telephone box not totally impossible just pointless ash and i found a space over near the piano she reached over the piano to a pile of little plastic cups grabbed one and shoved it into my hand here have a drink she sloshed some whisky into the cup howve you been fine i said broke and i can see that disappearing over the event horizon but fuck it ive still got my integrity and my mobius scarf and a boy can go a long way with those things you got a job yet what lets stand away from this fucking piano what have you got a job yet na hey she put one hand on my shoulder heard what david bowies latest films called this sounds lewisian i shouted no she shook her head merry christmas mister ceausescu ashley laughed like a drain a teetotaller might have said her breath smelled like one very funny i yelled into her ear havent laughed so much since general zia got blown up where is lewis anyway we were waiting for them to turn up at hamish and tones but they never showed he and james here ash looked concerned for a second then her smile returned she put her arm round my shoulders saw james over by the accordion earlier hey you want to take a stroll round the battlements she pulled a spliff half out of her breast pocket let it fall back got a number here but mrs mcspadden keeps wandering through and i seem to remember she took inordinate and extremely loud interest in one of these last year when wee jimmy calder stoked up you comin not right now i said looking around the crowd acknowledging a few waves and some distant mouthings that were probably shouts i stood on tiptoes to look round the hall a paperplane battle seemed to be taking place at one end you seen verity not for a bit ash said pouring herself more whisky i refused hey ash nudged me theres dancing upstairs verity there maybe ash said raising her eyebrows lets check it out way to go prent no verity in the solar loud with sounds and dark with light and less crowded still ash and i danced then cousin josh asked her and i sat watching the people dance for a while the best way to extract any real enjoyment from dancing ive always thought but i seem to be unusual in not gaining any real pleasure from performing the movements and then saw helen urvill entering the hall holding a lager can i went over to her through the dancers happy new year hey prentice same to you i kissed her then lifted her up and spun her round she whooped how are you i yelled helen urvill elegantly tall and judiciously lean straight thick hair obsidian black dress combatcasual back on holiday from switzerland and looking as thoroughly kempt as ever passed the lager can to me im fine she said i looked at the tin shed handed me carling black label i said incredulous somehow this did not quite seem helens style she smirked try some i tried some the stuff foamed went up my nose i spluttered stepping back dripping while helen took the can back and stood grinning champagne i said wiping my chin lanson what else oh youre so stylish helen i said wanna dance we danced and shared the can of champagne hows diana i shouted above the music couldnt get back helen yelled still out in hawaii poor thing yeah helen continued to circulate i decided it was time for a pee and then maybe some food which took me via the garden there was a queue for the downstairs loo and the upper part of the castle was locked to the kitchen mrs mcspadden was in command overseeing a production line of sandwiches sausage rolls bowls of soup and chilli slices of black bun and christmas cake and accompanying slices of cheese prentice mrs mcspadden said mthth mnthpndn i replied mouth full of cake she shoved a set of keys into my hand will ye pop down to the cellar for us mrs s shouted get another litre of whisky its the second archway on the left dinnae let anybody down with you mind keep that door locked the microwave chimed and she hauled a still halffrozen block of chilli out on a big plate she started breaking it up with a large wooden spoon i swallowed okay i said i went through to the utility room cool and dark after the noise and chaos of the kitchen i turned the light on sorted through the keys for one that looked like it might match the door to the cellar a movement outside caught my eye and i peered through the window looked like id put on an outside light too verity walker clad in a short black dress was dancing sinuously on the roof of uncle ferguss range rover lewis sat crosslegged on the bonnet of the car watching her he glanced over shading his eyes and seemed to see me looking through the window from the utility room verity pirouetted holding her shoes in one hand she ran the other down over her body to one thigh then back to her head and through her cropped blonde hair the floodlight outside harsh and white lit her like she was on stage her hair glowed like pale flame lewis jumped off the range rover verity wobbled a little as the car bounced on its springs but recovered he stood at the side of the car between me and it and held one hand up to verity she danced on oblivious then he must have said something and she danced seductively fluidly to the edge of the roof hips moving slow a big smile on her face as she looked down at lewis then she threw herself off the roof lewis caught her staggered back a couple of steps then forward as verity wrapped her arms round his neck and her legs round his waist white glances of thigh against the black lewis put his arms round her as he pitched forward they thumped together into the range rover i thought the impact must have hurt her back but it didnt look like it had her arms and legs stayed where they were and lewiss head bent down to hers her hands started to stroke and caress the nape of his neck and the back and sides of his head after a while one of lewiss arms disengaged waving behind him one finger pointed up to the bright floodlight that was showing me all this his hand made a cutting chopping motion when he did it a second time i put the light out i let myself into the cellar locked the door behind me the cellar was cold i found the whisky let myself out of the cellar and locked it turned all the lights out gave mrs mcspadden the bottle accepted a belated newyear kiss from her then made my way out through the kitchen and the corridor and the crowded hall where the music sounded loud and people were laughing and out through the now almost empty entrance hall and down the steps of the castle and down the driveway and down to gallanach where i walked along the esplanade occasionally having to wave or say happy new year to various people i didnt know until i got to the old railway pier and then the harbour where i sat on the quayside legs dangling drinking my whisky and watching a couple of swans glide on black still water to the distant sound of highland jigs coming from the steam packet hotel and singing and happynewyear shouts echoing in the streets of the town and the occasional sniff as my nose watered in sympathy with my eyes chapter rory stood on the dunes facing the sea lewis stomped away along the tideline kicking at the odd piece of driftwood and the occasional plastic bottle his hands were stuffed into the pockets of his camouflage jacket his head shorthaired these days was down south uist lewis seemed to be taking it as a personal insult that the family had come to the hebrides for their summer holiday people kept asking him what he was doing on uist lewis was further north ha ha hes awful moody isnt he uncle rory rory watched lewis walk away along the beach yeah he shrugged why do you think he doesnt want to walk with us prentices thin face looked genuinely puzzled rory smiled looked once more at lewiss retreating back then started down the far side of the dune heading for the narrow road prentice followed i think rory said its called being at an awkward age kenneth mary and the boys had come holidaying to the hebrides as they did most years rory had been invited along too as he usually was and for a change had accepted so far theyd been lucky the atlantic weather systems had been kind the days bright and warm the nights calm and never completely dark the big rollers boomed in the wide beaches lay mostly empty and the machair between dunes and cultivation was a waving ocean of bright flowers thrown across the rich green waves of grass rory loved it somewhat to his surprise a holiday from holidays a place to stay where he didnt have to take notes about flights and ferries and hotels and restaurants and sights no travel book to think about no articles no pressure he could laze he volunteered to take the boys on a walk after breakfast that sunday james had stayed behind and lewis had been sullen for the halfhour or so theyd been walking before suddenly announcing he wanted to be alone rory and prentice walked on together their short shadows preceding them the road would be turning east soon and taking them back to the main road so that they could turn south and walk back to the house lewis knew his way about the area so rory was happy to let him wander off alone a car passed them on the single track road heading north they stood aside to let it pass waving at the single occupant when he waved at them the surf was a distant wash of noise rolling over the sparkling machair in invisible waves larks warbled points of sound in the sweep of blue sky and small puffy clouds is it all right to walk on a sunday uncle rory all right rory said glancing at the boy in shorts and a shortsleeved shirt he looked almost painfully thin rory wore an old cheesecloth shirt and cutoff jeans aye dad was saying youre not even allowed to walk in some islands on a sunday prentice rolled his eyes and puffed his cheeks out well yeah rory said i think theyre like that in lewis and harris but thats the hardline prods up there down here theyre catholics bit more relaxed about that sort of thing but not being able to walk prentice protested shaking his head at his shadow on the greyblack tarmac i think youre allowed to walk to church and back ho big deal prentice didnt sound impressed he was silent for a while mind you he said sounding sly i suppose you could always take a very long way round rory laughed just as his attention was caught by a little white blossom lying on the road surface in front of them prentice looked up at first surprised then smiling when rory laughed prentice stood on the flower then jumped shrieking with pain ah my foot my foot oh oh rory stood open mouthed for a second watching prentice hop around on the tarmac clutching at one ankle his face contorted rory thought for a second prentice was pretending but the boys expression convinced him he was in real pain prentice hopped onto the grass and fell over still clutching at his foot rory could see something white stuck to the sole of the boys sandshoe what is it he said crouching down by prentices side the boy was shaking and when he looked up at rory there were tears in his eyes i dont know he sobbed stepped on something let me see rory sat on the grass in front of prentice and held his foot the little white blossom hed seen on the roads surface was stuck to the boys sandshoe it wasnt a flower it was a little paper charity flag for the royal national lifeboat institution the sort you secured to your lapel with a pin the flag was still attached to its pin which was buried in the sole of prentices shoe rory sucked his breath in when he saw it most of the pin must be inside the boys foot near the middle of the broadest part of the sole prentices foot and leg shuddered as he rolled on the grass its awful sore uncle rory he said voice trembling its just a wee pin rory said trying to sound encouraging ill have it out in a second he licked his lips rubbed his right index finger and thumb together for a couple of seconds and held prentices foot steady with his left hand he used the nails of his finger and thumb to find the head of the pin itself almost buried in the tan rubber sole of the sandshoe he grasped it prentice whimpered foot trembling in rorys grip rory gritted his teeth pulled the pin slid out an inch of it shining in the sunlight prentice cried out then relaxed rory put the boys foot down gently prentice sat up face quivering thats better he said he used one shirt sleeve to wipe at his face what was it this rory showed him the pin prentice grimaced ouch youre probably going to need a tetanus injection rory told him aw no more needles they took his shoe and sock off rory sucked at the tiny wound and spat trying to remove any dirt prentice eyes still watering laughed nervously is that not a horrible smell no uncle rory rory threw the boys white sock at him grinning ive been to india kid that aint nuthin prentice put his shoe and sock back on and got to his feet obviously in some pain when he stood here ill give you a carrycoalbag rory said turning his back to the boy and putting his arms out from his sides as he crouched really uncle rory you sure will i not be awful heavy hop on youre a beanpole laddie ill probably go faster with you on my back you walk too slow come on prentice put his arms round rorys neck and got up onto his back rory set off at a run prentice whooped see rory said slowing to a fast walk im not too heavy honest uncle rory what a skelf like you never do you think this is a punishment from god for talking about walking on a sunday uncle rory rory laughed certainly not do you not believe in god either uncle rory no well not in the christian god maybe something else he shrugged his shoulders and shifted prentice into a more comfortable position on his back when i was in india i thought then i knew what it was i might believe in but when i came back it all seemed to go away again i think it was something to do with the place he looked to one side at the dazzling expanse of machair endless emerald green scattered thick with flowers so bright they seemed lit from inside places have an effect on people they alter your thoughts india does anyway what about when you went to america did that effect what you thought rory laughed gently yeah it did that all right kind of in the opposite way though are you going to go away again i expect so prentice elapsed his hands in front of rorys chin rory glanced at his wrists thin and fragile looking prentice was still holding the little lifeboat flag twirling the pin between his fingers when did you stop believing in god prentice asked rory shrugged hard to say i think i started to think for myself when i was about your age maybe a bit younger oh i tried to imagine how the world had been created and i imagined sooty you know the glove puppet i know they still have him sooty and sweep prentice giggled well i imagined him standing on a wee planet about the size of a football but he hasnt got any legs ah but he did in the annuals i got for christmas anyway i imagined him waving a wand and the world came into existence like id been to church been to sunday school so i knew all the stuff in the bible but i guess i needed to envisage it see it in my own terms uhhuh but then i thought wait a minute where does the planet sootys standing on come from i thought sooty could have waved his wand and made that appear too but where would he stand while he was doing it i mean i didnt think well he could float in space and it never occurred to me to ask where sooty himself had come from or the wand but i was already heading towards not believing i suppose it was like the dragons dragons prentice said sounding excited and wary at once rory felt the boy tremble yeah rory said i used to hide under the covers of my bed at night imagining there were dragons out there in the room when the light was out when there was nobody else there id hunch down under the covers with just an airhole to breath through and shelter there the dragons couldnt get you through the airhole they could only get you if you put out a foot or a hand or worst of all your head that was when they struck bit it off or pulled you right out and ate all of you waa alien prentice said his arms squeezed rorys neck yeah rory said well i guess a lot of horror films come from that sort of background anyway i used to be petrified of these dragons even though i knew they probably didnt exist i mean i knew there was no santa claus and no fairies and elves but still thought ghosts and dragons were a possibility and it only took one to kill you i mean how did i really know i could trust adults even mum and dad there were so many things i didnt really understand about people about life most of the time you could just ignore a lot of the stuff you didnt know itd come in time youd be told when you needed to know but how did you know that there wasnt some big secret some big evil deal going down that involves you but had been kept secret from you like maybe your parents were just fattening you up until you would make a decent meal for these dragons or it was an intelligence test the kids smart enough to have sussed out the fact there were dragons around were the ones that would survive and the ones that just lay there trusting each night deserved to die and their parents couldnt tell them or the dragons would eat them and stories about dragons were the only clues you were ever given that was all the adults could do to warn you i was pretty paranoid about it i used to be frightened to fall asleep at night sometimes afraid id stick my head out from under the clothes while i was asleep and wake up to find my head in a dragons mouth before i died wow rory grunted shifting prentices weight again kid wasnt so featherlight after all but then one night under the covers i was just getting older i guess but anyway i was sort of reviewing the day and i was thinking about school and what wed learned and wed been doing the second world war and i hadnt liked the sound of this hitler guy at all and id asked dad just to doublecheck and so he was still alive when you were ten oh yeah didnt die until i was twelve anyway he brought down this book history of the war in pictures and it had like all these photos of the death camps where the nazis murdered millions of jews and communists and homosexuals and gypsies and anybody else they didnt like but mostly jews and there were like just piles of bodies incredibly thin bodies like bones skeletons wrapped with tissue paper and piled higher than a house and pits long pits full of bodies and the metal stretchers they were put onto to be shoved into the ovens and the piles of wedding rings and spectacles glasses and even artificial legs and weird stuff like that anyway that night they put a nightlight in my room in case i had nightmares but the shadows were even worse than the darkness and so i just lay there under the covers quivering with fear thanks to these damn dragons and i wished ken was back from university because sometimes i was allowed to sleep in his room and i wished i was allowed a torch in my room but wasnt and i was wondering about crying really loudly because that would bring mum and dad in to see me but then what did i say was wrong and then i suddenly thought the dragons might be there they might be real and they might be every bit as vicious as id imagined but im a human being so was adolf hitler and he killed millions of people and i threw back the bedclothes before i had any more time to think about it and burst out of the bed threw myself into the middle of the bedroom screaming and roaring and thrashing about ha prentice said squirming that brought mum and dad through thought i was having a fit or something but i just looked up from the carpet with this great big reassuring smile and said there was nothing to worry about rory smiled at the memory bringing his head up to look around a break in the dunes let the sound of surf grow louder there was a car in the distance coming towards them brilliant prentice said rory grunted shifting prentices weight once more never had any trouble with dragons after that ill bet you didnt the car hummed nearer as the view to one side slowly opened up through the dunes to reveal the shining beach and bluegreen ocean lets see if we can get a lift off this car eh rory said you okay to get down yeah prentice slid off onto the grass and stood there favouring his good leg while rory stretched and rubbed at his lower back he stuck one thumb out when the car was still a few hundred yards away prentice reached up and put something on the thin collar of rorys shirt it was the little paper lifeboat flag rory held his collar out so that he could look at it he looked down at the boys grinning face thanks he said thats your medal uncle rory prentice told him for being a brilliant uncle rory ruffled the boys hair thanks prentice he looked back at the car was it slowing i used to worry about darth vader prentice confessed putting his arm round rorys waist and lifting his foot to massage it with one hand id lie under the covers and make the noise he makes when hes breathing and then id stop but sometimes it would go on after id stopped prentice shook his head and slapped one hand off his forehead crazy eh rory laughed as the approaching car started to slow down yeah well thats what stories do to you sometimes your dads always tried never to tell you lies or stories that would scare you or make you superstitious but ha prentice said as the battered cortina ii drew to a stop just past them i remember he tried to tell us clouds came from the steam packet hotel in the town thats what they were packets of steam from the steam packet hotel ha rory smiled as they walked towards the car him supporting the limping boy rory looked away for a second towards the beach where the long atlantic rollers crashed against the broad expanse of gold he sniffed the glass the whisky was amber and there wasnt much of it the smell stung he put it to his lips hesitated then knocked it back in one go the drink made his lips and tongue tingle his throat felt sore and the fumes went up his nose and down into his lungs he tried very hard not to cough like hed seen people cough in westerns when they tried whisky for the first time and got away with just clearing his throat rather loudly he looked round at the curtains afraid somebody might have heard his eyes and nose were watering so he pulled his hanky from his trousers blew his nose the whisky tasted horrible and people drank this stuff for pleasure he had hoped that by trying some whisky hed understand adults a bit better instead they made even less sense he was standing between the curtains and the windows of the ballroom of the steam packet hotel on the railway pier at gallanach outside the afternoon was wet and miserablelooking and what little light there had been watery and grey was going now sheets of rain hauled in off the bay blew around the steamers and ferries moored round the windswept quay then collapsed upon the dark grey buildings of the town the street lamps were already lit and a few cars crawled through the roughmirror streets with their lights on and their wipers flapping to and fro music played behind rory he balanced the empty whisky glass on the windowsill and gave his nose a last wipe pocketing his hanky he supposed hed better go back into the ballroom ballroom he hated the word he hated the music they were playing highland stuff mostly he hated being here in this dull wet town with these dull people listening to their dull music at their dull wedding they should be playing the beatles or the rolling stones and they shouldnt be getting married in the first place modern people didnt heeeeyooch a voice shouted startlingly nearby making rory jump the curtains bowed in a few yards away almost touching the windowsill the movement like a wave rory could hear the stamping slapping feet move in time to the fiddles and accordions as they played a jig people were clapping shouting out god it was all so provincial rory straightened his tie and with his whisky still burning in his throat and now his stomach too he moved along to the gap in the curtains and slid through back into the ballroom where people sat drinking at long wooden tables and groups of dancers went whirling round in complicated everchanging patterns all flowing dresses and clasping hands and big red sweaty faces and white shirts and ties and narrow trousers or even worse kilts rory moved near the stage behind the tables where kenneth and mary sat talking to mum boring hamish and the horseresembling antonia were on the floor him in a kilt her still in her white bridal gown both dancing badly and out of time but seemingly thoroughly enjoying themselves well he heard his mum saying you two had better get a move on or hamish and antonia will beat you to it she laughed and drank from her glass she wore a hat rory hated his mother in a hat he thought she sounded drunk kenneth and mary smiled uncertainly at each other well mum kenneth said sitting back filling his pipe we have been practising kenneth his wife said quietly mum shook her head ah dont mind me plenty of time yet i dare say she looked into her empty glass i wouldnt be missing grandchildren so much but she shrugged there was an awkward silence between the three people then while the music played and the dancers whooped and shouted and clapped and stamped rory saw his mothers shoulders move once and she put her head down for a second sniffed she reached down for her handbag on the floor kenneth handed her his hanky he put his arm round his mums shoulders mary moved her seat closer reached out and took one of the older womans hands in hers god i miss that old devil mum said and blew her nose eyes bright with tears she looked at mary and then saw rory standing behind and to one side of them rory she said trying to sound all right we wondered where you were are you enjoying yourself darling yes he lied he hated her calling him darling he stayed where he was because he didnt want to get close enough for them to smell his breath his mother smiled good lad see if you can find your cousin sheila you said youd ask her to dance remember yeah all right he said turning away he didnt like boring cousin sheila either she was about the only girl here who was his own age it was horrible being this age when nobody else was they were all either adults or children he blamed his parents mostly he blamed his dad if hed looked after himself not had a heart attack hed still be around that was how thoughtless hed been rory supposed it was the same thoughtlessness that had made dad and mum have him so much later than the rest of their children people just didnt think that was the trouble he didnt go looking for sheila he decided to go wandering he would slip away he had always liked slipping away from things at parties he would just quietly leave when nobody was watching him so that only much later would anybody wonder where he was when he was out with a group of other kids playing kickthecan or soldiers he would often sneak away so that they would never find him or think he had fallen down a hole or into a burn or a loch it was a wonderful feeling to disappear like that it made him feel different and special he gloried in the cunningness of it the feeling of having outwitted the others of knowing what they did not that he was out and away and they were back there where hed left them ignorantly worrying where he was searching wondering he slunk out through the doors while they were clapping the band after finishing one of their noisy interminable highland dances it was cooler in the lobby he drew himself upright and walked confidently through the bit of the lobby that gave onto the cocktail lounge where ruddyfaced men stood panting and laughing sleeves rolled up ties loose queuing for drinks or holding trays of them laughing loudly in deep voices he went through another set of doors down some steps round a corner and found the hotels single small lift he pulled both sets of gates open with an effort entered then closed them again the lift was a little bigger than a phone box he pressed the brass button for the top floor the lift jerked into motion and set off humming the whitewashed walls of the lift shaft moved smoothly downwards as the lift ascended stencilled letters painted inside the shaft said st floor nd floor god he thought americans must think theyre in the stone age when they come to stay in a place like this he felt ashamed the top floor was boring he went from one end to the other of the ushaped hotel up and down steps that marked the boundaries of the three separate buildings that made up the steam packet hotel there were no windows only skylights each spattered with rain drops and lined with little rivulets of running water hed been hoping for windows and a view over the bay or the town he trod the corridors again looking for an unlocked door maybe the maids would have left some of the rooms open if there was nobody staying in them just now he tried a few handles the only open door led to a broom cupboard then at the next door he heard giggling he looked at the number it was room was a good number not as good as or but better than say and much better than though that was interesting too because it was a prime the very best numbers were numbers like and calibre numbers gun numbers those were luckiest but was all right more giggling he looked back down the corridor then crouched and looked through the keyhole it was a bit cliched but what did people expect in a boring hotel like this in a boring town like this in a boring country like this it was all you could do there was no key in the lock so he could see in through the big oldfashioned keyhole he saw a large dressing table sitting in a broad bay window the dressingtable held a big tippable mirror and most of the rest of the room was visible in it in the mirror rory saw his sister fiona and then fergus urvill they were making the big double bed fiona still wore her peachcoloured bridesmaids dress very long and smoothlooking there were flowers in her hair which made her look quite good rory suspected she looked so good because she didnt live here any more she lived in london and aunt ilsa had got her a job working for a television company fiona sold time to people that was how she put it she sold advertising space she sold time rory thought that sounded pretty interesting fergus urvill was on the other side of the bed dressed in a kilt shirt and waistcoat rory knew fergus was aged with kenneth but somehow he always seemed older maybe it was because he had gone to a private high school rory didnt really know fergus urvill very well although he did sometimes visit lochgair he spoke differently posher and seemed to spend a lot of his time shooting at birds and animals with other rich people rory had always found fergus urvill to be a little frightening kenneth had told him the story years ago about when fergus put lachy watts eye out hed stuck a fossil bone in it or something rory thought now that his brother must have exaggerated the story made it more horrific than it really had been and he certainly didnt believe that lachy had run away to sea just so that he could wear an eyepatch and pretend he was a pirate he had joined the merchant navy rory had asked dad about that but he had an artificial eye not a patch rory knew because hed been with mum once when theyd met lachy and a woman in the street in lochgilphead rory had looked very hard but hadnt been able to decide which was the false eye his own eye smarted exposed to the draft coming through the keyhole he blinked then used his other eye fiona and fergus were making the bed but doing it in a funny sort of way the bottom sheet had been doubled up halfway down the bed they were both chuckling to themselves and talking in quiet urgent whispers fiona glanced off to one side a couple of times rory worked out she was looking at the door he was crouched behind they made the bed up so that it looked ordinary rory got ready to run away down the corridor but they didnt leave the room instead fiona and fergus still breathless with giggles still chattering excitedly away started to turn the furniture in the room upside down they left the bed of course but they turned a table a chest of drawers two bedside cabinets two chairs and an easy chair upside down they carefully replaced lights and vases and other bits and pieces as they went along they stood before the dressing table for a while looking at it and discussing it apparently but eventually just turned it round so that it faced the wrong way rather than turn it upside down fiona leant back against the rear of the dressing table breathing hard and waved one hand wafting air over her face her cheeks were pink and a couple of coils of copper hair had fallen from her hairdo one on each side of her head she pulled at her bodice blew down went whoo rory couldnt see fergus urvill then he reappeared stood by fiona he was holding a key and a couple of toilet rolls he said something rory didnt catch oh no fiona said touching ferguss arm her face looked amused but concerned no thats naughty fergus stood there for a moment rory couldnt see his face but fionas looked glowing and bright i like being naughty he heard fergus say and then he stepped forward and took fiona in his arms still holding the key and the toilet rolls what thought rory this really was something sister fiona and big fergus urvill stupid girl probably only after her body ferg fiona said breaking away her face looked surprised cheeks even redder she smiled broadly held ferguss elbows well this is unexpected ive always fergus lowered his voice as he bent to kiss her again face in her hair and then his mouth on hers rory missed the exact words go on thought rory go on do it let me see ferguss hands dropped the key and the toilet rolls grabbed fionas bum she pushed away from him ferg she said breathless lipstick smeared fiona fergus moaned clutching her i want you i need you well fiona said gulping thats very ah but not here eh fergus pulled her close again let me drive you home tonight umm well i think we were getting a taxi please let me please fiona you dont know fergus stuck his nose into her hair again made a sort of moaning noise feel me and he guided one of fionas hands to the front of his kilt good god thought rory he took another quick glance down the hall then looked back through the keyhole fiona took her hand away hmm yes actually i already could fergus i need you he pulled her close again not here fergus fiona please all right all right fergus ill try well see okay yes yes thank you fergus gathered fionas hands in his right she laughed well come on lets get out of here before the happy couple arrive put those back in the loo she pointed at the toilet rolls fergus retrieved them she busied herself with her hair restoring it fergus turned and disappeared from rorys view and put some cold water on that fiona said grinning looks like your sporrans trying to levitate she came towards the door rory leapt back staggered on legs that had gone half to sleep and only just scrambled into the broom cupboard and got the door shut before the bedroom door opened the broom cupboard keyhole didnt let him see anything he heard muffled conversation but no footsteps he waited breathless heart hammering in the darkness one hand in his trouser pocket stroking himself do you know where the twins were conceived no idea he said and belched fucking mccaigs folly thats where what oban the very place good grief you dont mind me saying this i mean talking about fiona like this do you no no he waved one hand your wife you talk about her no no thats bad that sounds bad im all for womens lib might have bloody known might have bloody known you would be bloody typical if you ask me youre a bolshie bastard mchoan and you are the unacceptable face of capitalism ferg dont quote that fairy at me you bolshie bastard and dont call me ferg beg your pardon some more whisky dont mind if i do rory got up out of the creaking wooden seat and walked unsteadily over to where fergus lay on the bare wooden floorboards head against the ancient burst couch the fire crackled in the grate its light competing with that of the little gas lamp rory unscrewed the top from the bottle of bells carefully and topped up ferguss little silver cup fergus had brought a leather case with him it held three of the silver cups and a big hip flask rory had brought the bottle in his rucksack there you go ta much youre a decent fellow for a bolshie bastard one tries old bean rory said he walked carefully to his seat picked his little cup up from the floor and went to the rooms single window it was black outside there had been a moon when theyd first arrived but the clouds had come while they were chopping wood and the rain while theyd cooked dinner on the two little primus stoves he turned from the darkness fergus looked like he was almost asleep he was dressed in plus fours tweed waistcoat the jacket and his waxed barbour were hanging behind the door of the bothy thick socks brogues and a fawn country shirt with a buttondown collar god he even had his tie on still rory wore cords mountainhiking boots and a plain ms shirt his nylon waterproofs were draped over a chair what an odd pair we make he thought he had been back from his travels for a while staying first in london then at lochgair while he tried to work out what to do with his life he had the impression things were sliding past him somehow hed made a good start but now he was faltering and the focus of attention was drifting slowly away from him he had returned to discover that like his brother before him ken had given up being a teacher hamish had taken up the managerial place at the factory that everyone had expected would be kenneths when kenneth had decided to teach now ken too was quitting the profession to try something else writing childrens stories rory had always thought of hamish as a sort of ponderously eccentric fool and ken a kind of failure because he had so much wanted to travel and instead had settled down with mary stayed in the same wee corner of the world as hed been born and raised in and not only raised his own children but chosen to teach others too rory had felt slightly sorry for his elder brother then now he felt envious ken seemed happy happy with his wife with his children and now with his work not rich but doing what he wanted to do and why hadnt ken told him he was writing too he might have been able to help him but even if ken had wanted to do it all without any assistance from his younger brother he might at least have told him what he was doing instead rory had found out only when ken had had his first story published and now it was as though they were passing each other travelling in opposite directions ken slowly but surely building up a reputation as a childrens storyteller while his own supposed career as a professional recounter of travellers tales sank gradually in the west books people forgot about and articles in sunday supplements that were only one notch above the sort of shit tourist boards put out and so hed left london to come here hoping to lick the closing wise wound of whatever talent it was he had hed spent a lot of time just wandering in the hills sometimes ken came too or one of the boys if they were in the mood but mostly he went by himself trying to sort himself out what it boiled down to was there was here where he had friends and family or there was london where he had a few friends and a lot of contacts and it felt like things were happening and where you could fill time with something no matter how mixed up and fraudulent you felt or there was abroad of course the rest of the world india to take the most extreme example hed found so far where you felt like an alien lumbering and selfconscious materially far more rich and spiritually far more poor than the people who thronged the place where just by that intensity of touching that very sweating crowdedness you felt more apart more consigned to a different echoing place inside yourself one day on a long walk hed almost literally bumped into fergus urvill crouching in a hide up amongst the folds in the hills waiting with telescope and for a wounded sika deer fergus had motioned him to sit down with him behind the hide and to keep quiet rory had waited with the older man silent for quarter of an hour apart from a whispered hello and a quick explanation of what was going on until the herd of deer appeared brown shapes on the brown hill one animal was holding the rest back limping heavily fergus waited until the herd was as close as it looked like it was going to come then sighted on the limping beast still two hundred yards away the sound of the shot left rorys ears ringing the sikas head jerked it dropped to its knees and keeled over the rest raced off bouncing across the heather he helped fergus drag the small corpse down the slope to the track where the land rover was parked and accepted a lift back to the road hardly recognised you roderick fergus said as he drove not seen you since fi and i got shackled must be at least that long ive been away of course your travels ive got that india book of yours you know ah rory watched the trees slide past the land rovers windows done any others there was one about the states and mexico last year really fergus looked over at him briefly i didnt hear about that rory smiled thinly no he said fergus made a grunting noise changed gear as they bumped down the track towards the main road ken said something about you living in a squat in london or something ridiculous like that that right housing cooperative ahha fergus drove on for a while always wanted to take a look at india myself you know he said suddenly keep meaning to go never quite get around to it know what i mean well it isnt the sort of place you can just take a look at no not really the land rover came down to the main road between lochgilphead and lochgair look weve got a do on this evening in the town fergus glanced at his watch bit late already to tell the truth but how about coming round tomorrow for in fact dyou fish fish yeah i used to not against your vegetarian principles is it no india didnt change me that much well then come fishing with me tomorrow pool on the add with a monster trout in it been after the swine for months plenty of smaller stuff too though fancy it course ill never talk to you again if you catch the big feller but might make a fun afternoon what do you say okay he said so they became friends after a fashion most of rorys pals in london were in the international marxist group but here he was wandering the hills with an upper class dingbat who just happened to be married to his sister and who lived for huntin shootin and fishin and seemed to spend the absolute minimum amount of time in his castle with his wife and who had just last year rationalised half the work force in the glass factory out of a job still they got on together somehow and fergus was an undemanding companion company of a sort but not taxing none of kens garrulousness lewiss moodiness or prentice or jamess ceaseless questioning it was almost like walking the hills on your own and a couple of days ago fergus had suggested they go for a longer hike up into the trackless hills where the landy couldnt reach they would take collapsible rods a couple of guns and have to fish and shoot to eat they could stay in the old lodge it would save taking a tent so here they were on the first floor of the old lodge which was now used just as a bothy the room they were in contained a single big dormer window a fireplace a couch a table and two seats and two bunkbeds there were other rooms with more beds but keeping to one room meant only lighting one fire the autumn weather had turned chilly early no fergus said looking up from where he lay slumped against the couch but you dont mind me talking about fiona like this do you i mean your sister my wife you sure you dont mind do you positive good man mccaigs folly eh hmm oh well yes at least i think so got the idea from charlotte actually what your sister mmm the one that married that chap walker from edinburgh oh yeah i remember rory went over to the seat that held his jacket funny girl charlie had this thing about antiquity got walker to deflower her under this ancient fucking yew tree in perthshire so she told me anyway uhhuh rory rummaged in his jacket pockets fiona and i thought wed try something like that one time we were in oban for some do you know put a bit of sparkle back in you sure you dont mind me talking about your sister like this yeah rory took his tobacco tin from the jacket he held the tin up as long as you dont mind me having a little smoke not at all not at all bloody cold it was in that damn folly had to sit on a ohfergus said suddenly realising you mean the old wacky baccy rory smiled sat down thats the stuff not at all fergus said waving one hand go ahead he watched carefully as rory set out the papers mmm go ahead rory looked up saw ferguss fascinated expression do you want any of this fergus umm fergus said sitting back blinking could do i suppose never really tried it to be honest couple of chaps at the school got booted out for that stuff and i never did get round to it well im not forcing you not at all not at all they smoked the joint fergus used to the occasional cigar with his brandy now that hed given up his pipe pronounced the smoke quite cool and objected more to the sweet taste of the old holborn than to the scent of resin this any good for hankypanky he said passing the roach back to rory who took a last hot toke then flicked the remains into the heart of the fire can be he said might try it some time god knows we could do with something to look you absolutely sure you dont mind me talking about your sister this way positive good man hey did you hear that rory looked up at the ceiling fergus was staring at the plasterboard expanse above them rory listened then above the crackling of the fire he did hear something a quiet scrabbling noise in the roofspace above them rats ill bet fergus said and rolled over to his pack rory thought about it they were here in a deserted old house in the middle of nowhere on a black and starless night in one of the more mysterious bits of scotland and there was a scrabbling clawy sort of noise coming from the ceiling above him and this other drunk stoned man he shrugged yeah probably rats or mice or birds fergus pulled his pack gently to him scraping over the floorboards he lifted the rucksack up the and the shotgun were in a waterproof bag strapped to the side of the pack fergus undid the straps ssh he said to rory rory had started building another joint he waved he drank some more whisky he was just inserting the roach when fergus rolled over to him and held the shotgun out to him here he whispered urgently hmm rory said nodding thanks he heard some clicks fergus held the ancient lee enfield at his side he knelt close by rory think the little bastards over there he pointed he reached up touched the gun rory held it was hard doing the roach one handed put that down man fergus hissed he took the tin from rorys lap and put all the makings down on the floor rory felt peeved there fergus said safetys off when i fire aim where i do all right yup rory said forgetting about the j he took the shotgun fergus walked on his heels still hunkered down across the room eyes and gun pointed towards the plasterboard ceiling he stopped there was a noise like a spider running across a very sensitive microphone bang went the rifle rory almost dropped the shotgun there yelled fergus plaster was falling from a small hole in the ceiling there was smoke in the air rory aimed at the small hole pulled the trigger the gun struck back against his shoulder sending him falling back off his seat he clattered to the floor well pump it man pump it he heard fergus shouting from somewhere awful lot of smoke around ears seemed to be ringing he pumped the gun funny hed have thought fergus would have been a sidebyside man there was another sharp crack of sound from the he saw the hole appear in the plaster almost right above him great he could get the little bastard without having to get up from the floor the floorboards ought to provide extra firing stability too he pulled the trigger again the gun went blam with a little less sonic enthusiasm than before though it hurt his shoulder a little more a white waterfall of plaster burst down from the ceiling and slapped and pattered all over him rory spat bits out of his mouth blinked the white dust out of his eyes he heard fergus colliding with something in the room he pumped the gun looked round fergus was lying on the couch aiming at the centre of the ceiling he fired the lee enfield again rory was getting the hang of this now and aimed the shotgun at the same place and fired it almost before the noise of ferguss shot had stopped echoing the room was getting a bit hazy and there was probably blood coming from his ears but what the fuck rory readied the gun again he tried to follow where fergus was pointing his rifle as he did so still lying there with his legs up on the chair hed fallen over he started to overbalance to one side towards fergus aah rory said he tried to put one hand out to stop himself but the gun was still in his grip the long blueblack barrel arced towards fergus fergus looked as rory fell helplessly over the gun barrel falling like some felled tree wide muzzle pointed straight towards him rory could tell exactly what was going to happen and couldnt stop it ferguss eyes widened he jumped fell over the back of the couch rory fell onto his side the shotgun roared and the rear of the couch blew open in a dusty horsehair explosion rory let the gun down to the floor the noise still rang in his ears the room stank of smoke and the fire had gone strangely quiet ferg he said tentatively couldnt hear himself speak ferg he shouted he sat upright leaving the gun on the floorboards plaster tumbled off his body in clouds of dust hello fergus said appearing over the top of the couch gunless rory looked at him they both blinked eyes watering did we get it rory asked dont know fergus said he staggered round the rear of the couch feet crunching in plaster and sat down he looked at the still slightly smoking hole in the couch just beside where hed sat then up at the holes in the ceiling he stayed looking at the holes in the ceiling for a while then he started crying rory watched for a while befuddled whats the matter man he said fergus took no notice he kept on crying still staring up at the holes in the ceiling he took big lungfuls of air and then let them out in great racking sobs that shook his whole body after a while he put his head in his hands and sat there rocking back and forward clutching his hair just above his ears the tears flowed trickling off his nose and spotting the white plaster dust on the floorboards at his feet ferg rory said going over to him he hesitated then put his arm on the mans shoulders fergus for gods sake man whats wrong fergus looked up and suddenly rory felt older than him ferguss heavy ruddy face was puffed and bloated and tears had streaked through the dust on his cheeks disappearing in the bristles on his jawline and chin when he spoke it was in the voice of a small hurt boy oh god rory ive got to tell somebody but you must promise you must give me your word you wont breathe a word to anybody else on your life hey you havent killed anybody or anything have you no fergus shook his head screwed his eyes up no nothing like that its not something i did okay my word all that stuff fergus looked at him and rory shivered you swear fergus said voice hollow rory nodded i swear he felt dizzy the smokefilled room seemed to tip and waver he wondered if they put something trippy in shotgun or rifle cartridges and why did i mention killing somebody that wasnt too sensible way out here on this moonless night etc with a couple of lethal firearms lying around all right fergus said sitting back breathing deeply he looked almost soberly at rory you sure you dont mind me talking about your sister he said slowly with what might have been some sort of smile on his face oh god thought rory and felt sick but it was too late to go back now the way he told it it took maybe five minutes fergus urvill was crying like a baby again at the end of it rory cuddled him and after as many tender words as he could think of to try and lighten the load to try and make it seem less of a confession even to try and compensate for the shared and shaming confidence he told fergus that he had been responsible for the fire that had burned down the barn near port ann fifteen years earlier they ended up laughing about that but it was the uneasy laughter of desperation and displacement and all they could do after that was finish the whisky and have the joint rory had been working on and it was almost a relief when fergus was sick as a dog out of the window hanging out barfing onto the slates and into the guttering while rory tried to clean the plaster off the top bunk and stowed the guns out of harms way they woke with raging hangovers to a wrecked room and the smell of black powder and vomit there was a dead rat blown almost in two resting on the hearth of the fire they left the place as it was picked up their gear and walked away neither of them mentioned anything that had been said during the night they just agreed to head back to civilisation and not to mix whisky and cannabis like that again there were no more huntin shootin and fishin trips rory went back to live in london that winter and ended up funnily enough living in a squat he wrote poems chapter the train sat wrapped in rain and rocked by gusts waiting to join the main line sidelined again i watched the cold wind flatten the grubbylooking grass of a weedy field outside springburn a man walked across the field some mongrel dog padding ahead of him two paths crossed the rectangular field forming a neat st andrews cross of downtrodden grass the dog stopped to sniff at something in the grass then squatted urinating the man following behind was dressed in cheap looking jeans and a donkey jacket there was a bonnet perched on his head and his hands were stuffed in his pockets he walked up behind the dog and kicked its arse the animal loped away putting more distance between them then resumed its casual padding walk along the path it was getting dark street lights were starting to come on in the distance crimson slivers slowly brightening to orange i looked at my watch wed been stuck here waiting to join the main line into queen street for about ten minutes you often had to wait here while the edinburgh trains came and went but the delay didnt usually last this long the station was only five minutes away more importantly food was only five minutes away id forgone breakfast because i hadnt got to bed till four in the morning lunch because i had a hangover and anyway i was late for the train and due to the fact that it was according to british rail at any rate still part of the extended festive period there had been no buffet trolley on the train i was starving i was so hungry id have eaten pork scratchings queen street station a scant mile and a half away had burgers sandwiches shell pies french fries and french sticks bridies and pasties and patties my god if all they had were haggisburgers id eat those ladies and gentulmun crackled a gruff glaswegian voice from the carriage loudspeakers my heart sank the perfect end to a perfect holiday due to a signalling failure i looked out of the windshaken carriage where people were moaning and cursing and making vows to start going by bus or take the car next time or buy a car or learn to drive looked out through the rainspattered sheets of glass watching the cold january day leach out of the grey skies above the drenched city and witnessed the rain fall upon the trampedon pissedon shaton grass of the narrow path in the scrubby field with a feeling of wry but nevertheless wretched empathy god what did any of it matter in the end you lived you died you were as indistinguishable from a distance as one of these blades of grass and who was to say more important growing surrounded by your kin you outliving some some outliving you you didnt have to adjust the scale much either to reduce us to the sort of distant irrelevance of this bedraggled field the grass was lucky if it grew was shone upon and rained upon and was not burned and was not pulled up by the roots or poisoned or buried when the ground was turned over and some bits just happened to be on a line that humans wanted to walk on and so got trampled broken pressed flat with no malice just effect and intelligence control there were things that we had no more control over yet than the grass did over the developer who chose to plough it all under and build a factory on top perhaps some asteroid nudged out of its place in the great gravitational gavotte would fall to earth a bullet into a face obliterating unwitnessed for what would be visible from even a nearby star a blink of flame like a match struck beside a searchlight and then nothing but didnt there have to be something out there just to witness just to know hell it didnt even have to do anything it didnt have to act on prayers or have us singled out as a special species or play any part in our history and development it didnt even necessarily have to have created us or created anything all it had to do was exist and have existed and go on existing to record to encompass i watched as the rain battered the grass and the wind pummelled it quick gusts flattening patches of the field like sudden bruises beneath the dull sky i could just imagine my father jumping up and down on this argument this need for meaning for faith the train jerked i started too shaken from my reverie then the train went into reverse motors growling occupants groaning and trundled slowly back through the squalls of rain passing maryhill and looping down through anniesland and over great western road we paralleled crow road for a bit and stopped waiting for signals outside jordanhill station i looked up at the rear of the flats which fronted crow road trying to work out which was janice raes i thought of uncle rory then remembered that i had some more of his papers with me and a load of his poems mum had found them for me in the house at lochgair i got my bag down from the rack uncle rory could not be more depressing than reality was just now any hope i might have entertained that lewis and veritys little hogmanay hug had been an aberration something they would fail to follow through or feel for some reason embarrassed about was comprehensively quashed the next evening when they turned up together at uncle hamish and aunt tones bearing all the signs of new lovers literally so in the case of lewiss neck which displayed a line of passion purpurae worthy of an industrial vacuum cleaner and which were illconcealed by lewiss longish dark curls and a white shirt fastened with a bootlace tie lewis and verity kept exchanging looks laughing at anything even remotely amusing each other said sitting close together finding a hundred small excuses to touch each other i wanted to throw up we had all gathered for hamish and tones traditional neerday partyette a necessarily quietish affair during which people exchanged tales of drunkenness broken resolutions and recipes for hangover cures as well as taking advantage of the opportunity to compare notes regarding blank spots in the memories of any of the assembled penitents i was helping aunt tone prepare stuff in the kitchen but had to give up when lewis and verity volunteered to assist as well and then spent most of the time feeding one another little bits of food goosing each other and going into sardinelyintimate huddles punctuated by low whispers bursts of baboonlike giggles and convincingly porcine snorts i went through to the diningroom and helped myself to a pint of the neuronfriendly punch uncle hamish always made for the event mum and dad turned up later there were about twenty of us all told mostly mchoans but with a smattering of civilians we sipped or in my case gulped the weak but tasty punch nibbled on aunt tones buffetbits and played alternative charades an invention of my fathers in which one first has to guess the category of the thing one is being asked to decipher when it was my turn to mime i tended to concentrate on popular communicable diseases wellknown poisons famous mass murderers and great natural disasters my last memory is of trying to mime kare disorders preparatory to attempting toxic shock syndrome but apparently people insisted that one stand up to do ones piece and i successfully acclimatised to the horizontal by this time refused to pander to this sort of nitpicking and so passed my turn on to cousin josh with as much good grace as i could muster the congenitally oddjeaned person to my left will take my place i mumbled waving one hand in his direction before letting my head resume its communion with hamish and tones lounge carpet the bit about odd jeans was totally accurate by the way cousin josh made his fortune firstly by dealing in cars then by risking all on a jeans company which at the time was tottering on the very hem of bankruptcy under joshs regime their jeans werent any better or any cheaper than anybody elses but he had the garments made in odd sizes waists of inches and so on as opposed to the products from all other companies domestic and foreign which tended to favour the even numbers it was one of those brilliantly simple ideas people always wish they had had themselves and believe that somehow they could have had no need to incur any extra expense or make any more sizes than anybody else or necessarily to distinguish ones product in other way yet just by the idea one has a potential market of half the jeansbuying public or at least that proportion of it which has always felt that they are somehow perpetually between the usual sizes i vaguely remember dreaming about veritys jeans that night how graphically geographically tight they were and how wonderful it must be to take them off her then i imagined lewis boots tied round his neck for some reason suddenly resembling shane macgowan skinning her jeans off not me and he turned into rodney ritchie at home with his parents unpicking the individual stitches of her jeans with a tiny knife and the ritchies all wore badlyfitting jeans and had denim curtains and denim carpets and denim light shades and denim wallpaper with the little rivets left on like poppers so you could just press paintings and photos onto the wall except that mr ritchie looked like claude lévistrauss which is when i think i started to get confused either i had been put to bed i thought as i woke up next morning in the wee cold room at the top of the house or my standard drunkpersons onboard autopilot facility was improving with experience i bathed dressed and broke my fast with some leftovers from the fridge a pint of water and a couple of brace of paracetamol all without encountering anybody else in the house it was only eight oclock obviously id conked out some time before everybody else and they were still asleep i had heard appropriate logsawinglike noises coming from hamish and tones room on my way back from the bathroom the day looked bright but cold i laced up the docs and went for a walk in the hills behind gallanach i felt like shit and i was trying so hard not to think of lewis and verity that i couldnt think about anything else but the day was fabulous clear and cold the sky crystal blue and reflecting in the waters of hillcupped lochans and the glinting length of loch add on such days the hills hold a mixture of azure and gold never seen at any other time of year the cobalt sky is more intense than it ever is in summer and the strawcoloured hills shine strong in the light from the low winter sun against the shifting mirror that is the surface of a loch the colours shimmer and dance they take your breath away and for a brief relieving while they can even take your thoughts away up in the hills at the place of marching water i found ashley watt and one of her more exotic cousins the concrete spillway below the loch add reservoir comes down to a stepped slope above the confluence of several small burns draining nearby slopes a short bridge carries the track over the spillway and that was where ashley and aline were sitting legs dangling over the stream in the concrete gully arms resting on the lower bar of the bridge rails they were sitting side by side watching the marching water what happened was that the water first backed up behind the lipped edge of the top step then overflowed and spilled with increasing force in a sort of hydrochainreaction down each subsequent step to the bottom of the channel there followed a period of comparative quiet while the water built up again behind the top step and those beneath you might guess it was my dad who first pointed out this odd and classically chaotic phenomenon and brought it to the attention of us kids none of us had ever been able to discover whether it was a deliberate effect or the result of pure chance whatever it was wonderfully restful unpredictable and therapeutic hey prentice ash said she looked a little worn and blearyeyed though her long lioncoloured hair shone like health itself in the brassy sunlight of midday hi i nodded to her and to aline who was francovietnamese and engaged to hugh watt one of ashleys multitudinous cousins from the branch of the family that seemed to favour consorts of an exotic provenance hughs brother craig was going out with a stunning lanky nigerian called noor aline looked even smaller and blackerhaired than usual beside ashley aline ça va magic prentice aline replied in fluent glaswegian have some skoosh ash said as i sat down next to her she reached between her and aline and handed me a halffinished bottle of irnbru i had over the course of the morning already gulped down about a gallon of teethachingly cold streamwater at various points up in the hills but the traditional scottish hangover treatment was probably just what i needed i took a couple of mouthfuls handed the bottle back wiping my lips you look terrible ash said feel worse i said glumly watching the water cascade down the concrete staircase of the spillway lost track of you at the urvills party prentice ashley said you just slope off or did you get a lumber oh god i moaned and lowered my head to the cool steel pipe of the bridge rail hey ash said gently putting her hand on my head and patting me there there prentice ma man whats the matter oh nothing much i sighed slowly raising my head again and gazing at the water i saw the woman i love wrap herself round my older smarter and wittier brother like clingfilm round a sandwich and it looks like theyre enjoying each other the way oh god im so pissed off i cant even think of a decent comparison or even an indecent one which would probably certainly be more to the point part from that everything okay aye ash said putting her arm round my shoulders help me ashley i said closing my eyes and putting my head on her shoulder what am i to do you must think of her on the toilet aline said and giggled offwhite woman speak truth ash said lowering her head to rest it on mine the hots rarely survive an intense course of imagining the beloved on the cludgie no i sighed opening my eyes as a series of splashes announced another chaotic event on the spillway id probably only develop a fetish for coprophagy pardon that as unpleasant as it sounds unpleasanter merde yup youre a hopeless case prentice so you are have you contemplated suicide yeah soon as its finished im going to throw myself off the channel tunnel ashleys shoulders moved once under my head plenty of time to set your affairs in order then its not my affairs im concerned with ach she wasnt your sort anyway prentice what you mean not good enough for me no prentice i mean too much taste you never stood a chance with a woman that choosy i pulled away and looked dubiously at ashley who smiled sweetly what is this i said you auditioning for the exit chapter of the samaritans or what ashley took my hands in hers ah prentice dinnae worry maybe its just an infatuation hers or lewiss or yours whatever maybe shell come to her senses maybe she wants to work her way through all the mchoan brothers in order of age or weight or weight maybe shell get married to lewis but have a lifelong affair with you oh great see you dont know what might happen ashley said happily spreading her hands anyway prentice aline said in her singsong voice there are plenty more fishes in the sea yes i looked over at aline hey can i quote you on that aline winked at me tapped the side of her nose the toilet said conspiratorially i started to get up its no good i sighed you two are cheering me up too much and i cant stand the excitement i got wearily my feet muscles aching from the effects of drink and walk see you down the jac tonight ash said maybe i said i keep trying to drown my sorrows but they appear to be marginally more buoyant than expanded polystyrene the water cascaded down the face of the spillway again the noise like a million stamping feet heard from a long way off i shrugged fuck it though worth another try gotta start working some time thats my boy see you gals byebye prentice try not to fall in love with anybody else before tonight yo an hour or so later i saw my mothers green metro just about to turn out of the driveway of hamish and tones house she stopped when she saw me wound the window down here you are she said here i am i agreed i was waiting for ages there she glanced at her watch oh well getting in i got into the car we started to reverse the fifty yards back up the drive actually my legs were so tired i was quite grateful for the lift i brought what i could find of rorys stuff mum nodded your dad thinks theres more but its buried in the filing i looked at the back seat where a folder lay not that you deserve it she added oh thanks i said i picked the folder up crii said the lettering on the spine it looked similar to the folder i already had but perhaps a little thicker i vaguely remembered reminding mum last night that i was looking for the rest of uncle rorys papers well she said i looked over yawning well i repeated we drew to a stop outside the door of the house you dont remember last night do you mum said turning the ignition off she was dressed in angoraand chunky cords new perfume she looked slightly unamused and not a little worried not in its entirety no i confessed she shook her head god you were drunk prentice umm i said weighing the folder in my hands yes i smiled my best but im still your wee laddy smile she raised those delicate brown brows my god you dont remember embarrassing lewis and verity last night do you i looked at her i mean apart from embarrassing your father and me she added i felt the blood draining from my face like somebody had opened a valve in my ankle ohoh i swallowed i wasnt doing my impression of the bradford city supporter the kings cross disaster victim and the guy from piper alpha meeting up in hell was i requires three cigarettes offends everybody its not funny prentice poor verity was nearly in tears youre lucky lewis didnt throttle you oh my god i said feeling cold what did i say duck and cover told her told everybody you were madly in love with her she said eyes flashing then having declared undying worship of the poor girl you proceeded to slag her off for taking up with lewis mum shook her head angrily tears in her eyes prentice what were you thinking of oh my god i moaned kyag i put the folder down in my lap and put my forehead on the folder then you followed that up with some fairly offcolour remarks about lapland and what you referred to i believe as the old earthmoving equipment oh my god and i think we all successfully worked out what doing the delta foxtrot was as well before you became totally incoherent oh my god i dont think saying oh my god will make it any better prentice i think you should apologise to verity and lewis as soon as you can theyre up at the castle my mother brought her voice under control with an effort though you might also think about saying sorry to hamish and antonia too as you were their guest and it was their party you brought grinding to an embarrassing halt just as well you agreed to go quietly when kenneth suggested it was time you went to bed though apparently he and hamish practically had to carry you upstairs and the whole way up you were muttering something vile about lewis being thrown naked into a tub of starving elephant leeches and dad put me to bed oh no dad and the tree the shame of it mum i want to die i mumbled into the folder just at the moment prentice i dont think thered be any shortage of volunteers to help you on your way if you were serious i am stop being melodramatic prentice it doesnt suit you sarcasms more your forte oh my god prentice mum said putting her hand on my head and running her fingers through my hair prentice i looked up straightened mums eyes looked red she shook her head prentice why are you so stupid with your cleverness sometimes i took a deep breath wish i knew mum i said and sniffed eyes smarting best not to say anything about it running in the family she took me in her arms hugged me i was surprised as i always was at such moments how slim and small she felt after a bit we let go of each other she glanced in the mirror and declared i had wrecked her eyes for the rest of the day then we went in to hamish and tones for tea and apologies and later drove to the castle for what would have been the most excruciating interval of my life if verity and lewis had still been there but they werent they had taken off in the car to visit some friends of veritys who lived in ardnamurchan and wouldnt be back until late tomorrow at the earliest mum took me back chez hamish and tone she agreed to pass on my expressions of contrition to my father shed wanted me to come to lochgair and say sorry to him there but i had begged for mercy and rather to my surprise been granted it i had already decided that tomorrow i would take the train back to what was now your official european city of culture for the following twelve months in theory verity and lewis were meant to be giving me a lift in four days time but that was obviously out now i had to promise mum id write to each of them and apologise in person at the first possible opportunity and also that id stop off at lochgair before i returned to glasgow to see dad ashley met me in the jac that night listened to my woes bought me drink when i ran out of money im sure i was shortchanged at the bar even though she probably had less dosh than i did and listened to my woes all over again when we went back to her mums and sat up till god knows when talking low so we wouldnt wake dean in the next room she made me coffee gave me hugs and at one point i fell asleep and was at peace for a while and woke up sprawled on the floor my head on her lap one gentle hand stroking my head ash i croaked youre a saint she just smiled a last cup of coffee and i left back to h and ts in time for a few hours fitful sleep then up and away run to the station by aunt antonia i only just caught the train and when a quarter of an hour later we pulled in to lochgair and i should have got my bag and quit the sprinter and walked to the house and finally have talked sober and not in the context of a game of alternative charades to my father and apologised and spent the three hours until the next glasgow train with my mother and father in some longedfor spirit of reconciliation i did nothing of the sort instead i put my head to one side so that it rested against the cold glass of the window closed my eyes and let my mouth hang open a little i stayed like that for the minute or so we waited at the lochgair station platform and didnt stir again yawning convincingly for any other passengers who might be watching until we were crossing the viaduct at succothmore still stuck on the track within sight of janice raes flat i got up out of my seat took down my bag and fished out the file mum had brought from the house i found some muchtippexed poems typed on foolscap plus about twenty or so printed a pages which looked like they were part of a play or film script selected a page at random and started reading lord and i see them as they will be dead and torn shocked mutilated and alone on battlefields or by long roads in ditches or against high walls in echoing white corridors and misty woods in fields by rivers dumped in holes thrown in piles neglected and absolved or if living on filled with petty bitter memories and a longing for the war they fought to end oh captain i see in this my ending what i think you didnt start to glimpse with your most cunning intuition the soldiers are always the real refugees their first victim is themselves their life taken from them well before as though seeking a replacement from another freed but i couldnt take any more i put the papers in the folder and the folder in my bag then stuffed that under my seat i looked out at the rain instead it was cheerier id avoided stopping off to see mum and dad it made my eyes close every time i thought about it what was wrong with me well i thought they made me they produced me their genes and they brought me up school and university still hadnt changed me as much as they had maybe even the rest of my life could never compensate for their formative effect if i was too embarrassed too full of shame to go and see them it wasnt just my fault it was theirs too because of the way theyd brought me up god i thought id stopped using that excuse when i left lochgair primary school but there was a grain of truth in there wasnt there and hell i thought i had been tired i was tired still and i would phone that evening definitely and say id fallen asleep and nobody would be too bothered and after all a chap could only cope with so much sorrowsaying in one day of course id phone a bit of soft soap a bit of flannel like dad would say no sweat i could charm them id make everything all right still it was the hangover of that piece of moral cowardice at lochgair station along with everything else that led to me feeling so profoundly awful with myself that evening after the train finally did get into queen street and i walked back soaked and somehow no longer hungry in the rain to the empty flat in grant street that mum had to call me there because i hadnt been able to bring myself to phone her and dad and i still managed to feign sleep and a little shame and a smattering of sorrow and reassure her as best i could that really i was all right yes of course not to worry i was fine thanks for calling and so of course after that felt even worse i made a cup of coffee i was feeling so bad that i treated it as a kind of moral victory that i was able to empty most of the water out of the obviously gavfilled kettle and leave the level at the minimum mark i stood in the kitchen waiting for the water to heat up with a distinct feeling of ecosmugness it was just as i was sitting down in the living room with my cup of coffee that i realised id left my bag on the train i couldnt believe it i remembered getting out of my seat putting on my jacket wondering about trying to get something to eat deciding i didnt feel hungry glancing at the empty luggage rack and then heading through the station and up the road with no bag how could i i put the coffee down leapt out of my chair and over the couch ran to the phone and got through ten minutes later to the station lost property was closed call tomorrow i lay in bed that night trying to remember what had been in the bag clothes toiletries one or two books a couple of presents and the folder with uncle rorys papers in it both folders including the one i hadnt read yet no i told myself as panic tried to set in it was inconceivable that id lost the bag forever it would turn up i had always been lucky that way people were generally good even if somebody had picked it up maybe they had done so by mistake but probably a guard had spotted it and it was right now sitting in some staffroom in queen street station or gallanach or maybe in a siding only a mile or two from where i lay a cleaners brush was at this moment encountering the bag wedged back under the seat but id get it back it couldnt just disappear it had to find its way back to me it had to i got to sleep eventually i dreamt of uncle rory coming home driving the old rover verity had been born in the window open his arm sticking out him smiling and holding the missing folder in his hand waving it in the dream he had a funny looking white towel wrapped round his neck and that was when i woke up and remembered my white silk scarf the irreplaceable mobius scarf the gift of darren watt had been in the missing bag as well noooo i wailed into the pillow waking up was a process of gradually remembering all the things i had to feel bad about i rang lost property first thing no bag i got them to give me the number for the cleaners messroom and asked there no bag i tried gallanach in case the train had got back there before the bag had been discovered under the seat by some honest person no bag i tried both stations again in the afternoon guess what i did the only thing i could think of and retired to bed if i was to be a blade of grass doomed to be trampled flat then i might as well accept it and lie down i stayed in bed for the next twentyfour hours sleeping drinking a little water not eating at all and only rousing myself when gav arrived back from his parents i wrongly assumed loudly declaring himself to be of unsound liver but totally in love oh lucky ewe i said does she come from a respectable flock ha ha its your au fr parents friend janice gav beamed radiating unrepentant guilt came round here the other day looking for you we got talking went for a curry had a few drinks ended up back here one thing led to another know how it is always liked older women theyre more experienced know what i mean arf arf anyway spent an extremely enjoyable new year at her place apart from the usual visit to my folks of course oh by the way shes coming round here tonight im cooking lasagne can you swap rooms seeing norris wont be back until tomorrow its just i didnt expect you back until then either that okay i stared at gav from my bed blinking and trying to take in this torrent of exponentially catastrophic information i attempted desperately to convince myself that what i was experiencing was just a particularly cruel and hateful dream concocted by some part of my mind determined to exact due penalty from my conscience for my having behaved with such despicable lack of grace during the holidays but failed utterly my subconscious stock of nightmareparadigms includes nothing so banally twisted as gav finally scraping together the last microscopic filaments of my tattered pride to produce a quorum fit for emergency egoresuscitation if not actual wit i managed gav im shocked gav looked defensive for all of a microsecond a concession my lacerated selfrespect fell upon with all the pathetic desperation of a humiliatingly defeated politician pointing out that well things can only get better you never told me you could cook lasagne chapter once upon a time long ago there was a rich merchant who thought that the city where he lived was full of bad people and especially bad children were they slow children some of them were as a matter of fact but at the time they didnt have the signs to tell them so are the slow children only in lochgair dad no there are slow children in various places watch out for the roadsigns now back to the story the rich merchant thought the children should always salute him and call him sir when they passed him in the street he hated beggars and old people who couldnt work any more he hated untidiness and waste he thought that babies who threw things from their cradles should be punished and children who wouldnt eat their food should be starved until they ate what they had been given in the first place dad what if it had gone rotten even if it had gone rotten aw dad even if it had maggots and things in it and it was all horrible yes that would teach them he thought awwrr yuk well the rich merchant was very powerful and he came to control things in the city and he made everybody do as he thought they ought to do snowballthrowing was made illegal and children had to eat up all their food leaves were forbidden to fall from the trees because they made a mess and when the trees took no notice of this they had their leaves glued onto their branches but that didnt work so they were fined every time they dropped leaves they had twigs and then branches sawn off and so eventually of course they had no twigs left then no branches left and in the end the trees were cut right down the same happened with flowers and bushes too some people kept little trees in secret courtyards and flowers in their houses but they werent supposed to and if their neighbours reported them to the police the people would have their trees chopped down and the flowers taken away and they would be fined or put in prison where they had to work very hard rubbing out writing on bits of paper so they could be used again is this story pretend dad yes its not real i made it up who makes up real things dad nobody and everybody they make themselves up the thing is that because the real stories just happen they dont always tell you very much sometimes they do but usually theyre too messy so the rich merchant wouldnt like them thats right in the city nobody was allowed to tell stories nobody was allowed to hum or whistle or listen to music either because the merchant thought that people should save their breath the way they saved their money but people didnt like living the way the merchant wanted them to most mums and dads wouldnt serve their children rotten food and hated having to pretend that they did people missed the trees and flowers and having to walk around with one eye covered by an eyepatch why was that dad why did they have because the merchant thought it was a waste of light to have both eyes open why not save the light the way you save money were they like mr lachy dad well not exactly no lachlan watt only has one eye the other one looks like a real one but its glass the people in the city could change from one eye to the other on different days but lachlan aye dad but theyre like him sort of arent they well sort of why has mr lachy only got one eye dad uncle fergus punched him eh dad no prentice uncle fergus didnt punch him it was an accident fergus and lachy were fighting and fergus meant to hit lachy but he didnt mean to put his eye out now do you two want to hear this story or not aye dad aye dad right well the city wasnt a nice place to live because of all the silly laws the merchant had passed and people started to leave it and go to other towns and other countries and the merchant was spending so much time passing new laws and trying to make people obey the ones hed already passed that his own business started to fail and eventually the city was almost deserted and the merchant found that he owed people much more money than he had in the bank and even though he sold his house and everything he owned he was still broke he was thrown out of his house and out of the city too because he had become a beggar and beggars werent allowed in the city so he wandered the countryside for a long time starving and having to beg for food and sleeping in barns and under trees and eventually he found a little town where all the beggars and old people hed had thrown out of the city had gone they were very poor of course but by all helping each other they had more than the merchant had he asked if he could stay with them and eventually they agreed that he could but only if he worked so they gave him a special job what dad what was the job dad he had to make brooms brooms old fashioned brushes made from bundles of twigs tied to a wooden handle you know up in the forest you sometimes see those things for beating out fires the big flappy things yes theyre big bits of rubber old tyres attached to wooden handles for beating out fires on the ground well in the old days those used to be made from twigs and even longer ago people used to use brooms like that to sweep the streets and even to sweep their houses not all that long ago either i can remember seeing a man sweeping the paths in the park in gallanach with a broom like that when i was older than either of you are now ah but dad youre ancient ha ha ha ha thats enough now listen about these brooms right what what dad the man who had been a rich merchant and who was now a beggar had to make brooms for the town he had a little hut with a stone floor and a supply of handles and twigs but to teach the man a lesson they had given him a supply of twigs that were old and weak poor twigs for making brooms with so by the time he had made one broom the floor of the hut was covered in bits of twigs and he had to use the broom hed just made to sweep the floor of his hut clean before he could start making the next broom but by the time hed cleaned the floor to his satisfaction the broom had worn right away right down to the handle so he had to start on another one and the same thing happened with that broom too and the next and the next the mess made making each broom had to be cleared up with that same broom and wore it away so at the end of the day there was a great big pile of twigs outside the hut but not one broom left thats silly thats a waste sure it is dad both but the people had done it to teach the man a lesson what lesson dad ahhah youll have to work that out for yourselves aw dad dad i know what kenneth asked prentice not to be so damn silly kenneth laughed he reached up and ruffled prentices hair in the semidarkness the boys head was hanging out over the top bunk well maybe he said dad james said from the lower bunk what happened to the merchant kenneth sighed scratched his bearded chin well some people say he died in the town always trying to make a broom that would last others say he just gave up and wasted away others that he got somebody else to make the brooms and found somebody to provide better twigs and got people to sell the brooms in other towns and cities and hired more people to make more brooms and built a broommaking factory and made lots of money and had a splendid house made and other people say he just lived quietly in the town after learning his lesson thats a thing about stories sometimes they have different endings according to who you listen to and some have sort of open endings and some dont actually have proper endings yet aw but dad but one things definite what dad its lightout time aw nightnight night dad yeah night sleep tight dont let the bugs bite right now lie down properly noddles on pillows he made sure they were both tucked in and went to the door the nightlight glowed softly on the top of the chest of drawers okay dad what did the man not have any family dad prentice asked in the story the merchant did he not have any family no kenneth said holding the door open he did once but he threw them out of his house he thought he wasted too much time telling his two youngest sons bedtime stories aww aww he smiled padded back into the room kissed the boys foreheads but then he was a silly man wasnt he they left margot to look after the children and set off in the car heading for gallanach kenneth smiled when he saw the handpainted sign at the outskirts of the village that said thank you what are you grinning at mary asked him she was bending down in her seat staring into the little mirror that hinged up from the glovebox flap inspecting her lipstick just that sign he said the one that goes with the slow children sign at the other end of the village huh mary said slow children indeed i hope you werent telling my bairns horrible stories thatll keep them awake all night na he said the volvo estate accelerated down the straight through the forest towards port ann though maggoty meat and people with one eye did come into it at one point hmm mary said she snapped the glovebox closed i heard lachy watts back in the town is that true apparently kenneth rotated his shoulders as he drove trying to ease the nagging pain in them that too much drink the night before always seemed to give him these days they had spent hogmanay at home welcoming the groups of people roaming the village as they came round the last revellers had finally been seen off at nine in the morning they and margot had done some cleaning up before going to bed though ken had anyway had a couple of hours sleep between three and five when hed fallen into a deep slumber on the wicker couch in the conservatory the boys had gone out to play on the forestry tracks with their new bikes on what had proved a bright but cold day mary had got three hours sleep before they came back noisily demanding to be fed havent seem him for what ten years mary said has he been away at sea all that time well hardly ken said he was in australia wasnt he settled down there for a while had some sort of job in sydney i heard what was he doing dont know you could ask him yourself supposed to be coming to hamish and tones shindig tonight is he mary said the volvo hissed along the dark road a couple of cars went past holes of white light in the night scattering spray which the water jets and wipers of the volvo swept away again mary took a perfume spray from her handbag applied the scent to wrists and neck fergus and fiona are coming tonight arent they should be ken nodded do you know if lachy and fergus still talk to each other no idea he laughed dont even know what theyd talk about a member of the factoryowning scottish gentry and a second mate or whatever lachy is these days whos spent the last few years in oz what is there to say ayeaye captain of light industry fergus isnt gentry anyway mary said well good as might not have a title but he acts like he does sometimes got a castle what more do you want kenneth laughed lightly again ayeaye ha ha the lights of lochgilphead swung into view ahead just as rain started to spot the windscreen kenneth put the wipers on ayeaye he sniggered mary shook her head going to the dogs if you ask me fergus people like you have been saying that since somebody invented the wheel things get better theyre always looking up yes kenneth but youre basically bolshie so you would think so kenneth grinned took a drink of his whisky and water its been a good year he nodded fergus looked suitably disgusted and threw back the remains of his own whisky and soda in one gulp they stood in the lounge of hamish and antonias house watching the others help themselves to the buffet antonia had prepared neither of the two men had felt hungry you might not be saying that when the refugees come back from australia fergus said sourly kenneth glanced at him then looked round for lachlan watt he was sitting on a distant chair a plate of food balanced on his knees talking to shona watt his sisterinlaw kenneth laughed as fergus refilled his glass from one of the whisky bottles on the drinks trolley behind them fergus you re not talking about the domino theory by any chance are you dont care what you call it mchoan not saying itll be next either but you just watch fergus for gods sake not even that asshole kissinger believes in the domino theory any more the vietnamese have finally got control of their own country after forty years of war defeated the japs the french us and the most powerful nation in the history of the planet in succession with bicycles guns and guts been bombed back into the bronze age in the process and all you can do is spout some tired nonsense about little yellow men infiltrating the steaming jungles of the nullarbor plain and turning the aussies into commies i think a highland league side winning the european cup is marginally more likely im not saying they wont pause to draw breath kenneth but i cant help feeling the future looks black for those of us interested in freedom fergus youre a tory when tories say freedom they mean money the freedom to send your child to a private school means the money to send your child to a private school the freedom to invest in south africa means the money to invest there so you can make even more and dont tell me youre interested in freedom unless you support the freedom of blacks to come here from abroad which i know you dont so there kenneth clinked his glass against ferguss cheers to the future huh said fergus the future you know im not saying your lot wont win but i hope it doesnt happen in my lifetime but things really are going to the dogs fergus sounded genuinely morose kenneth thought ah youre just peeved your lot have elected a woman leader even thats good news even if she is the milk snatcher we got rid of an old woman and replaced him with a younger one fergus said mouth turned down at the corners staring over his whisky tumbler and across the room to where his wife was talking to antoma thats not progress it is fergus even the tories are subject to change you should be proud fergus looked at kenneth a wealth of sombre disdain in his slightly wateryeyed look kenneth gave him a big smile fergus turned away again kenneth looked at the other mans heavily jowled prematurely aged face and shook his head chiangkaishek and franco dead angola independent vietnam free at last kenneth thought it had been a great year the whole tide of history seemed to be quickening as it moved remorselessly leftwards he felt vaguely sorry for fergus his shower had had their reign he thought and grinned to himself it had been a good year for kenneth personally too the bbc bless its cotton socks had taken some of the stories from his first collection a whole week of jackanory to himself just six weeks before christmas at this rate he could start thinking about giving up teaching in a year or two i wish i shared your enthusiasm for change fergus sighed and drank deeply change is what its all about ferg shuffling the genes trying new ideas jeez where would your damn factory be if you didnt try new processes better off fergus said he looked sourly at kenneth were just about making enough from traditional paperweights to keep the specialist division afloat all this hitech stuff just loses us money well it must be making money for somebody maybe you werent able to invest enough maybe the big boysll take over thats the way things go capitalists all want to have a monopoly only natural dont get depressed about it you wont be saying that if we have to close the factory and put everybody out of work god ferg it isnt that bad is it fergus shrugged heavily yes it is weve told them it might come to that the shopstewards anyway another strike or too big a pay rise and we might go under hmm kenneth said sipping at his whisky he wondered how serious the other man was industrialists often made that sort of threat but they rarely seemed to be carried out kenneth was a little surprised that hamish hadnt said anything about the factory being in such dire straits but then his brother did seem to put the church and the factory above family and friends i dont know fergus shook his head if we werent tied to this bit of the country id almost think about chucking it all in and heading off somewhere different canada or australia or south africa it was kenneths turn to look sour yes he said well youd probably get on fine in the rsa ferg though thats the one place i wouldnt recommend if you want to keep well away from the red tide hmm fergus nodded still watching his wife now talking to shona watt yes you may be right he knocked back his drink turned to the bottleloaded table behind and poured himself another large whisky antonia clapped her hands singing out come on you boring lot lets all play charades kenneth drained his glass murmured god i hate charades henriss never liked him either fat lipped beggar queer yknow thass wha hes singing you know dyou know that scuse me while i kiss this guy disgussin absluley disgussin fergus do shut up scuse me while i kiss this guy bloody poofter coon im sorry about this lachy thats okay mrs u you no goin to put your seat belt on no no not for short journeys lachy lachy lachy lachy im sorry about your eye really really sorry never forgave myself never here shake fergus tried to lever himself up from the rear bench seat of the old rover but failed he got as far as lifting his head and getting one shoulder off the seat but then collapsed back onto the leather and let his eyes close the car rumbled about him even more restful than the noise of train wheels in the old days he tried to remember the old days you sure you dont mind doing this lachy fiona said swinging the car off the main road and onto the drive that led to the castle the headlights made a tunnel of the trees and rhododendrons na its okay lachlan watt had been about to leave hamish and antonias party when fergus had fallen over and fiona had decided it was time to take her husband home she had offered lachy a lift back to his brothers house but when theyd got there fergus had seemed fast asleep snoring loudly and taking no apparent notice of fiona shaking him and shouting at him lachy had volunteered to come back to the castle to help get fergus out of the car and upstairs to bed fiona would run lachy back afterwards god that mans a nuisance fiona said as they turned the corner in the drive and the lights of the castle came into view against the coaldark night like i say i could have got the babysitter to help me with him but shes just a skelf not our regular girl shes built like a rugby player could probably put ferg over her shoulder but not this girl leannes her name thats her car there doesnt look old enough to drive if you ask me fiona brought the rover to a halt behind a beatenup mini standing on the gravel in front of the castles main entrance this really is awful good of you lachy aye its no problem mrs u fiona turned to him she smiled lachy its fiona you make me feel old when you call me mrs u sorry fiona lachy grinned he had been a thin lightframed boy and he had grown to become a lean wiry man the years of life on merchant ships and then in australia had left his skin looking wellused like soft and finegrained but slightly distressed leather his hair was unfashionably short and both eyes glittered it was a spare uncluttered characterful face especially compared to ferguss thats better fiona smiled she turned and looked in disgust at the body in the back seat just as fergus started to snore again well better get this lump out of the car i suppose fergus had gone back into a deep sleep they couldnt wake him fiona went in to tell the baby sitter she was free to go while lachy tried to rouse fergus hoi you fergus ferg wake up man aarg henriss bassard fergus wake up fergus lachlan tried slapping the mans cheeks his heavy jowls wobbled like jellies hhnn wake up lachlan said slapping ferguss cheeks again harder wake up he said quietly ye upper class cunt ye he fairly walloped ferg on one chop fergus awoke suddenly arms waving about eyes wild and bright making no sound other than a faint gurgling noise then he rolled off the seat into the footwell and immediately started snoring again any luck with the sleeping beauty fiona said coming down the steps alongside a slim blondehaired girl who was zipping up an anorak lachlan turned round na hes sound thatll be the day muttered fiona she glanced in at fergus then turned to the girl thanks leanne dear now drive carefully wont you aye mrs urvill the girl said taking out some keys and heading for the mini nightnight bye now fiona and lachy took an end of fergus each lachy held him under the shoulders fiona by the ankles they struggled up the steps through the entrance hall rested in the main hall then took him up to the first floor in here fiona said nodding lachy supported ferguss shoulders with one knee while he twisted the handle of a darklystained wooden door it swung open to darkness theres a light aye just there down a bit the room was small and bright there was a single bed a dressing table and chair and a wardrobe there was a print of a hunting scene on one wall opposite a small window guest rooms good enough for him tonight fiona grunted as they swung him onto the bed and dropped him shooch fiona said collapsing onto the floor lachy sat down on the pillow at the head of the bed breathing hard fiona wiped her brow she got up shakily that was hard work she said she pulled ferguss shoes off and nodded to the door come on lets break into the old buggers best malt before we run you back you deserve it fair enough lachy said smiling no takin his clothes off no ugh certainly not fiona said she drew back a little against the door to let lachy go past her into the hallway hes lucky we didnt leave him in the car she turned out the light fergus woke in utter darkness wondering where he was he felt as though he was falling backwards forever into darkness for an instant he thought perhaps he was dead consigned to perdition and gloom until the end of time his only sensation that of falling back and back and back head over heels forever he heard himself moan and felt with his hands bedclothes he was still wearing his own clothes too here was his shirt on his wrist there his trousers sweater shoes off he flexed his feet feeling his toes in his socks his hands found the sides of the bed it was a single then it was still totally dark he tried to remember where hed been last the party hamish and antonia mchoans of course he must still be there as this wasnt his own bed put to bed bit bad that probably in the doghouse as far as the lady wife was concerned too but then what was new he put one hand out feeling for a table he found what felt like one and then a long cold metal stem reaching up he felt a switch the light clicked on and suddenly everything was white and horribly bright he shielded his eyes god his head felt fuzzy and sore he needed a drink very badly water would do he looked round the whitepainted room thinking that it looked somehow familiar perhaps he had slept here before or maybe hed given the mchoans some bits and pieces of furniture he listened but couldnt hear anything the door of the room looked familiar too odd to find a door so comforting somehow he got up wobbled across to the door he was quite cold he opened the door a dark hall funny the place didnt smell like the mchoans house did it smelled of wood and a sort of quite pleasant mustiness this place smelled of stone and polish bit like the castle he went out into the hallway felt along the wall for a light switch he found one switched it on stairs led up the woodpanelled hall led to another set of stairs going down there were old paintings on the walls he felt very dizzy and sat down on the bottom step of the stairs he was home this was the castle he got up walked up the stairs the door to the short flight of stairs that led to the two topmost floors was locked he didnt understand he searched his pockets but could find no key he pushed at the door again he gathered a chestful of air to shout at fiona dozy bitch had locked him out of his own fucking castle his own bedroom but then thought of the children might wake the little beggars up didnt want that he went down through the lower hall to the kitchen drank some water his watch said it was two oclock so did the kitchen clock there ought to have been keys hanging by the door to the utility room but they werent there bloody fishy had fiona hidden them did she think he was dangerous was that it maybe she thought he would get up in some drunken stupor and ravish her huh thatll be right he said to himself his voice sounded rough in the quiet kitchen he cleared his throat coughed and felt the dull pounding of his headache suddenly sharpen damn it all perhaps he was being punished maybe she was punishing him for getting drunk had he done anything disgraceful he couldnt remember but he doubted it he usually held his drink well and behaved like a gentleman even when he did have one too many he looked at his reflection in the window over the sink he pulled one splayed hand through his hair maybe he ought to have a shower or something there was always the bathroom on the first floor he felt bloody annoyed fi locking him out of their apartments like that then he remembered the observatory you could get up to it by the stairs to the roof hed been up there in the roof space when the men had been installing the dome for that matter hed seen that loft being put together knew it almost as well as that selfopinionated young architect had hed crawled around in there him and the builder with a torch discussing where the observatory could be built what joists and supports would have to go what extra bracing would be needed he chuckled to himself put down the cup hed been drinking the water from wiped his lips he padded through the hall up the four flights of stairs to the little landing where you either went straight ahead and out onto the battlements or ducked through the wee door into the observatory it was bitterly cold inside the aluminium hemisphere he wished hed thought to put shoes on before hed started on this piece of nonsense feet felt like blocks of ice still he opened the door that gave into the extended cupboard under the roof dark damn should have thought to bring a torch too sloppy urvill bloody sloppy he breathed to himself he squeezed inside the little cupboard really must lose some weight well festive period well and truly over now time to go on a diet or do a bit more exercise he wriggled to the rear of the cupboard felt for the wooden battens on the panel at the end of the dark space the panel came away after a little while he put it on the floor in front of him and wriggled through on his elbows and knees into the darkness beyond getting too old for this sort of thing he told himself it was very nearly totally dark in the roof space only a little light came from behind him through the cupboard from the dome of the observatory he felt his way across the joists in front of him got his legs free from the cupboard and was able to get up into a crouch balancing on a joist hands just above his head holding on to rough undressed wood he swung one foot out to the next joist then put out one hand and felt for the next rafter he transferred his weight carefully there did it he was aware of the lath and plaster clinging to the bottom of the joists put a foot through that and youd be right through the ceiling below chap could fall slap into the bath from here probably or into the twins room maybe perish the thought daddy coming crashing through the ceiling give the little perishers nightmares for the rest of their lives he swivelled from joist to joist rafter to rafter feeling horribly like a monkey and getting very cold feet in the process even though he was breaking out in a sweat at the same time his knees and his neck were making ghastly creaking noises and protesting like hell he looked back at the light coming from the observatory cupboard now a good twenty feet away and thought about going back this whole prank was becoming a bit much really but hed started so hed finish he saw the faintest of glows ahead from between two of the joists he smiled thats the ticket he breathed to himself with the next joist it came closer then he could see one edge of the little hatch then he was over it a soft light gave away the outline of the door he heard voices god the silly woman had probably left the radio on he got down on his knees again feet supported on the joist behind his knees gave sharp twinges of pain taking almost all his weight he felt for the edges of the square door found them and lifted it gently what a lockedroom mystery this would present the old girl with if he could get in without her hearing him and get undressed and slide in beside her shed never be able to work it out of course he thought as he levered the hatch door open slowly letting more soft light spill out from underneath hed have to cover his tracks in the morning damn silly to have left the cupboard back there open and the light on in the dome but never mind fi hardly ever went up there anyway hed lifted the near edge of the door up about three inches above the top of the joist in front of him he held it there lowered his head peeped into the room smiling wondering if he could see fi from this angle voices warm air and voices oh god god god god yes yes yes yes it took him a moment to work out what was going on but then he realised that was fiona in the bed on the bed covers half off the only light in the room coming from a little candle by the bedside her hair spilled on the pillow the other pillow was on the floor and that was lachlan watt wrapped round her body bucking like some horse his hands at her neck at one breast in her hair cupping her neck the covers sliding off fiona putting her arms wide clutching at the bottom sheet of the bed at one side clutching the edge of the bedside table with the other her head beat from side to side and she said yes yes yes yes again then lachlan wiry athleticlooking skinny shanks ramming back and forth like some skinny bull reached under her pulled her up his legs spreading kneeling she hung onto him arms round his neck then after a few vertical stabs he threw her down back onto the bed she grunted arms still tight round his back then she brought her legs up right up over his thin plunging globebuttocked behind until her ankles were in the small of his back rocking to and fro feet crossed one over the other locked there with one splayed hand she held onto his back pressing him to her and with the other hand she felt down the length of his body over ribs and waist and hips and with another grunt reached round and under taking his balls in her hand pressing them and kneading them and squeezing them aw christ he heard lachlan watt say body arching fiona shuddered her voice almost a squeal as she took a series of sudden deep inrushing breaths and buried her head in the hollow between lachlan watts shoulder and neck fergus let the little door down without making a noise he felt very cold and he had pissed himself the urine was warm around his balls and tepid down his leg but it was cold at his knees he knelt there in the darkness listening to the sounds of the subsiding passion in the room below then swivelled silently and with even greater care than before and feeling far more sober moved back towards the thin escaping light at the far end of the chill cramped roof space chapter if the year of our folly had started inauspiciously for me then the fates lady luck lord chance god life evolution whoever or whatever immediately thereafter set about the business of proving that the entangled disasters distinguishing the years first few days were but a mild and modest prelude to the more thoroughgoing catastrophes planned for the weeks and months ahead and this with a rapidity and even an apparent relish which was impressive if also bowellooseningly terrifying to behold gav and my aunt janice got on like a house on fire a combined location and fate i occasionally wished on them as i lay awake listening to the sounds of their lovemaking a pastime i sometimes suspected i shared with people in a large part of the surrounding community not to say northern europe i had made the mistake of volunteering to sleep on the couch in the living room on the nights that janice stayed at our flat this offer was made with what i thought was obvious sarcasm one evening while gav and norris were attempting to develop a technique for cooking poppadoms in the microwave they were having an intense and appropriately heated discussion on the problems of coldspots as evinced by the fact that their first attempts came out looking like braille roundels and on the unfortunate instability of three poppadoms balanced together caused not so much by the jerk they received when the turntable started up as by their movements while they cooked and swelled but eventually my flatmates settled on the concept of standing the things up individually on the glass turntable and so instigated what they termed a brainstorming session in an attempt to find a suitable support mechanism i suppressed the urge to point out that the chances of two such patently zephyrgrade minds producing anything remotely resembling a storm was roughly equivalent to the likelihood of somebody called cohen landing a pork scratching concession in mecca during ramadan an alligator clip with the chrome bits removed naw still metal maybe we could shield it na has to be plastic yer non thermosetting stuff for preference well look gav i said from the kitchen doorway i only overhang the couch by a foot or so at each end why dont i attempt to curl up there when you and janice are in residence if not flagrante in the bedroom eh gav said swivelling that thick neck of his to look at me his massive brows furrowing he scratched at one rugbyshirt shrouded armpit then nodded aw aye he looked pleased thanks very much prentice aye thatd be grand he turned back to the microwave maybe we could suspend them from this bit in the middle with a length of thread norris grunted sticking his head almost right inside the appliance norris still clad in his white lab coat was one of those medical students whom fate has seemingly marked out to spend the bulk of their studies and initial training suffering from quite stupendous hangovers incurred through the intake of nearfatal levels of alcohol the night before and their subsequent professional careers sternly fingerwagging at any member of the general public who dares to consume over the course of a week what they themselves had been perfectly happy to sink during the average evening i mean dont let the fact im the longest serving flatdweller put you off the last thing i want to do is embarrass you gav i said just a tad tetchily na its all right prentice ta gav said then crouched down by norris and squinted into the lit interior of the microwave nowhere to attach it he told norris anyway wouldnae turn would it they both looked thoughtful heads side by side at the open oven door while i wondered what the chances were of both heads fitting and jamming inside and the door safetycatch somehow shortcircuiting na norris said were looking at some form of support from below know what ah mean come on gav youre the engineer i mean that old duvets bound to cover most of the important parts of my body and the chances of the pilot on the fire blowing out again and gassing me in my sleep cant really be that high i said hmm gav said he straightened then bent forward and tapped at the white plastic strip on the kitchen window ledge which retained the cheaply horrid secondary doubleglazing the flats owners had fitted just a block of wood maybe norris said get hot gav said looking more closely at the white plastic strip depending on how much water there is in the wood could warp still think plastics your best bet after all gav i can just stay up till your drinking pals have decided to head home or norriss card school chums finally drag themselves away or crash out and snore on the richter scale whatever the fun rarely extends beyond three or four oclock in the morning why that would leave me a good four or five hours sleep before an early lecture aye thats great prentice gav said still closely inspecting the window sill then he stood up suddenly and snapped his fingers got ithe said what i thought had my tone of reason in the face of monstrosity finally registered but no blutack what blutack blutack aye blutack you know blutack norris thought about this then said excitedly aye blutack blutack gav said again looking wideeyed and pleased with himself the very thing norris nodded vigorously i shook my head quitting the kitchen doorway for the comparative sanity of the dark and empty hallway you crack the bollinger i muttered ill just phone the nobel prize committee and tell them their search is over for another year blutack ya beauty i heard from the whiteglowing crucible of cuttingedge technological advancement that our humble kitchen had become you mean you havent read them all i went off the idea i said i was sitting in what had effectively become my boudoir our living room aunt janice seemed to prefer staying here with gavin to travelling out to crow road most nights gav and janice sat on the couch loosely attired in dressing gowns and watching a video i had been sitting at the table housed in the living room bay window trying to write a paper for a tutorial the next day but gavin and janice had chosen to punctuate their highly audible coupling sessions in what the more tenacious coreareas of my longterm memory still sporadically insisted had once been my bedroom with an almost equally noisy episode of tortilla chip eating the corny raucousness which ensued of course meant that the television volume had to be turned up to windowshaking levels so that the happy couple could savour the exquisitely enunciated phrasing of arnold schwarzennegers lines over the noise of their munching i had admitted defeat on the subject of the links between agricultural and industrial revolution and british imperialism and sat down to watch the video perhaps appropriately given the inflammatory nature of the effect gav and janice seemed to have on each others glands it was called red heat oh id said a hollywood movie about two cops who dont get along at first but are thrown together on a case involving drugs foreigners lots of fights and guns and which ends up with them respecting each other and winning sheech i shook my head makes you wonder where these scriptwriter guys get their weird and zany ideas from doesnt it gav had nodded in agreement without taking his eyes off the screen janice rae had smiled over at me her hair fetchingly disarrayed her cheeks flushed oh yes prentice shed said what did you think of rorys work in that folder hence the exchange above janice looked back at the telly and stretched one leg out over gavins lap i glanced over thinking that she had much better legs than a woman of her age deserved come to that she had much better legs than a man of gavs mental age deserved so you havent found any hints about what it was rory had hidden in there she said ive no idea what he wanted to hide i said wishing that janice would hide a little more of her legs i was uncomfortable talking about the poems and rorys papers the bag lost on the train coming back from lochgair at the start of the year had stayed lost and stuck with just the memory of the halffinished stuff that janice had given me originally id given up on any idea id ever had of trying to rescue uncle rorys name from artistic oblivion or discovering some great revelation in the texts still it haunted me even now months later i had dreams about reading a book that ended halfway through or watching a film which ended abruptly screen whitingout usually i woke breathless imagining there was a scarf shining white silk looped in a halftwist tightening round my neck it was something hed seen i think janice watched the distant screen something she said slowly pulling her dressing gown closed something overseen if you know what i mean vaguely i said i watched gavins hand move apparently unconsciously though of course with gav that could still mean it was fully willed to janices polyesterandcotton covered thigh something i suggested watching this seen voyeuristically perhaps mmm janice nodded her right hand went up to gavs short brownish hair and started to play with it twirling it round her fingers he put it in whatever he was working on she nodded something hed seen or somebody had seen whatever some big secret really i said gavins hand rubbed up and down on janices lap gavs face gave no sign he was aware of doing this i pondered the possibility that the lad possessed some dinosaurlike secondary brain which was controlling the movements of his hand palaeobiological precedent dictated such an organ be housed in gavins ample rear and have responsibility for his lower limbs not to say urges rather than his arms but then one never knew and i reckoned gavins modest forebrain doubtless fully occupied with the postmodernist subtexts and tertiary structuralist imagery of red heat could probably do with all the help it could get really i repeated mmmjanice nodded so he said she bit her lip gavin had a look of concentration on his face now as though two parts of his brain were attempting the tricky and littlepractised operation of communicating with each other something about janice moved her hips and seemed to catch her breath the castle she clutched at gavs hair i looked at her the castle i said but too late perhaps lent the final impetus necessary for successful reception by the proximity of the area of stimulus to that of cognition this hairpulling signal finally seemed to awaken gavin to the perception that there might be something else going on in his immediate area other than the video undeniably captivating though it was he looked round first at his hand then at janice who was smiling radiantly at him and finally at me he grinned guiltily he yawned glanced at janice again bit tired he said to her yawning unconvincingly once more fancy goin to what janice said brightly slapping her hand down on gavins bulky shoulder a good idea tell us how it ends eh prentice gav said nodding back at the television as he was half hauled out of the room by aunt janice en route to the land of nod after a lengthy detour through the territories of bonk with you going uhuhuhuhuh i muttered to the closed door i glared at the screen how it ends i muttered to myself its a video you cretin i returned to the changes in british society required to bring about the empire on which the light of reason rarely shone it was going to be a long night as i also had to finish an already overdue essay on swedish expansion in tne seventeentn century it would have to be a goodish one too an earlier remark made in an unguarded moment during a methodically boring tutorial ascribing swedish territorial gains in the baltic to the invention of the smorgasbord with its takewhatyouwant ethic had not endeared me to the professor concerned nor had my subsequent discourse on the innate frivolity of the swedes despite what i thought was the irrefutable argument that no nation capable of giving a peace prize to henry kissinger could possibly be accused of lacking a sense of humour pity it was actually the norwegians i remembered a joke about kissinger no fucking her and found myself listening to gav and janice they were still at that stage of their coital symphony where only the brass section was engaged as the old metal bed creaked to and fro the wind section essentially vox humana would join in later i shook my head and bent back to my work but every now and again as i was writing or just thinking a niggling little sidetrack thought would distract me and id find myself remembering janices words and wondering what exactly uncle rory might have hidden within his later work if he really had hidden anything not of course that there was much point in me wondering about it for about the hundredth time i cursed whatever kleptomaniac curmudgeon had walked off the train with my bag may the scarf unravel and do an isadora duncan on the wretch uhuhuhuhuh came faintly from what had been my bedroom i ground my teeth married i gasped aghast well theyre talking about it my mother said dipping her head towards the table and holding her paisleypattern scarf to her throat as she nibbled tentatively at a large cream cake we were in mrs mackintoshs tea roomes just off west nile street surrounded by straightly pendulous light fitments graphpaper pierced wooden screens and ladderback seats which turned my usual procedure of hanging my coat or jacket on the rear of the seat into an operation that resembled hoisting a flag up a tall mast but they cant i said i could feel the blood draining from my face they couldnt do this to me my mother neat and slim as ever ploughed crunchingly into the loafsized meringue cream cake like a polar bear breaking into a seals den she gave a tiny giggle as a little dollop of cream adhered to the tip of her nose she removed it with one finger licked the pinky then wiped her nose with her napkin glancing round the restaurant through the confusing topography of slats and uprights of the seats and screens apparently worried that this minor lapse in handmouth coordination was being critically observed by any of the surrounding middleclass matrons perhaps with a view to passing on the scandalous morsel to their opposite numbers in gallanach and having mother blackballed from the local bridge club she neednt have worried from what i had seen getting a little bit of cream on your nose was practically compulsory like getting nicked on the cheek in a ritualised duel before being allowed to enter a prussian drinking sodality the atmosphere of middleaged ladies enjoying something wicked and nostalgic was quite palpable dont be silly prentice of course they can theyre both adults mother licked cream from the icecave interior of the meringue then broke off part of the superstructure with her fingers and popped it into her mouth i shook my head appalled lewis and verity married no but isnt this my voice had risen a good halfoctave and my hands were waggling around on the end of my arms as though i was trying to shake off bits of sellotaperather soon i finished lamely well yes mum said sipping her cappuccino it is she smiled brightly i mean not that shes pregnant or anything but pregnant i screeched the very idea the thought of the two of them fucking was bad enough lewis impregnating that gorgeous creature was infinitely worse prentice mother whispered urgently leaning closer and glancing round again this time we were getting a few funny looks from other customers my mother smiled insincerely at a couple of burberried biddies smirking from the table across the aisle they turned sniffily away my mother giggled again hand to mouth then delved into the meringue she sat back munching face red but eyes twinkling and with those eyes indicated the two women whod been looking at us then she raised one finger and pointed first at me then at her her giggle turned into a snort i rolled my eyes she dabbed at hers with a clean corner of napkin laughing mother this is not funny i drank my tea and attacked another chocolate eclair it was my fourth and my belly was still growling not at all funny i knew i was sounding prissy and ridiculous but i couldnt help it this was a very trying time for me and the people who ought to be offering support were offering only insults well mother said sipping at her coffee again like i say theres no question of that i mean not that it makes much difference these days anyway but yes youre right it is a bit soon your father and i have talked to lewis and hes said they arent going to actually rush into anything but they just feel so right together that its just come up you know arisen naturally between them i couldnt help it my obsessed starveling brain was conjuring up all sorts of ghastly images to accompany this sort of talk things arising coming up oh god theyve talked about it mother said in tones of utmost reason with a small shrug and i just thought you ought to know oh thanks i said sarcastically i felt like id been kicked by a camel but i still needed food so i polished off the eclair belched with all the decorum i could and started eyeing up a danish pastry theyre in the states right now mother said licking her fingers for all we know they might come back married at least if that happens it wont come as quite such a shock now will it no i said miserably and took the pastry it tasted like sweetened cardboard it was april i hadnt been back to gallanach yet this year hadnt spoken to dad my studies werent going so well a was probably the best i could hope for money was a problem because id spent all the dosh id got for the car and i needed my grant to pay off the overdraft id built up there was about a grand in the old account my dads money came by standing order but i wouldnt use it and what i regarded as my own finances were judging from the tone of the banks increasingly frequent letters somewhere in the deep infrared and in serious danger of vanishing from the electromagnetic spectrum altogether i had paid my rent early on with the last inelastic cheque id written hadnt paid my poll tax had tried to find bar work but been unsuccessful and was borrowing off norris gav and a few other pals to buy food which comprised mostly bread and beans and the odd black pudding supper plus a cider or two when i could be persuaded to squander my meagre resources on contributing to the funds required for a raid on the local offlicence i spent a lot of time lying on the couch in the living room watching daytime television with a sneer on my face and my books on my lap making snide remarks at the soaps and quizzes chat snows and audience participation fora skimming the scummy surface of our effervescent present in preference to plumbing the adumbrate depths of the underlying past i had taken to finishing off the flat beer left in cans by the members of norriss itinerant card school after its frequent visits chez nous and was seriously considering starting to steal from bookshops in an attempt to raise some cash for a while i had been ringing the lost property office at queen street station each week still pathetically hoping that the bag with uncle rorys poems and darren watts mobius scarf would somehow miraculously turn up again but even they werent having anything to do with me any more after id definitely detected an edge of sarcasm in the persons voice and lost my temper and started shouting and swearing rejected by lost property it seemed like the ultimate insult and aunt janice never did remember any more about whatever rory had hidden in his later work mum sipped her coffee i tore the danish to bits imagining it was lewiss flesh or veritys underclothes i was a little confused at the time well let them get married the earlier the better it would end in tears let them rush into it let them repent at leisure they werent right for each other and maybe a marriage would last a shorter time than a more informal less intense liaison brief and bitter both of them on proximity fuses with things coming rapidly to a crunch rather than something more drawn out where they might spend long periods apart and so forget how much they hated being together and enjoy the fleeting passionate moments of reunion i fumed and bittered away while my mother finished her coffee and made concerned remarks about how thin and pale i was looking i ate another danish mother told me everybody else was fine back home come back prentice she said putting one hand out across the table to me her brown eyes looked hurt this weekend come back and stay with us your father misses you terribly hes too proud to i cant i said pulling my hand away from hers shaking my head i need to work this weekend got a lot to do finals coming up prentice my mother whispered i was looking down at my plate licking my finger and picking off the last few crumbs transferring them to my mouth i could tell mum was leaning forward trying to get me to meet her eyes but i just frowned and with my moistened fingertip cleared my plate prentice please for me if not for your dad i looked up at her for a moment i blinked quickly maybe i said i dont know let me think about it prentice my mother said quietly say you will all right i said not looking at her i knew i was lying but there wasnt anything i could do about it i couldnt send her away thinking i could be so heartless and horrible but i also knew that i wasnt going to go home that weekend id find an excuse it wasnt that this dispute between my dad and me about whether there was a god or not really meant anything any more but rather the fact of the history of the dispute the reality of its course not the substance of the original disagreement was what prevented me from ending it it was less that i was too proud more that i was too embarrassed you promise mother said a slight stitching of her brows as she sat back in the ladderbacked seat the only indication that she might not entirely believe me i promise i nodded i felt wretchedly that i was such a moral coward such a sickening liar that making a promise i knew i had no intention whatever of keeping was hardly any worse than what i had already done i promise i repeated blinking again and set my mouth in a firm determined way let there be no way out of it let me really make this promise i was so disgusted with myself that wanted to make myself suffer even more when i did as i knew i would break my word i nodded fiercely and smiled bravely utterly insincerely at my mother i really do promise really we said goodbye outside in the street i told her the flat was in too disgusting a state for her to come and visit she hoisted her umbrella to ward off the light drizzle that had started to fall gave me a couple of twentypound notes said shed look forward to seeing me on friday kissed my cheek then went off to do her shopping i had dressed as well as i could that morning in more or less the same stuff id worn for grandma margots funeral minus the lost mobius scarf of course i turned up the collar of my fake bikers jacket and walked off i gave the money to a thankfully dumbstruck fiddleplayer on sauchiehall street and walked away feeling like some sort of martyred saint as i walked this mood was gradually but smoothly replaced by one of utmost depression while my body as though jealous of all the obsessive regard my emotions were receiving came up with its own demands for attention evidenced by an unsteady fluid shifting in my guts and a cold sweat on my brow i felt fainter and fainter and worse and worse and more and more nauseous unsure whether it was the bitterness of siblingthwarted love or just too much starch and refined sugar it felt like my stomach had decided to take a sabbatical all that food was just sitting there unprocessed locked in slopping around and making me feel horrible after a while i stopped telling myself i wasnt going to be sick and resigned to the fact that i was going to have to throw up at some point kept telling myself instead that id manage to hold it in until i was back in the flat and so do it in private rather than into the gutter in front of people eventually i threw up into a litter bin attached to a crowded bus shelter on st georges road i was still gagging up the last few dregs when somebody punched me on the cheek sending the other side of my head banging against the metal wall of the shelter i spun round and sat down on the pavement a ringing noise in my head a tramp dressed in tattered shiny trousers and a couple of greasylooking buttonless coats bent down looking at me he smelled of last years sweat he gestured angrily up at the litter bin ye wee basturt there might a been somethin good in there he shook his head in obvious disgust and stalked off muttering i got to my feet supporting myself on the side of the shelter a wee grey woman wearing a headscarf peered out at me from the end of the bus queue you all right sonny she said aye i said grimacing missus i added because it seemed appropriate i nodded at the bin sorry about that my stomachs on strike and my foods coming out in sympathy she smiled uncomprehendingly at me looking round heres ma bus son you look after yoursel okay i felt the side of my head where it had hit the bus shelter a bruise was forming and my eye felt sore the wee woman got on her bus and went away oh prentice ash said more in despair than with disgust youre kidding she looked at me in the candlelight i was past caring about feeling guilt and shame and everything was collapsing anyway so i just looked straight back at her resigned and after a while i shook my head then i picked up a bit of naan bread and mopped up my curry sauce the naan bread was big wed both stuffed ourselves with it during the meal but it was still big when it had arrived it had needed a separate table just to accommodate it luckily the restaurant wasnt busy not so much a naan bread more a toasted duvet id said ash had laughed during the course of the meal wed reduced the blighter to the porportions of a couple of pillows not to mention disposing of portions of chicken kalija and fish pakora to start followed by garlic chilli chicken lamb passanda a single portion of pulao rice and side dishes of bombay potato and sag panir to accompany two dry sherries and a couple of bottles of nuit st georges had washed it all down and now we were onto the coffee and brandy it was ashley watts treat of course i still couldnt afford to eat out unless it was in the street and out of a paper poke ash was passing through glasgow and staying with us on her way to a new job down in london it was midsummer and unseasonably warm for glasgow ash wore a long rough silk shirt and leggings a light cotton jacket hung over the back of her chair i was still wearing out the regulation docs and the thick black jeans i had borrowed one of norriss big paramilitarystyle fawn shirts to wear as a jacket over my anti poll tax tshirt id left it to the end of the meal before i said anything about being arrested aw man ash said sitting back slackly in her seat the candlelight reflected in her glasses why prentice the anarkali was dark and quiet and a lot of the light was coming from the candle between us she looked sad concerned for me i thought i rather liked it i liked the idea of other people feeling sorry for me even though i also despised them for it because i wasnt worth their sympathy and that made them fools of course i despised myself for despising them for showing such genuine and unselfish emotions but thats just one of the things you have to get used to when youre in a serious selfdestruction spiral mine was feeling rather like a powerdive right now i shrugged why not i needed the money but your familys rich no theyre well they might be fairly well i smiled sat closer took up my brandy and cradled it in front of the candle flame actually theres quite a good exchange on those lines in catch the movie much underrated film which isnt in the book so buck henry must have written it where natelys been killed and yossarians been to milos whorehouse to see nately s whore and milos picked him up in the halftrack and hes saying nately died a rich man he had suchandsuch a number of shares in mm enterprises and yossarian says ashley was glaring at me over the candle flame the way a hawk must glare at a field mouse the instant before it parts mouse from field forever i saw this predatory outraged expression building on ashs face like a line of dark clouds on the horizon and stopped talking though entirely out of inquisitiveness not trepidation shut the fuck up about catch ya cretin ash said storming forward and planting both forearms on the table cloth what the fucking hell are you doin stealing books for money when youve no need to eh just what sort of dickhead are you prentice i mean what the fuck are your parents going to think if they hear how are they goin to feel or is that it are they supposed to feel bad are you tryin to get back at your dad because of this stupit religious thing well come on are you i sat back amused i played with the dumpy stem of the brandy glass smirking at ashley through the candle flame ashleys long hair was tied back and she looked rather attractive now i thought about it i wondered what the chances were of bedding the girl a little recreational fornication would go down quite well just now i wondered if ash was into rough sex i had no idea whether i was into it myself but for some reason just then the idea seemed rather intriguing i smiled at her gave a small laugh really ashley i didnt think youd take it all so melodramatically its only shoplifting after all just one silly book too worse things happen at ca s i sat back still smiling legs crossed arms crossed ashs face was close to the flame its yellow oval glowing like some magical castemark on her forehead much closer and shell melt her glasses i thought she appeared to be trying to outstare me but actually im rather good at that sort of thing when i want to be and i didnt let my eyes flicker a waiter was approaching from behind her i noticed without taking my eyes off hers i felt the grin broaden on my lips the waiter would distract her especially as she had ordered the meal and was obviously paying and anyway she almost certainly hadnt heard the waiter approaching ash reached one hand out across the table and spilled my brandy into my lap just as i was reacting going wha and jerking forward ash turned smoothly to the waiter and with a broad smile said the bill please it does look like ive pissed myself i protested as we walked back to the flat those people were definitely laughing at me oh shut up prentice youre telling me to shut up i laughed the july night was warm and muggy and the traffic rumbled like thunder down great western road you throw drink all over me expect to sleep in my flat tonight and you tell me to shut up ash paced purposefully on long flinging strides i was having difficulty in keeping up with she was still glaring though straight ahead now i noticed people coming towards us werent getting in her way i didnt throw the drink i tipped it she told me and im only coming back to the flat to get my bag if thats the way you feel ill sleep in the car or find a hotel i didnt i protested waving my arms and running after her as i saw the possibility of getting into ashleys increasingly attractive body slipping away from me i didnt say that i just dont like being told to shut up im sorry i mean im really sorry im annoyed that you spilled or tipped drink all over me ash stopped so suddenly i wondered where shed gone for a moment i turned looked and went back to her standing looking furious in the light of a spudulike prentice she said calmly youve practically exiled yourself from your family and your home and your friends you think youve failed your finals but you say youve no intention of sitting your resits even if you have youve no money and you havent even been looking for a job youre getting done for shoplifting and youre acting like such a fucking dickhead you seem determined to get shot of the last few pals you do have left and all you can do is make smartass remarks i looked through her bright red glasses into her light grey eyes and said well so far so good certainly but lets not count our she stamped on my right big toe forcing me to produce an involuntary and appallingly undignified yelp she stormed off i half limped half hopped after her lets not count our vultures before theyre hatched eh i laughed she powered on ignoring me i hopped after her spare a shekel for a healthy beggar i cackled able was i ere i saw michael where can you land a palin and in what ash kicked my other shin wonderful girl didnt even seem to break stride she disappeared into an offlicence i waited outside rubbing my shin and inspecting the damage to my docs luckily the scuff on the right toe didnt show up the way it would have with polished boots ash reappeared with a bag she swept past me briefly showing me the bottle of grouse it contained i skipped after her down the street after trying the fluid on a small unnoticeable area you now wish to wash all of my trousers the spirited way am i right madam now will you swap these two bottles of warm urine for that one bottle of our product she shook her head not looking at me you and i are going to get filthily drunk prentice and if by the time we get to the bottom or this bottle i havent got some sort of sense out of you im going to break it over your thick fucking skull she turned beamed a toothy nonsmile at me for about a microsecond then strode determinedly on i tried to keep up i looked at the bottle in the bag couldnt you just leave the whisky ill drink it all wake up in the morning no make that the afternoon with a head that feels like you hit me over the skull with the bottle and you sleep in the car ready for that long and demanding journey down the notoriously dangerous a tomorrow ash shook her head we got back to grant street i looked up saw some lights on in the flat maybe i thought ash would be so turned on by the sounds of frantic coupling emanating from gav and aunt janice in the bedroom that shed tear my clothes off or maybe norris and his pals would distract her from this crazed idea of getting airlocked drunk by suggesting a friendly game of cards ash followed my gaze she held the bottle up in front of my eyes ready for this prentice drink doesnt solve anything you know i told her just dissolves brain cells i know she said im working on the principle that most people are okay unless they get muroculous with drink when they become arseholes youre behaving like an arsehole now so maybe drinkll make you okay i tried to look as sceptical as i could i bet you believe in crop circles too prentice i believe you seem determined to fuck your life up and i just want to know why oh i said brightly thats easy my affections have been rejected by the one i love and her carnality is being most thoroughly investigated by my elder and smarter brother on a more or less hourly basis so i am spurned and she is spermed my father believes his children should be free to make up their own minds but preferably only out of the spareparts that he provides and apart from that i mean the exams and getting nicked and stuff well i sighed looking up to the night sky where the clouds were starting to blot out the few stars that the city lights did not obscure i spread my arms wide im just a waster ash looked at me i could see her chest move in and out inside the light cotton jacket naw prentice she said quietly after a while youre just a bairn i shrugged maybe come on i indicated the close lets get as drunk as you think we have to and you can tell me all the reasons im so childish i glanced at my watch as we headed for the stairs better get started though weve only got all night we climbed the stairs reached the flat you know ash was saying breathing hard and looking down the stairwell as i opened the door i dont know anybody who lives in a flat who doesnt live on the top floor friends in high places i said opening the door to janice rae aunt janice was clothed shirt and jeans which made rather a refreshing change and standing in the hallway she looked distraught her eyes were red and her mascara had left what appeared to be a diagram of the los angeles freeway system down her cheeks beyond her gav stood looking awkward and sheepish i glanced from janice to gav and back again while janice looked at me lip trembling let me guess i thought theyve finally done it theyve broken the bed oh prentice janice said suddenly throwing herself at me and enveloping my upper torso in a hug that would have done credit to a grizzly i wondered what had brought this on and how to peel aunt janice off what must ashley be making of all this shed be getting jealous with any luck janice pulled away i could breathe again and promptly did so oh prentice she said again holding my head in both hands and shaking her own her eyes closed she turned her face away released her hold on my cheekbones and let me go on into the hall gav stood by the hall table shifting his weight from side to side and glancing nervously down at the phone now and again he avoided my eyes i took a couple of steps forward then heard something whispered from behind me and looked back to see janice hugging ash almost violently theyd never met before how shocking i thought where was that traditional british reserve only abandoned for cloying camaraderie under the influence of injuriously vast quantities of alcohol i wondered if nervously ash was looking over janice raes shoulder at me those grey eyes behind the bright red glasses filling with tears um youve to phone home gav mumbled apparently addressing his trainers et or bt i heard myself say to him though the different sections of my brain seemed to have slipped out of synch somehow and i was aware of all sorts of different things at once and time seemed to have slowed down and at the same time some part of my brain was racing trying to come up with some logical explanation for what was going on that didnt involve calamity and failing its gav said this time seemingly directing his remarks to his rugbyshirted chest its your dad he whispered and suddenly started to cry chapter this is the specialist glass division hamish said opening a door they found themselves in a long corridor with one glass wall that looked out into a bright modern openplan and spacious area everything gleamed and the few people visible wore white coats apart from the exposed brickwork of a couple of rotund furnaces linked to the ceiling by shining metal ductwork the place looked more like a laboratory than a factory there was a silence none of the three brothers seemed inclined to fill hamish an immaculate white coat over his three piece suit gazed with a rapt expression at the almost static panorama on the far side of the glass kenneth looked bored rory stood at janice raes side humming something monotonous one arm round janices waist and attempting to tickle her just above her right hip very clean janice said eventually yes hamish said gravely he nodded slowly still observing the scene beyond the glass it has to be of course he turned to the tables against the wall behind them on which lay various glassylooking objects some in display cabinets most loose all with explanatory notes stuck to the wall above them from a wooden plinth on one table hamish picked up a dull black cone that looked a little like a viking helmet without the horns this is a missile nosecone he said turning the cone over in his hands he held it out to janice she took it hmm quite heavy she said rory tickled her again and she nudged him yes heavy hamish said gravely taking it back and carefully replacing it on its wooden block strictly speaking this is a glass ceramic rather than ordinary glass he said adjusting the precise position of the nose cone on the plinth the basis is lithium aluminosilicate which withstands heat very well cooker hobs are made from this sort of thing and obviously missiles need to withstand a lot of heat from friction with the air obviously kenneth said he and rory exchanged looks hamish turned to another exhibit a broad bowl also dull and dark and over half a metre across it was like a gigantic plate with no lip he lifted an edge so that they could look underneath where it was crisscrossed with a lattice of deep ribs satellite aerial kenneth said no hamish said though a hint of a smile crossed his dour face no this is a substrate for an astronomical telescope mirror like the one fergus has in the castle rory asked thats right all the substrates and optics for mr urvills telescope were made here though of course they were on a smaller scale than this piece hamish lowered the edge of the bowl and flicked a bit of dust off one edge this is made from the same type of material as the nose cone there it resists distortion under thermal shock hmm janice in a tone that suggested that she was really trying to be interested as well as sound it over here hamish said plodding towards another table we have what are called the passivation glasses related to the borate glasses but made from zincsilicoborate all i said was id like to see the factory janice whispered to rory as they moved to follow hamish the outside would have done tough shit rory said and tickled her with both hands this time producing a yelp another man in a white coat came up to hamish from the far end of the corridor excuse me a moment hamish said to the others and turned to talk to him kenneth turned to rory and janice he tugged on rorys sleeve and in a low monotone said dad im bored dad dad are we nearly finished yet dad dad want to go home dad he leant one hand against the glass wall glanced back at hamish still deep in conversation and nodding and rolled his eyes he looked at janice my elder brother he said quietly the man who put the bore in borosilicate you dont have to stay rory grinned we could get a train home kenneth shook his head no its okay he glanced at his watch maybe we can drag the tree out for lunch soon sorry about that hamish said coming up behind them they all smiled at him hamish moved one arm up to indicate they should move down the corridor to where they could see the exciting zincsilicoborates he took a pristine white handkerchief out of his pocket and rubbed at the faint handprint kenneth had left on the glass partition as he said these passivation glasses are of much use in the semiconductor industry and we have high hopes that with the burgeoning of the scottish computer industry silicon glen as it is sometimes jocularly called we shall shortly be supplying and to think all that could have been mine kenneth sighed with pretended regret putting his feet up on the low wall of the terrace and rocking his seat back on its rear legs as he shaded his eyes with one hand he brought his drink up to his lips with the other janice and rory were tucking into their salads the terrace of the achnaba hotel was crowded with tourists and on the road in front of the hotel cars caravans and coaches hummed past heading for lochgilphead gallanach or kintyre a brisk warm wind blew from the south west laden with the vanilla smell of gorse blossom mixed with pine off the forests and a salt hint from the sea well thats just the way it goes ken rory said hamish got to be manager of the factory and you didnt no use crying over spilled borosilicate kenneth grinned staring out over the balustrade of the terrace towards the hills on the far side of loch fyne i wonder where that saying comes from i mean why milk if it means something not very valuable why not water or maybe crying over milk was unlucky rory suggested it was years before i realised it was even common parlance kenneth said still staring out to the loch i used to think it was something only mum came out with like i couldnt draw a herring off a plate i mean what the hell does that mean or och aye thats him away the crow road jeez opaque or what but they might all have some some basis in reality rory insisted like crying over milk was bad news spoiled it maybe it spoiled unspilled milk kenneth nodded some chemical reaction like they say thunder can curdle milk ions or something ah rory said then maybe you were supposed to cry over milk because it helped preserve it or made it easier to turn into cheese and so it was a waste crying over spilled milk i think this is where we came in kenneth said he squinted at a car on the road as it hurried north isnt that fergus he said nodding where racing green jag heading north is that what fergs driving these days rory said rising up in his seat a little to watch the car pass it swept round the long bend that carried the road towards the forest he sat back down and took up his fork again yeah looked like ferg this is fergus urvill who owns the factory janice asked she sat back in the white plastic chair fanning herself with her napkin kenneth looked at her yep that fergus he said of course you havent had the dubious pleasure yet have you he put his glass down on the circular table and inspected the rolled up sunshade that protruded from the centre of the table like an unopened flower nojanice said whats he like kenneth and rory exchanged glances bearing up remarkably well kenneth said janice looked puzzled for a second then said oh yes of course fiona she looked embarrassed rory patted her hand on the table kenneth looked away for a moment then cleared his throat yeah anyway he stretched his shoulders sat back fergus upperclass huntinshootinfishin type could be worse i suppose still rory said not what youd call a happy man well of course janice said quietly and bit her lip kenneth frowned his precious factorys making a profit he said briskly draining his glass the greedy partys in power what more does he want a wife rory suggested and then sucked on one finger kenneth looked down studying his glass there was silence rory rubbed a mark off the white tables surface janice lifted the scooped neck of her bright print dress and blew down want some shade kenneth asked janice she nodded kenneth stood lifted the stalk of the sunshade and opened the big parasol casting a shadow over janice and rory did you know janice said to rory squeezing his hand in the dewey decimal system glassmaking comes under the code six six six woo rory whistled number of the beast spooky eh not many people know that janice said she smiled kenneth laughed he sat back in his chair again dragging it round so he was under the shade too shame ferg isnt superstitious he chuckled mind you hamish is maybe we should tell him that the tree has some pretty weird ideas about religion he might just swallow the idea hes been working for the devil all this time renounce the whole business start going round smashing windows reallyjanice said what is he i mean what religion kenneth shrugged oh just church of scotland but if they had a provisional wing i think hed be on it hes always had a soft spot for the royal family rory began yes his head kenneth said maybe he could start the royal church of scotland maybe he could start thinking like a rational human being instead of a caveman frightened by lightning kenneth said tartly oh youre so cruel rory told him i know kenneth sighed rolling the base of his glass around on the table top time for another drink i think my round janice said rising no kenneth said let sit down janice told him taking his glass from his hand same again kenneth looked glum no virgin mary this time gotta drive the two men watched janice head for the bar what did fergus ever say to you kenneth asked rory what rory said blinking what about god i hate it when youre mysterious kenneth shook his head you know damn well before the crash way before what did fergus ever tell you was it after you came back from india that second time before you went back to london you two went hillwalking a lot then didnt you old ferg spill some beans up in them there hills we talked rory said awkwardly using his fork to push bits of lettuce around his plate he told me things but i dont want to go into it ken it would only complicate matters its nothing that directly touches you what about fiona kenneth said voice low staring at his brother did it touch her rory looked away across the loch he shrugged look ken it isnt something youd benefit by knowing all right just leave it at that the fork continued to shift the lettuce leaves around the plate kenneth watched his brother for a moment then sat back oh well serves me right for being nosey lets change the subject hows this new project thing coming along oh im still working on it i wish youd let me look at it it isnt finished yet when will it be when it is rory said frowning he put the fork down i dont know look its sort of a personal story ah kenneth said rory leaned forward over the table closer to his brother look he said glancing round towards the french windows that led to the bar ive had a few more ideas well ive thought about areas i didnt think i could use that i now think i can and i want to develop that stuff and what stuff kenneth said laughing in exasperation and throwing his arms wide just tell me what sort of stuff rory sat back shaking his head i cant say really he glanced up at kenneth but things things might start to happen soon anyway i cant say any more for now kenneth shook his head sadly they might have happened by now if youd just let me see this opera tv series popupbook whatever the hell it is and if youd let me talk to a few people i mean if its just that youre too close to it and you dont want me to look at it there are people i know whore good at that sort of thing they can see the wood from the trees they could aw come on ken rory said a pained expression crossing his face he ran a hand through his short straight hair this is my show this is the way i want to do it just let me all right i dont know rore kenneth said sitting back sometimes you play your cards so damn close to your chest i dont think you can see them yourself you should open up a bit more share your problems share some secrets i do rory said biting his lip and looking down at his glass rory kenneth said sitting forward and lowering his voice to conspiratorial levels the last secret i remember you telling me was that it was you who set fire to that barn on the urvills estate rory grinned stirring his finger through a little patch of moisture on the side of his glass hey im still waiting to see if you tell anyone ken laughed well i havent have you rory smiled sucking air through his teeth at the same time clinked one thumbnail against his glass he glanced at his brother dont worry my secret is safe with us he shook his head then shrugged okay rory sighed trying to suppress a smile looking away there might be a job with aunty in the offing okay what kenneth laughed the beeb you going to be a tv star its not definite yet rory shrugged and its he frowned at his brother shit ken its just more hackwork its better paid is all what is it though oh a fucking travel programme what else rory rolled his eyes but anyway well see okay its not definite like i say and i dont want to get anybodys hopes up so keep it quiet but things might start to happen but thats great news man kenneth said sitting back talking about me i hope boys janice said returning with their drinks on a tray said my god rory ive never seen one that blg and i said oh hello dear rory grinned pretending only then to notice janice she sat down smiling talking about the size of your overdraft are we dear goshdarn rory said snapping his fingers looking at kenneth caught telling tales again runs in the family kenneth said taking up his glass cheers janice your health slange they left after that drink and went back to the house at lochgair rory and kenneth cleared a tangled choke of bushes and shrubs at the rear of the garden where mary wanted the lawn extended they sweated through the insectloud afternoon while the sun shone janice sunbathed and later helped mary and margot prepare the evening meal janice had taken that day off from the library she and rory left on the last train back to glasgow that night it was the last time kenneth ever saw rory fiona sat in the passenger seat of the car watching the red roadside reflectors drift out of the night towards her she was thrown against one side of the seat as fergus powered the aston round the righthander that took the road out of the forest down into and through the little village of furnace she was pressed back against the seat as fergus accelerated again they swung out and past some small slower car overtaking it as though it was stationary headlights ahead of them glared the oncoming car flashed its lights and she heard its horn sound as they passed a few seconds later the sound was quickly lost in the snarl of the astons engine if youre driving like this to try and prove something dont bother on my account she said fergus was silent for a while then in a very controlled and even voice said dont worry look i just want to get home as soon as possible all right everythingll suddenly get better once were home will it fiona said kiss the kids on the head and get mrs s to make some tea stiff whisky for you g and t for me maybe we should call up the mckeans to say we got back safely you can ask after julie for christs sake fiona for christs sake fiona fiona sneered imitating ferguss voice is that all you can say youve had half an hour to think up another excuse and i dont need fergus sighed any excuses look i thought we had agreed to just leave this yes that would suit you fine wouldnt it ferg thats your way of dealing with everything isnt it pretend it hasnt happened maybe itll go away if were all terribly polite and decorous and discreet maybe the whole horrid thing will just she made a little fluttering motion with her hands and in a highpitched girlish voice said disappear she looked at him his broad softfowled face looked hard and set in the dim light shining from the cars instruments well she told him leaning over as far as she could towards him they wont just go away ferg she tried to make him look at her he frowned put his head slightly to one side and lifted it trying to look round and over her head nothing ever goes away fergus she told him nothing ever doesnt matter she strained over a little more fergus she said he pushed her away with his left hand back into her seat she sat there mouth open he seemed to understand the silence and glanced over a weak smile flickering on his face sorry he said getting in the way a bit there sorry dont you push me she said slapping his shoulder she hit him again dont you ever dare push me again oh stop it fiona he said more exasperated than angry one minute im in the doghouse because well because im not all over you all the time next second not all over you all the time fiona said you mean not fucking me fergus is that what you mean fiona please oh fiona slapped one palm off her forehead then crossed her arms looked away out of the dark side window fuck did i swear oh fuck oh what a silly fucking cow i must fucking be fiona i said something straight im so sorry i actually said what i meant used the sort of word youd normally only hear from your golfing chums or your rugby pals or does julie use that sort of language does she do you like her to talk dirty does that get you going ferg fiona im getting rather tired of this fergus said through his teeth his fingers gripping the wheel harder rubbing round it im sorry you think what you do about julie as i have tried to tell you she was the wife of an old friend and ive kept in touch since she got divorced still stuck on that fergus fiona said impersonating concern oh dear we had that line back at arrochar i seem to recall and what was the rest of it oh yes one of her sons has leukaemia poor little kid hasnt he and youve helped her and the little darling with bupa out of the goodness of your heart yes i have and im sorry you choose to sneer about it fiona sneer laughed fiona its a joke fergus jesus she was practically taking your zip down oh dont be ridiculous its not my fault julie got a bit tipsy she was smashed out of her brains fergus and about the only thing she remembered was that she wanted to get your trousers off god knows why but she seemed to associate that with pleasure fiona gave a sort of strangled laugh then put one hand up suddenly to her nose and looked away and sobbed once fergus drove quickly on trees flicking past like green ghosts to the right the waters of the loch just a dark absence on the left fiona sniffed trying the great silence again eh ferg she pulled a handkerchief from her handbag on her lap dabbed at her hose still pretending itll all go away still sticking your head in your precious fucking opticalquality sand look cant we talk about this in the morning i mean when youre sober fergus she said looking over at him that what you were going to say blaming it on drink again is that all it was of course silly me i should have realised dear julie gets drunk and for bizarre reason suddenly starts feeling you up under the table while were nibbling our cheese and biscuits and making pathetic doubleentendres and attacks you outside the bathroom totally unprovoked of course and its all just the drink talking and im just being hysterical i suppose because ive had too many of johns terribly strong g and ts and itll all look different in the morning and ill come to you and say sorry and wasnt i being a silly girl last night and you can pat me on the head and say yes wasnt i and you can still go for cocktails at the frasers and bridge at the mcalpines and tee off with the gordons and cruise with the hamiltons with a united front a respectable face cant we fergus fiona fergus said face set and teeth clenched i dont know breathed why youre making such a big thing of this its just one of those things that happens at parties people do get drunk and they do do things they wouldnt normally think of maybe julie has or has had in the past a crush on me or something i dont know maybe a crush on you said fiona jesus well thats a better try ferg but i dont think youre quite as good a liar as you think you are and shes not that good an actress fiona looked down twisting the handkerchief in her fingers oh god ferg it was so fucking obvious i mean i knew there was something going on all those trips away and getting drunk and not being able to come home staying at one of your chums delightful little piedaterres oh sorry no you cant phone back hes only just got it and it hasnt had a phone put in yet or coming back with bruises how you suddenly became so very clumsy or so easily marked but at least i could still kid myself at least i didnt have my nose rubbed in it fiona fergus shouted knuckles white on the steering wheel for gods sake theres nothing to have your nose rubbed in julies just a friend i havent touched her you didnt have to she was touching you fiona said voice quiet looking away from fergus out to the darkness of the loch a few weak lights shone on the far side and headlights on the otter ferry road two miles away across the black expanse of waves swung out briefly like a lighthouse beam and then dimmed and disappeared the car roared through another small village before the trees hid the view again fiona kept her face away from him looking out into the night watching the vertical bright line of light the car threw onto the serried mass of dark conifers even there she could not escape him she could see his distorted image in the slanted glass of the cars windows dim in the background still lit by his instruments she wondered how she could ever have thought that she loved him and why she had stayed with him for so long after shed realised that if she ever had she did not love him now of course she could say it was for the children as people always did it was true up to a point how terrible it was to have those easy phrases trotted out so often in the course of gossip or hearttohearts or in magazine articles or even court cases become so real it was never the sort of thing you thought about when you were young when you were or thought you were in love and all the future shone with promise problems belonged to other people you might imagine supporting them talking with them when they needed to talk trying to help but you didnt imagine that you would be the one desperate to talk or the one too embarrassed to talk too ashamed or too proud to talk you didnt imagine you would be the one who needed help not even when you told friends that of course there might be problems or agreed with your beloved that you would always talk about things staying together for the children and for the adults she thought for the sake of appearances god she had thought she was above that sort of thing once she had been bright and free and determined and she had decided she was going to make her own way in the world just as well as any of her brothers might shed been a sort of feminist before it became fashionable never had much time for all that sisterly stuff but she was positive she was as good as any man and shed prove it and marrying ferg had seemed like an extra boost to her lifeplan london had been exciting but she had not shone out there she felt the way she had here she had never felt any affection for the place and had made no friends there she would miss and anyway she would find fields to conquer up here coming home triumphant to wed the lord of the manor but it had not been as she had imagined she had expected to be the centre of things in gallanach but the mchoans as a family had so many other things happening to them she had felt peripheral the urvills own history too made her feel like something unimportant on the family tree for all that fergus talked of responsibility and duty and ones debt to the next generation she was a leaf expendable a twig maybe at best somehow all her dreams had disappeared it seemed to her now that all she had ever had had been the dream of having dreams the goal of having goals one day once she had made up her mind what it was she wanted but that had never happened first fergus then the twins then her own small part in the society of the town and the people there and in the wider still circumferential concerns of this wee countrys middletoruling classes and in the more dissipated commonwealth of mildly powerful people who were their peers beyond that in england on the continent from the states and elsewhere took up her time sapped her will and replaced her own concerns with theirs so now she thought i am married to a man whose touch disgusts me and who anyway does not seem to want to touch me she looked at ferguss dim reflection distorted in the glass then tried to refocus on her own image can he find me as repellent as i find him i cant look that bad can i a few grey hairs but you dont notice them still a size twelve and ive looked after myself i look good in this your standard little black number and i still get into a tight pair of jeans whats wrong with me what did i do why does he have to spend half his time with that drunken brassy bitch god the best time ive had in the past five years was one night with lachy watt angry at ferg and more surprised than anything else the way he just took my hair in one hand while we were standing looking up at that godawful window in the great hall and turned my head to him and pulled me close tongue down my throat before i knew what was happening and there was something adolescent and desperate beneath all that workingclass directness but jesus i felt wanted she shook her head that was best left out of it once was once dismissible ever again would set a pattern lachy had been back one time afterwards that she knew of a year later and he had called but shed told him she wouldnt be able to see him and put the phone down on him no that didnt matter she looked at the reflection of fergus again as he pulled the wheel the car tunnelled into the forest the wall of trees on either side a blur their greenness more remembered than seen i could leave him she thought i could always have left him but mothers too close for comfort thered be too many nearby friends too many chances of bumping into people id rather not bump into too much mitigating against the clean break new start god im pathetic though thats so petty why havent i the sheer drive to just get up and go take the twins and emigrate to oz or canada or live in wild eccentricity in london or paris or i can stay as i know i probably will muddle through look after the twins and try to make sure they negotiate the reefs of puberty and adolescence set them up to make their way in the world and do so without becoming just like me she looked out into the grey sweep of road ever rushing towards them fergus powered the car down out of the forest through some more houses and a few lights the car lurched fergus looked over smiled at her she didnt know whether to smile back or not and she wondered what that expression had meant and what had been going through his head for the last few miles the car jiggled on its springs lurched again and settled she clutched at her seat looking forward the engine roared she looked back at ferg saw tears in his eyes ferg she said the car skidded a little came straight she glanced forward at the road saw the corner and the trees she clutched at the dashboard with both hands ferg she screamed look chapter i was eleven when aunt fiona died i remember feeling both peeved and cheated that i was thought too young to go to the funeral it would have been my chance to show how mature i had become and anyway from what id seen on television and films funerals looked like rather dramatic and romantic events people dressed in black and looked sombre they had thin tight lips and they sometimes wept and there was a lot of grim clutching of other peoples shoulders and low mutterings about how soandso had been a good person and that sort of thing but under it all was the simple joyous fact they were dead and you werent yet i hadnt got to see aunt fiona being buried but i did see uncle fergus in hospital i was in too getting my appendix out and i went along from my ward to his room just to say how sorry i was he had a broken arm some cracked ribs and his whole face was bruised kids with facepaints couldnt have matched all those colours id never seen anything like it there wasnt much to say i cant remember what i did say he kept talking about not being able to remember anything after passing lochgair no matter how hard he tried he couldnt understand why she hadnt been wearing her seatbelt hed thought she had been but they said she hadnt she hadnt he started to cry i sat on the giant corroded lump of concrete and steel legs crossed arms folded watching the waves break on the sands below and listening to the strange whooping hooting sounds and hollow clanging noises produced by the fluted pipes and iron doors embedded in the fractionally tilted concrete mass it was a little after sunset three days after my fathers death the sun had dipped behind north jura and abandoned the sky to a skeined mass of glowing clouds sinking through the spectrum from gold towards bloodred all against a wash of deepening blue the wind was still warm coming in from the south west sharp with salt as the remnants of the rolling atlantic swell hit the rocks nearby and sent up spray but maybe also well you could imagine it at least containing a hint of grasses too something directed over the distant greenery of ireland or swept round from the welsh hills along the circling wind the concrete block was more or less a cube about four metres to a side though it looked more squat than that its lower metre buried in the sand of the small beach a few miles west of gallanach about level with the southern tip of island macaskin the concrete and pipework block four years old now and streaked with rust and seagull droppings was the only fullsize work darren watt ever completed darren had got his sponsorship from a cement company which agreed to provide materials and a grant but finding a place to put the finished piece had been tricky and it had been uncle fergus no less who had finally come to the rescue with a site for the work the town council hadnt liked the idea of a gigantic concrete object the size of four garages being stationed anywhere near the town itself and for a while it had looked like darren was going to have real problems finding anywhere to put his concrete edifice especially after a couple of the more pygmybrained newspapers had taken up the story and started fuming about a ridiculous waste of public money and the outrageous despoiling of our fragile landscape with queer artyfarty loonyleft monstrosities darren had thought about playing up to this drivel by giving the thing some wonderfully pretentious title and i recall him at a party discussing the merits of calling it the lusitanian coast dialectical kineticstatic object alpha in the end though he just called it block one it was a threekilometre hike from the nearest path and even the odd yachtsperson passing close enough to catch sight of the block would probably have dismissed it as some old wartime ruin not exactly as public as sauchiehall street then but darren had been happy it worked when the tide was at the right level it produced noises like a ghost trapped in badly tuned organpipes sonorous slammings as waves opened and slammed shut heavy doors like hinged manhole covers within the set tonnes of the blocks hollow insides and depending on the waves impressive spouts of water bursting into the air from its rusted throats as though from some stranded cubist whale hed learned a lot from it hed said just you wait till the next one and the ones after that i was thinking about aunt fiona because death and dying were on my mind and i was going back through all the people id known whod had the nerve to pop their clogs before they should have while i was still around to miss them aunt fiona was a vague memory even though id been eleven when shed died and id known her for so many years it was as though by her early death the memories had lost the chance of being renewed every now and again and instead were somehow built over the spaces that should have been hers recycled and usedup by those of the family who were still alive shed been okay id liked her from what i could remember shed let us play in the castle and its grounds and shed taken us on walks round the coast sometimes shed seemed young and old at once to me of a different generation to fergus and lachlan and even my father she had seemed younger than them never mind the real elders like grandma margot closer to us when we were children it was a quality shed shared with uncle rory the still absent uncle rory wed thought that as dads death had gone reported in a few papers partly because of his modest fame and partly because of the bizarre nature of his demise rory might hear and finally get in touch but nothing had happened yet and the funeral was tomorrow the romantic in me wanted him to reappear at the ceremony in the grounds of the house at lochgair but i doubted that he would too pat too neat too kind a thing for fate to throw up now i looked up at the violet sky feeling the wind move my hair across my forehead and the nape of my neck i could see a few stars i stared at the heavens until my neck got sore then said aloud and loud well nothing the waves shushed across the sands i lowered my head out to sea a couple of birds flew wingtip low across the skyreflecting waters i shook my head wondering at it all dad died my uncle hamish seemed to be maintaining in suspicious circumstances god killed him uncle hamish appeared to be almost perversely upset and appalled by the implications of this supposed act his own part in the bizarre and fatal episode troubled him less i guessed than the terrifying idea that there really might be after all a god who listens thinks decides and acts just like an ordinary mortal except more powerful it rather indicated i suspected that all this time my uncle had just been playing a game and his retributive protoheresy was exactly as frivolous as my dad had been given to claiming whatever uncle hamish was in short under sedation and dad was under the care of the undertaker and would soon be under the roses at the rear of the garden in lochgair unchristened at the start of his life and joined to unconsecrated ground after its end some generation i thought if uncle rory was dead and who was to say he wasnt then hamish my uncle the tree at that moment lying in a darkened room moaning about a jealous god and being his brothers keeper and the divine and blinding light come from the skies and the smell of the devil and all his works and popping valium every few hours and muttering about anticreates and asking his wife to tell my mother that for all his atheism so powerfully and dramatically disproved he was sure kenneth had been a mostly good man and would not suffer unduly in the afterlife even though the gates of heaven were irredeemably closed to him this prattling wreck this bedbound hidebound bag of gibbering nonsense was all that remained of that generations onetime promise rory gone from us for a decade at least as good as dead fiona gone for want of a seat belt and my father drunk and angry furiously determining to prove something by a prank barely worthy of some overprivileged oxbridge undergraduate just hamish left and him halfmad with an amalgamated fever of grief guilt and reinoculated faith some result id surprised myself when gav broke down like that and i knew that dad was dead i believe i actually came close to fainting i stood watching gav greet hearing janice rae sob into ashley watts shoulder behind me and gradually i started to feel i was no more attached to or in control of my own body than i was gavins i dont mean that i stood or floated outside myself just that i was somewhere inside me that wasnt connected with the usual channels of communication let alone action i heard a noise like continual surf and the view went sort of grey and tunnellike for a bit i was suddenly aware of how delicately balanced we are on our two skinny legs and my skin seemed to be contracting pressing in all about me and going cold leaving sweat i wobbled apparently ash took me by the shoulders and sat me down on the little chair by the table she got janice to make some sweet tea i said thank you drank the tea shivered a bit and then ash dialled lochgair for me the phone was engaged but ashley kept trying it was a friend of mums from the village who answered initially i didnt think i was crying while i was on the phone i felt calm and in control and i spoke quietly to my mum who sounded trembly and yet flattoned and told me what had happened but after id put the phone down i found that my eyes were full of tears and my cheeks wet with them theyd dribbled round my chin and onto my chest inside the open shirt oh dear i said feeling that i ought to feel embarrassed ash handed me a clean tissue and i dabbed myself dry ill drive you back ashley said squatting in front of me in the hall my hands gathered in hers her long face serious eyes shining youve drunk too much weve both drunk too much i said anyway youve got to get to london start your new job i took a deep breath thanks though i bent forward kissed her nose she put her head down i sat back in the seat again and gazed over her head at the whitepainted wallpaper on the far side of the hallway she looked up into my eyes what happened prentice i shrugged crazy i said my gaze sliding away from those sternly concerned eyes to look at the worn hall carpet and an old red wine stain from a party two years ago just crazy ash patted my hands ill take you down in the morning then i can get them to hold the job there was no rush only if you want i dont know i said and really didnt i bent forward put my head between my knees and stared at the blacktaped edge of the carpet under the seat and the rough floorboards beyond i felt ash stroke my head her hands soft and gentle through my hair i didnt want to go to bed and anyway could not have slept she stayed up with me and we finished the real coffee and then the instant i talked about the family about rory and fiona and mum and dad thunder rolled over the city just before sunrise and i found myself laughing sitting there on the couch in the living room with ashley laughing at the thunder she held me shushed me the dawn came up dull at first then the clouds cleared from the west and a bright blue day was there ashley left a note for gav and janice helped me pack a bag i couldnt decide on anything then we left the old cv freshly pillarbox red after its latest respray puttered through the nearempty streets of the bright and silent city and rocked and rolled its way back down towards gallanach the weather was perfect the new day glorious i talked incessantly and ash listened sometimes smiled and seemed always to have a kind word we arrived at lochgair about breakfasttime with the sun shining through the trees and the birds loud in the garden ashley stopped the car at the opened gates at the end of the drive where it entered the courtyard ill drop you here okay she said oh come in i told her she shook her head yawned her long fawn hair shone in a beam of sunlight coming through the cars open side window i dont think so prentice ill get home get some sleep give me a call if theres anything i can do okay i nodded okay promise she smiled promise i said she leaned over put one hand behind my head and kissed my forehead i heard her take a breath like she was about to speak but then she exhaled just patted my head i put one arm round her held her for a moment then pulled away reached into the back and got my bag opened the door and got out thanks i said its okay prentice she said i closed the flimsy door the car revved up and turned round one skinny front wheel poking out alarmingly from its wheel arch the little citroen clattered off down the drive ashley stuck one hand out of the window and waved i raised my arm and held it there as i watched the car head away under the trees through the dappling light it paused at the main road then turned away its noise soon lost in the background of birdsong and windruffled leaves the cool morning air smelled clean and fresh i took a deep breath and rubbed my smarting eyes feeling spacedout from lack of sleep then i picked up my bag and turned to the house it was a welltravelled country dad told us within the oceanic depths of time that lay beneath the surface of the present there had been an age when appropriately an entire ocean had separated the rocks that would one day be called scotland from the rocks that would one day be called england and wales that first union came half a billion years ago some of those rocks were ancient even then two billion years and counting and shifting and moving across the face of the planet while that primaeval ocean shrank and closed and all that would become the british isles still lay south of the equator compressed and folded the rocks that would be scotland by then part of the continent of euramerica held within their crumpled tortuously layered cores the future shape of the land by a third of a billion years ago that part of euramerica lay on the equator covered by great fern forests that would be buried and folded and pressed and heated and so turn to oil and coal in the future that was yet to come meanwhile the mass of rocks afloat on the molten stone beneath were heading slowly northwards and sundering the climate became hot and the rains sparse the great dinosaurs treetall and househeavy tramped slowly through a semidesert while a new ocean opened to the west after the dinosaurs had gone and while the atlantic still grew the volcanoes erupted smothering the old rock on the surface under their own vast deep oceans of lava the land then held mountains higher than everest but they were worn down eventually by nothing harder than wind and water until much later still now that scotland was level with canada and siberia and the earth cooler the glaciers came covering the rocks with their own chill inverted image of the old and weathered lava plains the sheer mess of that frozen water etched the mountain rock like steel engraving glass and pressed the roots of those firefloating hills deeper into the dense sea of magma beneath then the climate changed again the glaciers retreated and the water they had held filled the oceans so that the waters rose and cut what would eventually be called the british isles off from mainland europe while the scoured abraded hills to the north set free at last from that compressing weight of ice rose slowly back out of the earth to be colonised again by plants and animals and people on walks on day trips and holidays he found and pointed out the signs that told of the past deciphering the symbols written into the fabric of the land in gallanach we saw the bright seam of white cretaceous sandstone that had provided the gallanach glass works with raw material for a century and a half on arran he showed us rocks folded like toffee ribboned and split on staffa the even keyboardregular columns of cooled lava in edinburgh the rubbletailed stumps of ancient volcanoes in glasgow the black petrified remains of trees three hundred million years old in lochaber the parallel roads that marked the shores of lochs dammed and undammed by glaciers millennia earlier throughout scotland we saw hanging valleys drumlins and corries and in the hebrides we walked the raised beaches where the ocean swells had crashed until the land rose and touched rocks two and a half billion years old half as old as earth itself a sixth of the age of the entire universe here was magic i remember thinking as we drove north towards benbecula one day looking out at the machair gaudy with flowers i was just old enough to grasp what dad had been telling us but still young enough to have to think about it in childish terms magic time was magic and geology physics chemistry all the big important words dad used they were all magic i sat listening to the cars engine as we drove mum at the wheel dad in the passenger seat shirtsleeved arm out of the volvos window lewis james and i in the back the car engine made a steady growling noise and i remember thinking it was funny that those longdead plants had been turned into the oil that had been turned into the petrol that made the car growl i chose to forget the absence of reptiles in those carboniferous forests and imagined that they had been populated by great dinosaurs and that they too had fallen into the ooze and made up part of the oil and that the noise the car made was like the angry bellowing growls they would have made while they were alive as though their last dying breath their last sound on this planet had been saved all these millions and millions of years to be exhaled along a little road on a little island pushing the mchoan family north one summer on our holidays i looked out of the open window the machair lay dazzling under the midsummer sunshine to our left prentice prentice oh prentice pray for your father hello uncle hamish i said as aunt tone ushered mother and me into the bedroom where my uncle lay propped up splendid but demented in a pair of blue cotton pyjamas and a red silk dressinggown decorated with blue dragons the room was behind dim closed curtains and smelled of apples mary oh mary uncle hamish said seeing my mother he clasped his hands together holding a black handkerchief his hair was a bit mussed and he had a stubble shadow id never seen him look so disarrayed in front of him there was a huge tray with short legs partly covered by a quartercompleted jigsaw puzzle i walked up to the bed and put my hand out i clutched uncle hatnishs still clasped hands held them briefly squeezed and let go closer inspection revealed that hamish was putting the jigsaw puzzle together upsidedown every cardboard flake was grey turned the wrong way up mum gave hamish a brief hug and we sat down on a couple of chairs on either side of the bed ill make some tea aunt tone said and quietly closed the door and biscuits shouted uncle hamish at the closed door and smiled broadly at first mum and then me after a moment though his face seemed to collapse and he looked like he was about to weep the door opened again whats that my dear aunt tone asked nothing uncle hamish said the mouthonly smile suddenly there again then fading just as quickly the door closed hamish peered down at the jigsaw puzzle toyed with a couple of the pieces looking for a place to fit them into what he had already completed the squint bottom edge of the puzzle some small spaces between joined pieces a few tiny flecks of cardboard half grey half coloured gathered like dust along the raised edges of the tray and a small pair of collapsible scissors lying on the bedspread near the pillows indicated that uncle hamish had not to put too fine a point on it been cheating thank you both for coming he said absently still fiddling with the grey pieces he sounded bored like he was talking to a couple of factory workers summoned to his office for some formality of business i appreciate it i exchanged looks with my mother who appeared close to tears again mum had done pretty well till now wed both cried a bit when ashley had deposited me at the gates of the house at lochgair but since then she had coped pretty well wed visited the good lawyer blawke that first day and the next day hed actually made a housecall a concession which extrapolating from the attitude of his secretary when she rang us up to tell us the sacred presence was on his way we ought to have treated with the sort of awe and respect the average person reserves for royalty and major religious figures i was a little surprised he didnt kneel and kiss the doorstep when he unfolded himself from his merc the undertaker had been dealt with a few reporters fended off lewis in london reassured that there was nothing he could do up here for now and told not to cancel his gig dates and james on a school trip in austria finally contacted he would arrive the day of the funeral one of his teachers would come back with him dads study proved to be a wilderness of papers disorganised files chaotic filing cabinets and an impressivelooking computer that neither mum nor i knew how to operate the afternoon i got back mum and i had stood looking at the machine knowing there might be stuff in it wed need to look at but unable to work out what to do with the damn thing after switching it on the relevant manual had disappeared mum had never touched a keyboard in her life and my computer expertise was confined to having a sound tactical sense of which alien to zap first and a leechlike grip on continuousfire buttons i know just the person i said and rang the watts house twentyfour hours before the funeral aunt tone had rung and said could we possibly come and see uncle hamish hed asked to see us and so here we were mum sat on the far side of the bed her eyes bright i cleared my throat how are you uncle hamish i asked he looked at my mother as if he thought shed talked not me he shrugged sorry to drag you out here he said his voice was flat emotionless i just wanted to say how how sorry i am and i want you all to forgive me even though i didnt didnt encourage him he insisted i told him not to do it he sighed and tried to press one of the cardboard pieces into place on the puzzle without success we were both a little the worse for wear and he said i did try i tried to stop him tried to talk to him but but he stopped talking tutted in apparent exasperation and took up the little scissors he trimmed a couple of fingernail sized bits of cardboard off the piece and forced it into place dont make the damn things right any more he muttered i began to wonder at the wisdom of leaving uncle h with a pair of scissors even small ones he looked at me headstrong he said brightly then looked down at the puzzle always was good liked him brother after all but there was no sense of god in him was there hamish looked at mum then me no sense of something greater than him was there mary he said turning back to mum proof all round us goodness and power but he wouldnt believe i tried to tell him saw the minister yesterday told him he hadnt tried hard enough he said he couldnt force people to go to church i said why not did in the old days why not uncle hamish took up another piece of grey cardboard turned it this way and that good enough then good enough now thats what i told him for their own good he grunted looked displeased idiot told me not to blame myself he said staring grimly at the puzzlepiece as though trying to pare bits off it with just the sharpness of his stare i said i dont i blame god or kenneth for for goading inciting him uncle hamish started to cry his bottom lip quivering like a childs there hamish mum said reaching out and stroking one of his hands what exactly happened uncle hamish i asked sounded to me like the man had cracked completely but i still wanted to see if he could come up with more details sorry sniffed hamish wiping his eyes then blowing his nose into the black hanky he put the hanky in his breast pocket clasped his hands on the edge of the tray holding the jigsaw and lowered his head a little seeming to address the centre of the puzzle his thumbs started to circle each other going round and round we had a few drinks wed met in the town id been at the steam packet meeting with some people showed them round the factory in the morning just paperweights man from harrods nice lunch thought id look for a present for antonias birthday bumped into kenneth coming out of the stationers went for a pint bit like the old days really here we are aunt antonia announced from the door appearing with a tray full of crockery there was a pause while tea was poured biscuits dispensed shall i stay here dear aunt tone asked hamish i thought she looked worse than mum did her face was drawn there were dark shadows under her eyes even her brown bunned hair looked greyer than i remembered her husband ignored her talking on as before though now having apparently shifted his attention to the cup of tea aunt tone had placed in front of him on the puzzle tray his thumbs were still circling each other went to the argyll lounge good view of the harbour from there drank pints it was like when we were younger had a cigar good chat really rang the office said i was playing truant he rang lochgair we were going to go for a chinese meal just for old times sake but we never got round to it thought it would be fun to go on a bit of a pubcrawl so we went on to the gallery bar in the steam packet that was where we started talking about faith uncle hamish stopped talking took up his cup of tea sipped quickly from it without raising his gaze from the tray then replaced the cup in the saucer he called me a crackpot hamish said his eyebrows rose up his forehead his voice rose too then it fell again as he said i called him a fool hamish looked quickly furtively at my mother sorry he mumbled and looked forward at the tray and the puzzle again he sighed his thumbs kept going round i told him christ loved him and he just laughed hamish complained he refused to see he refused to understand i told him he was like a blind man like somebody who would not open their eyes all he had to do was accept christ into his life and suddenly everything would fall into place the world would look a different place a whole new plane of existence would open up i explained that all we did here was merely a preparation for the next life where we would be judged punished and rewarded hamish shook his head face radiating dismay he went all snide asked me when exactly id had the brain bypass operation god or whatever help me at that point despite it all i had to stifle a guffaw i coughed and dabbed at my suddenly brimming eyes with a tissue hamish rattled on i told him that only religion gave any meaning to life only god as an absolute gave us a peg to hang our philosophies on what was the meaning of life otherwise he said what meaning he said how long is a piece of string and what colour is the wind uncle hamish shook his head again i told him faith was love the most beautiful thing in the world he said it was nonsense surrendering our humanity humanity hamish scoffed religion gives us rules it can keep people from doing wrong it helps us be good but he wasnt having it would not listen religion is politics he told me several times as though repeating it made it true religion is politics religion is politics blasphemed we left the last bar cant even remember which one it was to be honest and we were walking back here for a nightcap i think coming along shore road i left the car in the steam packet hotel car park of course and we had some argument about the shore street church he said he liked it liked the architecture but it was really a testament to the skill of humans not to the glory of god and just a symbol i said it was the house of god and hed better not trespass hamish looked up at mum for a moment he was walking along the wall you see mum nodded hamish was already staring at the tray again he said what was any church or temple but a giant hollow idol i told him he was sick he said he was infected with reason i said reason was his god and it was false it was the true idol hamish sighed the street was wet there had been rain i remember noticing that kenneth shouted at me told me hamish shook his head he said hamish all the gods are false faith itself is idolatry uncle hamish swivelled his big grey head and gazed gloomily at me his eyes looked cold and jellylike they reminded me of frogspawn discovered in some ditch all the gods are false faith itself is idolatry uncle hamish breathed staring at me i shivered can you credit that prentice he looked down away from me shaking his head hamish returned his gaze to the puzzle tray his thumbs kept circling i cant remember exactly what he said hamish whispered and then sighed but he jumped off the wall and ran over to the church he started climbing i heard my mother sob once very quietly i had to climb over the wall hamish breathed gate was locked by the time i got there he was out of reach i thought he was shinning up a drainpipe just assumed heard rumbles i think but didnt think anything of it no flashes that i can remember kenneth was yelling and swearing and shouting imprecations calling down all sorts of punishment i was trying to get him to come down told him hed fall told him the police were coming told him to think of his family but he kept climbing i studied my hands in the pinktinged light turning them over and looking at the lines on my palm the veins on the back i tried to imagine dad climbing up that tower hauling himself up hand over hand sweating and straining in the darkness trusting to his own strength and the cool metal strip beneath his hands the block beneath me was silent now the last of the waves had retreated from it and were breaking further down the beach as the tide went out the sky was still gaudy with crimson clouds though much of the brightness had gone i glanced at my watch i ought to be jumping down off this thing and heading back to the road it was a rough hike over the headland and dangerous in the dark but the red streaks of the clouds were dissolving as the sunset went on leaving the sky clear above me this near the centre of the year on a clear night it would never get totally dark i had a while yet but i wouldnt leave it too late mum would worry that would just be the cherry on it me taking the crow road too uncle hamish took another sip of his tea frowned at the cup and spat the tea back into it cold he said apologetically to his wife he dabbed at his lips with his handkerchief i realised only then i hadnt touched the cup that aunt tone had poured for me hamish went on there was a very strange noise a sort of humming noise seemed to come from under my feet from the stones of the church couldnt work out what it was thought it was the drink or just the effect of looking up like that craning my neck but it wouldnt go away and it got louder and i felt my hair stand on end i shouted up to kenneth he was about halfway up still climbing then there was a flash a blinding flash saw a glowing red line in front of me like a vein of burning blood like lava in front of me noise terrific smell of sulphur something of that nature smell of the devil though i think that was just coincidence fell down half blind thought a bomb had gone off heard ringing like the church bells all going on at once uncle hamish went to sip from his tea again then thought the better of it and put the cup back on the saucer realised it had been lightning i still couldnt believe it found kenneth behind me lying on the grass and a sort of slab thing over a grave hands burned been climbing the lightning conductor blew him off dont know if that would have killed him but hed landed on the stone dead blood from his head hamish looked slowly over at mum who was crying silently sorry he told her she didnt say anything idiot i whispered sitting there on darrens great grey concrete block idiot i said and for once i wasnt talking to myself idiot i shouted at the sky idiot i bellowed hands clawing at the pitted concrete surface beneath me idiot i screamed emptying my lungs to the soft sea airs coughing and choking i sat there tears in my eyes breathing hard eventually i wiped my nose on my shirt sleeve feeling like a little kid again and then sniffed swallowed and breathed slower clenching my teeth to stop my jaw trembling i sat back shivering legs out straight in front arms behind hands splayed on the rough concrete i thought about them all dad falling grandma margot falling darren broken against the tombwhite concrete of a council litter bin aunt fiona through the windscreen of the aston martin neck snapped into the young trees by the roadside and who knew what had happened to rory well in a day or two i was going to start trying to find out so far mum and i with ashleys help had only dealt with the papers and files we had to to deal with the legal formalities but there was a lot more stuff to go through and somewhere in all that bumf there might be something that would tell us about uncle rory and why dad had always been so sure his brother was still alive but for all we knew hed died a roadside death too uncle hamish turned to me swear he was still alive he nodded frowning at me i raised my eyebrows feeling very cold inside hamish nodded again still alive he said something to me i swear kenneth said see hamish shook his head said that to me said see without opening his eyes he looked down at his rotating thumbs his frown seemed to stop them that was what he said and it was so wrong such a silly silly thing to say that i thought i must have only thought i heard it but im sure thats what he said see uncle hamish shook his head see he kept shaking his head see he turned to me can you credit that prentice he looked away again before i could think of what to say see he repeated to the tray with the ruined puzzle and shook his head again see excuse me mum got up and left the room crying hamish stared at the cardboard puzzle aunt antonia sat at the end of the bed staring holloweyed at her silent husband the tray over uncle hamishs legs started to vibrate i could see the duvet over uncle hamishs thighs shaking the bed began to squeak my uncle stared appalled at the tray on his lap as the little grey pieces of the upturned puzzle migrated across the vibrating surface of the tray gradually collecting against one edge the spasms in uncle hamishs legs seemed to grow more severe the cup of tea id put on the bedside table near my right elbow snowed a concentric pattern ot standing ripples i suddenly thought of the scene in the unbelievable prevalence of bonking when the tanks enter prague uncle hamish made a strange keening noise aunt tone patted his feet under the duvet and rose from the end of the bed ill get your pills dear she left the room hamish turned to me his whole body shaking now the puzzle on the tray starting to break up as the tray bounced up and down beneath it jealous hamish croaked through clenched teeth jealous prentice jealous jealous jealous god jealous i got up slowly patted his trembling hands and smiled ive always had this fantasy that after uncle rory borrowed his flatmate andys motorbike and headed off into the sunset he crashed somewhere maybe coming down to gallanach came off the road and fell down some gully nobodys looked in for the last ten years or rather more likely i suppose crashed into the water and theres a suzuki gt lying just under the waves of loch lomond or loch long or loch fyne its rider somehow entangled in it reduced by now to a skeleton in borrowed leathers somewhere underwater perhaps between here and glasgow and we all pass it every time we make the journey maybe only a few tens of metres away from him and very possibly will never know i know that dad who had indeed assumed that rory had been on his way here drove the glasgow road a few times immediately after andy and then janice raised the alarm looking for some sign of an accident a skid mark a damaged fence or wall always wondering if maybe his brother was lying unconscious or paralysed in a field or a ditch somewhere invisible from the road but all he ever found were road cones assorted litter and the occasional dead sheep or deer whatever neither dad nor the police ever found any trace of rory or the bike no unidentified bodies turned up that could have been his and no hospitals received any unknown coma victims fitting his description i dont think any of us ever mentioned suicide but i at least considered the possibility that he had killed himself rory had been depressed after all his one success had been a travel book written a decade earlier and everything else hed tried since had failed to live up to that he had recently failed to become a tv presenter a job hed thought beneath him but which he needed for the money and so had been all the more galled when he hadnt been chosen and maybe too hed finally admitted to himself he was never going to write his magnum opus hell his life just wasnt going anywhere special people kill themselves for poorer reasons i reckoned the chances of him being under the waves somewhere improved significantly if he had committed suicide he could have picked his spot to drive straight at a wall or a crash barrier maybe on top of a cliff could be anywhere i could think of a few places further north in the highlands which would be perfect if hed tied himself to the bike somehow but why go to the effort of doing that in the first place it wasnt as though there was some big insurance sum involved or any funny business with wills or family money rory had inherited some capital when grandad died held in trust until he was eighteen hed used that up travelling round india the first time then lived off the success of traps and later the declining advances and journalistic commissions hed received after that when hed disappeared hed had a small overdraft maybe hed been murdered id thought of that years ago even on the evening wed heard he was missing i had been playing down on the shore of loch gair with helen and diana urvill and when we came back for our tea there was a police car in the courtyard of the house a police car i recall thinking getting all excited of course in my fantasy i was the one who discovered rorys evil murderer and brought him to justice or fought with him and watched him fall off a cliff or into a combine harvester or under a steamroller or whatever only i couldnt see that anybody had had much of a motive it had crossed my mind that it might have something to do with crow road somebody wanted to steal the idea and keep rory out of the way but it wasnt even as though there was much to steal notes and poems wow i stood up on the silent concrete block and dusted my hands off the disappearing clouds were the colour of dried blood in a sky gone close to purple more stars were coming out a contrail blazed pink overhead as a plane headed for america i looked at my watch i had to go id told mum id be back for supper in an hour or so we were expecting lewis and verity that evening they were flying up from london where lewis had been working and they would hire a car at glasgow they might be back when i returned shouldnt have mentioned you uncle hamish said as i walked to the door of the dim bedroom i turned back he was still trembling it hurt me to look at him the way it hurts to hear nails scraped down a blackboard shouldnt have said anything about you prentice he said the words whistling out between his clenched teeth i could hear aunt tones footsteps coming up the stairs in the hall outside shouldnt have said prentice shouldnt have said said what uncle i said hand on the door knob that you were closer to me that id won you saved you from his heathen faith uncle hamishs eyes stared at me from a shaking ashgrey face i nodded and smiled at him oh well i said the door opened and i got out of the way of aunt tone bearing pills and a glass of water see you tomorrow prentice she whispered to me she patted my arm thank you its all right see you tomorrow aunt tone outside on the landing i looked down the stairs to where my mother was standing by the front door putting on her jacket i leant back against the closed bedroom door for just a second and looking at nothing in particular said very quietly to myself see i went to the landside edge of the concrete cube and faced back at the remains of the sunset trying to work out how i was going to feel seeing lewis and verity again after the way id behaved at new year but search as i tried i could find no trace of dread or jealousy i was even looking forward to seeing them again something of the coldness that had settled over me in the last few days seemed to have spread to the way i felt about verity it felt like all my jealous passion had dissipated like the clouds overhead i thought about jumping down onto the beach but that might have been asking for another family tragedy so i climbed down walked to the end of the shallow scoop of bay and set off through the grass by the side of the burn heading back to gallanach through the calm summer gloaming he told us about the plants on the islands too how the open glorious machair between the dunes and the farmed land was so dizzily sumptuous with flowers because it was the place where the acidic peat and the alkali sands produced a neutral ground where more plants could flourish in the sunlight and just the names of those plants were a delight almost a litany marsh samphire procumbent pearlwort sandspurrey autumnal hawkbit cathartic flax kidney vetch germander speedwell hastate orache sea spleenwort eyebright we learned about the people who had made scotland their home the huntergatherers of eight or nine thousand years ago nomads wandering the single great wood and stalking deer or camping by the edge of the sea and leaving only piles of shells for us to find the first farmers just beginning to clear the land of the blanket of thick forest a few millennia later the neolithic people who had built the tomb of maes howe before the pyramids were constructed and the stone circle at callanish before stonehenge in the thousandyear summer of the third millenium then came the bronze age and iron age people the vikings and picts romans and celts and scots and angles and saxons who had all found their way to this oceanically marginal little corner of northern europe and left on the place their own marks the treeless slopes themselves the roads and walls cairns and forts tombs standing stones souterrains crannogs and farms and houses and churches and the oil refineries nuclear power stations and missile ranges too he made up stories about the secret mountain and the sanddrowned forest the flood that turned to wood the zombie peat and the stonebeings that drilled for air sometimes the location for or the subject of a story would have some basis in fact the secret mountain was a real hill on which grew a flower that grew nowhere else in the world there had indeed been great storms that had moved whole ranges of sand dunes inland drowning forests and villages and peat was undead the surrounding rocks acidity the chill atlantic airs and everlikely rain conspiring to prevent the corpses of the dead plants from decomposing other stories were pure fantasy the result of a kind of childlike quality in him i think if you looked at certain stands of trees from a distance especially in a glen and when in full leaf they did look like great bulging torrents of green water bursting from the depths of the earth and somehow frozen there was a sort of visual naivety at work there that verged on the hallucinogenic but it did id argue make a warped sort of visual sense magmites the people who lived in the mantle of the earth beneath the crust and who were drilling up for air the way we were drilling down for oil must just have appealed to that part of him that loved turning things around opposites and images fascinated him excited him magicked inspired absurdity from him i think uncle rory would have given almost anything to have tapped the lush gravidity of that source as well telling us straight or through his stories my father taught us that there was generally a fire at the core of things and that change was the only constant and that we like everybody else were both the most important people in the universe and utterly without significance depending and that individuals mattered before their institutions and that people were people much the same everywhere and when they appeared to do things that were stupid or evil often you hadnt been told the whole story but that sometimes people did behave badly usually because some idea had taken hold of them and given them an excuse to regard other people as expendable or bad and that was part of who we were too as a species and it wasnt always possible to know that you were right and they were wrong but the important thing was to keep trying to find out and always to face the truth because truth mattered i suppose we all want to pass on our beliefs they seem even more our own than the genes we transmit but maybe they are largely inherited too even if sometimes what you inherit is the exact opposite the reversed image of what was intended sometimes i felt he was trying to brainwash us that he wanted us to be images of himself thinking the way he thought doing what he would have done as if that would help him cheat death make him less mortal somehow then all his parables and laws seemed like megalomania and his reasoned certainties like dogma other times he seemed genuinely altruistic and on occasion i thought i could sense something like desperation in him trying so hard to equip us as best he could for the vicissitudes of life while the world changed all around us so fast that some of his ideas and theories which had seemed so important to him in his life and so crucial for us to know in turn became irrelevant were proved wrong or just shown to be not so important after all my mother was different and always had been i dont think she ever really laid down the law like that not even once she just got on with things we knew we were loved and we knew when something wed done was disapproved of but she trained us by example and let us make mistakes the only idea i think she could ever be accused of trying to put into our heads was the welcome realisation that whatever happened to us shed be there im not sure that it wasnt the more effective method in the end and in its own way more confident too half an hour after id left darrens postpostmodernist concrete block i stood in the dusk light beneath the dun on the hill of bac chrom within sight of the track at last the lights of slockavullin village beneath me the eastern edge of gallanach a thin grid of orange sparks to my right the main road to oban and the north busy with lights of white and orange and red and the dark landscape below full of soft undulations littered with chambered cairns cup and ring marked rocks standing stones tumuli and ancient forts all the gods are false i thought faith itself is idolatry i looked into that ancient cluttered darkness wondering chapter so anyway bro how are things lewis shook his head slowly and deliberately he held up his whisky glass and studied it from close range focusing with explicit care one eye at a time i formed the impression he was attempting to fix the tumblers image in his memory so hed know the identity of the receptacle to blame come the following morning i was so drunk at the time this actually seemed like quite a smart idea and i would probably have attempted to do the same thing myself if id thought i was remotely capable of coordinating my hand eyes and brain to that degree the only reason i could get my drinking hand and my mouth in roughly the same place at approximately the same time at this stage in the evening was because id had so much recent practice at it and even that comparatively simple system wasnt a hundred per cent any more id missed my mouth twice already and spilled small amounts of whisky onto my chin and shirt id carried it off with dignity though lewis looked like he was going to sleep either that or the superior intellect of the whisky glass had hypnotised him i knew the problem lewis i said wha what he looked at me confused i was saying i said how are things oh he said and sighed i dont know he frowned verity said to me just yesterday she said lewis i dont think we understand each other any more what did you say i sipped my whisky carefully i said whadaya mean lewis snarled then he burst out laughing it must have been infectious laughter because i started laughing too and then we were both laughing but we couldnt have been that drunk because we didnt overdo it five minutes later well maybe ten absolute max wed stopped laughing almost entirely really i said wiping my eyes lewis shook his head na course not everythings was pure dead brilliant actually good i said and drank i meant it too but even as i realised that i meant it i thought ah its just the drink ill be worse in the morning still i looked up at lewis and said i think im better better lewis began giggling better than yesterday mr creosote i started to laugh better get a bucket lewis howled but couldnt manage the rest of the line because by then we were on the floor i laughed until my ears hurt i stood beneath the larches in the rain holding an umbrella wearing a kilt and feeling a little selfconscious the stand of dripping trees had gone yellow and dropped their needles during the last few weeks turning the ground beneath them a dully shining blond that seemed like a tinted mirror to the ashbright expanse of overcast sky i touched the plain black obelisk slick and cold in the chill october rain behind me the noise from the marquee an increasing choir of chattering voices was slowly drowning the patter of the drizzle as it fell through the twigs and branches above onto the sodden ground a busy buzzy shared excitement displacing what the solitary soul perceived as a sort of tranquil gloom what guy i thought what is ash going to show me who and already thought i might have guessed shit i didnt like the sound of this the rain came on harder and i listened to it drumming on the taut black skin of the umbrella remembering remembering remember the river game remember the black river game ha we were digging dads grave waist deep in the rich black earth of lochgair partially shielded from the house by the dense mass of rhodie bushes and tall tangles of wild roses jimmy turrock the council workman sent from the municipal cemetery to dig the grave officially and whod been in the same class as lewis at school was sitting against the wheel of his miniature earthmover arms folded head back mouth open snoring that morning over breakfast lewis and i had decided wed dig the hole ourselves if nothing else it would take our minds off our hangovers which were industrial strength the river game was something dad made up himself he did it for lewis and me the first version was roughed out in a big sketch book while he tinkered with the rules when he was happy with it all he got a big bit of white cardboard from a display company in glasgow drew out the playing surface painted it sprayed it with lacquer and edged the board with black tape hed bought various lego packs and made the ships and the cargoes out of those the rules were typed the cards were printed on labels and they were stuck onto the back of ordinary playing cards we were presented with the result as a sort of extra present to be shared between lewis and me for christmas james was still a bit young hed only have chewed the ships and choked on the cargoes lewis who had asked for and got a television for his room and a new walkman had the good grace to express gratitude i was still celebrating having finally worn down dads resistance to having a computer in the house and was therefore far too busy kicking pixel and restaging the attack of the imperial atats on the rebel snow trenches to be bothered sparing more than the most cursory glance at what was when all was said and done a lump of amateurishly painted cardboard a handful of nonmotorised and very basic lego bits a few adulterated cards and what looked suspiciously like an exam paper yeah great dad got any more pp batteries for this wee car the one out your calculator didnt last long was about as enthusiastic as i got about the game for most of the festive period later i deigned to play the river game was based on trade dad had wanted something that would distract us from all the war games lewis and i played soldiers with our friends in the woods battles with our toys wars on friends computers he really wanted something noncapitalistic as well as nonmilitary but the river game was going to be just his first effort he would he told us be working on something much more righton once he had the time to spare hed see if we liked the river game first you had two or three ships you sailed them from a port on one side of the board to a port on the other side through what was either a big loch or lake choked with islands or a piece of territory with an awful lot of waterways snaking through it depending how you chose to look at it you picked up cargo at the second port and sailed back the cargo was worth a certain amount when you got back to your home port and with the money you could buy more ships configured for speed or capacity there were at least half a dozen major routes from one port to the other and basically the shorter the route you took the more hazardous it was there were whirlpools channels prone to rock falls stretches of river where the sandbanks changed all the time and so on the weather had a chance to change every few moves and how much the different types of cargo were worth depended on oh what your opponents had chosen to carry what the weather was whether the month had an r in it i cant remember it all it was quite a fun game mildly addictive with a reasonable balance of skill and luck and lewis and i eventually got quite a few of our friends playing it but the truth is it improved dramatically when lewis with my help drew up an extra set of rules which let you build warships we played that game for weeks before dad caught us at it in the conservatory one rainy may day and asked how come there were all these ships with funnycoloured cargoes clustered so close together and surrounded by wrecks where there were no hazards oops we called it the black river game dad even objected to the title he had been working on a new improved version of the original game that involved using some of the money to build railways across the board you laid track you built bridges dug tunnels coped with rock falls and marshes and recalcitrant land owners and the first one to finish his or her railway was in effect the winner but he stopped work on this sophistication when he found us acting out furiously destructive naval engagements on his painstakingly crafted board he didnt take it away though i think for a while he was trying to develop another noncombative game that hed defy us to turn martial but it stayed at the development stage and never did see the light of day i stopped digging for a moment wiped some sweat from my brow with the hem of my tshirt which was lying on the ground at the head of the grave i leant on my shovel looking at jimmy turrocks upended face while he snored lewis stopped digging for a moment too breathing hard i said we disappointed him though didnt we lewis shrugged he took a handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped his face oh prentice come on boys will be boys dad knew that yeah but he expected better of us dads always do its traditional we turned out not too bad neither of us did as well as he expected at uni i said id told lewis though not my mother that i was fairly certain id failed my finals well for a start he didnt know about you lewis said scraping some earth off the blade of his spade and he was smart enough to know degrees arent everything come on were not in prison were not junkies and were not young tories he waggled his eyebrows its no small achievement i suppose i said and started digging again pity hed mentioned prison another thing i hadnt told lewis about was that id been nicked for shoplifting not that id be going to prison but its the thought that counts lewis kept on digging we could have done worse he insisted we could have done better i said shovelling another load of earth out of the pit lewis was silent for a while then said quietly better than yesterday i laughed in spite of myself and in spite of the grave and my aching head and still bruised heart shut up i said please lewis shut up i encountered another rhodie root and attacked it with the hacksaw then took up the spade again blinking sweat out of my eyes and waving a couple of flies away lewis muttered almost inaudibly as he dug its only waffer thin we snorted and guffawed for a while then took a break for yet more irnbru sitting at the edge of the grave legs dangling into it with jimmy turrock still blissfully and vocally in the land of nod across the grave in front of us i drank deeply from the bottle passed it to lewis he finished it grimaced looked at the bottle you know ive finally realised what this stuff reminds me of he said and belched heavily i followed suit trumping his sonorous burp with one that disturbed a few drowsy crows from nearby trees and even had jimmy turrock stir in his sleep what i said chewing gum lewis said screwing the cap back on the bottle and chucking it into the grass near the council earthdigger i nodded wisely yeah right enough we sat there silent for a while i looked at jimmy turrocks spotty openmouthed face and his wispy red hair his snores sounded like somebody forever trying to start a badlytuned buzzsaw i listened to it for a while and watched a couple of flies buzzing around in a tight but complicated holding pattern in front of his mouth as though daring each other to be the first to investigate inside after a while they broke off though and settled for exploring the rough landscape of jimmys checked shirt my head hurt come to that almost everything hurt ah well selfinflicted wounds jimmy turrock snored on oblivious lewis and verity had arrived the night before an hour after id got back from my sunset visit to darrens seaside sculpture their plane had been late and theyd had problems hiring the car so they arrived nearly two hours later than wed expected rather than phone from the airport lewis had hired a mobile along with the car but then when theyd tried to use it it hadnt worked the upshot was that mum and i had been getting into a fine panic and id been dreading watching the news and were just getting reports of an incident at glasgow airport details still coming in i mean statistics tell you family tragedies oughtnt to come in quite such close succession but jeez it gets to you when somebody dies as unexpectedly as dad suddenly everybody you know seems vulnerable and you fear for them all every phonecall sends your heart racing every car journey anyone takes you want to say oh god be careful dont go above second gear have you thought of fitting airbags is your journey really necessary be careful be careful be careful so there we were mum and i sitting watching the television on the couch together side by side holding hands tightly without even realising it and watching the television but not taking in what we were watching and dreading the sound of the phone and waiting waiting waiting for the sound of a car coming up the drive until i heard it and leapt over the couch and hauled open the curtains and the car drew up and lewis waved at me as he got out and i whooped its them to my mum who smiled and relaxed and looked suddenly beautiful again there was a big threecornered hug in the hall then mum saw verity standing by the door taking a very long deliberate time to take her jacket off and hang it up and so she was brought into the scrum too and that was the first time i realised that id ever actually embraced her even if it was just one arm round her slim shoulders it was all right then the phone rang mum and i jumped i got it mum took lewis and verity into the lounge hello hello shouted a voice of immodestly robust proportions to whom am i talking the booming voice demanded it was aunt ilsa wed left a message at the only contact address we had for her two days earlier she was in ladakh a place so out of the way it would take several international airports a major rail terminus and substantial investment in a network ot eightlane highways to promote it to the status of being in the middle of nowhere its prentice aunt ilsa there was a satellite delay i was talking to what i suspected was the only satellite ground station between islamabad and ulaan baatar there was a lot of noise in the background it sounded like people shouting and a mule or something hello there prentice aunt ilsa bellowed how are you why did you want me to call perhaps i thought shed been taking steroids and theyd all gone to her vocal chords im theres ello some bad news im afraid what youll have to speak up my dear the hotelier is proving refractory its dad i said thinking i might as well get this over with as quickly as possible kenneth your brother im afraid hes dead he died three days ago good god what on earth happened aunt ilsa rumbled i could hear shouting the thing that sounded like a mule went into what appeared to be a fit of coughing mr gibbon roared aunt ilsa will you control that fellow he was struck by lightning i said lightning aunt ilsa thundered yes good god where was he was he on a boat or he was golf course mr hello mr gibbon had a friend once who was struck by lightning on a golf course in marbella right at the top of his backswing bu no he was course it was an iron climbing i said number seven i think what he was climbing i shouted i could hear what sounded like a fight going on at the other end of the phone climbing a church a church aunt ilsa demanded im afraid so listen aunt ilsa but he wouldnt be seen dead near a church i bared my teeth at the phone and growled my aunt the unconscious humorist im afraid thats what happened i said as evenly as i could the funeral is tomorrow i dont suppose you can make it can you there was a noise of some ladakhian confusion for a while then fortissimo ill have to leave you now lewis prentice i breathed through gritted teeth our yak has escaped tell your mother our thoughts are with her at and it was goodbye downlink i looked at the phone im not sure you have any to spare aunt i said and put the phone down with a feeling of relief i need a drink i said to myself i strode purposefully towards the lounge lewis had been marginally more sensible than me later on that night before the funeral hed gone to bed one whisky before i had leaving me in the lounge alone at about three in the morning i should have gone then too but i didnt so i was left to get morose and selfpitying reliving another evening in this room another whiskyconnected twosome over a year earlier but its not fair prentice and dont tell me life isnt fair aw think son dad said sitting forward in his seat clutching his glass with both hands his eyes fixed on mine i looked down glaring at his reflection on the glasstopped coffee table between us fairness is something we made up he said its an idea the universe isnt fair or unfair it works by mathematics physics chemistry biochemistry things happen it takes a mind to come along and call them fair or not and thats it is it i said bitterly he just dies and theres nothing else i could feel myself quivering with emotion i was trying hard not to cry theres whatever he left behind art in darrens case thats more than most get and theres how people remember him and there might have been children not very likely in darrens case was it i sneered grabbing at any opportunity to score even the smallest rhetorical point over my father dad shrugged staring into his whisky even so he drank looked at me over the top of the tumbler but the rest he said is just cells molecules atoms once the electricity the chemistry stops working in your brain thats it no more youre history thats defeatist thats smallminded he shook his head no what youre proposing is he said slurring his words a little he pointed one finger at me youre too frightened to admit how big everything else is what the scales of the universe are compared to ours distance and time you cant accept that individually were microscopic here for an eyeblink might be heading for better things but no guarantees trouble is people cant believe theyre not the centre of things so they come up with all these pathetic stories about god and life after death and life before birth but thats cowardice sheer cowardice and because its the product of cowardice it promotes it the lord is my shepherd thanks a fucking lot so weve to live like sheep cowardice and cruelty but everythings okay because were doing the lords work fuck the silicosis get down that mine and work nigger aw shucks sure we skinned her alive and threw her in the salt pans but we were only doing it to save her soul lordy lordy gimme that old time religion and original sin another baby for perdition shit original sin what sick fuckwit thought that one up dad drained his glass and put it down on the glasstopped table between us feel sorry for yourself because your friends dead if you want prentice he said suddenly calm and sober but dont try to dignify it with whats supposed to be metaphysical angst its also known as superstitious shit and you werent brought up to speak that language well thanks for the fucking censorship dad i yelled i jumped up and slammed my own glass down the table top cracked a single big flaw crossed deep and green and not quite straight like a dull ribbon of silk somehow suddenly embedded in the thick glass from one edge of the table to the other almost underneath our tumblers dad stared at it then snorted chuckling hey yeah a symbol he shook his head glum muttering as he sat back hate the fuckers i hesitated looking at the cracked glass instinct or training telling me to apologise but then did what id intended to do and set about storming out of the room just fuck off dad i said before i slammed the door he looked up pursed his lips and nodded as though id asked him to remember and put the lights out before he went to bed yup okay he waved one hand night i lay in bed seething thinking of all the smart things i should have said until i fell into a troubled sleep i woke early and left before anybody else was up driving my hangover back to glasgow and shouting at caravans that got in my way and that was the last meaningful full and frank exchange of views with my dad that i ever had i wish he hadnt died right now i said i didnt look at lewis i was still looking at jimmy turrock asleep against the wheel of his council digger i wish i could i wish we could have started talking again one of the two flies exploring the cotton landscape of jimmys shirt suddenly buzzed up to his forehead his snoring hesitated then went on it was so stupid i shook my head i was so stupid yeah lewis said after a bit well thats just the way it is prentice you werent to know i heard lewis sigh there was something i wish id told him too could have said over the phone end of last week i looked at lewis oh yeah lewis looked awkward he crossed his arms and sucked at his bottom lip he glanced at me were you really that you know keen on verity i mean are you i kicked my heels against the sides of the grave checked out a couple of tree roots wed have to tackle before we could dig much deeper i shrugged ah it was just infatuation i suppose i mean you know ill always like her but all that stuff at new year that was well partly the drink but mostly just sibling rivalry sibling jealousy i said we both grinned he still looked awkward this time instead of sucking his bottom lip he bit his top one i knew just like that you are getting married i said gulping lewis looked at me with wide eyes shes pregnant i spluttered contralto lewiss mouth was hanging open he shut it quickly he wiped his face with the hanky his eyebrows and eyes registered surprise um both he said almost certainly he rung the hanky out over the hole but it didnt drip still though we would leave a fair amount of sweat in our fathers grave lewis nodded and his smile was flickering uncertain i hadnt seen him look so unsure of himself since the time when he was sixteen and i almost had him convinced the boxer rebellion had been about underpants fooof i said seemed as appropriate as anything i stared over at jimmy turrock blinking lewis was making a clicking noise with his mouth he cleared his throat wasnt exactly planned to tell the truth but well i mean we both you know want it so and well you know how i feel about marriage and all that stuff but fuck it it just keeps things simple he sounded almost apologetic i shook my head and turning to him with a big smile i said you total bastard i put my hands on my hips he looked concerned but i guess my grin must have looked sincere you total complete and utter bastard i hate you i told him but i hope youre disgustingly happy i hesitated just a little then i hugged him obscenely happy i said probably have cried but i was pretty cried out by that stage man he breathed into my shoulder i didnt know how youd take it in the neck i said pushing him away told mum wanted to wait till after the funeral mind you i was going to wait till then to tell you too so maybe veritys spilling the beans right now so whens the big event which one lewis smiled embarrassed i do believe he shrugged we thought october and the sprog thinks march i let out a long shuddering sigh head feeling a bit swimmy marriage eh i said shaking my head again i looked him down and up hoisted one brow think youll take to it lewis grinned like a lemming to water i laughed eventually i laughed so loudly i woke jimmy turrock who looked at me sitting on the edge of my fathers grave on the day of his burial guffawing away fit to wake the living with undisguised horror like a lemming to water lewis knew as well as i did the maligned little buggers are perfectly good swimmers james arrived back about midday he was well pretty distressed and all the fragile defences mum lewis and i had been constructing for the past few days lewis and i joking mum staying quiet and keeping busy crumbled james seemed to blame dad blame us blame everybody he was ugly with anger and he was like a racing outboard in the calm little pond wed been trying to create the house felt hellish and we all started snapping at each other outside at the back of the garden we could hear the council digger excavating the rest of the hole the engine revved up and down it sounded like a machine snoring james wished us all dead and ran up to his room and slammed the door it was a relief to get back out to the grave and help jimmy turrock apply the finishing touches then it was time to get showered and changed and wait for the hearse and the mourners the funeral was suitably grim despite the sunshine and the warm breeze the words lewis said over the grave sounded awkward and forced mum looked white as paper james stood mouth twisted furious he stalked off the instant the coffin touched the bottom of the grave i threw some earth down onto the pale wood of the lid putting back a little of what id helped dig out but it passed and the people who came a good hundred or more were kind we were busy in the house afterwards feeding and watering them and then that passed too my big brother and his intended asked me to be their best man the day after dads funeral id slept fitfully on the idea but finally said yes it had already been agreed between the two families that the wedding would be held at lochgair lewis and verity stayed another day after that then left to go back to london so that lewis could resume his gigs he was almost ashamed when i saw him next when he confessed that nobody thought his delivery had altered a bit he was just the same on stage after dads death as he had been before the only thing he changed was that he stopped telling the joke about the uncle that dies in an avalanche on a dry skislope i told him not to worry about it you had to be a different person on stage the person he was up there would only change if he told a story about dad dying maybe a routine based on the idea of an atheist getting struck by lightning while climbing a church tower would be therapeutic for him one day lewis had the decency to be appalled at the idea mum and i went through dads papers and were able after ashleys tuition to work the computer and access the information it held dads will which had been written at the time of grandma margots death had turned up in the strongbox hidden under the study floorboards the strongbox had been no big secret we all knew about it it was just something to make any burglars job more difficult mum had already seen the will when she had opened the strongbox the morning after dads death in the company of one of her friends from the village she had only looked at the first paragraph which confirmed that dad wanted to be buried in the grounds of the house shed been too upset to look at any more of it and had put the will back under the floor so we opened the strongbox again divided the papers took a desk each and looked at what we had mum had given the pile with the will in it to me i read it first and my heart sank after id scanned quickly through it and got to the end oh no i said whats wrong she asked from the main desk in front of the window its the will i said turning it over looking at the last part again looking over the page but still failing to find what i was looking for it hasnt been witnessed or anything mum came over and stood behind me she took the four handwritten sheets from me frowning her skin was pale and her eyes looked dark she wore black jeans and a dark blue shirt and her hair was tied back with a piece of blue ribbon she handed the will back to me i think its all right she said slowly she nodded ill call blawke to make sure hell need to look at it anyway she nodded again walked back to sit in her seat and started reading through the papers she had in front of her then she looked up at me you phone him would you all right i said and watched her bend to the papers again she appeared to read for a few moments i almost wanted to laugh she seemed so unconcerned she looked up again after a few seconds and just sat there looking out through the open velvet curtains at the back lawn she sat like that for a full two minutes unmoving face unreadable i smiled i wanted to weep to laugh eventually i said softly mum hmm she turned to me a hesitant smile on her tin face i held the will up from where it lay on the desk this is dads will i managed a smile dont you want to know what it says she looked confused then embarrassed and put her hand to her mouth oh of course yes what does it say lets see i pulled my seat over alongside hers the good lawyer blawke opined that the will was perfectly legal under scottish law a handwritten will did not have to be witnessed he even came out and looked at it personally which made two visits in one week truly our cup of honour ranneth over yes the lawyer blawke said reading the will as he sat in the front lounge well i cant see anything wrong with it he looked unhappy unarguably his writing he studied it again yes he nodded finally i actually warned him against doing this some time ago but he seems to have got away with it the heronlike lawyer seemed sad that the will was litigationproof he smiled weakly and mum offered to refill his whisky glass the will expressed with a brevity and a lack of ambiguity the best lawyers would have been proud of and the rest alarmed at left the house grounds and so on to mum along with a twofifths share in both the residue of dads savings and any money made after his death lewis james and i had onefifth shares each there were specified amounts to an almost archetypal spread of righton causes cnd amnesty international and greenpeace ten grand each ten grand i was initially stunned fleetingly annoyed then ashamed and later vaguely impressed mum just sighed like shed been expecting something like that i confess to having experienced a sensation of relief on discovering i had not been written out of dads will i wouldnt have blamed him i think and hope that that feeling was engendered more by a desire to feel id still been loved despite everything than by avarice i didnt think there would be all that much to go round after those donations anyway dads agent his accountant and the lawyer blawke worked it out between them though i checked their figures later the good lawyer summoned us all to his office a fortnight after dads death only james wouldnt come lewis flew up specially it had all indeed been just about as simple as it had looked blawke told us the sums involved and i was pleasantly surprised the donations to rightonnery seemed much more in proportion now i can only claim that i had spent what at least seemed like so long living on bread and cottage cheese and fish suppers in glasgow measuring my money in pennies and reluctantlypartedwith pounds that i had an excuse for not being able to imagine that the thirty k dad had salved his conscience with when hed written the will had actually been quite a small part of the modest fortune hed built up over the years dad had left over a quarter of a million pounds after the government had taken its cut my share came to well over forty thousand smackeroos the likelihood was that for the next few years at least id bank about fifteen grand per annum which might or might not tail off abruptly or gradually depending on how well dads stories held up against the tests of time not to mention the likes of thomas the tank engine the teenage mutant ninja turtles and whatever other delights the future of the childrens fiction market held anyway suddenly i was if not quite within range of the mountains of rich certainly well into the foothills of comfortable it entirely made up for the discovery a few days earlier that the estimate i had made of my chances of passing my final exams had been considerably more accurate than any of the conclusions i had drawn in the course of them i had distinguished myself by failing a result the department prided itself on happening only rarely my initial reaction had been to cut my losses on the honours front and see if i could take an ma instead a resit would mean a whole extra year at university but that sentiment had only lasted for a day in the turmoil of feelings and fortunes dads death had produced the prospect of another years study with the framework and time scale that would provide especially if i applied myself as i thought i would now be able to seemed suddenly a relief rather than a chore at any rate i still had a little time to decide what to do and the money would make the choice easier a return to glasgow need not now also mean a return to the joys of sharing a flat with gav aunt janice and their sonically extrovert passions we stood the three of us mum lewis and i on the pavement outside the main street offices of the lawyer blawke in gallanach i was still thinking forty grand and trying not to look too stunned mum was slowly putting on her black leather gloves lewis and i looked at each other lewis wasnt doing too badly himself down in london but he too had looked pretty surprised when blawke told us the sums that were heading our way mum hadnt really shown any reaction shed just thanked the good lawyer politely and asked after his wife and family fancy a drink lewis said to me i nodded i felt slightly faint mum lewis said she looked round at him small and neat in her dark blue coat it was a bright warm day and i could see the silver in her dark brown hair she looked so delicate i felt like i was in my early teens again mum seemingly getting shorter and shorter with each season that passed what she said i found myself sniffing the air i was downwind but all i could smell was pears soap and lewiss aramis mum seemed to have stopped wearing perfume i think a drink to steady our nerves lewis said to her aye mum said looking thoughtful she gave a thin wee smile and nodded at us aye hed have liked that and so we went to the lounge of the steam packet hotel looking out over the touristcrowded pier and the packed car park the water was bright amongst the hulls of the moored yachts and the mull ferry was a black shape in the distance heading away we drank vintage champagne and fifteenyearold malt i suspected dad would have approved lewis had to head back to london that night mum and i had been busy for a week tidying up all the loose ends an unexpected death leaves especially when the deceased is somebody as socially and professionally entangled as dad then mum had gardened while id sorted through less urgent papers printing out everything on the disks searching out all the of the stuff on stories and sending it or copies to dads literary executor his editor in london i had become modestly pccomputerate ashley had given me a grounding in the basics though pcs were not really her field id even learned how to change the toner cartridge in the photocopier without making a mess on one of the earliest computer disks dad had used dated shortly after hed finally joined the computer age and bought the compaq in i found copies of some of rorys poems dad must have been putting them onto the system from the drafts rory had left i printed those out it didnt look like dad had been very impressed with the poems or hed presumably have transcribed them all onto the computer they werent on the hard disk or backed up onto another floppy either another indication my father had regarded them as relatively unimportant but at least i again had something rory had written i was still hoping more of rorys papers would surface somewhere dads old diaries turned up in a cardboard box at the back of a cupboard mum glanced at them handed them to me they looked pretty boring frankly mi to gal shops prom walk back did vat and me glasg car lhr ffurt late missed others tel lgair din in room tv were two of the more exciting and informative entries for last year dads ideas books a pads usually were where the interesting stuff was wed look at the diaries later then one day at the back of dads oldest and most decrepit falling cabinet id discovered treasure it was in the form of three jatty fallingapart woolworth folders stuffed with old exercise books and shorthandpads bulging manila envelopes stuffed with tickets timetables and assorted scraps of paper as well assorted sheets of paper of various sizes some stapled together most loose some typed and some handwritten and all the work of uncle rory there was one sealed envelope too here were all the poems id seen before and more typescripts of all the travel pieces and the progenitor of traps rorys india journal tattered battered stained and torn and littered with doodles and little handdrawn maps and sketches a foldout map of india was stapled to the inside back cover of the first exercise book and on it rorys spastically erratic route round the country was picked out in blue biro the back cover of the second book was covered with little faded train and bus tickets attached to the cheap fibrous blue paper with rusting staples the last exercise book had only one ticket stapled to the rear cover rorys air india ticket home some of the pages were stained with what looked like saffron and i swear one book still smelled of curry id sat down there and then and begun to read flicking through the thin brittle pages of the journal smiling at the spelling mistakes and the awkward amateurish drawings looking for passages i remembered id looked at the other stuff too and found one play another martial yarn about death and betrayal and apparently nameless which contained not only the passage about the fate of soldiers which id read in the delayed train back in january in the rain on the line at the back of crow road but which also ended with the lines id heard first a few weeks before that in janice raes flat in janice raes bed in fact and all your nonsenses and truths id read your finery and squalid options id said quietly to myself rorys climaxdelaying mantra was all there right down to the last threeword line but given the situation the narrator was in at that point the lines took on an extra resonance and an irony i had not been able to appreciate before the section was circled with red ink and under that last line was written a note in large letters use for end cr gradually though as id looked at it all my feeling of quiet elation faded as i realised there seemed to be nothing else in any of the folders that seemed to relate to crow road all i found was one cryptic note scribbled in pencil on the inside flap of what looked like the most recent of the three tatty files it said crb killsh save jlsy stil drwnd b and h i vaguely remembered these abbreviations from the notes id lost i shook my head cursing my own idiot negligence and uncle rorys frustrating delight in abstract abbreviation jlsy well that was a recurring theme in rorys work stil drwnd but hell i thought h got crshd btwen crge tr fuck it id said and closed the file id turned the bulky heavy sealed manila a envelope over in my hands for a while then opened it computer disks that was a surprise as far as i knew uncle rory had never possessed a computer eight big floppy computer disks each in their own brown paper envelopes hewlettpackard doublesided flexible disks recorder a package of disks well yes of course there would have to be two missing they were numbered to in black felttip and that was the only indication they werent brand new and unused the writeprotect holes were still taped over id looked over at the compaq sitting on dads desk but the big somehow already oldfashioned looking disks wouldnt even have fitted into the compaqs drive if youd folded them in half making a mental note to call ashley in london about the disks some time i put them back in their manila envelope and the envelope back in its faded folder and spent a fair while after that just leafing through uncle rorys india journal smiling sadly at it all and becoming almost as willingly lost in it as it seemed rory had m the pungent teeming wastes of india itself until mum called me from the foot of the stairs and it was time for tea a few days later id travelled back up to glasgow by train wed got all the immediate matters regarding my fathers death sorted out it had been a perfect day summerwarm and springfresh the air winterclear the colours more vivid than in autumn id felt a sort of shocked calm settle over me as id travelled and been able to forget about death and its consequences for a while the familiar route had looked new and startling that day the train had travelled from lochgair north along the lower loch crossed the narrows at minard and stopped at garbhallt strachur lochgoilhead and portincaple junction where it joined the west highland line and took the north shore of the clyde towards glasgow the waters and the skies blazed blue the fields and forests waved luxuriously in a soft flowerscented breeze and the high hill summits shimmered purple and brown in the distance my spirits had been raised just watching the summer countryside go past even the sight of the burgeoning obscenity of the new trident submarine base at faslane hadnt depressed me and when the train had approached queen street and id been making very sure i had all my luggage with me id seen something sublime even magical it had been no more than that same scrubby irregularly rectangular field of coarse grass id sat looking at so glumly from the delayed train in the rain that january then the fields sodden downtrodden paths had provided an image of desolation i had fastened onto in my selfpity like a bloodstarved leech onto bruised flesh and now the field had burned recently too because there was no new growth on the brownblack earth and yet the field was not fully dark all the grass had been consumed save for a giant green x that lay printed vivid and alive on the black flag of the scorched ground it was the two crisscrossing paths through the wedgedin scrap of field that still shone emerald in the sunlight the flames had passed over those footflattened blades and consumed their healthier neighbours on either side while they themselves had remained made proof against the blaze and guaranteed their stark survival just by their earlier oppression id stood there in the act of taking my bags down from the luggage rack and smiling to myself id said see dad hadnt specified any memorial all his will had said was that he wanted to be buried somewhere in the grounds of the house there was some discussion and eventually mum decided on a plain black granite obelisk with his name and the relevant dates on it i stood there dressed in my slightly preposterous highland finery halfway through this wedding in the rain and remembering the funeral in the sunlight a season earlier and i thought again how damn ugly that dark monument had turned out then i shook my head and turned and walked back to the lawn and the marquee the ground was squelchy and i had to tread carefully to avoid getting mud on my thick white socks the kilt swung against my knees i wondered if ash was back yet what what what come on prentice my first chance to snog tongues with your brother as a married man and youre dragging me away waving ha ha where did you get these the hall of the lochgair house was swarming with people crowding in laughing brandishing presents shaking hands demanding drinks slapping lewis on the back hugging verity talking quietly to my mother wandering through the press of people greeting each other and bumping and smiling and talking away and generally making me feel i might have arranged the reception line a little better it had been a relief to spot ashley struggling through the crowd at the front door remember the computer disks dash upstairs to get them and then down to intercept her and haul her into the lounge found them in dads study i told ashley holding the disks out to her she put a gaily wrapped package down on a chair took one of the big disks from me and slid it out of its paper wrapper grinning then she looked up frowned and stepped back arms wide prentice she said voice deep with censure you havent said how stunning i look yet i mean come now ash wore loose black pants and a shimmery silver top hair backswept and piled up the glasses had been replaced by contacts you look great i told her i nodded at the disk in her hand think you can do anything with that ash sighed and shook her head i dont know havent you got the machine they ran on i shook my head i asked my mum about it she thinks they might have been rorys that long ago eh ash tapped the disk sleeve dubiously as though expecting it to crumble to dust at any second i didnt know until today he even had one i mentioned to mum id ask you about these and she said rory did have a computer or a word processor or whatever got it out in hong kong about a year before he disappeared hong kong ash looked even more dubious some sort of copy clone of an well mum said an orange but i guess she means apple she remembers him complaining that it or the program or whatever didnt come with proper instructions but he got it to work eventually uhhuh dad left it in the flat rory shared in glasgow when he took rorys papers away wouldnt have a computer in the house at the time wise man im going to try and track down the guy rory shared the flat with but i reckon the machines been chucked out or whatever long ago and i just thought could you you know you might know somebody who perhaps could be able to to decode whats on there i shrugged suddenly feeling awkward ash was now looking at the disk as though fully anticipating that creepy crawlies were about to start emerging from it i mean i said clearing my throat suddenly feeling hot and sweaty there might not be anything on them at all but i just thought so ash said slowly let me get this straight you dont know the machine but its probably some ancient nameless apple clone from the dark grey end of the market almost certainly using reject chips it probably had a production run that lasted until the first months rent fell due on the shed the childlabourers were assembling them in it used an eightinch drive and ran what sounds like dodgy proprietorial software with more bugs than the natural history museum umm yeah that about sums it up ash nodded a few times lips tight weighing the disk in her hands right she nodded at the ones i still held okay can i take these sure i handed them to her and she turned for the door see you later she said heading into the crowded hall i went after her she was excusing her way to the front door ash i said squeezing through after her not now come and enjoy the party dont worry she said glancing back i shall return ill drop these at home so i dont forget to take them back to london i know people who might be able to help but i just remembered i forgot something something for you left it at mums she looked out the door it was starting to rain shit there was an old giant brass cartridge case by the hall hat stand which held our assorted umbrellas and walking sticks i lifted a brolly from it ash turned to me a worried expression on her face as she said i saw that guy again ill show you give my present to the happy couple what guy i said but she was already sprinting through the stillarriving guests for the little red cv parked a good fifty metres down the carcrowded drive the disks held tight to her chest i watched her highheels flashing over the gravel and the other guests turning to look at her then there were more people to greet and hands to shake i took the brolly myself eventually and went for a walk up the garden to dads grave just to get away from the crowds for a bit back in the house i dodged one of the waitresses from the lochgair hotel carrying a huge tray with champagne flutes out of the kitchen towards the marquee i waved at mum splendid in black with white stripes and standing talking to helen urvill and went through to the hall i put the umbrella in the old cartridge case then i thought maybe i should open it out and dry it like youre supposed to so i hauled it out again and left it opened in the hall prentice verity said coming down from upstairs she was enfolded in white silk a creation of some clothesdesigner friend of hers in edinburgh technically it was a blouse mediumlength skirt and jacket but when she wore it it looked like a single piece and handsome it was too she was hardly showing yet but the outfit would anyway have disguised an almost fullterm pregnancy she wore white leggings and highheels that made her taller than me she also wore the fulgurite necklace mum had guessed both that verity would want to wear it and that she might think it best not to in case the association hurt so she d made a point of telling lewis she thought verity ought to wear it if it suited the outfit she had chosen veritys hair was as shortcropped as ever but she looked none the worse for that and the little white microhat she wore complete with thrownback white fishnet veil sat well on her too she came up to me took me by the shoulders and kissed me on the cheek that was a great speech thanks she said she was still holding my shoulders and squeezed them she looked the way youre supposed to look both when youre pregnant and on the day of your marriage glowing radiant suffused with joy still had perfect skin she put on a convincingly upperclass english accent as she said youve been en ebserloortly soopah byest men my deah i put my hands lightly on her still slim waist and made a small bowing motion any time i said and grinned she laughed shaking her head she stepped back folded her arms looked me up and down and said and so smart i curtsied fluttering my eyelashes she laughed again and held out her hand come on lets find my husband hes probably flirting with the bridesmaids by now i thought that was my job i said taking her arm in mine as we went towards the rear of the hall i heard the front door open behind us i turned and looked stopped then turned back to verity ill take a rain check on that shweetheart verity smiled at ashley watt shaking a glistening waterproof shed just taken off and nodded well theres appropriate today she winked at me and walked off ashley met me at the foot of the stairs brandishing a vhs cassette got it take me to your video walk this way i told her heading up the stairs two at a time do i get to look up your kilt she said from behind not if youre lucky i switched the lights on in the study we tended to keep the curtains closed there was a tv and video in the study i switched it all on and put the cassette in the machine cool ashely said standing hands on hips in the middle of the study hands nearly over the centre of dads persian rug bunned hair directly beneath the big brass and stainedglass light fixture hanging extravagantly beneath an ornate plaster ceiling rose she swivelled surveying the bookcase walls the maps the prints and paintings and various interesting bits and pieces scattered around shelves tables desks and the floor bit cluttered for my taste i said starting the tape and watching some endcredits dad found it conducive enough fast forward ash said the screen scrolled quickly then the bbc nine oclock news started flashing before us ash turned away so i let it roll ashley crossed to an overcrowded book case there was an empty crystal bowl perched on a pile of loose papers on top of the book case and ashley tapped the bowl very gently with one finger she took her hand away held it in the air near the icecoloured ornament and clicked her fingers she bent her head towards the bowl seemingly listening for something i frowned wondered what she was up to she turned and faced the bowl went ah in a highpitched voice then listened again head tilted smiling this time ashley what exactly are you doing she nodded at the bowl crystal you can make it ring by producing the right noise she grinned like a little girl good eh she looked behind me thats you she said nodding at the screen i hit play we stood watched talked to rupert paxtonmarr of the inquirer one of the journalists held by the iraqis and asked him how hed felt said the bbc man in amman i couldnt resist a thin smile one journalist asking another how he felt rupert paxtonmarr was a tall blond blueeyed man with exactly the jawline id have chosen for myself given the opportunity sickeningly handsome he had an accent to match well michael he said air hair lair i said to myself i dont think we were really in much danger clearly international attention has fixed on iraq and i think they knew we knew that and accepted we were werent a threat to them umm our driver had taken a wrong turning and that was that of course one does remember what happened to ah farhzad bazhoft but i dont think you can let that stop you in the end one has a job to do thank you rupert and now reporting fr i hit stop and turned to ashley standing beside me she was still looking at the blank screen where the little green zero symbol sat in one corner wobbling almost imperceptibly she had sucked her cheeks in and her lips were pursed there was a whoop of laughter from somewhere downstairs ash nodded slowly looked at me thats ma boy she said youre sure about that i said im sure she looked serious she looked pretty good too now i looked properly i couldnt remember ever seeing ashley wearing makeup and youd have thought that not having had the practice shed be crap at it but she looked great maybe a little overenthusiastic with the dark stuff round the eyes but why quibble she nodded dont look at me like that im really sure sorry i believe you i said i spun the tape back to play it again ashley put one hand on my arm and rested her chin against the shoulder of my prince charlie jacket turn the sound down she said that guys voice is like chewing on silver paper i turned the sound down the noise of people laughing and talking in the marquee came through the double glazing and the heavy burgundy of the velvet curtains i heard an amplified voice outside say testing it was probably dean watt he and his band had been hired by lewis and verity to play during the afternoon for the evening theyd booked a more traditional wheechyourpartner fiddle and accordion band i ran the clip again definitely officer ashley said tapping the top corner of the tv recognise him anywhere even with his clothes on i switched the tv off and ejected the cassette i stood for a moment rubbing my chin whoops ashley said and delicately rubbed a little of that transferred makeup from the black shoulder of my jacket i waited till shed finished then went to dads desk unlocked a lower drawer and took out a slide tray one of those plastic things that holds a few hundred transparencies so when you saw this guy paxtonmarr i said opening the tray and putting the lid on the desk in berlin in this hotel in the jacuzzi i looked up at ashley standing sceptically by the tv one elbow resting on it as she watched me what was the hotel called again i told you she said i cant remember i called june and neither could she its probably the only place she ever stayed and forgot to nick a towel or yet another emergency sewing kit or whatever ash shrugged frankly prentice i was stoned out of my brains most of the time i was there all i can remember is it had a big pool in the basement with a jacuzzi at one end and they did really good breakfasts she sighed excellent hopplepopple her eyebrows flicked once hopplepopplei grimaced scrambled eggs ash smiled take me to berlin and ill find it for you it was somewhere near the zoo i put the tray down on the desk went over to ashley holding out a little piece of cardboard it was the front cover off a book of matches torn off the piece that held the matches wasnt the schweizerhof was it i asked her she looked steadily into my eyes for a little while then took the piece of card looked at it and turned it over twentyseven eleven eightynine she muttered she nodded and handed me the cover back yeah she said frowning yeah it was that was the place i put the little torn bit of cardboard back in the slide tray it was the second last one out of about forty of them whats the significance of the date ashley asked coming over to the desk outside i could hear the sound ot an electric guitar chord and a few drum beats i think that was when dad received it i picked the latest torn cover out of the tray this one arrived just after he died we both sat on the edge of the desk ashley looked at the little piece of glossy cardboard woo she whistled amman hilton spooky or what yeah spooky i said as fucktapping the cover with one fingernail and im sure i recognise that guy paxtonmarr too from glasgow or edinburgh or here ive met him in the flesh i think ash put her elbow on my shoulder and damn firm tanned flesh it was too let me tell you she said i looked into those grey eyes smiling but not as firm and tanned as your programmer from texas ash laughed skipped off the desk systems analyst and youre right they breed them bigger and better in texas music started up in the marquee kiss the bride ash stood on the persian rug again putting one hand to her ear hark its young brother and his pals she frowned doesnt sound like a mark e smith or morrissey track to me she shook her head tsk how are the mighty fallen she put her head down so that if shed been wearing glasses shed have been looking over them at me want my advice mmhmm i nodded come on and dance we can sort or you can sort this out later when youve had time to think she struck a dramatic arguably danceinspired pose and held out one hand hey baby lets boogie i laughed shut the matchbook covers away and locked the desk drawer thats it laddy ashley said holding my arm as we went to the door you put that key in yer sporran at least i know down there its safe from interference i told her she smiled i locked the study door too by the way by the way ash muttered into my ear as we headed along the landing for the stairs got a gramme of the old bogota talcum powder about my person fancy a toot later what the real thing i grinned i thought speed was your poison normally she nodded but this is a special occasion i splashed out you wee tyke i said i pulled her closer as we walked held her tight you just stick with me kid all right whatever you say ma man we did kicksteps down the stairs risky when youre wearing a kilt as it is meant to be worn but invigorating i danced with ashley and with verity and with helen urvill and with mum cutting in on lewis after hed persuaded her onto the floor most of the time though she just sat surrounded by family and friends watching us all with an expression that to me at least spoke of a kind of stricken joy a surprise that such pleasure could still exist and she feel even remotely a part of it when dad was not here to share in it all i am not a natural dancer but i made an exception for veritys wedding i grooved and sweated and drank and made a point of doing the old red blood cell impression circulating bathing in soaking up and transmitting onwards the oxygen of family news and gossip from cell to cell where are you off to next aunt ilsa i asked the lady in question during our waltz aunt ilsa even larger than i remembered her and dressed in something which looked like a cross between a persian rug and a multioccupancy poncho moved with the determined grace of an elephant and a curious stiffness that made the experience a little like dancing with a garden shed canada i think prentice churchill on hudsons bay to observe the arctic bear i confess i had to reprocess that sentence a couple of times as we danced before working out that she did not intend to study the region naked an image i found rather alarming but was merely using a more pedantically accurate term for a polar bear super i smiled uncle hamish sat at the table with the rest of the family and got slowly drunk i danced with aunt tone and asked after her husbands health oh hes getting better all the time aunt tone said glancing at him he hasnt had the nightmares for weeks now i think going back to work helped him fergus was very understanding and hes had a lot of long chats with the minister people have been very kind altogether you havent talked to him aunt tone looked at me critically not for a bit i gave her a big smile i will though uncle hamish watched the dancing he lifted his whisky to his lips sipped at it then shook his head with such slow deliberation i caught myself listening for the creak no prentice i have been foolish and even vain i did not pay sufficient heed to the scriptures i thought that i knew better he sipped his whisky shook his head it was vanity my theories my beliefs about the hereafter vanity i have renounced them oh i said disappointed no more anticreates he shook as though a chill had passed through him no that was my mistake he looked at me straight for the first time he punished both of us prentice uncle hamish flicked his gaze towards the roof of the marquee both of us he repeated he looked away again god knows we are all his children but he is a strict father sometimes terribly terribly strict i put my head on my hand and looked at my uncle as i considered this idea of god as childabuser hamish started to shake his head again before hed sipped his whisky and i experienced a brief feeling of excited horror waiting for the resulting catastrophe but he just stopped in midshake sipped then shook his head slowly again aye a strict father i patted his arm never mind i said helpfully i danced with aunt charlotte veritys stillhandsome and determinedly superstitious mother who told me that the newlyweds would surely be happy because their stars were wellmatched exhibiting a generosity of spirit i rather surprised myself with i agreed that certainly the stars in their eyes seemed to augur well i bumped into the smaller than lifesize mr gibbon near the bar at one point i was in such a gregarious clubbable mood i actually enjoyed talking to him we agreed aunt ilsa was a wonderful woman but that she had itchy feet mr gibbon looked over at aunt ilsa who had i could only imagine by force got uncle hamish up for a dance together they were having the same effect on the dance floor as a loose cannon manned by hippos yes mr gibbon said sighing his eyelids fluttering i am her kentledge he smiled at me with a sort of apologetic selfsatisfaction as though he was the luckiest man alive and tiptoed off through the crowds with his two glasses of sherry kentledge i said to myself id have scratched my head but my hands were full of glasses prentice taking a breather too eh i had stepped outside the marquee for a breather late on after the hoochterchoochter music started and the place got even warmer i looked round in the shadows and saw fergus urvill scottishly resplendent in his urvill dress tartan fergus came into the light spilling from the open flap of the marquee he was smoking a cigar the rain had ceased at last and the garden smelled of earth and wet leaves fergus glittered crystal buttons sparkled on his jacket black pearls of obsidian decorated his sporran and the skean dhu stuck into the top of his right sock a rather more impressive and businesslike example of the traditional highlanddress knife than mine which looked like a glorified letter opener was crowned with a large ruby glinting in the light against the hairs of his leg like some grotesquely faceted bulb of blood yes i said yes getting my breath back fergus looked into the marquee theyre a handsome couple eh i glanced in to see lewis and verity hand in hand talking to some of veritys relations lewis had changed into a dark suit and a bootlace tie verity wore a dark skirt and long goldcoloured jacket i nodded yes i said i cleared my throat cigar fergus said digging an aluminium tube from one pocket of his jacket i shook my head no fergus said looking at me tolerantly of course you dont do you no i said i grinned inanely i was surprised at just how uncomfortable i felt in his presence and how hard it was both to work out precisely why i felt that way and to disguise the fact we talked for a little while about my studies going better now thank you and about flying fergus was learning to fly up at connel the air field a few miles north of oban oh really yes hoped to be going solo by the end of the year if all went according to plan he asked me what i thought of the gulf crisis and i quailing said it all kind of depended how you looked at it i think i made him feel as awkward eventually as i had from the start of the conversation and i took the opportunity of a new reel beginning to head back into the marquee to join in another swirling riotous dance ashley dean and i retired to my room in the house during the supper interval while people got their breath back and the band four oldish guys mysteriously called the dougie mctee trio tried to get drunk we snorted some coke we had a couple of js and in response to a single question from dean i told them both all about the river game its history every rule and feature a thorough description of the board an analysis of the differing playing styles of myself lewis james dad mum and helen urvill some handy tips and useful warnings and a few interesting excerpts from certain classic games wed played it took about ten minutes i dont think i repeated myself once or left anything out and i finished by saying that all of that of course wasnt to mention the secret banned version the black river game they both stared at me dean looked like he hadnt believed a word id said ashley just seemed amused aye good coke isnt it she said yep dean said busy with mirror and blade again he glanced at his sister and nodded at me for gods sake ash stick that number in his mouth and shut him up i accepted the j with a smile the three of us kickstepped down the stairs hoy all that stuff about that game dean shouted as we three swung into the marquee where an eightsome reel of extravagant proportions and high decibelcount was in its dervish phase that gospel aye i frowned deeply as i looked at him oh no i shook my head earnestly its true later i sat alone at a table quietly drinking whisky watching them all id lowered my head one hand lay flat palmdown on the table i felt very calm and deadly and in control shit i felt like i was michael corleone the tunes and laughs and shouts washed through me and the people for that moment seemed to be dancing about me for me i felt pivotal and drank a silent toast to grandma margot i drank to my late father i thought of uncle rory wherever he was and drank to him i even drank to james also absent james was coming down only slowly from his peak of anger even now he was still so sullen and difficult to get on with that it had almost been a relief when hed said he didnt want to be involved in the wedding hed gone to stay with some school pals at kilmartin a little north of gallanach for the weekend i think mum was unhappy he wasnt here today but lewis and i werent i drank some more whisky thinking a marriage and a little information not to mention more than a little suspicion all it had taken was one blurred face glimpsed far away by somebody else seen soundless for a second on a fuzzed tv in a noisy crowded smoky pub in soho one friday evening just one tiny example of all the inevitable peripheral results of a confrontation in a distant desert and suddenly despite all our efforts we id felt a sort of shocked calm settle over me as id travelled and been able to forget about death and its consequences for a while the familiar route had looked new and startling that day the train had travelled from lochgair north along the lower loch crossed the narrows at minard and stopped at garbhallt strachur lochgoilhead and portincaple junction where it joined the west highland line and took the north shore of the clyde towards glasgow the waters and the skies blazed blue the fields and forests waved luxuriously in a soft flowerscented breeze and the high hill summits shimmered purple and brown in the distance my spirits had been raised just watching the summer countryside go past even the sight of the burgeoning obscenity of the new trident submarine base at faslane hadnt depressed me and when the train had approached queen street and id been making very sure i had all my luggage with me id seen something sublime even magical it had been no more than that same scrubby irregularly rectangular field of coarse grass id sat looking at so glumly from the delayed train in the rain that january then the fields sodden downtrodden paths had provided an image of desolation i had fastened onto in my selfpity like a bloodstarved leech onto bruised flesh and now the field had burned recently too because there was no new growth on the brownblack earth and yet the field was not fully dark all the grass had been consumed save for a giant green x that lay printed vivid and alive on the black flag of the scorched ground it was the two crisscrossing paths through the wedgedin scrap of field that still shone emerald in the sunlight the flames had passed over those footflattened blades and consumed their healthier neighbours on either side while they themselves had were back amongst the bad stuff again shrapnel from the coming war although of course i couldnt be sure mum went past dancing with fergus urvill who was sweating mum looked small next to him her expression was unreadable jlsy i thought and drank to uncle rory lewis and verity left at midnight in a taxi none of that letsmakeamessofthecar nonsense for them the taxi was supposedly heading for gallanach only mum and i knew they were actually booked into the columba in oban and heading for glasgow and the airport tomorrow the fourman trio played the dancing continued mum left with hamish and tone she was staying with them tonight i was in charge of the house i danced until my legs ached i talked until my throat hurt the band and the bagpipe players whod joined in with them stopped playing at about two dean and i fed some homemade compilation tapes through the pa and the dancing went on later after everybody had either left or crashed out in the house ash and i walked out along the shore by the calmly lapping waters of loch fyne in a clear cool dawn i remember babbling high and spacey and dancedout all at once we sat and stared out over the satin grey stretch of water watching lowflying seagulls flapping lazily to and fro i treated ash to bits of uncle rorys poetry i knew some of it by heart now ash suggested heading back and to the house and either having some coffee or getting some sleep her wide eyes looked tired i agreed coffee might be an idea the last thing i remember is insisting i had whisky in my coffee then falling asleep in the kitchen my head on ashs shoulder mumbling about how id loved dad and how id loved verity too and id never find another one like her but she was a heartless bitch no she wasnt yes she was no she wasnt it was just she wasnt for me and if i had any sense id go for somebody who was a kind and gentle friend and who i got on well with like ash i should take up with ash i should fall in love with her thats what i ought to do only if i did i muttered into her shoulder shed be sure to fall for somebody else or die or get a job in new zealand but thats what i ought to do if only things worked that way why do we always love the wrong people ash silent beneath me above me just patted my shoulder and laid her head on mine mum woke me in the late afternoon i moaned and she put a pint glass of water and two sachets of resolve down on the table near my head i tried to focus on the water mum sighed tore the sachets open and tipped the powder fizzing into the glass i checked things out with the one eye that would open i was in my room at lochgair on my bed still mostly clothed in shirt and kilt and socks my head felt like it had been recently used for a very long and closely contested game of basketball somebody had stolen my real body and replaced it with a prenticeshaped jelly mould packed full of enhancedcapacity pain receptors firing away like they were auditioning for a duracell commercial mum was pressed in faded jeans and an old holed sweater her hair was tied up and she wore violently yellow rubber kitchen gloves which started doing horrible things to my visual cortex a yellow duster hung from her hip pocket i couldnt think what else to do so i moaned again mum sat down on the bed put a hand on my head and ran my curls through her rubberclad fingers whats that youve got in your hair she said my brain cells i wondered certainly it felt like theyd been squeezed out of my ears damn rimshots not that i could share this insight with my mother for the simple reason that i couldnt talk what is it mum said this black stuff she rubbed her fingers together in my hair the rubber gloves squeaking horribly oh stop moaning prentice drink your water she sniffed at her fingers hmm she said rising and heading for the door mascara eh i looked up monocular at the closing door grimacing massacre chapter i sipped my bloody mary looking down at huge white piledup clouds so bright in the midday sunshine they looked yellow the plane had just levelled out and there was a smell of food they were serving lunch further forward in the cabin i watched the clouds for a moment then looked at my magazine i was on my way to london a couple of tornoff matchbook covers m my pocket hoping to confront mr rupert paxtonmarr thanks mum ash yo prentice hows it hanging oh plum still wearing the kilt eh look ive had some word from how about you eh how are you oh rude health verging on the obscene listen my computer wizards been in touch what about the disks correct whats on them what do they day is there anyth hey hold your horses had to get the stuff to him first oh where is he denver denver yup denver colorado yes what in america yeah northern hemisphere the world the solar system okay okay so hes hey is this your texan programmer has he moved states systems analyst for the last fucking time prentice and no it isnt him just a guy i exchange email with sometimes right and hes got the disks no of course he hasnt got the disks what then he has the information that was held on them well on the one that held anything seven were blank not even formatted ah right i see so what does it say what is on it was it all rorys its a little more complicated than that prentice oh ive got a message on my screen here from him thought you might be interested in it oh youre at work hey have you seen the time youre working late arent you yes prentice do you want to hear the message will i understand it youll get the gist of it okay right i quote i thought your man up there in the misty glens might like to know misty glens thats sounds a bit patronising prentice shut up sorry might like to know what our game plan is with respect to your wordprocessed files as we dont yet know what geek program this mutant nonamobrand clone was running we have had to resort to extreme measures to access the data dr claire simmons of london university who picked up the disks will use a vintage hewlett packard touchscreen which has compatible eightinch drives in the establishments museum of computing to extract the raw binaries sector by sector praying all the while that somebody has posted an ediger to usenet that she can use to strip off the physical addressing she will then attack the content one word at a time swapping bytes as needed and inverting bits if none of it looks like ascii stripping the eighth bits if theyre in the way or unencoding the lot if we cant do without them and unload the result to a prime minicomputer another indestructible antique somewhere on the campus network she moves all this to her iris doubleencrypts it and emails it via internet off janus or bitnet to nsfnetrelayacuk probably via cornell to an account im not supposed to have on the minnesota supercomputer centers cray currently the biggest and quickest computeserver short of a connection machine at the high end so i might as well use it to do the decryptions and perhaps take my own first whack at demangling before moving the data along from there i download via a dedicated t line to an sgi sxvgx at one of atts bell labs the one in boulder i think another unofficial account from where i can further download and filter out certain offending control characters to a mac ii at my office then i dump the results onto a floppy and bike them home to tinker with in my basement which is where the hard work starts get all that prentice yeah basically what hes saying is its a piece of piss absolutely a doddle great so when can we expect to see some results no idea dont forget the guys doing it for fun and hes a busy man no promises but he sounds confident ill call him in a week if he doesnt get in touch first tell him ill fax him a crate of champagne or something certainly so when ah shit fucking decollators jammed again gotta go attend the print prent okay bye oh and thanks i now had a better idea of what rory had been doing in the days before his disappearance it looked like he had been working on crow road between the time hed come back from london after seeing his friends and the evening he disappeared on the motor bike hed borrowed from his flatmate that was what hed been doing stuck in his room in the flat in glasgow finally actually writing something on his bizarre contraption of a computer hed done it hed stopped writing notes and started on the work itself id talked to a retired policeman who at the time had looked briefly into what had happened to rory the police hadnt come up with anything theyd interviewed janice rae and rorys flatmate andy nichol and looked at the papers rory had left with janice there was no suicide note so theyd decided the papers werent relevant apart from checking the hospitals and eventually listing rory as a missing person that had been that the only useful information id got from the police was that rorys flatmate had left local government and joined the civil service a few months after rory had disappeared id tracked andy nichol down at a tax office in plymouth and called him there but apart from saying hed heard a lot of keyboardclattering noises coming from rorys room during the days before rory had borrowed his bike and disappeared hed only been able to confirm what i already knew he did say hed tried working rorys neanderthal computer after dad had said he could have it but he couldnt make the beast work hed sold the machine and the two blank disks that had come with it to a friend in strathclyde university it had been chucked out years ago whatever after those few days work rory had suddenly upped and offed and never came back maybe the stuff on the disks would give me a clue why hed suddenly done that if there was anything useful there that clattering noise didnt prove anything id seen the shining the cloud cover started to break up over the midlands i chomped through my lunch the starter was smoked salmon i thought of verity and lewis on honeymoon in the bahamas and with just a tinge of sadness silently wished them well i saw ashley come into the pub she stood near the door looking round that strongboned head swivelling those grey eyes scanning she didnt see me on the first sweep i was mostly hidden by other people i watched her take a couple of steps forward look round again she was dressed in a dark skirted suit under the old but still goodlooking jacket i remembered her wearing at grandma margots funeral her hair was gathered up and tied she wasnt wearing her glasses her face looked tense and forbidding she seemed harder more capable and more selfcontained than i recalled her being in scotland in those few moments in the noise and smoke of a pub by the river a quarter mile from the tower in the great cruel headless monster that was london after a decade of hyaena rule i wondered again at my own feelings for ashley watt i knew i didnt love her she didnt make me feel anything like the way i had about verity and yet id been i realised looking forward to seeing her and now that i had seen her just felt well happier i guess it was all puzzlingly simple maybe to lapse into the humdrum continuum for a moment she was the sister id never had i remembered the mascara mum had discovered in my hair after the wedding and wondered if the position of honorary sibling was one ashley would entirely welcome i tried to remember ashleys tone when id rung her a couple of days ago to say that i was coming down this about a week after id had my own personal infodump on the workings of the world computer network i had already called aunt ilsa and arranged to stay with her and kentledge man and id wondered at the time if id detected the merest hint of reproach in ashleys voice when id told her i would be staying in deepest kensington at any rate shed told me there was a sofabed and a spare duvet of indeterminate tog value at the flat she shared in clapham in case aunt ilsa went on some sudden expedition to antarctica and forgot to tell her filipino maid or whatever shed added that the two girls she shared with really wanted to meet me i felt pretty sure the person they really wanted to meet was lewis i raised my hand as ashleys gaze passed again over where i stood she caught the movement and that cityhard expression changed instantly relaxing and softening as she smiled broadly and walked over hiya babe she punched my shoulder then gave me a big hug i hugged right back she smelled of poison how are you i asked her she put one fist on her hip and held her other hand up in front of my face fingers spread drinkless she grinned you got off yeah i said swirling the remains of my pint round in my glass ash shook her head i thought you were going to plead guilty i was i confessed i shrugged looked down i got a smart lawyer she said it was worth fighting ended up in a jury trial eventually ash laughed well done she said she lowered her head until she could look into my eyes hey whats the matter well i said trying not to smile i did do it after all it seems wrong i got off because i dressed in a suit and i could afford an expensive advocate and people in the jury had heard of dad and felt sorry for me because hed died i mean if id come from maryhill and i wasnt reasonably articulate and didnt have any money even if i had just forgotten i hadnt paid for the book i bet everybody would have told me to plead guilty instead thanks to the money i had an advocate whod probably make god look just a little lacking in gravitas and discovered a talent for lying through my teeth that promises a glittering career as a sun journalist ash leaned conspiratorially forward over the small table we were crouched round and quietly said easy boy youre on their turf yeah i sighed and dont drink the tap water i looked around the place all crowds and smoke the english accents still sounded oddly foreign no sign i asked ash looked round too then shook her head no sign you sure he drinks here positive maybe hes been sent away back to the gulf ash shook her head i spoke to his secretary hes having some root canal work done hes here till the end of next week maybe i should have just arranged to see him i sighed my newfound talent as a conman might have come in useful i could have said i had pictures of saddam hussein torturing a donkey or something maybe ash said we had discussed this sort of thing ashs first idea was simply that she should ring him up tell him shed seen him on television and heard he worked in london she was here too now and did he fancy a drink sometime but i wasnt sure about this if hed been reluctant to give ash his name in berlin and thought even there that hed already said too much he might be suspicious when she rang up so i felt so my by now rather paranoid feelings suggested a chance meeting seemed more plausible or at least it had when id been talking to ash from dads study in lochgair now i wasnt so sure hows your wizard i asked her eh ash looked confused for a moment oh doctor gonzo still working on the files they werent just weird shit they were corrupted weird shit where did your dad keep those things inside a tv but anyway hes still hopeful doctor gonzo i said tartly dont look like that prentice ash chided this guys knocking his pan in for you for nothing and he has got a doctorate i smiled sorry oh and supposing the good doctor can decipher all that corrupted crap you presented him with what format do you want these files in eventually anyway you ungrateful wretch how dyou mean i mean what program do you use on the compaq oh wordstar i nodded knowledgeably version number ah ill have to come back to you on that one look just ask him to print it out and send it to me would that be okay she shrugged if you want or you could get a modem emails about a zillion times faster look im still not all that comfortable around computers that dont come with a joystick and a fire button just just ordinary airmail and real paper will be fine ash grinned shook her head as you wish she stood up same again she asked clinking my glass no i said ill have a half any particular sort na anything i was alternating pints and whiskies on principle they keep giving you your old glass back down here i watched ash weave her way to the bar i still felt nervous about meeting this guy paxtonmarr but allinall i told myself things werent so bad those of us most affected by dads death were with the possible exception of uncle hamish bearing up pretty well i might yet find out what uncle rory had written i didnt have to worry about money i had no criminal record and i was being a good youngish adult again attending diligently to my studies mostly i stayed in glasgow during the week and went back to lochgair at weekends unless mum sometimes accompanied by james came to stay with me i had got filthy drunk just once since dad had died and then with good reason it had been the day thatcher resigned bliss was it etc even if the tapeworm party was still in power the lawyer blawke had found me a place to rent for the year i needed to be in glasgow it was part of the property of a mrs ippot whod died rich but intestate at a sourly ripe old age having throughout her life promised part or all of her sizeable fortune to various individual relations and combinations of relations within her extensively and antagonistically divided family in a blizzard of contradictory letters and with what appeared to be a profound lack of consideration for the litigious chaos that was bound to ensue mrs ippot in short had been the sort of client probate lawyers have wet dreams about my own theory was that mrs i had actually thoroughly detested every single one of her relatives and had hit on a nicely appropriate way of confounding all of them by jarndyce out of petard mrs ippots lawyerinfested legacy had ensured that her rebarbatively consistent family would suffer years if not decades of selfinflicted hatred and frustration as the increasing legal fees gradually corroded the monies she had left a tortuously slow method of telling your relatives from beyond the grave exactly what you thought of them that makes giving all the loot to a cats home look positively benign in comparison and so i stayed in the late mrs ippots enormous town house in park terrace overlooking kelvingrove park and the river kelvin running through it the museum and art gallery sat red huge and stately to the left its sandstone bulk crammed with the silt of time and human effort while on the hill to its right skirted by the black outlines of trees the university soared with selfimpressed victorian fussiness into the grey autumnal skies positively exuding half a millenniums experience in the collation and dissemination of knowledge the high ceilings and vast windows of mrs ippots former home appeared to have been the work of an architect anticipating the design of aircraft hangars the interior was cluttered with paintings rugs chandeliers lifesized ceramics of the smaller big cats small statues large statues and objets dart of every imaginable description all interspersed with heavy dark intricately gnarled wooden furniture that gave the appearance of being volcanic in origin the houses inventory drawn grimly to my attention by a spotty clerk who obviously resented the fact i was younger than he was came in three volumes i christened the place xanadu but never did find any sleds my friends of whom i saw less these days suggested parties when they first heard about the place on seeing it they usually agreed with me that to mount a serious whoopee on the premises would be to invite cultural catastrophe on a scale usually only witnessed during major wars and james last concerts one of my pals graduated employed moving on to better things sold me his old vw golf and i drove down to lochgair most weekends usually on a thursday night as i didnt have any classes on a friday james and i helped mum who was redecorating the house she was talking about knocking down the old conservatory and putting in a new one perhaps covering a small swimming pool she had also formed the idea of building a harpsichord and then learning to play it we took tea at the steam packet hotel on occasion and james kept an ordnance survey map on which he inked in all the walks we undertook on the hills and through the forests around gallanach mum and i had started going through dads diaries some were pocket size some were desk diaries a couple of early ones were effectively home made they went back to when hed been sixteen id suggested mum read them first in case there was anything embarrassing in them though i think in the end she just skimmed them they werent the stuff of scandal anyway the entries wed sampled when we first discovered them in the box at the back of the cupboard were about as revealing as they ever got really just appointments notes on what had happened that day where dad had been who hed met if there was a single indiscretion recorded there i never found it the same went for any but the most basic observation or idea hed kept those in the a pads it was at the bottom of the box containing dads diaries in an old presentation tin which had held a bottle of fifteenyearold laphroaig that i found rorys diaries little pocket books usually a weekpertwopages dad must have filed them separately from the other papers i got very excited at first but then discovered that rorys diaries were even more sparse and considerably more cryptic than my fathers with too many initials and acronyms to be easily understood and too full of week and even monthlong gaps to form a reliable impression of rorys life there was no diary for the year he disappeared id tried to make sense of rorys diaries but it was uphill work the entry for the day of my birth when rory had been in london read k r boy prentis m ok eve pub the entry for the next day read vho in shaky writing and that was all ho and vho or sometimes ho and vho often followed entries regarding pubs or parties the night before and i strongly suspected they stood for hungover and very hungover k meant kenneth and m mary pretty obviously ok was itself its opposite was nsg which stood for not so good hed spelled it out the first time hed used it following a hr ho after hogmanay the previous year a small r meant rang a telephone call and i had indeed weighed in at eight pounds i found a few mentions of cr i even recognised some of the notes id read the previous year he must have jotted them down in his diary first before transferring them to his other papers but there was nothing to provide any new answers the one thing that stayed with me as a result was not a solution to anything but rather another mystery it was on a page at the back of the last diary the diary for a page headlined by the mysterious message just use it a page covered with notes some in pencil some in ballpoint some in very thin felttip but a page which held the only instance anywhere in all the papers i had where rory had made an effort not just to alter or score out some words or letters but to obliterate them it read show hlvng pty wi c whoops close the symbols just before the h and c had been obliterated by a heavy black felttip marker but the original note had been written with a ballpoint and by holding the page up to the light at just the right angle i could see that the first letter had been an f and the second an l f and l those abbrevations didnt turn up anywhere else in rorys notes for either crow road or anything else that i knew of rory never crossed stuff right out he only ever put a line through it why the big deal with the felttip and who were f and l and why that whoops and what was too close to what found myself cursing uncle rorys inconsistency f in the diaries sometimes meant fergus aka fe sometimes fiona also fi and sometimes felicity a girl rory had known in london also recorded as fls fl or fy i guessed the only l in the diaries seemed to be lachlan watt though he mentioned on the rare occasions when he came back to visit from oz was lw more usually some nights at lochgair after long evenings spent poring over those little thinpaged diaries on the broad desk in dads study trying to make sense of it all and failing id fall asleep in my bed with the symbols and acronyms the letters and numbers and lines and boxes and doodles and smudges all swirling round in front of me even after id put the light out and closed my eyes as though each scribbled sign had become a mote of dust and by my reading been disturbed lifted from the page and blown around me in a vortex of microscopic infodebris chaotic witnesses of a past that i could not comprehend i found one thing which after a little puzzled thought i could comprehend but which i hadnt been expecting in uncle rorys diary stuck to the inside back cover with a yellowing stamp hinge was an old faded slightly grubby paper lifeboat flag without its pin the sentimentalist in me was reduced almost to tears in glasgow i had taken to sitting in churches it was mostly just for the atmosphere catholic churches were best because they felt more like temples more involved with the business of religious observance there was always stuff going on candles burning people going to confession the smell of incense in the air id just sit there or a while listening but not listening seeing but not seeing there ut not there and finding solace in the hushed commerce of other peoples belief absorbed in the comings and goings of the public and the priests and their respective professions of faith a father would approach me now and again but id tell him i was just browsing i walked a lot dressed in my docs and jeans and a long tweed coat that had been my fathers uncle hamish sent me thick letters full of original insights into the sacred scriptures which i dipped into sometimes when i couldnt sleep i never got further than page two of any of them i frequented the glasgow film theatre and installed a video and a tv in the lounge i bought a ghettoblaster which usually lived in the flats kitchen and so became known as the gateauxblaster but which i would take walkabout with me sometimes at least partly for the weighttraining which transporting the brute from room to room provided id stand and look at timedark paintings or run a finger over the line of some cold marble animal while the tall glittering rooms resounded to the pixies rem goodbye mr mackenzie the fall and faith no more hes here ash said coming back with the drinks she sat down i looked around i saw him after a while a little shorter and a little youngerlooking than id expected from the tape id seen he was talking to a couple of other guys they were all dressed in grey trench coats and one had put a hat down on the bar that at least looked like it ought to be called a fedora i wondered if the other two were also journalists rupert paxtonmarr a foreign correspondent his meticulouslytrained razorsharp mind ready in an instant to describe a place as wartorn and bring home to us all events and disasters in far away places to talk of people tearing at the rubble with their bare hands to reveal that only with dawn did the full extent of the devastation become apparent and even in the very best traditions of british popular journalism to ask people whod just seen their entire family duly butchered burned crushed or drowned how do you feel ash seemed contemplative eyeing me with a steady gaze well i said feeling my heart beat faster and my palms start to sweat i took the two torn matchbook covers out of my pocket think ill go see what he has to say for himself want me to come ash started to move in her seat i shook my head then bit my lip shit i dont know all the way down here i was just going to go up to him and say you send these to my dad but now i dont know it feels a bit weird i looked over at the three men i mean i laughed theyre even wearing trenchcoats ash looked briefly over too hey she said smiling theyre on wine theyre not just knocking back whiskies and heading off theyll be here a while yet sit and think for a moment i nodded took a deep breath and drank some whisky i thought about it some more then i said okay maybe we should go together you could sort of introduce i could go out and pretend to just come in hell i could just tell him the truth i dont know i closed my eyes appalled at my own lack of gumption ash got up putting a hand on my shoulder sit here ill tell him ive just recognised him you come over later just mention the matchbooks dont show them not at first how does that sound i opened my eyes i shook my head and said oh i dont know good as anything right ash went over to the men she pulled something from the back of her head as she went and shook her long fawn hair down it was the length of the jacket i smiled to myself thats my girl i thought i saw them look her up and down rupert smiled then looked mystified as she talked animated hands waving then he laughed his tanned handsome face smiled and he looked her up and down again the expression changed just a little though after that as though something else had occurred to him he looked a little more wary so it appeared to me anyway he held out one hand seeming to make introductions ash nodded he pointed to the bar she shook her head then nodded back at me rupert paxtonmarr gazed above me then dropped his gaze he looked at me then back at ashley she was talking to him his expression went through puzzlement maybe concern then went wary again finally cold studiously expressionless he nodded leaning back against a post supporting the front of the bar ash glanced back at me her eyes opening wide for an instant then she turned back to the men i started to get to my feet ruperts expression didnt change as i walked over two couples passed in front of me weaving their way between the tables when theyd passed rupert was already on his way to the door mouth smiling broadly one hand alternately waving and pointing at his watch as he backed off by the time i got to where ash and the two guys in the trench coats were standing hed made it out to the street i stood there frowning at the door rupert paxtonmarr had exited through something about the way hed moved as hed backed off had left me with an uncanny feeling of déjà vu ash looked surprised so did the two guys one of them looked me up and down jesus christ he said howd you do that usually only women with toddlers screaming daddy in tow have that sort of effect on rupe remember remember i thought to myself and smiled i turned to the man and shrugged its a gift i told him he owe you money or somefink the second man said they were both about thirty lean and cleancut both were smoking i shook my head ash laughed loudly no she said holding her hands out to the two men its just that the last time we all met up we all got filthy drunk didnt we presley and rupert thinks presley here presley ash was indicating me when she said the name presley i thought thinks that rupert tried to proposition him which he didnt of course but it was all a little embarrassing wasnt it dear her happy smiling face looked demandingly at me i nodded dumbly as the two men looked at me as well embarrassing i confirmed ash was beaming smiles all over the place like a laser gone berserk i mean she said tossing her hair rupert isnt gay is he and presley she looked suddenly sultry voice slowing going a little deeper here she took an extra breath her gaze flickering down from my face to my crotch and back certainly isnt then she seemed to collect herself and directed a broad smile to the two men they looked suitably confused presley presley i yelled as we walked rapidly along thomas more street how could you i waved my hands about a light drizzle was falling out of the orangeblack sky ashley strode on grinning she held a small umbrella her heels clicked sorry prentice it was just the first thing i thought of but it isnt even very different from prentice i shouted she shrugged well then thats probably why it was the first thing i thought of ash laughed its not funny i told her sticking my hands into my pockets stepping over some empty pizza containers it wasnt funny ash agreed almost prim its your reaction that is she nodded great i said there are two guys going around now who think my name is presley but to you its just a hoot i stepped on a wobbly paving stone and jetted dirty water up my chinos jeez i muttered look said ash sounding serious at last more to the point im sorry i fucked that up i dont know why he dashed off like that all i said was id a friend with me i didnt even say you wanted to meet him or anything it was weird she shook her head weird we had escaped from the pub after finishing our drinks and chatting awkwardly on my part easily on ashleys with ruperts two friends howard and jules a stilted conversation whose most useful result seemed to have been a general agreement that old rupe was a lad eh doesnt matter i told her i saw a taxi coming with its light on and suddenly remembered i was rich i know where i saw him now i stepped into the road and waved you do ash said from the kerb yep the cab pulled in things were looking up my usual klingon cloaking device which has tended to engage automatically on the rare occasions i have felt rich enough in the past to afford a taxi seemed to have been deactivated i held the door open for ashley so you going to tell me or be all mysterious she said as she got in ill tell you over dinner i sat beside her and closed the door dean street soho please i told the driver i smiled at ashley dean street she said eyebrow arching amongst many other things i owe you a curry when i was fifteen i had my first really bad hangover on friday nights i and some of my school pals used to meet at the droid family house in gallanach wed sit in droids bedroom watching tv and playing computer games and wed drink cider which droids big brother purchased for us for a small commission from the local offlicence and smoke dope which my cousin josh mchoan uncle hamishs son purchased for us at an exorbitant commission in the jacobite bar and sometimes do speed which came from the latter source as well then one night dave mcgaw turned up with a litre of bacardi and he and i finished it between the two of us and the next morning i was woken up by my dad to a strange and horrible new feeling vho as rory would have written nsg at all there had been a phonecall for me hugh robb from the farm near the castle reminding me id agreed to come and help with making the bonfire for guy fawkes night he was coming out to pick me up this of course was not really what i needed any more than i needed dad lecturing me on how unsound a custom it was to build bonfires on november the fifth and so celebrate religious bigotry didnt i know it had been an anticatholic ceremony and the effigy burned on the fire used to be the pope but i couldnt admit to mum and dad id been drinking and had a hangover so i had to get dressed with my head pounding and my insides feeling distinctly unwell i waited outside on the porch steps taking deep breaths in the cool clear air and wishing the hangover would just go away then i suddenly thought maybe it wasnt a hangover maybe this pounding in my head was the first symptom of a brain tumour and so i ended up praying that i did have a hangover hugh robb was a big amiable scotch broth of a lad he was a full year older than i was but we were in the same class at school because hed been kept back a year he arrived in a tractor hauling a trailer full of branches and old wood and i rode with him in the cab wishing that the tractor had better suspension and that hugh could have thought of something else to talk about other than the prolapsed uterus of one of the farms cows round the hill from the castle there was a big eastfacing field it was surrounded by trees on all sides but the slope gave it a view towards bridgend i still thought of it as the ponies field because it was where helen and dianas ponies had been stabled originally before theyd been moved to a more level paddock west of the castle hugh and i unloaded the broken planks and the great bare grey branches from the trailer we worked together for a bit then i continued to stack the wood while hugh went to collect some more he made a couple of trips dumping what looked like about a tonne ot wood each time before announcing he was off to another farm where they had even more wood i let the tractor disappear bumping along the track towards the castle then collapsed back in the huge pile of branches awaiting my attention i lay spreadeagled and halfsubmerged on the springy mass of grey leafnude wood and stared up at the wide blue november sky hoping the bass drum inside my head would hit a few thousand restbars reasonably soon the sky seemed to beat in time to the throbbing inside my head the whole blue vault pulsing like some living membrane i thought about uncle rory and his discovery that it was not possible to influence tv screens from afar by humming i wondered as ever where he was hed been gone a couple of years by that time a bird swung into view over the trees behind my head and i lay there and i watched it broad flatwinged flight feathers at the square wingtip ruffling like soft fingers the small quick head flicking this way and that the browngrey body between the soft density of wings tilting and turning as it glided the cool air tail feathers like a rich brown fan beauty i whispered to myself smiling despite the pain in my head then suddenly the buzzard burst and sprayed across the sky it fell plummeting limp and trailing feathers to the ground a double crack of sound snapped across the field the bird fell out of sight behind me i blinked not believing what had happened then rolled over looking through the mask of branches at the trees edging the field where the sound of the shots had come from i saw a man holding a shotgun just inside the trees looking to one side then the other then running out into the field he wore green strapped wellies thick brown cords a waxed jacket with a corduroy collar and a cloth bunnet one more prick in a barbour jacket but this one had just shot a buzzard he gazed down at something in the grass then smiled he was tall and blond and he looked like a male model enviable jaw line he stamped down on the thing in the grass looked around again then backed off finally turning and walking smartly back into the woods i should have shouted or taken the bird to the police as evidence buzzards are a protected species after all but i didnt i just watched the barbour disappear into the trees then rolled over and breathed fuckwit he was at the firework party the following night laughing and talking and sharing a dram from ferguss hip flask i watched him and he saw me and we looked at each other for a few moments before he looked away all in the furious writhing light of the pyre that i had put together and which contained pushed in near its now blazing centre the corpse of the bird he had killed chapter we stood beside the observatory dome on the battlements of castle gaineamh facing into a cool westerly breeze lewis in cords and a greasebrown stockmans coat looked through the binoculars his black hair moving slightly in the wind verity stood at his side face raised shining to the winter blue sky bulky in her thermal jacket her skigloved hands clasped thickly under the bulge of her belly the plain beyond the woods below holding gallanach and cupping the inner bay was bathed in the deepshadowed sunlight of late afternoon wisps of cirrus moved high above tails trailing up promising clear weather a twocoach sprinter moved in the distance on the viaduct at bridgend windows glinting in the sunlight i took a deep breath and could smell the sea the unopened airmail packet from colorado lodged next to my chest between shirt and jacket make a crinkling flexing noise giving me a funny feeling in my belly no sign verity asked lewis shook his head mmmm verity shivered she hunched her shoulders bringing them up and in towards her neck brr she went she linked arms with lewis ah he said protesting still looking through the field glasses though now at a slight angle verity tutted and with a gorgeously pretended scowl moved away from her husband and stepped over to me she slid an arm round my waist snuggling i put an arm round her shoulders she rested her head against my arm i looked down at her she was growing her hair a little the sides of her head werent actually shaved any more she smelled of baby oil lewis had what sounded like the enviable job of smoothing it over the bulge in an attempt to fend off stretch marks later i smiled unseen and looked back to the north is that whatdoyoucallit verity said nodding no thats thingymabob lewis said just as i said hey well remembered dunadd verity said patiently ignoring both of us she was looking at the small rocky hill a kilometre to the north where the footprint is correct i said lewis glanced at us grinned he lowered the binoculars a little cant see it from here but thats where it is dunadd rock had been the capital of dalriada one of the early and formative kingdoms in scotland the footprint looks more like a bootprint actually just a smooth hollow in the stone was where the new king had to place his foot when he made his vows symbolically i suppose to join him to the land can i have a look verity said lewis handed her the glasses arid she leant against the stone battlements supporting her belly lewis stood behind her chin lowered onto her shoulder right at the summit isnt it verity asked yep lewis said she looked at dunadd for a bit i wonder she said if you had one of your feet planted there when you gave birth i laughed lewis went wideeyed drawing up and back from his wife she turned round grinning wickedly at lewis and then me she patted lewiss elbow joke she said i want to be in a nice warm birthing pool in a nice big hospital she turned back to the view lewis looked at me had me fooled i shrugged runs in the family after all can you see that stone circle too verity said lifting the binoculars to gaze further north earlier that day helen urvill verity and lewis and i had been behaving like tourists the land around gallanach is thick with ancient monuments burial sites standing stones henges and strangely carved rocks you can hardly put a foot down without stepping on something that had religious significance to somebody sometime verity had heard of all this ancient stoneware but shed never really seen it properly her visits to gallanach in the past had been busy with other things and about the only place she had been to before was dunadd because it was an easy walk from the castle and of course because we had lived here most of our lives none of the rest of us had bothered to visit half the places either so we borrowed ferguss range rover and went siteseeing tramping through muddy fields to the hummocks that were funeral barrows looking up at mosscovered standing stones plodding round stone circles and chambered cairns and leaning on fences staring at the great flat faces of cupandring marked rocks their grainy surfaces covered in the concentric circular symbols that looked like ripples from something fallen in a pond frozen in stone did i ever tell you about the time i used to be able to make televisions go wonky from far away it was a bright and warm day back in that same summer rory had come out to the hebrides with us rory and i were walking near gallanach going from the marked rocks in one field to the stone circle in another i remember i had a pain in my side that day and i was worrying that it was appendicitis one of the boys in my class that year had almost died when his appendix had ruptured it was just a stitch though uncle rory was a fast walker and id been intent on keeping up with him my appendix waited another year before it needed taking out we had been visiting some of the ancient monuments in the area and had started talking about what the people whod built the cairns and stone circles had believed in and that had led us on to astrology then suddenly he mentioned this thing about televisions making them go wonky i said no well rory said then turned and looked behind us we stood up on the verge as a couple of cars passed us it was hot i took off my jacket well rory repeated i was a few years older than you are now i guess i was over at a friends house and there was a bunch of us watching top of the pops or something and i was humming along with a record i hit a certain deep note and the tv screen went wavy nobody else said anything and i wondered if it was just coincidence so i tried to do it again and after a bit of adjusting i hit the right note and sure enough the screen went wavy again still nobody said anything rory laughed at the memory he was wearing jeans and tshirt and carried a light jacket over his shoulder well i didnt want to make a fool of myself so i didnt say anything i thought maybe it just worked on that one particular television set so i tried it at home and it still happened the effect seemed to work from quite a distance too when i stood out in the hall and looked into the lounge it was still there stronger than ever then we were going up to glasgow mum and i and we were passing a shop window full of tvs and so i tried this new gift for messing up tv screens on them and hummed away to myself and all the screens went wild and i was thinking great i really can do magic the effect is getting stronger i could appear on tv and do this maybe it would make everybodys screens go weird wow i said wanting to get home and try this myself so rory said i stopped in my tracks and i asked mum i said mum watch this watch those screens and i hummed for all i was worth and the pictures on the screens went wavy and mum just looked at me and said what and i did it again but no matter how hard i tried i couldnt get her to see the effect eventually she got fed up with me and told me to stop being silly i had screens going mental in every tv shop we passed in glasgow that day but nobody else seemed to be able to see it rory grimaced looking across the edge of the plain beyond gallanach to the little rocky hill that stuck up from the flat fields now i wish i could remember just what it was that made the penny drop but i cant i mean usually a beautiful assistant says something stupid and the clever scientist says say that again and then comes up with the brilliant plan thats going to save the world as we know it but as far as i remember it just came to me what i said rory grinned down at me vibrations he said vibrations yeah the vibrations i was setting up in my own skull actually in the eyeball i suppose were making my eyes vibrate at about the same frequency as the tv screen flickers so the screen looked funny but only to me that was the point and it made sense that the further away you were from the screen as long as you could still make it out of course the more pronounced the effect would appear he looked down at me you see yeah i said i think so i studied the road for a bit then looked up disappointed so it doesnt really work after all rory shook his head not the way i thought it did no he said i frowned trying to remember how wed got onto this whats that got to do with what we were talking about i asked rory looked at me ahha he said and winked he nodded at a gate set in the low wall facing the road beyond were the standing stones here we are here we are the stairdoor creaked open i went to help helen she handed me a tray with four pewter mugs the mulled wine steamed it smelled wonderful mmm great i said helen took my hand and stepped out through the little halfsize door onto the battlements her broad face was tanned and her body looked lean and fit after some earlyseason skiing in switzerland she wore meindl boots an old pair of leather trousers that had belonged to her mother a cashmere sweater and a flying jacket that looked distressed enough to have seen action over korea if not greater germany her hair was shining black and shoulder length she took a mug help yourself she said any sign of him nope i said i held the tray out to lewis and verity who made the appropriate noises and took a mug each helen nodded at the corner of the airmail package inside my jacket still incubating that prentice i grinned yeah we stood there sipping the hot spicy wine looking north prentice ash hes done it who doctor gonzo yeah printing it out now mail you the hard copy tomorrow morning hell email it to me too ill download the files and stick them on a disk your compaqll accept and bring it with me next week when i come up for hogmanay unless you got a modem yet did you no no i didnt okay thatll be the arrangement then sound all right to you yeah great ill write back to say thanks he ah say what the files actually were in the end text that all he said yep prentice he hasnt read whatever he found well probably not more than the first few lines to check they were in english not gibberish once hed cracked it i dont think he was really interested in what was actually written there but it is text right text should get to you in a few days airmail the big envelope from the states had arrived in the mail this morning five days after ash had called the return address was dr g computing science faculty university of denver co id stared at the thing as it lay there on the front door mat my mouth gone oddly dry i had a slight hangover and had decided as i gingerly picked the disappointingly slim package up that id open it after breakfast then after breakfast id thought maybe i should leave it until later especially when verity rang and invited me over to the castle it was the last day of a full twelve months after that fateful party when mrs mcspadden had sent me down to the cellar for some more whisky we were all back here for the usual round of parties and visits and hangovers i was mostly looking forward to it all even though i was still trying to find reasons not to ask fergus the things i knew i ought to ask him about mr rupert paxtonmarr but then maybe i oughtnt to ask them at all maybe what was in this airmail package would relieve me of the need to ask any questions i told myself i kept coming back to the distinct possibility that maybe i was making something out of nothing treating our recent local history like some past age and looking too assiduously too imaginatively for links and patterns and connections and so turning myself into some sort of smallscale conspiracy theorist i had been immersed in my studies all term and everything seemed to be going well my professor reading my tutorial papers and essays had gone beyond noises of encouragement and vicarious complacency to a sort of uncomprehending peevishness that id contrived to fail so spectacularly the year before meanwhile in the history that we were currently living through it looked like a war was going to start in just over two weeks but apart from a kind of low background radiation of species ashamed despair because of that personally i felt not too bad mum appeared to be holding out despite christmas and new year traditionally being a bad time for the bereaved she had actually started building the much talkedabout harpsichord turning a spare bedroom at lochgair into a workshop which at the moment looked suitably chaotic james had mostly rejoined humanity to the extent that several times over the last few weekends before christmas hed taken his walkman phones off long enough to have what could with only a little generosity be described as a conversation lewis was doing well verity was almost disgustingly healthy apart from the occasional sore back and a bladder that appeared to have become inordinately susceptible to the sound of running water and i actually looked forward to seeing lewis and verity now much to my own amazement there was still a distant pang when verity smiled at me but it was more remembered than real i looked at my watch in four hours id be setting off for glasgow airport for ashley she was booked on a late flight and id volunteered to go pick her up shed be working until halffive in london this evening and it would have been pushing the old cv a bit to get to scotland let alone here in time for the bells i scanned the skies to the north watching for movement i was looking forward to the drive even if it was at night and i wouldnt be able to see the scenery the wind gusted a little and i supped my mulled wine the woods evergreen and deciduousbare swept down to the fields and then the town forests rose on the hills to the east anybody heard the news today lewis asked nothing special happening helen said i guessed shed got an update from mrs mcspadden who tended to keep the tv on in the kitchen these days all quiet on the desert front breathed lewis taking up the glasses again and looking north towards kilmartin you sure hell come that way verity asked lewis shrugged think so said he would helen confirmed verity stamped her feet hey helen said i never asked you lewis you got any gulf jokes lewis made an exasperated noise still looking through the binoculars na i heard a couple of crap irish ones and the usual suspects in different disguises but there hasnt been anything good i was trying to work on a routine about if the stealth bomber worked as well as it did in panama the b as it did in viet nam and the marines as effectively as they did in lebanon then saddam had nothing too much to worry about but it wasnt funny enough he brought the glasses down from his eyes for a moment in fact it wasnt funny at all i know a girl from school whos out there helen said nurse yeah verity said stamping her feet again ha lewis said suddenly you seen him verity said clutching lewiss arm he laughed glancing down at her no he said and grinned at me but guess who got called up as a reservist i shrugged i give in i didnt think i knew anybody in the forces lewis smiled sourly jimmy turrock used to be a bandsman theyre the stretcherbearers in war time i frowned not recognising the name jimmy i began then i remembered the gravedigger i laughed yeah lewis said turning away again raising the glasses the gravedigger i felt cold inside and my smile faded wow i said some sense of humour the army has work experience lewis muttered whos this youre talking about verity asked guy helped us bury dad lewis said oh she said she hugged lewis you going to go if they call you up prentice helen urvill said not looking at me hell no i said which ways canada yeah muttered lewis shame dads dead maybe he could have got us into the equivalent of the national guard if we have one traffic wardens i suggested lewiss shoulders shook once you really wouldnt go helen said to me one eyebrow raised i might send them some blood if they ask me nicely i told her in an oil can i suppose we cant use the telescope can we verity said suddenly nodding at the white dome to our right as well as the binoculars i mean she looked at each of us nup helen said too narrow a field of view lewis said and upside down i added verity looked over at the dome there was a smile on her face do you remember that night we met in the dome she said looking up at lewis we hadnt seen each other since we were kids lewis handed the glasses to helen who held them onehanded straps dangling lewis hugged his wife of course i do he said and kissed her nose she buried her face in his coat i looked away thinking about the drive up to the airport this evening maybe i should allow another halfhour or so for the journey just in case of holdups and of course they were building new bits onto the airport at the moment could be a problem parking and tonight was bound to be busy id leave early no sense in leaving late and having to hurry i had taken to driving a bit slower and more carefully these days mum still worried but at least i could reassure her with a clear conscience i sighed and the package against my chest flexed again i looked down at it hell this was silly i ought to read the stuff waiting until i got back to the house and was sitting at the desk in the study was just putting it off hows the wonderful world of swiss banking these days anyway hel lewis asked oh wacky and transparent as ever helen said they started talking about zurich and london and i sat down on the slope of slated roof behind them i pulled the airmail package out and opened it carefully verity looked back at me and smiled briefly before turning back to helen and lewis to share some joke about the hard rock café my hands felt clammy as i slid the sheets of paper out of the thick white envelope this is daft i thought it probably is gibberish or rorys job application for that travel programme presenters job a cv for the tv nothing important nothing revelatory the first sheet was a letter from the good doctor arcane with acronyms and abbreviations telling me how hed deciphered the binary mush hed been sent and turned it into what i held in my hands he sounded like a likeable guy but i kind of just glanced at the letter i went on to the printout there were about fifty or sixty pages of singlespace laser print the first twenty or so pages were taken up with pieces i recognised articles and poems and the nameless play rory had apparently decided to cannibalise for the end of crow road then came three passages of prose i glanced up at the others helen and verity were still talking lewis was looking through the binoculars towards gallanach i started reading and my mouth went dry i raced through each of the passages my eyes bulging hands shaking the voices of the others the cool december air and the chill slates under my backside seemed like they were all a million miles away as i read what uncle rory had written dyou know where the twins were conceived no idea he said and belched fucking mccaigs folly thats where what oban the very place good grief you dont mind me saying this i mean talking about fiona like this do you no no he waved one hand your wife you talk about her no no thats bad that sounds bad im all for womens lib might have bloody known might have bloody known you would be bloody typical if you ask me youre a bolshie bastard mchoan and you are the unacceptable face of capitalism ferg that was how the first passage began i finished it and realised my mouth was hanging open i closed it and started dazed the next passage henriss never liked him either fat lipped beggar queer yknow thass wha hes singing you know dyou know that scuse me while i kiss this guy disgussin absluley disgussin fergus do shut up scuse me while i kiss this guy bloody poofter coon im sorry about this lachy thats okay mrs u you no going to put your seat belt on no no not for short journeys lachy lachy lachy lachy im sorry about your eye really really sorry never forgave myself never here shake holy fucking shit i whispered when i finished it suddenly my hands felt very cold i looked at the slates i was sitting on then over at the dome of the observatory gleaming in the low winter sun you okay prentice verity said frowning at me from the battlements i nodded tried to smile fine i gulped i turned to the third and last passage fiona sat in the passenger seat of the car watching the red roadside reflectors as they drifted out of the night towards her she was thrown against one side of the seat as fergus powered the aston around the righthander and on through to the end look and that was all i looked up brain reeling yo helen said looking through the binoculars she bent at the knees and put her mug down on the stones under her feet then rose smoothly again you see him verity said turning still hugged within lewis arms to look out over the battlements could be helen said she handed the field glasses over to lewis yeah might be he said it was veritys turn next with the binoculars i swallowed a few times put the sheets of paper back in their envelope i stood up and walked over to the others in a kind of trance verity shook her head na i cant see the damn thing she handed the glasses to me youre looking pale prentice you sure youre okay fine i croaked not looking at her i took the binoculars thanks id seen the speck unaided by that time once id found it again the binoculars enlarged the dot into the frontal silhouette of a highwinged light aircraft flying more or less straight towards us its body pointed a little to the south west to compensate for the wind it waggled in the air a little as it flew down the glen encountering a gust high above kilmartin christ lewis said its a mig on a bombing run everybody down i handed the glasses back to helen who didnt look particularly amused she frowned at me you okay prentice fine i said you should have loaned your dad your jacket lewis told helen doesnt fit him helen said binoculars at her eyes i watched the dot of the plane drift closer towards us through the northern sky you were in a sleeping bag i heard lewis say softly to verity he was holding her from behind chin on the crown of her head i must have missed what theyd said earlier i felt weird i was glad the battlements were too high to fall over if i fainted verity smiled i remember we were all smoking and playing cards and taking turns to look at the stars and we got the munchies she frowned there was diana and helen and what was that guys name she glanced round and up at lewis wayne somebody darren somebody lewis said he accepted the glasses from helen held them with one hand and balanced them on veritys head hoy stand still sorry sir she said darren watt i said the plane was closer now but harder to see it had dropped below the level of the hills behind and was no longer silhouetted against the sky you could still see it with the naked eye though it glinted once verity nodded lewis tutted in exasperation he was the gay guy wasnt he verity said yup lewis said sculptor good too fucking shame that was oh god verity said of course he died bike crash helen said scooping up her mug of cooled wine from the flagstones and draining it the plane was flying over gallanach now i thought i could hear its engine i remembered standing here once with mum years ago fergus and dad were shooting at clay pigeons in a field to our right somewhere and i remembered hearing the flat crack crack noise of the guns and thinking they sounded just like one plank falling on top of another blam indeed remember remember verity laughed making lewis tut again you were doing your radio impressions she said that night remember of course lewis said why was i in a sleeping bag verity said frowning at the approaching plane you were in the cupboard helen smiled she waved out across the chill afternoon air above gallanach i looked back at the plane which was switching its lights on and off oh verity said yeah the wee cubby hole ah ha helen said as lewis waved too still watching through the binoculars now elevated above veritys head but it was really a secret passage was it verity asked glancing at helen yeah di and i used to take the bit of wood off at the back and get into the attic wander all over anything interesting in there lewis asked the plane was in a shallow dive angling towards us a few hundred metres away just pipes and tanks helen shrugged there was a loft door into mum and dads room she smiled when we started getting interested in sex we used to pretend wed get up there one night and see if we could catch them at it but we were too frightened helen laughed lightly had us giggling ourselves to sleep a few nights though and anyway ferg had put a bolt on it the little white cessna roared overhead waggling its wings lewis and verity and helen all waved i stared up seeing the single tiny figure waving in the cockpit the plane banked circled round the hill the castle stood on and came back over lower engine loud and echoing in the woods beneath i made myself wave oh dear fucking holy shit i thought the plane waggled its wings again then straightened out over dunadd as fergus took the cessna his christmas present to himself back north to its home at connel that it said verity yup helen said what did you expect lewis asked a crash oh said verity heading for the door to the stairs lets get back in the warm blam remember remember amman hilton look just use it kiss the sky you idiot prentice lewis said from the little door i looked over at him prentice he said again wake up prentice id been staring after the departing plane oh i said yeah on still shaky legs i followed the others down from the windblown battlements and into the warm bulk of the great stone building so the televisions werent going wonky at all i said still struggling to understand thats right rory said it just looked like it to me only he plucked a long piece of grass from beside one of the standing stones and sucked on the yellow stalk i followed suit so it was in your head not real well rory frowned turning away a little and leaning back on the great stone he folded his arms and looked out towards the steep little hill that was dunadd i stood to one side watching him his eyes looked old things in your head can be real he said not looking at me and even when they arent sometimes they he looked down at me and i thought he looked troubled somebody told me something once he said and it sounded like it had really hurt him hed seen something that made him feel betrayed and hurt by somebody he was very close to and i felt really sorry for this person and im sure its affected them ever since but when i thought about it hed been asleep before this thing had happened and asleep again afterwards and it occurred to me that maybe hed dreamed it all and i still wonder why dont you tell him that rory looked at me for a while his eyes searching mine making me feel awkward he spat the blade of grass out maybe i should he said he nodded looking out across the fields maybe i dont know he shrugged i stood there back at the same stone my uncle rory had rested against a decade earlier id left the castle and driven here to the stone circle shortly after wed come down from the battlements there was still plenty of time to get back to lochgair for dinner before i had to set off for glasgow and ash i leant against the great stone the way rory had when hed talked about the man betrayed the man whod seen or thought hed seen something that had hurt him i looked ahead out over the walls and fields and stands of trees i shivered though it wasnt especially cold see i said quietly to myself maybe rory had been looking at dunadd that day as id assumed at the time but beyond dunadd just a little to the right on this line of sight i could see the hill where gaineamh castle stood its walls showing blunt and steel grey through the naked trees prentice yeah food come on its getting cold mum had been calling from the bottom of the stairs i was sitting at the desk in the study curtains open to the darkness just the little desk light on its brass stalk gleaming its green shade glowing i looked back down from my reflection in the dark computer screen first to my watch still half an hour before i had to leave to pick up ashley and then to the thin batteredlooking pocket diary lying opened on the desk fri f cas lrvr trak hills bothy fire fd dnk js f stnd rt in clng guns f nsg trs scrts f barfd welcome to argyll i saw her hair first shining tighttied in a spotlight somewhere down the domestic arrivals concourse i hadnt seen ashley watt for about six weeks after that night in london when id seen but not talked to rupert paxtonmarr ashley was dressed in the same businesslike suit shed worn that night and carried a big shoulder bag her smile was broad ash great to see you i hugged her lifting her off her feet woo she laughed throatily how ya doin presley i winced dramatically but still offered to carry her bag prentice you read a couple of things your uncle wrote and suddenly youre accusing people of murder come on havent you looked at the files doctor gonzo sent over of course not not my business prentice ashley sounded indignant oh before i forget she said reaching for her jacket on the back seat and digging into a pocket she took out a little threeinch sony disk and handed it to me present from colorado yours to tinker with thanks i said putting the disk in my shirt pocket i might too the spelling mistakes have been annoying me i moved my head the stuffs in that envelope on the back seat you dont want me to read it now do you theres a torch am i allowed to finish building the spliff first okay but then read id waited till we were out of glasgow before id told ashley about the horrible ideas concerning fergus that i just couldnt get out of my head most of the journey from lochgair up to glasgow id spent thinking trying to work out what might be true and what false in the fragments of writing that rory had left on disk the rat in the ceiling and the confession of something overseen that was what had taken me back to stand amongst the standing stones that afternoon after id left the castle and remembering what rory had said to me there had taken me back to that diary entry rt in clng f nsg trs scrts and the diary with the words just use it and the l that had been changed to a c the l must stand for lachlan watt and the f for fiona that was the secret fergus had told rory that mght in the bothy the story of fergus waking up after being brought home from hamish and tones party and crawling through the castle roofspace to see his wife in bed with lachy watt that was the party that fiona and lachlan had left together of course all i had was rorys fictionalised word for any of it so id asked my mum over dinner did fiona leave a party with somebody else she repeated looking mystified its just something in one of rorys poems i said not earthshakingly important or anything but theres an odd sort of note that well i just wondered if you knew or had heard i shrugged sipping my glass of water mum shook her head helping herself to some more peas the only time i ever saw fiona leave a party with somebody else fergus was there too in body at least uhhuh i said scrts i owed the last absurdly simple part of the theory to a stag that had suddenly run onto the road while i was zapping down glen croe between the restandbethankful and ardgartan one moment the road ahead was clear in the headlights next second wha something dark brown looking big as a horse with huge antlers like some twisted aerial array came belting out of the forest across the road and leapt the downhill crash barrier i slammed the brakes on nearly locking the wheels the beast disappeared into the darkness and the car swept through the single cloud of steamy breath it had left behind id come off the brakes and accelerated again almost immediately shaking my head and muttering curses at all kamikaze deer and feeling my heartbeat start to slow again after my fright id adjusted my seat belt and looked over at the passengers seat something had moved there when id braked id left the airmail envelope holding the printout of rorys pieces sitting on the passenger seat because i wanted ashley to read them the envelope had slipped forward under the deerinduced sharp braking plonking down into the passenger footwell id tutted waited for the straight along the side of loch long checked for traffic then reached over retrieved the package from the footwell and put it back on the seat and that had set me pondering id passed through arrochar in a daze thinking of course ashley read the relevant passage while we travelled the new fast stretch of the loch lomond road yeah she said slowly mmhmm she put the sheaf of papers down switched off the torch looked at me then lit the j so this is rorys idea of what happened just before fergus and fiona crashed yeah and is this rory indicating your aunt fiona fucked my uncle lachy she sounded almost amused right i said i glanced at her kind of fanciful isnt it she said jeez he was hardly ever here and they didnt really move in the same social circles damn i breathed maybe you should have read the other two bits first hmm ashley drew smoke in handed the j to me i took a small toke yuk whats this herbal mixture ash said no point giving up fags and then smoking tobacco in js hmm i said handing the number back so what are you saying prentice did i miss something maybe i shook my head letting the car slow as we approached tarbet or maybe im reading too much into it want to read the other two bits ash sighed accepted the j back and switched the torch back on we passed tarbet accelerating over the shallow neck of land to arrochar pottered through the village at less than forty then gathered speed again as we curved round the head of loch long passing the place where id retrieved the airmail package from the footwell a couple of hours earlier yeah but what did fergus tell rory ash said finishing that part read the next bit i said i waved my hand when ash offered me the joint the road started to climb along the dark shoulder of the hillside towards the restandbethankful leaving the old road still down in the floor of the glen i kept a careful look out for mad stags from hell crashing across the road but none appeared woof ash said closing the last page horny stuff towards the end there she switched the torch off again you think that last bit is what fergus told rory in the bothy if it really happened yeah i said theres a diary entry to back it up and there is a way through the castles attic from the observatory to the master bedroom and a loft door helen mentioned it just today but prentice ash laughed coughing all youve got is rorys written word for it its all circumstantial i know although mum does remember the party at hamish and tones and lachy did help fiona take fergus home wow ash said tartly so anyway whats happened is fergus has spilled these beans to rory whos spent years trying to come up with some creative ideas for his big project and failed dismally then decided just use it use the one spectacular piece of reallife drama only he and fergus know about hes written this sort of diary piece about the time they were in the bothy together another more fictionalised bit about what fergus actually saw and then a third passage that well thats the point i glanced over at her i was hoping you might see the same thing i did in that last bit the bit in the car i think that was what rory was writing just before he borrowed the bike and went to see fergus because of what he had started to suspect when he was writing that went to see fergus yes i looked over at her and fergus killed him what and fergus killed him ash said voice high why prentice she opened the window a crack and threw the roach out ill come to that i said holding up one finger we were passing loch restil now i was still watching out for stags ashley shook her head prentice have you been reading crime novels instead of your history books i gave a small laugh no the worst crimes are always in the history books anyway ash undid her hair reached into her bag and started to brush her hair with a longtooth comb hmm she said okay so keep going right i said that guy paxtonmarr hed been sending dad those matchbook covers i mean matchbook covers right yeah so so he knows fergus fergus was getting the guy to send them making dad think rory was still alive farting around all over the world why should fergus want to do that i dont know but whats so special about matchbook covers i looked over for a moment her face was pale in the lights of an oncoming car that bit in the bothy i told her rory tells fergus he accidentally set fire to a barn on the estate when he was a kid i think the only other person roryd ever told about that was dad who thought that nobody else knew so when these matchbook covers came from all over the world he thought it was a secret sign from rory ashley was silent for a while then sighed what fertile imaginations you have in your family yeah i said im afraid so we rounded the long lefthander into glen kinglas where verity had almost lost the backend of the beemer a year earlier the long straight disappeared into the darkness a few tiny red sparks in the distance were tail lights i had another shivery feeling of déjà vu ashley tapped her fingers on the dashboard then ran them through her hair after a while she said and what did rory suspect murder his sisters murder ash took her time before answering you think fergus killed your aunt fiona as well i nodded you guessed it she was already dead when they had the crash hmm i hadnt thought of that i admitted i came off the power i checked the mirror there was nothing following us and no headlights in front no i believe rory got it right in that bit he wrote and she was alive when they crashed i was thinking of something else what ash said braked smoothly as though we were approaching a sharp corner not on a long straight from the corner of my eye i could see ash looking at me i changed down to second gear let the engine brake the car i reached over and hit the little red release button on ashleys seat belt then i slammed the brakes on the golf skidded briefly along the road on locked wheels i heard ashley shout something her hands went out in front of her she shot forward harder than id intended and went oof against the dashboard blonde hair flying her head hit the screen the car juddered to a stop i stared in horror ash sat rubbing her forehead she glared at me she was holding her chest just underneath her breasts with her other hand she glared at me what the fucking hell was that for prentice oh shit i said hand to mouth oh god are you all right i checked the mirror put both hands to my mouth i didnt mean to actually hurt you well you actually did you idiot she looked down at her seatbelt anchorage then at the buckle one side of the belt was still wrapped round her i sat staring at her my back against the drivers door my heart pounding ashley patted her forehead studied her fingers then scowled at me and sat back in her seat refixing her seatbelt she waggled her shoulders sticking her chest out a little and grimacing through the screen at the dark grey length of road exposed to the headlights you complete fool prentice i may never dance the rhumba again she looked at me then pointed forwards drive god im sorry i said i got the car moving again ash patted her chest and inspected her forehead in the mirror on the back of the sunvisor using the torch shed been reading with no lasting damage done i think she said snapping the torch off and the visor shut im really sorry i said i rubbed my hands on my trousers one at a time i didnt mean enough ash said i promise i wont sue okay yeah i said shaking my head but im really you think ash interrupted that your uncle fergus killed his wife by driving off the road and undoing her seat belt just before they hit i took a deep breath yes slow down will you ash said eh i said slowing we hadnt been going particularly fast then i realised oh yeah i said feeling even worse i pick my places dont i ash didnt reply we both watched silent as the golf dawdled past the parking place at the cowal road junction where darren watt had died shit i said oh god im doing an awful lot of apol forget it ash said lets get home i shook my head oh shit i said miserably the lights of inveraray were off to our right steady across the dark waters of loch shira as we rounded strone point when ash spoke again bit of a risky way to top your wife isnt it convincing though and maybe dont laugh i said glancing over at her maybe the perfect crime ash looked at me dubiously oh dear prentice really im serious i said he banged his head he doesnt remember the last few miles of the drive he even asked to be hypnotised though they never did shortterm memory gone see hell if he did it just on the spur of the moment maybe even he isnt sure he meant it he told me himself that he thought fiona had been wearing a seat belt i saw him just after the crash while i was in hospital too getting my appendix out so nobody maybe not even him will ever know its fucking perfect risky but perfect if it does work we stopped at traffic lights by the ornate humpbacked bridge that took the road over the aray i sat staring at the red light inveraray sat ahead round the side of the little bay white buildings glowing in the sodium twilight of the street lights but if he doesnt know he did it ash said putting the sun visor down again and checking her forehead in the mirror in the lights of the oncoming stream of traffic why would he kill rory anyway i shrugged maybe he does know he did it but even if he doesnt he might guess that he did maybe he was afraid rory would publish something too close to the truth maybe rory was threatening to tell people about his theory the police for a start maybe neither murder was premeditated maybe fergus just reacted both times i dont know hmm ash said she sat looking baffled for a bit then shook her head the lights changed and we crossed the bridge if im right i said fergus probably had thought about killing her before he did maybe he only actually decided then and there on the road that night but he must have thought about it like i say even if he isnt sure he did it himself he knows he might have i mean how hard do you have to think about something how seriously before it becomes something you could do in the heat of the moment i give in said ash you tell me jeez i said when i was feeling really bad last year i used to lie awake at night thinking that if there was some way of killing lewis quickly painlessly with no way of being found out i might just do it especially if i knew somehow that verity would turn to me afterwards oh for gods sake prentice ash said turning her head to watch downtown inveraray slide past a minute later we were out accelerating down the darkness of the loch side look i said i was pretty fuckedup i mean im not saying it wasnt my own fault ash i know it was im not looking for sympathy im just trying to explain that some crazy stuff can go through your head sometimes through love or jealousy and maybe if its triggered by something i mean if somebody had actually given me a method of killing lewis like that id probably have been horrified i hope i couldnt even have thought about doing it any more once i knew it was possible it was just a fantasy a kind of warped internal therapy something i daydreamed about to make me feel better i shrugged anyway thats the case for the prosecution ash sat mulling for a while so she said have you checked out whether fergus was alone the night rory may or may not have gone to see him i mean this whole thing falls to pieces if your uncle he was alone ash i told her mrs mcspadden had gone to visit relatives in fife that weekend mum and dad had suggested the twins came and stayed with us fergus brought them over about tea time i remember talking to him he had a couple of drinks and then he left so he was alone in the castle ash looked at me i just shrugged okay she said eventually she rested her elbow on the door and tapped at her teeth with one set of nails her skirt had ridden up a little and i stole the occasional glance at her long blackly shining legs so she said later when we were in the forest away from the loch side and a few kilometres out of furnace what is to be done prentice i dont know i confessed theres no body well there is aunt fionas but thats neither here nor there but rorys still missing in theory i suppose i could go to the boys in blue with what ive got but jeez can you imagine right sonny so you think this wee story that yeve read means yer uncle wiz kilt ah see would you mind just putting on this nice white jaikit aye the sleeves are a wee bitty on the long side but you wont be needing yer hands much in this braw wee room weve got for you with the very soft wallpaper we curved down into furnace the road finding the loch shore again i could sense ash looking at me and chose not to look back concentrating on checking the mirrors and the instruments eventually she took a breath okay supposing fergus did kill rory what did he do with the body probably hid it i said not too near the castle he had plenty of time all night he had a land rover he could have got the bike in the back bit of a struggle maybe but fergus is a biggish lad and a suzi isnt that heavy it did occur to me he could have driven the bike himself with the body lashed to his back looking like a pillion its a bit mezentian but possible but then hed have had to have walked back from wherever he left it i looked over at ashley who was staring at me with a worried even frightened expression i shrugged but i think he took it up to one of the lochs in the hills in the landy used the forestry tracks and dumped body and bike together into the water there are plenty or places the forest to the south of the castle on the other side of the canal its just full of little lochs up there and there are tracks to most of them its the obvious whats the matter i asked youre right into all this arent you what do you expect i laughed a strange tight feeling in my belly what if im right jeez this guy might just have killed two of my close relations wouldnt you be kind of interested ash breathed out oh dear prentice she sighed shaking her head and staring out of the window at the night as we swept through the forest towards lochgair oh dear oh dear we pulled up outside the watt house in bruce street before eleven ash looked in the visor mirror again she frowned and held her hair away from her face turning her head from side to side cant see a bruise she said i looked over no i think youre all right there i spread my hands look im really sorry oh shush ash said she nodded at the house coming in just for a minute id like to ask a favour of your mum yeah ash said reaching into the back for her flight bag let me guess you want to get in touch with uncle lachy i turned the engine off and killed the lights aye i wondered if she might let me have his phone number in australia id like a wee word with him yeah i bet you would we got out of the car and walked up the path towards the door i had a brief chat with mrs watt gracefully refused a dram and left after five minutes a shower scattered raindrops in bright cones under the street lights as i drove away i went up bruce street then took a couple of lefts onto the oban road where it ran along the side of what had been the slate mine wharf when i saw the building site i pulled in and stopped the car the site was lit with a sort of hollow orange dimness by the nearby sodium lamps it was here id come with ashley that night after margots percussive cremation we sat here on the ballast mound the world hill it was the night shed told me about berlin the jacuzzi and the man whod hinted there was some trick being played on somebody in gallanach shed given me that piece of the berlin wall shortly after wed sat together here the developers had been going to level the mound the following day preparatory to putting up some new houses but it looked like they hadnt got very far the old wharf was derelict again levelled all right and with foundation trenches dug but no more little wooden stakes were stuck into the ground near a few of the trenches loose bits of wet string tied to them lay straggled across the ploughedup ground there were no earth movers or dumper trucks on the site any more just a couple of loose piles of bricks the bottom few layers already overgrown by weeds a picket fence round the site had been knocked flat almost all the way round and the developers signboard hung flapping in the breeze secured at only one corner to a rickety lopsided framework gone bust i supposed and with a look at where the ballast mound had been drove away chapter the line went dead twenty thousand kilometres away and a lot more than that if you took the satellite route my words had a man put the phone down on me i listened to the electronic buzz for a while then replaced the onyx handset in its gold cradle i put my hands between my knees looked out through my own reflection in the study windows to the darkness of the park and the string of orange lights along kelvin way and felt a cold sick feeling coiling in my belly i was running out of excuses for doing nothing if lachlan watt had said what or how dare you or something like that even if hed just denied it indignant or amused and perhaps especially if he asked me to repeat what id just said id have had some doubt but to put the phone down did that make sense i mean youre living quietly in australia the phone goes and somebody you last remember as a kid in scotland has the nerve to ask if you ever slept with his aunt in her marital bed do you put the phone down without another word it the answers no maybe you do everybodys different maybe i still didnt know enough i lowered my head to the green leather surface of the antique desk and banged my head softly a couple of times my hands still clasped between my knees id been putting this off for days and anyway weeks had passed first ashleys mum hadnt had lachys number then she got it off somebody else in the family then it turned out it was an old number i hadnt tried it anyway and hed moved then there was a delay getting the new number and when mrs watt did phone up with it id dithered what was i supposed to say how did i broach the subject come right out with it talk round it hint accuse make up some story about a justdiscovered will with a bequest to the one man shed been unfaithful with or the one shed most enjoyed being unfaithful with should i pretend to be a lawyer a journalist offer money i fretted for days and could have gone on doing so for months id stayed in glasgow that thursday night completing a paper on the effect of industrial growth on the drive towards the unification of germany in the eighteenth century it wasnt actually due in until the following friday but i reckoned that slamming the blighter in a whole seven days early would keep the prof happy id turned one of the late mrs ippots firstfloor reception rooms into a study moving a giant oak and leather desk over to the window with the help of gav and norris id bought a pc similar to but faster than the machine at lochgair and plonked it roughly in the middle of the megadesk where it looked a bit lost but clashed nicely for the essay on german unity id surrounded the computer with a dozen delicately beautiful pieces of meissen pottery whether they had any positive effect on the worth of the paper i dont know but they were a lot more soothing to look at while i was searching for inspiration than a blinking cursor id finished the paper about am and printed it out i thought about getting in the car there and then dropping the paper through the letterbox of a pal whod take it in to the department for me tomorrow and then heading for lochgair but i was tired and id already told mum id be down in the morning i didnt want to wake her by arriving in the middle of the night so id had a whisky and gone to bed the main bedroom in mrs ippots expansive town house contained a canopied fourposter about the size of a double garage the sleeping surface of which was about the same height as a minis roof the posts were telegraphpole thick highly polished mahogany carved into representations of fairies elves and gnomes all stacked like little caryatids i liked to imagine they were the work of an amerindian totempole maker whod read too much tolkien the centrepiece of the bedroom was a vast chandelier cut from rubycoloured murano glass it hung like a glistening spray of frozen blood from the centre of a giltsmothered ceiling whose few flat patches were covered in paintings of cherubs and fawns cavorting in a sylvan landscape that appeared to be equal parts rubens and disney the walls of the room when not hidden from view by the beds luxurious but islamically abstract brocade side curtains were covered with huge rococo canvases of venus in various guises settings and ages though all shared the same state of déshabillé and a rotundity of figure that must have required the painterly equivalent of softfocus to appear so leniently attractive where the walls did not glow with acres of flesh they reflected that golden voluptuousness with great giltframe mirrors which almost visibly strained the walls they hung on and which i couldnt help but notice also provided rather a good view from and of the silksheeted bed id understood mrs ippot had been elderly and frail when she died but i rather hoped shed had more fun in the bed than just lying there contemplating the condign punishment id decided she had devised for her immediate family certainly i had yet to share the space between those sheets with anybody though the bedrooms sheer scale and stateliness did lend masturbation an air of solemnity and arguable dignity the apprehension of which had previously quite passed me by even the bedside tables were chippendale one of them was topped with a large cutcrystal venetian vase which i kept fruit in when i remembered otherwise it played host to the little lump of concrete that had been part of the berlin wall which ashley had given to me over a year earlier the bedroom also contained the greater part of mrs is collection of camphorwood chests a few too many perhaps despite the visual and tactile splendour olfactorily it was like sleeping in a chemists however the sad truth is that being surrounded by art treasures designed to excite the eye gladden the gland and animate the avarice does not guarantee a full nights kip id woken at about halfsix lain there restlessly for a bit then given up trying to get back to sleep and got up to have some toast and a cup of tea id put the tv on in the kitchen and found we were at war i sat and watched it for a while heard the cnn guys in baghdad saw the reporters report from saudi airfields listened to the studio pundits gibber about surgical strikes and pinpoint accuracy and discovered that these days war is prosecuted not waged actually both words struck me as possessing greasily appropriate connotations in the circumstances fuck it i said to myself what was telephoning somebody you hardly know on the other side of the planet and asking them impertinent questions about their sex life compared to this gratuitous malfeasance i strode up the stairs to the receptionroom study determined to make the phone call i settled on the direct approach and the truth about myself and lachy watt put the phone down on me maybe he just wanted to get back to the tv and watch our exciting third world war for a bit id stayed in the lochgair house over hogmanay itself we had plenty of drink in and mum and i had prepared loads of food but not many people actually visited after the bells verity went to bed about ten past midnight after struggling to stay awake from about ten oclock she had a very small glass of whisky at the bells some people from the village came in about one aunt tone and uncle hamish arrived about two for half an hour of strained conversation and some of jamess pals called in after four but mostly it was just mum lewis james and i together james conked out about six but lewis and i were determined to see the dawn come up just on principle we sat in the conservatory talking and listening to cds on the gateaux blaster which id brought down with me from glasgow because it sounded better than the golfs own sound system which anyway didnt include a cd player we were drinking whisky chasing it with pints of mineral water pacing ourselves lewis felt we were both starting to nod off at one point and so suggested a game of chess i mooted for the river game but wed have had to have dug the board and everything out and read through all the rules so we decided chess would be simpler ive been too sensible i told him while pondering a pawn exchange sensible lewis sounded surprised you i grinned well look at me im studying im living quietly im coming home to mother each weekend i even bought a sensible reasonably cheap car all that money i got i shook my head im twentytwo i should have blown it all on floozies or dangerous drugs or just took off round the world or bought a ferrari you cant buy a ferrari for forty grand lewis said chin in hands studying the board i didnt say it had to be a new one lewis shrugged well youve still got most of the dosh go ahead go do some of that stuff yeah but i sort of promised mum id get this degree okay so wait till the summer and then do it but mumll just worry if i get a fast car so take off round the world yeah maybe i might lewis looked up at me what are you intending to do anyway prentice he grimaced stretched rubbed his face i mean are you still just going to wait and see whos recruiting graduates and then take what sounds like the best job or have you settled on something yet something you actually want to do i shook my head still open that one i said i took the pawn lewis had offered he looked vaguely surprised i still like the idea of just being a historian i told him you know ideally but that means staying in academia and i dont know if thats what i want somehow i dont think they let you go straight from graduation onto primetime tv with a twentysix part dramatised history of the world sounds a little unlikely lewis agreed taking my pawn you given up on the diplomatic service i smiled thinking back a year to uncle hamishs party well im not sure im cut out for that ive met some of those people theyre bright but in the end you have to do as youre damn well told by fuckwit politicians ah politics then lewis said i bit my lip looking the length and breadth of the board trying to work out if the bishop i wanted to move next was going to cause any problems in its new position na i should have started by now anyway but shit you have to make deals you have to lie or come so damn close to lying it makes little difference its all so fucking expedient lewis they all have this thing about my enemys enemy is my friend he may be a sonofabitch but hes our sonofabitch i mean good grief what a crock of shit that is i despair for our species not politics then i wonder if noam chomsky needs an assistant i said probably got one lewis said yeah i sighed probably lewis looked quizzical everything else all right yeah i said feeling awkward why he shrugged studied the board again i dont know i just wondered if there was anything hi guys we both looked over to see verity hair in spiky disarray face soft with sleep wrapped in a long white towelling dressing gown padding into the conservatory holding a glass of milk morning i said hi there darlin lewis said swivelling so she could sit on his lap she put her head on his shoulder and he kissed her forehead you okay she nodded sleepily then she straightened drank some milk and ruffled lewiss hair might get dressed she said yawning been having nightmares aw lewis said tenderly you poor thing want me to come to bed verity sat on lewiss lap rocking back and forth a little her bottom lip pouting she frowned and said no she smoothed lewiss hair again ill get up you finish your game she smiled at me then looked up nearly dawn why so it is i said beyond the glass of the conservatory there was just the faintest hint of grey in the sky over the house verity waved byebye and went off head down rubbing her eyes back into the house i moved the bishop lewis sat and thought i had won a knight and another pawn for the bishop when verity came back she was washed and dressed she looked fabulous in leggings and a black maternity dress with a black leather jacket over the top she stood at the doors clapped her hands together and when we appeared quizzical waved some keys at us and said fancy a drive we looked at each other and both shrugged at the same time we took lewis and veritys new softtop xri roof down heater up full out into the greypink dawn and drove through lochgilphead and then into gallanach and just cruised about the town waving at the people still walking around the place and shouting happy new year at one and all lewis and i had brought the whisky just in case we met anybody we felt we ought to offer a dram so we started with each other and all that water during the night must have done us the power of good because the whisky tasted great id looked back at the castle as wed passed the hill on the outskirts of gallanach feeling guilty and ashamed and nervous because i still hadnt done anything about my suspicions but telling myself that i still didnt have any real evidence and anyway i was offduty now this was the season to have fun after all hogmanay letsgetootoorbrains time and naturally an endofyear truce hell it was traditional lets go down shore road and drop some whisky on that grave dad hit lewis shouted suddenly mr andrew mcdobbie and his wife moira deserve to be thought of at this time ugh you ghoul said verity no i said its a great idea verity to the church which is how we came to find helen urvill and dean watt wandering through gallanach along shore road arm in arm dean was playing necessarily softly on his stratocaster while helen held a bottle of jack daniels they were being followed by a bemusedlooking dog happy new year shouted dean watt and struck a chord there ensued a great deal of happy new years the mongrel that had been following helen and dean joined in by barking there were lots of hugs and handshakes and kisses too before helen urvill yelled yo verity as she hung on deans shoulder and breathed bourbon fumes at us you sober girl yep verity nodded briskly want a lift anywhere helen swung woozily round to look at dean who was fiddling with a machinehead well we were heading back for the castle she frowned deeply and her eyes flicked around a bit i think she shrugged her thick black eyebrows waggled but if youre going somewhere lets go somewhere verity said to lewis who was in the passengers seat somewhere further she nudged lewis okay lewis said got a full tank where we going to go oban boring glasgow what for how about i suggested over the noise of the barking hound that bit north of tighnabruaich where you can look out over the kyles of bute thats a nice bit of scenery brilliant lewis said great idea lets go get in then and lets take the dog is it cartrained who cares we can point it over the side if it comes to it fuck it yeah lets take the mutt might not want to come dean said and handed the fender to lewis who put it at his feet with the neck by the door while dean knelt down by the side of the dog which was sniffing at the rear wheel of the escort course it wants to come helen said with the conviction only the truly drunk can muster not a dog been born doesnt like sticking its nose out a car window here you go grunted dean lifting a puzzledlooking canine of medium build indeterminate breed and brownly brindled coat into the car and onto my lap hey thanks i said as helen clambered in beside me and dean squeezed in on her far side so its me that gets to find out if this beasts shitscared of driving ah stop whining helen said and pulled the fishysmelling dog away from me to plonk it in deans lap all set asked verity i wonder if its wee eyesll light up when the brakes go on dean said trying to look into them all set helen yelled then did some yodelling as we did a uturn and went smoothly back through the town helen offered me some jack daniels which i accepted we still shouted happy new year at people and the dog barked enthusiastically in accompaniment it didnt seem in the least discomfited when we left gallanach and headed through lochgilphead and away we stopped briefly at lochgair i ran into the house mum was up washing dishes i kissed and hugged her and said wed be a few hours not to worry verity was bright as a button and so sober it ought to constitute a crime in scotland at this time on a hogmanay morning she told me to make sure nobody else drove then and be careful she made me take a load of sandwiches dips and godknows what two bottles of mineral water and a flask of coffee shed just made and i staggered out the house and had to put most of it in the convertibles rather small boot but then that was that and off we went through the calm brightening day playing lots of very loud music and munching through the various bits and pieces of food i hadnt stashed in the boot dog liked the garlic dip best i dont give a fuck what colour he is a man who cant pronounce his own name shouldnt be in charge of the most destructive military machine the world has ever seen i heard lewis say while i sat looking at dean watt and thought shit not again she did did she i said trying to look pleased well good for her nice chap is he dean shrugged okay ah suppose we were sitting on the rocks beyond the carpark crash barrier at the viewpoint above west glen overlooking the kyles of bute the island itself stretched away to the south all pastel and shade in the slightly watery light of this new years morning the waters of the sound looked calmly ruffled reflecting milky stretches of the lightly clouded sky damn i thought ashley had got off with somebody at liz and droids party dancin and winchin as dean had put it then gone off together and suddenly i felt like it had happened again maybe not quite as stylish as jumping off your uncles range rover into your future husbands arms but just as effective my heart didnt exactly go meltdown this time but it still wasnt too pleasant a feeling dean seemed happy to adjust his strat and pick out the occasional tiny tinnysounded phrase lewis and verity and helen were arguing about the coming war or at least lewis was ranting and they were having to listen aw hell lewis said im not arguing he isnt an evil bastard ashley i thought staring out into the view ashley what was i thinking of why had i taken it so slow what had i been frightened of why hadnt i said anything hadnt i known what it was i wanted to say democracy and freedom what our brave boys are actually going to be fighting for is to restore the nineteenth century to kuwait and defend the seventeenth century in saudi arabia now i thought i knew what i wanted to say but it might already be too late the knowledge and the provenance of its uselessness were the same a feeling of loss i couldnt deny did that mean i was in love with her if i was it felt quite different from what id felt for verity verity sat at lewiss side huddled in her leggings and leathers and wearing lewiss startlingly bright skiing jacket all orange and purple and lime she looked like a little psychedelic blonde buddha perched on the tartan car rug something calmer than that something slower ternational law is only so goddman sacrosanct when it isnt something awkward like the world court telling america to quit mining nicaraguan harbours but perhaps i was wrong about ash being interested in me anyway ashley was the one i remembered talking to in the jac that evening after grandma margots cremation she was the one who kept telling me to tell verity i loved her if you love her tell her wasnt that what shed said so if ashley felt anything for me beyond friendship why hadnt she said anything to me and if she did feel anything what was she doing going off with this friend of droids next time the us wants to invade somewhere and see what happens outll come that good old veto again heck we got lots of practice using that well do it if the yanks dont panama this place with the ditch you dont like the guy in power any more after paying him all that cia drug money over the years ah why not on you go seven thousand dead never mind we can hush that up could i finally be right and a woman was taking up with somebody else to make me feel jealous i doubted it maybe she had been patiently waiting for me to tell her how i felt or make some sort of move and now she was fed up waiting so all bets were off but why should she have been so passive was ashley that oldfashioned didnt sound like it from what shed told me it was her who went after that texan systems analyst not the other way round if shed fancied me at all shed have said or done something about it before now wouldnt she resolutions are fine unless theyre against israel of course in which case aw sheeit you guys just stay in them golan heights and that gaza strip shoot them palestinians probably werent aw goshdarn did i say shoot them palestinians well hell no we wont mention that twentythree years the israelis have been ignoring un resolutions and occupying foreign territory south east and north hells teeth theyd probably invade the mediterranean if you told them the fish were palestinian but does the us lay siege to them impose sanctions like fuck they bankroll the place maybe she did think of me as a brother all those times id rambled drunkenly away to her about how much i loved verity and what a hard time i was getting from everybody and how wonderful verity was and what a poor harddoneby kid i was and how much i loved verity and how nobody understood me and how wonderful verity was how could you expect anybody to listen to all that moronic selfpitying selfdeluding crap for so long and not think poor jerk we paid him to fight the iranians for us but now the scumbags getting uppity so well pay other scumbags like assad to help fight him and itll all happen unloading all that stuff on ash most people would have told me to fuck off but she listened or at least didnt interrupt but what must she have been thinking the response just couldnt be oh hes so sensitive or oh what a deep capacity for lurve this young fellow has poor jerk that about covered it or just jerk a modern day hitler its pol pot even saddam hussein hasnt obliterated two million of his own people but does the west mount a crusade against that genocidal motherfucker no were supporting the vicious scumbag the united fucking states of america and the united fucking kingdom think hes just the bees knees because hes fighting those pesky vietnamese who had the nerve to beat uncle sam but maybe she hadnt really got off with this guy maybe it was all a mistake maybe there was still a chance oh shit i thought and watched a seagull glide smoothly through the air below us over the tops of the trees and the bundled rocks that led down to the distant shore oh said verity suddenly and clutched her belly and looked wideeyed at lewis who was in full flight over the vexed sands of kuwait and apparently quite beyond verbal interception sabra and chatila ask the kurds in halabja he stopped dead looked at his wife who was still clutching her belly looking pleadingly at him lewiss jaw dropped and his face went white verity hugged herself put her head between her knees and started to rock back and forth ohoh she said lewis staggered to his feet hands flailing while veritys shoulders started to quiver the dog which had been snoozing at lewiss feet jumped up too verity whats wrong is it began helen leaning over and putting an arm on veritys shoulders whos the least drunk lewis hollered gaze oscillating rapidly between the car parked a few metres behind us and his wife sitting rocking back and forth and shaking the dog barked bouncing up on its front feet then sneezing oh oh oh said verity as helen hugged her aw christ said dean verity youre no about to drop are ye lewis stood with his hands out fingers splayed eyes closed on the rock i dont believe this is happening he yelled the dog barked loudly in what sounded like agreement helen urvill her face down at veritys knees where veritys head was still wedged suddenly slapped verity across the back and rolled away laughing dean looked confused i felt the same way then realised lewis opened his eyes and stared at helen lying laughing on the rock verity rose quickly and gracefully her face pink and smiling she stepped up to lewis and hugged him rocking him her face tipped up to his as she giggled joke she told him it isnt happening i keep telling you this babys going to be born in a nice warm birthing pool in a nice big hospital nowhere else lewis sagged he might have fallen if verity hadnt held him he slapped both hands over his face you unutterable minx he roared and put a hand to each side of veritys grinning face holding her head and shaking it she just giggled so we sat and had some coffee and sandwiches damn fine coffee muttered lewis well he had a tartan shirt on we drove back later i watched buzzards and crows and gulls stoop and wheel and glide across the undersurface of thickening grey cloud we were all very tired save verity and i must have fallen asleep because it came as a surprise when we had to stop to put the top up in inveraray when the rain came on it was a cramped claustrophobic journey after that and the dog whined a lot and smelled we got to lochgair i staggered into the house collapsed into my bed and slept for the rest of the day i kept missing ashley after that whenever i rang the watt house she was out or asleep she rang me once but id been out walking next time i called she had caught the train for glasgow en route for the airport and london tone and hamishs usual posthogmanay soirée had been even more subdued than usual hamish had given up drink but apparently found his heretical ideas on retribution more difficult to jettison and so spent most of the evening telling me with a kind of baleful enthusiasm about a commentary he was writing on the bible which cast new light on punishment and reward in the hereafter and which had great contemporary relevance i drove back to glasgow on the fifth of january after new years eve watching fergus show off his new plane i hadnt visited the castle again two weeks later after i had had my abbreviated conversation with lachlan watt in sunny sydney i set off for lochgair at nine that friday morning listening to the war on the radio for as long as i could until the mountains blocked out the signal war breaks out amongst the oilfields and the price of crude plummets from being an ally so staunch he can missile american ships and it passes as an understandable mistake and gas thousands of kurds with barely a gesture of censure thatcher promptly increased his export credits and within three weeks britain was talking about all the lovely marketing opportunities iraq represented for chemicals presumably saddam hussein had suddenly become adolf hitler despite more or less being invited to walk into kuwait it was a war scripted by heller from a story by orwell and somebody would be bombing their own airfield before too long no doubt from glasgow to lochgair is a hundred and thirtyfive kilometres by road less as the crow flies or as the missile cruises the journey took about an hour and a half which is about normal when the roads arent packed with tourists and caravans i spent most of the time shaking my head in disbelief at the news on the radio and telling myself that i mustnt allow this to distract me from confronting fergus or at the very least sharing my suspicions with somebody other than ash but i think i already knew that was exactly what would happen and ash god the damn thing may be just muscle merely a pump but my heart really did seem to ache whenever i thought of her so i tried not to think about ashley watt at all utterly unsure whether by doing so i was being very strong or extremely stupid i chose not to make an informed guess which my track record didnt encourage such honesty mum dropped her laserguided bombshell over lunch that day we were sitting in the kitchen watching the war on television dutifully listening to the same reports and watching the same sparse bits of footage time after time i was already starting to get bored with the twin bluepink glowing cones of raf tornadoes afterburners as they took off into the night and even the slomo footage of the exciting britmade jp runwaycratering package scattering bomblets and mines with the demented glee of some satanic santa was already inducing feelings of weary familiarity on the other hand such repetition left one free to appreciate the subtler points in these reports that might otherwise have gone unnoticed such as the fact that the english could pronounce the soft ch sound after all the little rascals had only been teasing us all these years saying lock lomond and lock ness why it must be something genetic wed all thought but no places like bahrain and dahran were rolled confidently off the tongue by newsreader after newsreader and correspondent after correspondent as though theyd been using the technique for years unfortunately rather like a supergun there appeared to be a problem traversing such a sophisticated phonetic delivery system and while the arabian peninsula obviously lay in the favoured direction nowhere unfortunate enough to be located to the north of london seemed able to benefit from this newfound facility oh mum said passing the milk across the kitchen table to me assuming were all still alive next friday fergus has asked me to the opera in glasgow is it all right if we stay with you i watched the lines of tracer climb above baghdad impotent spirals of light twisting to and fro i felt frozen had i heard right i looked at my mother she frowned prentice are you okay wha i said i could feel the blood draining from my face i put the jug down feeling as white as the lowfat it contained i tried to swallow i couldnt talk so i settled for clearing my throat and looking at mum with a interrogatory expression fergus mum said tolerantly invited me to the opera in glasgow next friday may we stay with you i assume theres room i do mean separate rooms prentice she smiled are you all right youre not worried about the war are you you look white as a sheet im fine i waved one hand weakly actually i felt sick you look sick mum said i tried to swallow again she shook her head dont worry prentice they wont conscript you youre far too bolshie i really wouldnt worry hg i said almost gagging is that all right are we allowed to stay with you does your lease or whatever cover that ah i said at last yeah i nodded finally swallowing successfully yeah i think so i mean of course yes why not loads of room what opera what are you going to see macbeth macbeth oh i said trying to smile thats verdi isnt it yes i think so mum said still frowning would you like to come its a box so there should be room um no thanks i said i didnt know what to do with my hands which seemed to want to shake finally i shoved them in the pockets of my jeans you sure youre all right prentice of course mum tipped her head to one side youre not upset because im going out with fergus are you no i laughed why are you weve partnered each other at bridge a couple of times hes a friend prentice thats all mum looked puzzled right well i said yes of course theres room ill no problem good mum said and clicked a couple of sweeteners into her tea she was still looking at me strangely i turned and watched the war for a while jumping jesus now what i sat at dads desk it took longer to write down what i suspected than id thought it would i started with pen and paper but my writing looked funny and i kept having to dry my hand finally i used the computer and printed out what id typed i put the sheet of paper in an envelope and left it lying in the top right drawer of the desk i wished dad had had a gun but he hadnt i settled for the old bowie knife id had since my scouting days sticking the leather sheath down the back of my jeans i changed into a tshirt and a shortish jumper so that could get at the knife quickly feeling frightened and embarrassed as i did so mum was in what had been a spare bedroom constructing the harpsichord when i stuck my head round the door the room stank of varnish and the sort of oldfashioned glue youd rather not know the original source of im just going up to the castle to see uncle fergus i said you reminded me there are some pieces of lalique in the house im staying in i thought id have a talk to fergus about them see if he fancied bidding for them when the contents are eventually auctioned mum was standing at the workbench dressed in overalls her hair tied back she was polishing a piece of veneer with a cloth pieces of what she said blowing from the side of her mouth to dislodge a wisp of hair that had escaped the hair clasp lalique rené lalique glass you know oh yes she looked surprised fergusll see them on friday wont he well theyre in storage in the cellar i said i havent actually seen them theyre in the inventory i took a note of them but i thought if he did want to look at them maybe i could look them out in time for friday oh mum shrugged tipped oil from a bottle onto the brownstained cloth okay then say hello from me yeah i said i closed the door i walked away thinking i should have said more should have said well the conventional things you tell people when youre going in fear of your life but i couldnt think of a way to say them that wouldnt sound ridiculous and melodramatic id closed off the letter id left in the desk with quite enough of that sort of thing i thought i took the golf out of lochgair along the gallanach road the bowie knife was an uncomfortable lump down and across the small of my back its wood and brass handle cold on my back at first then warming i stopped and made a phone call in lochgilphead mr blawke sorry to trouble you at home ostensibly i was just checking out whether it was all right for me to mention the lalique to fergus before the expensive french glassware was included in any auction but really i was making sure the lawyer blawke knew where i was going it wasnt until i was at the foot of the castle driveway that i realised all this time id just been assuming fergus would be there as i hesitated hands shaking on the wheel it occurred to me there was probably a good chance he wasnt i hadnt checked after all and fergus frequently went away for the weekend maybe he wasnt at the castle relief coursed through me along with an annoying current of shame that i felt so relieved i took the golf up the drive the gravel circle in front of the castle held five cars including ferguss range rover oh god i said to myself i parked the golf behind a bristol brigand which sat half on the gravel and half on the grass i walked up to the doors and rang the bell prentice mrs mcspadden roared happy new year to you happy new year i said realising only then that i hadnt seen mrs mcs since the turn of the year i was permitted to kiss the formidable ramparts of one of mrs mcss cheeks is uncle fergus in i asked say no i thought say no aye he is that she said letting me into the castle i think theyre playing billiards ill take you up she stood aside to let me into the entrance hall with its glassyeyed audience of stags heads actually its sort of personal i said smiling faintly aware i was blinking a lot mrs mcs looked at me oddly is that a fact well then would you wait in the library ah all right i said we walked through the hall isnt this gulf thing terrible mrs mcspadden shouted as if trying to be heard there i agreed it was terrible she showed me into the library on the other side of the lower hall from the kitchen entrance i stood in there nervously trying to breathe normally letting my gaze flick over the ranked rows of impressive dark leather spines i wished my own was half so noble and upright the room smelled of leather and old musty paper i went to look out one of the rooms two small windows at the garden and the wood beyond i adjusted the knife down the back of my jeans so that i could get at it easily prentice fergus urvill said entering the library he closed the door behind him he was dressed in tweed britches and a pringle jumper over a checked country shirt with thick socks and brogues he brushed some greyblack hair away from his face his jowls flexed as he smiled at me lifting a little from the collar of his shirt i cleared my throat fergus stood there his arms folded after a moment he said what can i do for you young man i moved from the window to the large wooden table that filled the centre of the room and put my hands lightly on its surface to stop them shaking a seat back pressed into my thighs fergus i began i wondered i wondered if you knew where where my uncle rory might be fergus frowned then one eye closed and he sort of cocked his head still with his arms folded he leaned forward a little sorry your uncle uncle rory i said maybe a little too loudly but at least my voice didnt sound as shaky as id expected i lowered it a little to say i thought you might have an idea where he is fergus stood straight again the frown was still there around his eyes but his lips were smiling you mean rory who disappeared yes i nodded my mouth felt dry and i had to fight to swallow ive no idea prentice fergus scratched behind one ear with one hand he looked mystified why do you think i might know i felt myself blinking too much again and tried to stop it i took a breath because you got a man called rupert paxtonmarr to send matchbook covers to my dad my hands were shaking even though they were planted on the surface of the table i pressed down harder fergus rocked back a little on his brogues his frownsmile intensified rupert sending your dad what he looked a little amused a little confused and not nervous in the least oh god what am i doing i thought of course i hadnt thought to bring any of the matchbook covers with me matchbook covers i said my dry throat rasping from all over the world so that dad would think rory was still alive fergus looked to one side and unfolded his arms sticking his hands in his pockets he looked up at me hmm would you like a drink he said no i told him he moved to the other end of the table where there was a small wooden desk like the top of a lectern he opened it and took out a squat decanter and a crystal glass he took the glittering faceted stopper out of the decanter and poured some of the brown liquid into the glass frowning all the time prentice he said shaking his head and mating stopper and decanter again im sorry youve lost me what are you what is what do you think is going on ruperts sending or was sending kenneth matchbook covers from hotels and restaurants and bars in various parts of the world i told him as he stood relaxed one hand in pocket one hand holding the glass his face scrunched up in the manner of one trying hard and with some sympathy to understand what another is saying somehow i struggled on they were meant to convince dad that rory was still alive but i think hes dead dead fergus said drinking he nodded at the seat i was standing over arent you going to take a seat no thanks i said fergus shrugged sighed well i cant imagine the frown came back again has rupert told you he was doing this no i said and are you sure it wasnt rory fergus shrugged i mean was it his handwriting there wasnt any handwriting there wasnt fergus shook his head he smiled an expression that looked to be half sympathy and half incomprehension prentice im lost i dont see his voice trailed off the frown returned now wait a moment he said you said you thought i might know where rory is but if hes dead he stared looking shocked into my eyes i tried hard not to look away but in the end had to i looked down at the tabletop biting my lip prentice fergus said softly putting his glass down on the table ive no idea where your uncle is there was silence for a while rupert is an old school friend of mine hes a journalist who goes all over the world hes out in iraq at this moment in fact i havent seen him for a couple of years though he used to come and shoot on occasion he is a bit of a practical joker at times but fergus looked thoughtful he shrugged rory did tell me something once about setting fire to a barn on the estate once accidentally when he was very young that might tie in with these match boxes he shook his head inspected the contents of his glass but i dont think i ever mentioned that to rupert i felt sick nothing about some pieces of writing makes any sense does it writing fergus said tilting his head one eye narrowing he shook his head no whose writing rorys based on something that you saw here up in the roofspace of the castle and which you told rory when you were in that bothy together the night you shot the rat fergus had leaned forward again he looked totally bemused finally he jerked upright and laughed he looked at the glass he held maybe i should lay off this stuff youre making less and less sense as you go along here prentice rory and i did spend a night in a bothy once on the estate but there wasnt any rat he smiled and frowned at the same time or any shooting i dont think we even had guns with us we were fishing some of the outoftheway lochans and streams he sighed giving the impression of patient weariness is this something youve read yes i conceded what in your fathers papers since his death fergus looked as though he felt pity for me i nodded trying not to look down from his gaze sort of i breathed and who is meant to have seen what he raised one finger to his mouth bit briefly at a nail and examined it none of that makes any sense to you does it i said no confession revelation nothing to do with lachy watt fergus looked hurt he swirled the glass drained it that was a very long time ago prentice he said quietly he looked at me more sorrowfully than accusatorily we were only children we dont always appreciate the seriousness of what we do he glanced at his empty glass when were younger he put the glass on the table i couldnt match his gaze and lowered mine again i felt dizzy i heard fergus take in a breath prentice he said eventually i was quite close to kenneth he was a friend i dont think we saw eyetoeye on anything really but we we got on you know he was a gifted man and a good friend and i know i feel the loss i can imagine how you feel i ive had my own what i mean is it isnt an easy thing to cope with when somebody that close dies so suddenly everything can look well everything can look very black you know nothing seems right you even resent other people their happiness and well it just all seems very unfair it is a terrible strain to be under dont think i dont appreciate that and just now when the world seems he took another deep breath look old son im sorry i said stopping him i smiled shakily uncle fergus im very sorry i came here ive been silly i dont know what i was i shook my head looked briefly down i dont know what i was thinking ive not been getting much sleep recently i smiled bravely watching too much television maybe i waved one hand round a little as though flailing out for something just beyond reach then shrugged im sorry i concluded fergus looked serious for a moment then he gave a small smile he crossed his arms again oh well i think everything looks a bit sort of mad really at the moment doesnt it a bit i agreed i sniffed wiped my nose with a paper hanky sure you wont have that drink fergus said nodded stuffed the hanky back into my jeans no thanks i have to drive better be getting back right you are fergus said he saw me to the door he patted me on the shoulder as i stood in the doorway dont worry prentice all right yeah i said oh and i dont know if your mothers mentioned it opera friday i smiled fergus smiled too jowls wobbling ah she has yes no problem i said jolly good well thats all right then he offered me his hand we shook thanks uncle i said he nodded and i walked down the steps and across the gravel to the golf he waved goodbye from the steps looking concerned but encouraging i let the golf trundle down to the bottom of the hill where the drive levelled out and joined the tarmac singletrack which swept round the base of the hill towards the main road between gallanach and lochgilphead at the junction i stopped i just sat there for a while i raised my right hand and looked at the palm for a while then spat on it and rubbed it hard on the side of my thigh i tore the knife and its sheath out from my jeans and threw them down into the passenger footwell i looked in the rearview mirror where i could just see the reflection of the top of the castle its battlements and silver observatory dome through the limbs of the leafless trees guilty as charged you bastard i heard myself say then with a quick look either way i revved up slipped the clutch and sent the vw screaming along the road away from the castle the courtyard was empty and the house storm doors were shut when i got back to lochgair i parked the golf in the yard and got out my hands were shaking i felt like getting furiously drunk i stood there breathing hard in the calm air listening to gulls crying above the drive down towards the loch while crows crackled in the trees around the house like some drunken chorus scornful my heart was thudding now and my trembling hands were slick with sweat i had to rest back against the side of the car i closed my eyes the cries of the birds were replaced by a roaring noise in my ears jesus i thought if this was how i felt how must fergus be reacting if i was right and he was guilty now would be the time to watch him study him but i could barely have walked just then let alone drive back to the castle even if i had been able to summon up the courage to return eventually i felt better again and instead of going into the house went for a walk through the woods and the forest and up into the hills and sat on an old ruined wall on the hill topped by the cairn where dad had told us about the mythosaurs all those years ago i looked down to the trees and the loch in the pastel light cast by the bright gauzy overcast while the mild wind freshened i replayed that scene in the castle library time after time after time imagining that i remembered every word every movement every nuance of tone and phrasing every millimetric increment of body language trying to work out whether i was being terribly sensitive and acute or just insanely fanciful and paranoid sometimes i thought it was perfectly obvious that fergus was utterly genuine and all my ideas all my suspicions were demonstrably ludicrous of course the man was innocent i was insane guilty as charged indeed who was i to judge other times it was as though his every inflection and gesture shrieked artifice lies deception very good deception cunningly deployed lies and artful artifice but everything false all the same he had reacted just as you would expect somebody to react but was that the way somebody actually would react i didnt know and could not decide i got so angry and confused at it all i threw my head back and screamed at the grey sky roaring full force all noise and no meaning till my lungs emptied and my throat ached i doubled up coughing and spluttering eyes watering feeling marginally better but looking round guiltily hoping nobody had heard or seen only a couple of crows answered harsh voices calling from the trees beneath id chosen a vantage point from which i could watch the road and the house and only went back down there when i saw mums metro turn off the loch road from gallanach and flicker like a green ghost as it moved up the drive halfobscured by the trunks and branches of the bare grey oaks i suppose i was uncommunicative with james and my mother that evening i spent most of the time in dads study reading and rereading the three pieces rory had written about himself fergus aunt fiona and lachlan watt i looked through some of rorys diaries gritting my teeth at the impenetrable paucity of their desiccated information i turned on the compaq and looked at the letter id written that morning damn found a spelling mistake that had got through the spellchecker saw where id meant to type was i started drinking whisky after dinner sitting at the desk in the study at first craning over its leather surface sifting through the various papers and diaries my eyes getting sore i nearly spilled my whisky into the compaq at one point so i turned off the little greenshaded light on the desk and went over to the couch taking all the bits and pieces with me i switched on the standard lamp behind me and lay lengthwise on the couch surrounded by paper i had the tv on with the sound turned down most of the time using the remote to turn it up whenever it looked like there was something interesting coming in from the gulf i heard james go to bed about eleventhirty mum looked in to say goodnight about twelve i waved wished her pleasant dreams and kept on reading i woke up just after two with the whisky glass balanced on my chest and my eyes feeling gritty i finished the whisky even though i didnt really feel like it then went to bed i drank some water before i fell asleep the clock said when i woke up my bladder just at that point where it might or might not be possible to fall asleep again without having to go for a pee it didnt usually wake me with so poor an excuse i lay there for a bit listening to soft rain hitting the bedroom window maybe that was what had woken me i turned over to go to sleep again then suddenly started to wonder if id turned the computer off i had the feeling that i had but couldnt actually remember doing so fuck it i thought it would be safe enough i rolled over onto my other side but my bladder had woken up properly in the meantime and was demanding attention i sighed swung out of bed not bothering with my dressing gown even though the house had grown a little chilly by now there was an orange nightlight plug in a socket in the corridor i decided to save my eyes from the shock of putting on any more powerful illumination and navigated the anyway familiar route to the bathroom by the plugs pale orange glow i sat in the darkness peeing a sort of quartererection had made it advisable to sit down i smiled remembering lewiss spiel about trying to pee when you had a full bladder and a full erection at the same time i flushed the toilet washed my hands and drank some water from the tap mum must have been varnishing some part of the harpsichord earlier judging by the smell in the corridor i padded along to the study could just make out the dim shape of the desk and computer on the far side of the room when i opened the study door i couldnt hear the compaqs fan running or see a light on but i went over to it anyway i stood with my thighs against the wood and leather back of the desks chair and leant forward pressing the computers disk eject button in case i had switched it off but had left a disk in it no disk i yawned straightened and rubbed the inside of my right forearm where it had brushed against the glass shade of the little desk light the shade had been hot there was a little red dot glowing on the dark screen of the computer monitor must be the reflection of the tv on the other side of the room ha so i had left it i froze suddenly wide awake why was the light shade hot the little red light reflected on the screen winked out as though suddenly obscured i threw myself back from the desk just starting to sense movement behind me i fell backwards as something dark scythed past in front of my face and a noise like the wind terminated in a splintering crash somebody just a silhouette in the dim vague shadows of the room lit only by the feeble light spilling from the hall nightlight stumbled forward just behind where i had stood arms reaching in front of them pulling something long and dark and thin out of the wrecked back of the seat the figure started to turn as i landed heavily on my back on the rug i kicked out at their nearest knee wishing i was wearing my docs or anything come to that i felt my heel hit their leg huh sounded male he staggered a little then came forward at me one arm raised as i started to roll suddenly feeling very vulnerable and naked a smashing noise sounded from overhead metal and glass i kept rolling pushing up with my hands and leaping to my feet glass was falling from the ceiling as something thudded into the floor where id lain i was at the mans side as he staggered forward raising the bar or jemmy or whatever the hell it was from where it had struck the carpet i kicked him in what i hoped was the kidneys and watched him stumble to one side then something banged into the top of my head and hit my shoulder contusing me my feet crunched over something hard on the rug as i staggered more light from the hall as i stood swaying dazed and the attacker recovered i could see him better now all in black gloves balaclava his build uncle ferg i heard somebody whisper it sounded like me prentice said a womans voice distantly worriedly from the corridor i watched the man in front of me seem to hesitate arm raised i was falling i staggered backwards trying not to fall crashing into a filing cabinet prentice mum screamed somewhere then james get back the dark figure looked towards the hallway where the light was i nearly fell round the side of the filing cabinet then pulled myself up on some shelves staring back at the blackdressed man in the middle of the room there was movement at the study door sparks flashed in the middle of the ceiling i clutched at something on the bookshelf graspable heavy enough an ashtray or bowl i threw it heard it hit his body and clunk to the floor he still stood there maybe only for a second or so but it seemed like an eternal hesitation while he glanced from me to the hallway again i thought i heard a door slam i roared shouting incoherently the way i had on the hillside that afternoon as i stumbled from the shelves past the filing cabinet and nearly fell over the desk while he came forward at me arm raised again i picked up the computers keyboard from the desk hauling it bursting free and swinging it as hard as i could at him as he brought his arm down there was a terrific boneringing crash that seemed to infect the whole world like an electric shock and a thunderclap and an earthquake all at once there was an odd pattering and clinking noise from every part of the room i stood holding nothing blinking in the darkness while somebody moved stumbling away obscuring light i felt weird my feet and arms and head felt buzzy and sore but when i felt my head i couldnt feel any blood feet felt slippy i heard the phone on the desk make a noise and picked it up still dazed which service said a mans voice police i heard my mother shout sorry i mumbled i put the phone down pushing myself away from the desk i tripped on the pale remains of the keyboard its lettered keys lay scattered about the floor like teeth i stubbed my toe on something bent down and picked up a long steel bar i limped to the top of the stairs in time to see the front door slam shut my head felt buzzy again i went into the kitchen found the broken door lock and two full red plastic petrol cans sitting on the kitchen table then got back out into the hall still holding the steel bar even though it was beginning to feel very heavy and shouted mum mum its all right i think before i had to sit down at the kitchen table because my tongue had suddenly become a clapper in the bell of my skull and my head was ringing i put my arms on the table and rested my head on them while i waited for the echoes in my head to go away welcome to argyll i told myself the kitchen light was painfully bright when it went on mum brought me my dressing gown and put a blanket over my shoulders and made me drink heavily sugared tea and i remember thinking sugared tea dad must have died again and mumbling something about having a flag in my foot when mum washed them and put bandages on them and wondering why she was looking so upset and james so frightened then police came they seemed very large and official and asked me lots of questions later doctor fyfe appeared looking slightly dishevelled and i recall asking him what he was doing up at this time in the morning and how he was these days old ticker holding out all right was it chapter we were on the battlements i faced into the cool north wind i waited to feel the dizziness of déjà vu but didnt maybe too much had happened or not enough time had passed well whatever the heathen equivalent is lewis said will you of course i said i looked down into the small pink face bundled inside the old family shawl kenneth mchoan had his eyes tightly closed and wore an expression of concentration on his features that implied sleep was a business of some deliberation one of his hands the thumb so small it could have fitted on just the nail of one of my own thumbs was held up near his chin the fingers made a slow waving motion like a sea anemone in a ray current and i jiggled up and down a little cradling the sleeping child and going shhshh i glanced at verity sitting beside lewis her arm round his waist she looked up from her sons face for a moment uncle prentice the godfather she smiled an offer only a churl could refuse people have their own absorption spectra prentice said diana urvill as she took a corning turnofthecentury cut glass plate out of the display case in the castle solar and after wiping the plate with a lintfree cloth handed it carefully to me we both wore white gloves i took the plate like an immense ice crystal with too many angles of symmetry and placed it on the table on the topmost sheet of foam i folded the translucent padding over thinking how much it looked like prawn crackers secured it with tape then found a suitably sized box and placed the plate in the centre on a bed of small white expandedpolysytrene wafers that looked like flattened infinity symbols i lifted one of the giant sacks of the wafers and filled the box to the brim with them covering the wrappedup plate then closed the box and took the little card diana had left on the table and taped it to the side of the box where it could be read then i put the box on a fivehigh pile near the door the stacking limit was six so it completed that column absorption spectra i said sceptically as we started to repeat the whole process with a fritsche rock crystal ewer diana dressed in baseball boots black tracksuit bottoms and a ucla sweatshirt her black hair tied in a pony tail nodded and breathed on the ewer before polishing it things they get absorbed in interests that sort of thing if you could take a sort of lifespectrum for everybody of all the things they believed in and took an interest in and became involved in all that sort of stuff then theyd look like stellar spectra a smooth band of colour from violet to red with black lines where the things that meant something to those people had been absorbed what an astronomical imagination you have diana i said getting enough oxygen up on mauna kea yeah i grinned just a pet theory prentice she finished polishing the ewer better than believing in she said and handed me the elaborately carved jug crystals well thats true in a very uncalifornian way isnt it i filled the inside of the ewer up with little polystyrene beads from another giant sack a broad smile on my face as i remembered she cried out and the crystal sang in reply later we exchanged signals help me fold these sheets will you the day after all the excitement at lochgair i sat at the dining table with what looked like a turban on my head it was a towel wrapped round one of those sealed liquid containers you freeze and put in cool boxes i signed the statement thank you sir davey stop calling me sir for gods sake i breathed constable david mcchrom had been in my class at school and i couldnt bring myself to call him officer his nickname had been plooky but that might have been carrying informality a little too far ach second nature these days prent he said folding the papers and standing up he looked depressingly fresh and wellscrubbed joining the police force seemed to have done wonders for his skin condition he lifted his cap from the table top turning to my mother right thats all for now mrs mchoan ill be getting back but if you think of anything else just tell one of the other officers well be in touch if we hear anything you all right now mrs mchoan fine thanks davey mum smiled dressed in jeans and a thick jumper she looked a little dark around the eyes but otherwise okay right you are then you look after that heid of yours okay prentice as though it were my own i breathed adjusting my towel mum saw him out the cid were still in the study looking for fingerprints theyd be lucky i looked out of the diningroom window to where a couple of policemen were searching the bushes near the kitchen door my we were being well looked after i doubted a roughly equivalent fracas in one of the poorer council estates would have attracted quite such diligent and comprehensive investigation but maybe that was just me being cynical my head hurt my feet hurt my fingers hurt all the extremities well save one thankfully most of the damage came from the central light fixture in the study ceiling it was part of that a large heavy brass part of it which had hit me on the head and it was the shattered glass of its shades which had cut my feet as id stumbled around the study my fingers hurt from the impact of computer keyboard and steel tyreiron the desk drawers had been levered open the back of the desks matching chair had taken the full force of a blow with the tyreiron the light fixture had been hit accidentally by the same implement and the ceiling rose damaged the compaqs keyboard was wrecked and the kitchen door needed a new lock i felt i could use a new head nothing had been stolen though id noticed that all the papers id been looking at earlier that night and which id left scattered round the couch had been neatly gathered together and piled on one end of the desk under a paperweight the envelope id left in the desks top right drawer that morning was still here the police didnt open it apart from the damage and that one contrary act of tidiness it looked like our attacker had taken nothing and left behind him only the petrol and the tyreiron i wanted to phone fergus ask him how he was good nights sleep any aches and pains but mum had been fussing over me after doctor fyfe had said id need watching for a day or two and i wasnt being allowed to do very much somehow i lacked the will anyway theyd asked me if i had any idea who it might have been and id said no i didnt say anything to my mother or anybody else either what could i say i was certain it had been fergus his build had been right and even though id been dazed i swear he did hesitate when i spoke his name but how was i supposed to convince anybody else i shook my head then grimaced because it hurt i couldnt believe id been so stupid not even thinking that he might try and steal or destroy whatever evidence he thought i had is this something youve read i whispered to myself remembering what fergus had asked me in your fathers papers after his death jeez i felt myself blush at my naïvety mum continued to fuss but i got better through the day after the cid boys finished in the study i photocopied all rorys papers though i had to drag a chair over to the photocopier and sit down to do it then before the police left and after much pleading got mum to drive into gallanach and deposit the parcelled originals in the bank she came back with a new lock for the kitchen door i hadnt been able to persuade her that a little holiday in glasgow maybe would be a good idea so while she was away i rang dean watt and asked if he and tank thomas fancied coming to stay at lochgair for a few days tank was a quiet and normally docile friend of the watts two metres tall and one across id once seen him carry a couple of railway sleepers one over each shoulder without even breaking sweat james whod earlier been appalled that hed only missed the first two periods of school while the police interviewed him arrived back at four glowing with glory apparently his part in the nights events which id thought consisted largely of sticking his head round his bedroom door and being told to get back in again and doing as he was told for once had gained something in the translation at school i suspected the gains involved the singlehanded beatingoff an attack by an entire gang of ninja assassins while mum and i slept i told mum about dean and tank but she wasnt having it and rang dean up to cancel the protection id arranged the police had promised to keep an eye on the house over the next few nights after all a patrol car would check up the drive this didnt sound like much good to me but mum seemed reassured old mr docherty a leatheryfaced octogenarian with wispy white hair who was one of our neighbours in the village arrived at teatime and offered to come over with his shotgun and sit up all night ahve nuthin tae steal maself mrs mchoan and ahd rather make sure you and the bairns were all right canny have this sort aw thing going on in lochgair ye know be glasgow people ah tell ye be glasgow boys mum thanked him but refused he seemed happy when we asked him to help us fit the new lock on the kitchen door lewis was all set to come up from london when we told him what had happened but mum persuaded him we were fine really fretting for something else to do i rang up mrs mcspadden at the castle and related all that had happened and twice told her how i suspected the raider had been after rorys papers which id copied and deposited in the bank in the bank prentice she repeated and i could hear her voice echoing good idea i asked after fergus and mrs mcspadden said he was fine he and his friends had been out fishing that day to my own amazement i slept soundly that night james said lights came up to the drive twice i had to go and see doctor fyfe that day and mum insisted on driving me into gallanach despite the fact i felt fine doctor fyfe gave me permission to go back to glasgow that evening providing i took the train and stayed with friends i stayed the extra night instead and left by car in the early hours taking rorys diaries and the copies of his papers with me i phoned mrs mcspadden from glasgow and told her that too and discovered that fergus had gone to edinburgh for a couple of days on impulse i told her id remembered something more from the attack and id be going to the police in a day or two once id checked on something back at university i attended lectures hobbling a little on my cut feet and i studied though i had headaches on the monday and the tuesday night i made sure mrs ippots house was securely locked each night and closed all the shutters i rang mum three or four times each day mum said fergus had sent a huge bouquet of flowers to the house when hed heard what had happened hed phoned from edinburgh and advised getting an alarm system fitted and knew a firm in glasgow whod do it cost price as a favour to him wasnt that sweet of him oh and i hadnt forgotten she and fergus would be coming to glasgow for the opera at the end of the week had i i said of course not i put the phone down numb my thoughts racing in a kind of aimless shortcircuit as i wondered what on earth i was going to do and naturally i followed the war like a good little mediaconsumer the clichés were starting to come out it was hardly possible to open a newspaper turn on a television or listen to a radio programme without having rammed down the relevant orifice some witless variation on the facile adage concerning truth being the first casualty of war a truism that is arguably a neat piece of propaganda itself implying as it does that the majority of the military politicians and media have any interest in respect for or experience with disseminating the truth even in times of profoundest peace i started inventing reasons for not putting mum and fergus up on the friday i would be ill i would have a bad cold i would discover that the tenancy agreement specified i couldnt have anybody else to stay overnight at the ippot house the electricity had been cut off due to a computer error a gas leak serious structural deficiencies caused by the weight of mirrors and chandeliers anything i stopped watching the war at tuesday lunchtime because if id carried on the way i had been the history we were living through was going to stop me getting my degree for the history that had been and gone ash rang on the tuesday evening i told her everything that had happened at the castle and lochgair she didnt seem to know what to make of it all she said maybe i ought to go to the police she sounded low and said things werent too good at work though she wouldnt be more specific meanwhile the sound of her voice was pulling me apart it filled me with elation at the same time as it plunged me into despair i wanted to shout look woman i think im falling in love with you i am i do i love you honest im sure well almost certain but you couldnt i couldnt it wasnt the sort of equivocal thing to shout at any time and even if i had been completely sure how i felt i probably couldnt have told her not just then i got the impression it wasnt the sort of thing she wanted to hear anyway she sounded like she just wanted to keep her head down for the moment keep things quiet uncomplicated just cool out recently bangedonthehead nutters raving down the phone at her suddenly declaring undying passionate love for no apparent reason was probably the last thing she needed i was sure about that well fairly certain so it was a desultory kind of phone call i felt pretty depressed myself at the end of it i didnt ask her about her lovelife i put the phone down feeling the same way i had a year earlier the day id been travelling from gallanach to glasgow after hogmanay and id pretended to be asleep when the train stopped at lochgair remembering that cowardice and that shame i almost picked the phone up again to call ash back and my hand reached out a couple of times and i debated with myself muttering my face contorting with silly expressions and i told myself i was acting like a madman and i really wanted to make that call and i really ought to but i was terrified to do it as well even though i knew that i should shouldnt i yes yes i should yes i definitely ought to it was obvious clear definite i should but in the end i didnt at least there was always work to be done id submerged myself in my studies with a feeling of almost orgasmic relief the very fact the past can be taken or left made me want to accept it the sheer demanding immediacy of the present made it repulsive and so everything returned to a sort of normality which didnt last of course on wednesday the rd of january shortly after noon fergus walter cruden urvill left gaineamh castle in his range rover and travelled north through the town of gallanach and the village of kilmartin passing carnasserie castle and the cairn and standing stone at kintraw crossed the thin flood plain of the barbreck river above loch craignish travelled inland again to rejoin the shore at the cutoff for the craobh haven marina development and then curved past the village of arduaine skirting loch melfort before passing through kilmelford and entering the forest that led to glen gallain and then down to the shore of loch feochan and the twisting road heading for oban the range rover passed through the town a little before one oclock and continued north to connel waited for the traffic lights to change at the old bridge over the falls of lora then crossed negotiated some roadworks and finally turned left off the road a little further on entering the thin strip of level coastal ground that was the connel airstrip fergus urvill parked the range rover in the airfield car park he talked to one michael kerr from the village of benderloch a couple of kilometres up the road from the field kerr was repairing the carpark fence mr urvill said he wanted to use the telephone in the portakabin that served as the airfield office michael kerr said that mr urvill seemed in a good mood and told him that he would be flying out to one of the outer herbrides the utter hebrides were his exact words where an old school friend lived he was going to surprise this friend and take him a bottle of whisky for a belated hogmanay he showed michael kerr the bottle of bowmore whisky he was taking with him in a small leather suitcase which also contained some clothes and toiletries the only thing kerr noticed that was out of the ordinary was that mr urvill grimaced a couple of times and flexed his shoulders oddly kerr asked the older man if he was all right and fergus said yes but it felt like a couple of ribs were acting up a little an old injury nothing to worry about mrs eliza mcspadden the housekeeper at the castle had confirmed that mr urvill had complained of chest pains the night before and had taken some paracetamol painkillers he had taken a box of the tablets with him that morning when he drove to connel he had said he would be away for a couple of days and apparently on impulse as he was about to get into the car asked mrs mcspadden to prepare some of her cullen skink soup for his lunch on the friday he wouldnt need more as he would be dining with mrs mary mchoan in glasgow that evening before the opera the colonial restaurant in glasgow later confirmed that they had a booking for two for the friday evening in mr urvills name when mr urvill came back out of the airfield office it was about onethirty michael kerr helped him check the cessna aircraft the plane taxied to the end of the runway faced into a wind and then took off into a fiveknot southwesterly breeze in good visibility under a fivethousandfoot cloudbase of light overcast the forecast said the breeze would freshen and veer to the south east that evening and the following few days would be bright and clear with a steady southerly wind of force three or four the cessna was spotted by the british army radar base on the island of st kilda flying into an area that was restricted for missile testing the light aircraft was flying at an altitude of two thousand feet on a bearing of which would take it towards iceland there was no radio response from the plane and an raf nimrod on patrol over the north atlantic was diverted to intercept the nimrod rendezvoused with the light aircraft at gmt it decreased speed and flew almost alongside a little above and ahead of the cessna for twentyfive minutes attempting to make radio and visual contact the nimrod crew reported that the single occupant of the plane seemed to be unconscious slumped back in his seat at gmt the cessnas engine started to cut out and the plane presumably out of fuel began to lose altitude the engine stopped altogether less than a minute later the plane pitched forward causing the pilots body to slump over the controls whereupon the aircraft went into a steep dive and started to spin it fell into the sea impacting at the nimrod circled dropping a life raft and reporting the position of the wreck to nearby shipping the plane sank twenty minutes later as the sun was setting there was little visible wreckage an east german trawler picked up the nimrods liferaft during the following morning the crew of the nimrod reported that at no time had the figure on board the light aircraft shown any sign of consciousness hello prentice speaking is its ashley i just heard about fergus ashley ah yeah i heard this afternoon i was going to call i dont have your work number well well what do you know any more than whats been on the news well mum went up to the castle to see if mrs mcspadden needed a hand and she said she seemed kind of shellshocked kept talking about soup soup soup cullen skink specifically oh yeah well apparently fergus seemed in good spirits but hed had some chest pains the night before anyway he drove up to connel to fly out to the hebrides to see some chum of his out there and next thing we know hes divebombing the atlantic and forgetting to pull up unconscious apparently hmm so what do you think well i dont know mum said she asked mrs mcspadden who he was going to see and she said she didnt know who it could have been the police had already asked her that apparently they said they would make enquiries right you think it was a heart attack i dont know umm what well apparently mrs mcspadden said fergus had a phone call the night before she took it initially then handed the phone to him yeah and whoever it was they were scottish but it was an international phone call a satellite call mrs mcspadden thought she recognised the voice but she wasnt sure hmm recognised the voice yeah did i mean did she know lachy yes yes she did they both worked behind the bar in the jac about twenty years ago maybe ahha ahha indeed i took a deep breath look ash ive been mean i heard a noise in the background shit thats the door what the breath sighed out of me ah nothing take care ash yeah you too bye i put the phone down put my head back looked up at the plaster stalagtites that formed the ceiling frieze in the study of the ippot house and howled like a dog the strathclyde police received a telephone tipoff at their headquarters in glasgow that a drug ring was using loch coille bharr just south of the argyllshire village of crinan as a hiding place for cocaine at on january the rd the tipoff was quite specific talking of weighted watertight plastic cylinders towed behind yachts coming from the continent and transferred to the loch to await pickup by dealers from glasgow the loch was cordoned off that day and police divers started searching the south end of the loch the following morning while policemen in small boats used grappling hooks to drag the rest no drugpacked cylinders were ever found but on the second day one of the boats snagged something heavy a diver went down to free the line from what was expected to be a waterlogged tree he surfaced to report that the line had hooked onto the rear wheel of a motorbike which had tied to it the remains of a body the bike and the body were brought to the surface that evening the corpse had decomposed and been eaten by fish to the point of being a skeleton held together more by the clothes it still wore than by the few pieces of connective tissue left the clothes suggested the deceased had been a male but the police werent sure of the skeletons sex until the body was examined in glasgow the following day what they did know was that the bike a suzuki gt registered in had been reported stolen by its owner in glasgow in after it had been loaned to a friend and never returned probably that alone would have led to the police coming to lochgair to see us but one of the local policemen with a long memory had already put two and two together when hed heard the make and model of the bike the corpse carried no identifying papers but dental records matched we knew then it was rory the skeleton had been found wearing a crashhelmet but it must have been put back on after rory had been murdered according to the pathologists report hed been killed by a series of blows to the back of the head with a smooth hard spherical or nearly spherical object approximately nine centimetres in diameter he was probably unconscious after the first blow and so after the coroner had released the remains following the inquest in late february uncle rorys bones came back to lochgair at last and were laid to rest at the back of the garden under the larches between the rhododendrons and the wild roses at the side of his brother the stonemason added rorys name and dates to the black granite obelisk and we held a small ceremony just for the immediate family and janice rae it fell to me to read out the words rory had apparently intended to close crow road with by way of a funeral oration the passage came from rorys nameless play and began and all your nonsenses and truths janice cried i remarked to lewis that the way things were going in our family it might work out cheaper in the long run if we bought our own hearse i do believe he was shocked or maybe he just wished hed said it technically the case remained open and rorys murderer was still being sought but beyond briefly interviewing mum janice and rorys old flatmate andy nichol the police took no further action i never did find out just how good at addingup that policeman was the firm ashley watt was working for in london went into receivership in the last week of january she was made redundant but remained in the city looking for another job the war ended in a famous victory only their young men died like cattle and there was even talk of the us making a modest profit on the operation veritys baby was born bang on time on march the nd in london in a warm birthing pool in a big hospital the boy was registered as kenneth walker mchoan he weighed three and a half kilos and looked like his father lewis verity and young kenneth travelled up to lochgair two weeks later the lawyer blawke read fergus urvills will in gaineamh castle on the th of march i had been asked to be present and travelled down by train the golf was in for a service with feelings of bitterness and dread helen and diana solemnly beautiful in black both looking tanned helen from switzerland diana from hawaii sat together in the tallceilinged solar and heard that they were to inherit the estate with the exception of various pieces of glass held in the castle which as the twins had already known were to be donated to the glass museum attached to the factory mrs mcspadden sitting hunched and crying with what was in retrospect a quite baffling quietness received the sum of twentyfive thousand pounds and the right either to live on in the castle or receive a similar amount if the property was sold or if she was asked to vacate her apartments by the twins or their heirs fergus had asked to be buried in the old castle garden but as they never did recover the body a monument was decided on instead a memorial service would he held in gallanach at a later date the range rover was part of the estate but the bentley eight had been willed to my father fergus had changed his will after dads death following promptings by the good lawyer blawke and so the car and its contents passed to me instead which came as something of a surprise there were various other bits and pieces bequests to charities and so on but that was the gist of it the lawyer blawke handed me the keys to the bentley after the reading while we were standing around awkwardly drinking small sherries dispensed by a quietly tearful mrs mcspadden and i was still in a slight daze thinking what why why did he give me the car i talked to the twins helen just wanted to get away but diana had decided to stay on for a while i agreed to come and help her pack stuff away in a few days time ferguss personal effects were going to be stored in the cellar and of course the glass had to be packed up to be taken to the museum the twins said they still hadnt decided what to do with the castle longterm and i got the impression it depended on what mrs mcspadden chose to do i said my goodbyes as soon as i decently could i had intended to take mums metro straight back to lochgair id told helen and diana that id probably come back that afternoon with mum to take the bentley away but for some reason when i got out of the castle doors i didnt go crunching over the gravel to the little hatchback but turned and went back into the solar and asked if i could take the bentley to lochgair instead and come back for the metro later diana told me the garage was open so i walked round to the rear of the castle where the garage and outhouses were the bentley sat inside the opened double garage burgundy bodywork gleaming like frozen wine i opened the car wondering why the will had mentioned the contents of the eight as well as the vehicle itself i got in and sat in that high armchair of a drivers seat smiling at the walnut and the chrome and breathing in the smell of connelly hide the car looked showroomclean unlived in nothing in the door pockets on the back seats or the rear shelf not even maps i hesitated before opening the glove box i was just paranoid enough to think maybe there was a bomb wired to that or the ignition but well that didnt seem very ferguslike despite it all so i opened the glove box it contained the cars manual id never seen one bound in leather before the registration documents and a cardboard presentation box i recognised as coming from the factory gift shop i took it out and opened it there was a paperweight inside which was what the box was meant to contain but the big lump of multicoloured glass was a little too large for the cardboard insert that went with the box when i looked at the base it was an old limited edition perthshire weight not a gallanach glass works product at all i left the paperweight lying on the seat and got out checked the cars boot carefully thinking of the end of charley varrick but that was in concourse condition too i went back to the drivers seat and sat there for a while holding the paperweight and gazing into its convexly complicated depths wondering why fergus had left this lump of glass not even from his own factory in the car then i weighed the glassy mass in my hand and clutched it as you might a weapon and took another evaluating look at it and realised it was spherical or nearly spherical and probably pretty well exactly nine centimetres in diameter i almost dropped it i shivered and put the paperweight back in the presentation case put that in the glovebox and after the car did not blow up when i turned the ignition drove its quietly ponderous bulk back to lochgair ferguss memorial service was held a week later at the church of scotland on shore street in gallanach midargyll kind of a traumatic location for the mchoans and i wouldnt have gone myself it would have felt too much like either hypocrisy or gloating but mum wanted to attend and i could hardly not offer to escort her we put some flowers on the mcdobbies grave where dad had died then went in to the church each kissing the sombrely beautiful twins i stood listening to the pious words the illsung hymns and the plodding reminiscences of the good lawyer blawke who must be becoming gallanachs most soughtafter afterdeath speaker and felt a furious anger build up in me it was all i could do to stand there moving my mouth when people sang and looking down at my feet when they prayed and not shout out some profanity some blasphemy or even worse the truth i actually gathered the breath in my lungs at one point hardly able to bear the pressure of fury inside me any longer i tensed my belly for the shout killer fucking murderer i felt dizzy i could almost hear the echoes of my scream reflecting back off the high walls and arched ceiling of the church but the singing went on undisturbed i relaxed after that and looked around at the trappings of religion and the gathered suits and worthies of gallanach and beyond and if i felt anything felt only sorrow for us all i looked up towards the tower all the gods are false i thought to myself and smiled without pleasure i talked to a redeyed mrs mcspadden after the service walking down through the gravestones towards the road and sea under a sky of scudding cloud the wind tasted of salt aye mrs mcspadden said in what was for her almost a whisper you never think its going to happen do you we all have our little aches and pains but when i think about it if id just said something when he mentioned a sore chest that night to go to the doctor everybody hurts mrs mcspadden i said and he had broken those ribs in the crash anybody would have assumed it was just those aye maybe i hesitated mum said hed had a phone call from abroad the night before hmm oh yes yes he did i thought i well yes you dont know who it was no she said slowly though i saw her frown its just that a friend of mine from university whos abroad at the moment had been going to call fergus to ask permission to visit the factory hes writing a dissertation on the history of glass making and i havent heard from him for a while i wondered if it might have been him thats all all lies of course but id tried to ring lachy watt in sydney and found that the phone had been disconnected ashleys mum didnt know where he was now and i did still want to know what had finally driven fergus to do what he had oh i dont know mrs mcspadden said shaking her large florid head a big black bead of glass glittered at the end of her hatpin a stray strand of white hair blew in the gusting wind you didnt hear anything that was said i prompted och just something about putting somebody up i was on my way out the door putting somebody up aye he said he hadnt put anybody up and that was all i heard i suppose he must have been talking about people whod stayed at the castle or hadnt stayed whatever yes i said nodding thoughtfully i suppose so i shrugged ah well perhaps it wasnt who i was thinking of after all or maybe it was maybe if mrs mcs had heard one more word before shed closed that door it would have been the word to come to think of it mrs mcspadden said id just been talking about you prentice when the phone went had you aye just mentioning to mr urvill what youd said about remembering more details of when your house was burgled really i nodded putting my gloved hands behind my back and smiling faintly at the grey and restless sea beyond the low church wall canada i said aghast ive got an uncle there he knows somebody working in a firm installing a system i know a bit about they swung the work permit my god when do you go next monday next monday ill be going up to gallanach tomorrow to say goodbye to mum flying driving leaving the car there dean can use it jesus how long are you going to canada for i dont know well see maybe ill like it you mean you might stay i dont know prentice im not making any plans beyond getting there and seeing what the jobs like and what the people are like sheeit well can i see you i mean id like to say goodbye well you going to gallanach this weekend umm would you believe that this weekend i was intending to drive a bentley to ullapool get a ferry to the island of lewis drive to the most northwesterly point on the island i could find and throw a paperweight into the sea but well dont let me stop you ive got plenty of family to see goodness knows but but im flying out from glasgow on the monday morning you can put me up in this palace youre living in if you like sunday yeah let me think cant get a ferry on a sunday but i can get to ullapool on friday travel over back saturday yeah sundays fine what time do you think youll get here six all right six is perfect my turn to take you for a curry no it isnt but i accept anyway i promise not to throw brandy all over you okay i promise not to act like an asshole you have to act gosh you know how to hurt a chap years of practice see you sunday prentice yeah then drive carefully you too bye i put the phone down looked up at the ceiling and didnt know whether to whoop with joy because i was going to see her or scream in despair because she was going to canada caught between these two extremes i experienced an odd calmness and settled for a low moan i was starting to think that maybe the bentley wasnt really me people gave me funny looks when i drove it and i had already been stopped by some traffic cops on great western road the day i drove the beast back from lochgair to glasgow is this your car sir theyd asked with hindsight perhaps saying gosh i thought you only did this to black people wasnt the most politic reply to have made but they only kept me waiting for an hour while they checked up on me and scrutinised the car i spent the time sitting in the back of the police car thinking of all the worthy causes i could give the proceeds of the bentleys sale to i certainly wasnt going to keep ferguss bloodmoney the african national congress and the league against cruel sports were two names that suggested themselves as fit to spin fergs remains up to near turbocharger speeds in his watery grave thankfully the bentleys tyres were nearly new and the lights like everything else were all in perfect working order so the boys in blue had to let me go anyway it felt right that it was the monstrous burgundycoloured eight i took to the hebrides rather than the golf i started out on friday morning and took the a to iverness then crossed to the west coast and ullapool the drive confirmed that the bentley would have to go it hadnt been as unwieldly as id imagined it might be but i just felt embarrassed in the thing there hadnt been anything in ferguss will to say i couldnt do what i wanted with the car so what the hell id sell it i caught the afternoon ferry to stornoway i stayed in the royal hotel that night read history books about ancient wars and longgone empires and dipped into our currently interesting times via the television i stationed the paperweight on the bedside table as though to guard me through the night at ten oclock the next morning i stood in a strong wind and light drizzle wrapped in my dads old coat near the lighthouse at the butt of lewis trying to think of a good joke about that to tell my brother and wishing id brought a brolly i hadnt been able to decide whether this really was the most northwesterly point of the island there was a place with the appropriate name of gallan head that might have done as well but in the end i thought maybe it didnt really matter that much and anyway this headland was easier to get to there were some cliffs not especially high i had the paperweight in my pocket and i took it out feeling suddenly selfconscious and foolish even though there was nobody else around the wind tugged at the coat and threw light soaking spray into my eyes the sea was tarnished rolling silver and seemed to go on forever into the light grey watery expanse of spray and air and cloud i hefted the glass ball then threw it with all my might out to sea i dont think it would have mattered especially to me if it had hit the rocks and shattered but it didnt it just disappeared into the greyness heading towards the piling restless waves i think i saw it splash but im not sure i had been thinking about saying something when i threw the paperweight into the sea you forgot something had been the line id been toying with on the drive up through the peatsmoke smell but it seemed trite in the end i didnt say anything instead i stood there for a while getting wet and cold and looking out at the waves and thinking of that wreckage lying out there on the floor of the atlantic a few hundred kilometres to the northwest far beneath the surface of that grey receiving sea was fergus urvill anywhere still apart from the body whatever was left of him physically down there in that dark cold pressure was there anything else was his personality intact somehow somewhere i found that i couldnt believe that it was neither was dads neither was rorys nor aunt fionas nor darren watts there was no such continuation it just didnt work that way and there should even be a sort of relief in the comprehension that it didnt we continue in our children and in our works and in the memories of others we continue in our dust and ash to want more was not just childish but cowardly and somehow constipatory too death was change it led to new chances new vacancies new niches and opportunities it was not all loss the belief that we somehow moved on to something else whether still recognisably ourselves or quite thoroughly changed might be a tribute to our evolutionary tenacity and our animal thirst for life but not to our wisdom that saw a value beyond itself in intelligence knowledge and wit as concepts wherever and by whoever expressed not just in its own personal manifestation of those qualities and so could contemplate its own annihilation with equanimity and suffer it with grace it was only a sort of sad selfishness that demanded the continuation of the individual spirit in the vanity and frivolity of a heaven the waves surged against the cliffs thudding into the rock and being reflecting the shapes of their energy charged back into that wild disturbed water obliterated and conserved at once it seemed to me then that it was this simple individual life has no momentum and just as dad had said the world is neither fair nor unfair those words are our inventions and apply only to the results of thought to die as darren had and as my father had and perhaps as rory had with what might have been great things still to do and much to give and to receive was to make our human grief the greater but could not form part of any argument they were here and then they werent and that was all there was my father had had the right of it when id been so upset at darren watts death it had been a sort of petulance i had felt towards the world an anger as well as a sadness that darren had died so soon and so uglily so sordidly a litter bin for fucks sake how dare the world not behave as i expected it to how dare it just rub out one of my friends it wasnt fair and of course indeed it was not fair but that was beside the point well the old man had been right and i had been wrong and i just hoped that hed known somehow that i would come to my senses eventually but if he had gone to his grave via the mcdobbies thinking that his middle son was a credulous fool and likely to stay that way well that hurt me hurt me more than i could say but there was no fixing that now it was over i turned and left and caught the ferry back to ullapool from stornoway that afternoon drinking cups of styrofoam coffee and eating greasy pies while i stood out on deck watching the beating waves wed seen dolphins following the ship once coming back this way past the summer isles after a holiday one day many years ago mum and dad and lewis and james and me but that was then i was back in glasgow six hours later i slept well and so we went back to the anarkali restaurant on that sunday night ashley watt and i and we had a meal that was almost identical to the one wed had before on the summer night when dad had died except we got along just fine this time and ashley didnt throw any brandy over me and i didnt act like a complete asshole and as i sat there talking about all the old times and about the future again i didnt know whether to laugh or cry because it was so good to see her but she was going away tomorrow flying off across that wide grey ocean id stood looking at just the day before flying away to canada and maybe going to stay there and i didnt know whether to ask about any men in her life or not even though i knew from dean that the guy shed gone off with at hogmanay had only been a onenight thing and i still didnt feel i could tell her how i felt about her because she was going to go away now and how could i suddenly say i love you when id never said it to anybody in my life before how could i say it now especially the night before she was due to leave it would look like i was trying to make her stay or just get her into bed it would probably wreck this one precious evening that we did have and upset her confuse her even hurt her and i didnt want to do any of that and through it all i knew there must have been a moment when i could have told her some time in the past some time over the last few months when it would have been the right time and the right place and it would have felt like the most natural thing in the world to say and do but somehow in the heat of things just during the complexity of events and thanks to my own stupidity my hesitation my indecision my negligence id missed it and that too was gone from me over so i just sat there across from her looking into her softskinned face all glowing in the candlelight that long thin nose rising straight above her small smiling red mouth as if together they made an exclamation mark and i felt lost in the grey sparkle of those eyes we walked out into the cool march night it was fair but it had been wet and the pavements shone ashley stood on the steps as i put on the old tweed coat that had been my dads she wore a black dress and the old naval jacket with the turnedover cuffs i remembered from grandma margots funeral she leant against some railings watching me button my coat up and with her left foot she clicked her toe and heel as if in accompaniment to some song i couldnt hear i looked down at her tapping black shoe as i adjusted my collar morse code she shook her head long fawn hair spilling over her dark shoulders we went arm in arm down the steps what was that film that had a dancer tapping out insults at somebody i said dunno ash said clickclicking her feet as we walked was it dead men dont wear plaid i scratched my head i wasnt wearing gloves and i could feel ashleys warmth through her jacket she smelled of samsara which was a departure for her i thought maybe she said and then she laughed what i was just remembering she said squeezing my waist mrs phimisters class remember the french teacher we were in the same class oh yeah i said we turned onto woodlands road you hated her because shed confiscated a radio or something and you used to tap out insults in morse code ash laughed loud god yeah i said thats right fuck off you old cow was the witticism i recall best ash said still snorting with laughter jeez i said pulling away from her a little to look into her eyes you mean you could decipher it yeah ash said with a sort of friendly scorn you rotter i laughed you absolute cadess you cadette i thought that was my secret i only told people later after id left school and then nobody believed me yeah ash said grinning at me i knew a couple of times i almost got detention because i was giggling so much nearly wet my knickers trying not to laugh got some very stern looks from mrs phimister she laughed again throwing her head back i didnt even know you knew morse code i said i learned it in the scouts where did you learn it my grandad taught me ash said nodding we used to sit and pass messages at meal times by clinking our cutlery off the plates mum and dad and the others always wondered what we found so hilarious about yet another helping of shepherds pie and chips and you never said i shook my head you rascal she shrugged looked down at her black mediumhigh heels as she did a little tapdance you didnt like me what was the point i didnt like any girls i told her in fact i wasnt that keen on any of the boys either come to think of it i felt mostly contempt even for my friends yeah ash said leaning over towards me so that her grinning face was almost on my chest but you didnt break their noses with a boulder disguised as a snowball did you i stopped in my tracks ash gave a little squeal as she staggered suddenly losing support on one side she steadied and turned she faced me looking puzzled from a metre or so away i just stood there openmouthed you knew that was me course i did she frowned and smiled at the same time another secret gone i exclaimed waving my arms ive felt guilty about that for years ash tipped her head to one side well not all the time i said i mean on and off she raised one eyebrow okay i said slumping a little mostly off but i did feel bad about it i really did i always felt bad about that ashley shook her head gently and came forward took my arm and led me along the street never mind she said i never told anybody and i forgave you really i said putting my arm round her again when at the time well after it stopped hurting anyway we turned the corner into woodlands gate i shook my head why didnt you ever say you knew it had been me i asked her she shrugged the subject never really arose before i shook my head again good grief i said all this time good grief ashley had been ravenous when shed arrived at the house in park terrace a little after seven that sunday evening so shed just dumped her bags and wed gone straight out to the restaurant when we got back after the meal i showed her round the place we opened a bottle of graves i had in the kitchen after first agreeing that of course we shouldnt and then walked from room to room while i did my guided tour bit and pointed out the more interesting or valuable works of art while we sipped our wine and the statues gleamed and the chandeliers glittered and the paintings glowed and the carpets spread before us like gigantic blowups of oddly symmetrical printed circuits ashley shook her head a lot when she saw the main bedroom she laughed we went back to the kitchen she demurred when i offered to top her glass up i should go to bed now she said pulling a hand through her hair she put her glass down on an oak working surface take some water in a big glass and get to me bed she said do you mind she looked at me i shrugged no of course not theres glasses in the bathroom beside your room a terrible sadness settled on me then and i had to swallow hard a couple of times i drank to hide it then said as matteroffactly as i could what time do you want up tomorrow about seven should do right i said looking at my glass right seven ill bring you tea and toast all right fine okay then i said i looked up and she was smiling she looked at her watch well she said and flexed her brows nightnight she came forward put one hand on my shoulder kissed my cheek i put my hand on her hip let my head nuzzle towards hers a little she put her arm round my waist and i turned to her hugged her my lips at her neck kissing delicately she pushed her head against mine and we started to turn to each other at the same moment as she put her arms round me the kiss just seemed natural after that it went on for some time ashley seemed to loosen and grow more tense at the same time her mouth appeared to want to swallow mine her hands grabbed my curls nails scratching at my scalp i pulled on her hair kissed and licked her neck she dug her nails into the small of my back through my shirt we kissed again and i kneaded her backside then pulled the dress up while she wriggled a little to make it easier and i found skin stockings her knickers and pushed my hands inside gripping her smooth warm bum she pulled herself up against me this she said breaking off breathing hard while her hands stroked the nape of my neck and her gaze flicked from my mouth to my eyes and back again this might be better suited to that ridiculous bedroom what do you think i nodded good idea bring the wine better yet it was something on that monumentally ostentatious bed of the late mrs ippots ashley and i made love like wed done it for years and then been apart for years and just met up and hadnt forgotten a thing a couple of times lying there panting afterwards while we trickled with sweat and licked at each other or were stroking and caressing and thinking about starting all over again she laughed the room i said first time no she said shaking her gorgeous head all tawny hair and flushed face its just you and me i never thought this was going to happen and later when she cried out i heard the crystal bowl on the table by the side of the bed ring pure and faint as if in reply it was later still when wed put the lights out and had agreed just to cuddle exhausted and drained but had not been able to merely cuddle and so had coupled once more and i still lay on top of her inside her while she breathed and i breathed and our hearts gradually slowed down again that i did what id done before in that situation flexing whatever muscle it is in the male genitals or the associated support systems that briefly fills the slowly detumescing penis with blood again sending a small pulse of socketed touch into ashleys body she gave a little exhalation halfway between a sigh and a laugh and then squeezed back with her vaginal muscles like a hand round me there was a pause and i thought i felt her go very still for a second and then she squeezed me again two quick grippings in succession there was a pause and i responded but she dug her fingers into the small of my back as though to stop me and so i relaxed she squeezed again four times the second pulse longer than the other three another pause during which i realised it was morse then another four pulses the second one short and the others long ily i had raised my head away from her shoulder while i concentrated on what she was doing in there now i lowered my face to her skin again i laughed very lightly and after a moment so did she and then i sent the same signal back with a single long pulse at the end ilyt and i swear the sending made the signal all the truer and that falling was followed by two more shared fallings as we fell apart and then asleep i woke and she was dressed standing by the bed a beatific smile across her face which was washed and glowing and framed by neatly combed hair i struggled to get up on one elbow ash she put one hand to the back of my head and kissed my lips i have to go she said what but you mean to canada prentice i promised i have to i felt my jaw drop i rolled onto my back for a second then sat bolt upright but last night i said spreading my arms wide ashley smiled even more broadly and climbed half onto the bed one blackstockinged knee on the crumpled sheets she kissed me was wonderful she said but i have to go you cant i slapped myself on the forehead with one palm this cant be happening its a dream stay i reached out to her held her face between my hands ashley please stay i cant prentice i said id go i promised im serious i said i dont she put one soft hand gently to my mouth shushing me then kissed me long and tenderly im going prentice she said but it doesnt have to be for ever well how long i wailed she shrugged stroked my shoulders with her hands you get this degree okay if you still want me then well promise i said in what was meant to be a terminally sarcastic manner but came out pathetically she smiled i promise oh my god i said looking at the clock by the crystal bowl i dont believe this maybe if i could just stall her theres a taxi waiting she told me its all right she smoothed some hair away from my eyes her touch like silk but i was going to drive you rest she said you probably had too much wine last night anyway the taxi really is waiting she slipped her hand under the covers held my penis as she kissed me then slipped away as i fell forward trying to embrace her hold her keep her ashley i said desperately she was at the door yes she said i didnt dream that signal last night did i she laughed nope meant every letter every word with all my heart one brow flicked amongst other organs she tipped her head to one side eyebrows raised and you the same i gulped she looked down at the floor then back at me still smiling good well we can take it from there okay ill write every day i told her dont be ridiculous she laughed with one shake of her head just pass those exams theyll be over by midjune i said more to keep her there in my sight for a few seconds longer that for any other reason then ill be back in midjune she said she pulled her black gloves from her jacket pockets and put them on bye prentice she blew me a kiss bye i gulped she closed the door i flopped back stunned staring at the glittering red chandelier i jumped out of bed as the front door banged closed i tore downstairs bollocknaked and waved to her from one of the drawing room windows which went from about human knee level to giraffes head level she saw me i could see her laughing she pushed the window down and waved and pointed to my groin and made a shocked expression as the cab started away the driver saw me too and looked amused and shook his head the cab drove off around the curbed terrace i opened the window and leaned out waving and ashley pushed the cabs window right down and stuck her head and arms out and blew me kisses through her wildly waving slipstreamed hair all the way until the cab rounded the corner and disappeared i sat down on the parquet staring at the white gauziness of the huge net curtains all my muscles complaining my head pounding my penis tingling my flesh goosepimpling against the cool wood of the floor i shook my head i collapsed back banging my already internally abused head on a persian rug the carpets pile was luxuriously deep however so it didnt hurt as much as it might i looked up at the ornately carved wooden ceiling not entirely sure what to think then i started to laugh lying there in the enormous room naked tummy wobbling laughing like an idiot and hoping the resemblance ended there oh well i said laughing to the ceiling heres hoping good youre getting sensible mum said she walked carefully towards me the big blue sheet folding and drooping between us she took the sheets other two corners from me getting i said indignantly mum smiled folded the sheet over twice more and put it on top of the tumble drier i pulled another sheet down off the old clothes pulley that hung under the ceiling of the utility room we took an end each stood apart pulled the sheet taut mmhmm she said tugging at the sheet again i think selling the bentley is very sensible she folded the sheet over hand to hand i did the same we pulled it taut again mum looked thoughtful maybe we should sell that ancient thing sitting in the garage out there as well the lagonda i said we folded the sheet over again yes mum said walking towards me again its just a waste of space at the moment you mean you werent thinking of going in for classic car restoration after youve finished the harpischord mum smiled as she took the sheet from me well actually that had occurred to me but she wrinkled her nose no i dont think so well we wont get much for it in the state its in at the moment i pulled another sheet down im not bothered about the money mum said she folded the sheet away shot me a mischievous look and besides whose fault is it the cars in the state it is anyway what i said i stood looking at her mum took the sheet from me and put two of its corners in my hands as she backed off pulling it tight she smiled it was you who tipped the big dresser down onto it in the garage that time wasnt it she pulled the sheet it flew out of my fingers billowing over the floor of the room like some slow motion wave i ran after it catching it i retrieved the corners untwisted the sheet and studied the amused expression on my mothers face she tugged the sheet again and i held onto it this time im ashamed to admit that it even occurred to me to deny it albeit briefly i grinned sheepishly as we folded the sheet over yeah guilty as charged but it was an accident i shook my head how did you work that out she walked towards me took the sheet from me found a bit of broken glass in your underpants when i was washing them she said and gave a tiny laugh as she turned away to place the sheet on the drier i looked up at the ceiling oh dear i said mum turned round standing there in her jeans and blouse glowing with what might well have been selfsatisfaction she reached up and pulled a last sheet down off the pulley handing one end to me yes well well draw a discreet veil over that little incident shall we i nodded pursed my lips might be best i agreed i coughed pulled the sheet taut with her and with a textbook expression of interested interrogation asked and how is the harpsichordconstruction project going anyway well it didnt end there either nobody had thought to tell me but obviously it was open season on prentices ignorance if you were female anyway well i said i think my absorption spectrum must be hazy no diana said i think its much like anybody elses she took a waldglas beaker out of the display cabinet and glanced at me she may have seen a hurt expression because she shrugged and smiled and said okay maybe yours has a few more black lines you were always interested in all sorts of stuff werent you i shrugged it runs in the family fact is diana said breathing on the knobby green glass its probably thanks to you i spend so much of my life fourteen thousand feet above hawaii looking for ir stars it is i said yeah diana said smiling at the glass as she polished it you remember the night there was helen me you lewis and verity and darren we were up in the observatory i remember i said you got really stoned and started gibbering about how fantastic the universe was i shook my head i dont remember that i confessed well you were pretty ripped diana said she handed me the beaker but you were coherent mostly and you were really enthusiastic i mean you even shut lewis up you just raved about how amazing astronomy was you meant cosmology but what the heck you were just bubbling with it she brought a second waldglas beaker out of the cabinet huh i filled the beaker with polystyrene beads found a box big enough to hold the two beakers and put the first one carefully into its bed of little white infinity symbols well ill take your word for it oh you were just so fascinated with it all especially with stellar evolution that had obviously really blown your mind we are made of bits of stars you shouted diana laughed a little youd been reading about all that stuff and it just tickled you pink you told us about how the sun and the solar system were made out of the remnants of older stars that had blown up how the elements that made up the world had been made in those ancient stars and that meant our bodies too every atom jeez i thought you were going to explode she handed me the second beaker hmm i said well i sort of remember that i think actually i wasnt sure i really did at all my recollection of that evening got very hazy after the bit where verity had pretended to tell me my fortune we are made from bits of stars we are made from bits of stars you kept yelling and went through it all super novae scattering heavy atoms the debris swirling through space other novae and supers sending shockwaves through the debris compressing it stars forming planets geology chemistry life diana shook her head she extracted a thin delicate oldlooking flute of a wine glass from the display case and jeez you made me feel ashamed i mean dad had built the observatory for us it was a present in a way and we hardly used it we went up there to smoke dope and here you were knew all about this stuff and actually made it sound interesting you were really gone on the idea that we were stuck down here on this one little planet and still just savages really but wed glimpsed the workings of the universe worked out from light and radiation what had happened over the last fifteen billion years and could talk sensibly about the first few seconds after the big bang even if the jury has gone back out on that idea nowadays and could predict what would happen to the universe over the next few billion and understand it diana held the wine glass up to the light and cleaned it with the cloth you were pretty scathing about religion too tawdry and pathetic in comparison you said she shrugged i didnt necessarily buy that but you made me ashamed not to have used the telescope more and so i did and then i got some books on astronomy and found out a lot of it was about maths which i was good at anyway though somehow the fact astronomy was about numbers and equations as well as stars and telescopes hadnt occurred to me but anyway that was the start of it i was hooked been a starjunkie ever since prent and its all your fault she flashed a shocked expression at me and handed me the glass i shook my head you as well eh hmm diana said nothing i breathed running a hand through my hair shit i never knew i looked mockly serious this is something of a responsibility diana i trust you havent had cause to regret your decision not at all prentice she closed the now empty cabinet and took off her white gloves i mean maybe id have settled on astronomy anyway without your oneman show whatever its been fun cold at nights and a long way from the beach and the airs a bit thin but its the skies that really take your breath away she nodded you should visit come see it all some time id like to i said people allowed to come and look round diana folded her arms and rested her back against the display cabinet it can be arranged theres somebody id like to take there diana smirked yeah somebody special whos that oh friend of mine in canada at the moment ashley huh i felt myself blush well yeah i said trying not to grin too much diana nodded still smiling itd be great to see you both out there you two sort of an item these days i shrugged felt myself blush again sort of i hope so i think so diana laughed which was good to hear i didnt think she had laughed since fergus died yeah i think so verity and lewis brought young kenneth to the castle that day so that mrs mcspadden could go all gooey over him she did diana seemed equally charmed kenneth just slept diana broke open a bottle of twentyfiveyearold macallen which was older than any of us well except mrs mcs but shed gone back to the kitchen by then and an awful lot older than kenneth lets wet his head diana said can we go up on the roof i said it just seemed like a good idea so we climbed up there into a bright march afternoon with a keen blue sky and a smell of woodsmoke on the westerly breeze we sat on the slates and drank our whiskies and took turns holding the baby who was still fast asleep you having him christened diana asked verity softly peering down at the infants tiny scrunchedup face she rocked him to and fro well i think mum and dad would rather he was but im not bothered one way or the other lewis isnt too keen are you my love lewis showed his teeth over my dead body actually he said see verity said to diana who was smiling broadly and holding the boy close sniffing him she just nodded verity glanced at lewis then said prentice yo wed like you to be his godfather would you be she actually looked as though she thought i might refuse lewis was grinning at me i cleared my throat well in terms of the actual title im sort of taking a long hard look at my previous statements about the existence or nonexistence of a supreme being at this moment in time reappraisalwise i said a suitably pained expression on my face as diana handed the baby to me lewis laughed anyway it was agreed and then we thought the little blighter ought to have at least a semblance of a christening so lewis dabbed his finger in his whisky and reached over and put a tiny drop of the spirit on his sons head and said there thats all hes going to get kenneth walker mchoan i said cradling him with one arm and raising my glass in the other hand we drank the lads health then diana threw her glass away over the battlements towards the woods lewis verity and i all looked at each other then followed suit and heard a couple of the tumblers smash somewhere in the trees beneath young kenneth opened his eyes at that point looked woozily up at me and let out a small plaintive cry i laughed and kissed his tiny nose then handed him back to his mother so she could feed him i stood up then and went to the battlements and held the ancient rough stones beneath my hands i looked out over the woods and the plain and the fields to gallanach with its quays and spires and serried streets and out to the crumpled hills beyond the brindle of forests to the east and the glitter of waves to the west where the ocean was i thought of ashley on the other side of that ocean and wondered what she was doing right now and hoped that she was well and happy and maybe thinking of me and then i just stood there grinning like a fool and took a deep deep breath of that sharp smokescented air and raised my arms to the open sky and said ha
