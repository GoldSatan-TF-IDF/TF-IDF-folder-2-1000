john lescroart the suspect book in the dismas hardy series back to basics this book is to lisa marie sawyer truth is the cry of all but the game of few george berkeley on a clear still and silent sunday at the end of the second week in september a fiftyyearold outdoor writer named stuart gorman sat on a flattopped rock at the edge of a crystalline lake set in a bowl of granite near the california desolation wilderness area a few miles southwest of lake tahoe the lakes mirrored surface unsullied by even the trace of a breeze perfectly reflected the opposite shorelinemore granite studded with pine and a purple sky above stuart could barely be seen to breathe in the warm afternoon hed removed his tshirt and placed it beside him now he wore only his hiking boots and a pair of brown shorts though he had a good head of mediumlength dark brown hair the gray in his twoday stubble and on his chest betrayed the bare fact of his age without the gray the developed torso perhaps dangerously tan could have been that of a man half stuarts years his solid barrel chest spoke of hours spent outdoors in vigorous exercise there was a hollow of tight skin under his rib cage where most men his chronological age carried their fat there was age though in the face lines scored the skin around the deeply set blue eyes and at the corners of his mouth the stubble wasnt long enough to camouflage the strong jaw nor the nearly surgical cleft in his chin neither did the lines mar the clear expanse of his forehead the only obvious flaw in his face although some might not call it that was a silverdollarsize port wine stain high on his right cheek stuart held a fly rod across his lap he wasnt fishing yet the evening hatch wasnt due for at least another half hour until the sun ducked out of sight behind the foothills to the west then a few feeding trout would ripple tamarack lakes smooth and calm surface and on a typical evening stuart would find his spot play out line place his dry fly in the center of one of the few ripples and hope for a strike the trail ran along tamaracks shore and so there was a great deal of pressure on the lakes fishery the few trout that remained tended to be larger and wily and stuart relished the challenge normally in the last moments before the beginning of the true gathering of dusk while he waited for the first mosquitoes to hit the water he felt closest to peace in moments such as this one and in the poetry solitude and even athleticism of the flyfishing that would follow hed come to define who he was what he was made of the sun kissed the top of mt ralston and stuart caught a glimpse of the first rippleactually a rare splashas a fish broke through the surface of the water somewhere across the lake normally this would have been his signal to stir himself but this evening he remained where he sat unmoving and very far from in a state of peace two days before hed driven up from his beautiful home on san franciscos russian hill to his familys rustic cabin at upper echo lake his mood dark enough as hed left the city faded to deep black when he got pulled over for speeding a few miles east of sacramento at that moment his rage with the world in general and at his wife in particular had boiled over and had so nearly overtaken him that hed lost his temper at the highway patrol officer who was writing him up even if he was barely exceeding the speed limit every other car on the road was passing him so stuart wanted to know why was he the one getting a goddamn ticket in response the officer then had him get out of his car and take a field sobriety test followed by a warning that he was this close to getting himself arrested in the middle of this stuart lucked out when the officer suddenly recognized his namethe man was a fisherman whod read two of stuarts books and loved them apologizing and somewhat mollified stuart explained that he was still reacting to a terrible fight that hed had with his wife that he was coming up to his mountain retreat to get his head straight the cop still gave him a speeding ticket but then hed gotten his autograph and let him go but now hed been up here for two days and his head didnt feel any straighter in fact if anything he had grown more angry frustrated and depressed at the realization that his twentytwoyearold marriage to his charismatic brilliant difficult headstrong and stillpretty orthopedic surgeon wife caryn seemed to be over in almost every imaginable way they had grown apart her thriving practice her investments and the new medical office she was starting with her business partners had taken almost every spare minute of her life for the past couple of years now with a purple dusk gathering around him stuart looked out over the water and saw a few more promising signs of trout feeding but he couldnt even bring himself to move from where he sat to throw his line his mind refused to leave the familiar rut it had been plumbing since hed come up here how could his life with caryn have come to this theyd met when hed been a guide on a snake river rafting trip her parents had given her for a graduation present he had been twentyeight to her twentytwo and they were soul mates from the minute theyd laid eyes on each other she was going to med school at stanford in the fall but nothing was going to stand in the way of their being together stuart moved from wyoming out to california and they were married in the second week of november in those early days their lives complemented one another caryn studied round the clock stuart submitted his writings everywhere he could think of and augmented his meager writers income by working as a word processor in the law offices of jedd conley one of his friends from college at home stuart kept the apartment clean made their dinners did the dishes quizzed caryn on her classes she read and helped him edit his articles and early manuscripts and took every chance to get into the wilderness with himthe bay area was good for that they jogged together three or four times a week talking the whole while they liked the same music the same books they laughed at the same jokes busy lives notwithstanding they found time to make love often they would often brag to each other that in the history of the world nobody had ever been as happy as they were if that had been true then stuart thought now there were few if any couples as miserable on friday the fight had erupted when caryn came home for lunch after her hipreplacement patient had caught a cold and canceled on her at the last minute so her entire afternoon loomed open and free and when she got home she was in a foul humor stuart whod been planning to drive up to echo lake anyway and get some writing done suggested that she take advantage of the unexpected opportunity and accompany him she had no interest no she didnt have other plans but why would she want to come up to his cabin for an entire weekend what did he think they would do that she would remotely enjoy another hike shed done her share of stuarts hikes eight or ten or fifteen miles up and down steep and difficult terrain two or three or even six thousand vertical feet in one day wow what a good time that was and all to accomplish what to get some outdoor exercise or a variation of a nice view that theyd both already seen a thousand times shed pass thanks shed outgrown all of that he had offered to stay down in the city then maybe they could go out to dinner or even eat at home get some overdue and richly deserved quality time together maybe reconnect you mean sex shed asked that wouldnt be the worst idea in the world but i wasnt just thinking of sex no surprise there what does that mean the thing heating up between them you havent thought of sex at all in a couple of months stuart ive thought of it all right caryn its just never been at a good time for you oh so its all my fault after which it had gotten ugly fast caryn finally admitting that she was sick of the sham marriage between them kymberly their incredibly highmaintenance daughter whose birth had forever altered the dynamic of their life together was gone off to college now there was no reason to stay together she wanted a divorce stuart had slammed out of the house yesterday hed walked for miles in the grip of an incoherent rage that seemed to grow with each passing minute last night he drank off most of a quart bottle of vodka that had lain untouched in the cabins freezer for five years this morning he found that hed trashed his cabin thrown dishes around broken two chairs and smashed the framed family photos he woke up still mostly drunk and with little memory of what hed done but today monstrously hungover feeling ashamed and sorry for himself hed hiked for a grueling sixhour loop before taking a long afternoon nap and then walking up here to tamarack hoping the evening peace would soothe him he wasnt really interested in tracing all the roots of his anger though the strength and depth of it left him in a kind of shock and exhausted god knows there had been reasons enough the last few years caryn had all but abandoned him emotionally and physically but hed stayed on because he believed you should fight to save your marriage even when it looked impossible hed stayed on too in order to carry the vast amount of the load of raising kymberly because his wife didnt have the time hed stayed on in all of his own good faith trying to get to compatibility with caryn from which he hoped they might again approach affection until fridayjust two days agohed repeatedly told her that he loved her he loved her he loved her in these admissions he realized that he was probably culpable of dishonesty but he thought it might help might bring her back and if he said it enough and she came around it might even become true now after all that sacrifice and despair all the hope and commitment all the pain and constant work she wanted to end it anyway he had been such a fool and he hated himself for that almost as much as he hated her tamarack lake had grown dark and still again the hatch and the bite were over and the only sound off the lake was a whisper where the water met the shoreline stuart forced his stiff body to its feet he could get back to his cabin by the moonlight to his car and back to the city by midnight have it out with her one last time on his schedule for a change and not hers it would be great to wake her up which would make her miss a day of her precious work it would do her good to see him in the full flower of his outrage at how shed used and abused him his naive belief his basic good nature he broke into a jog in a hurry now to get on the road and finally give her the real piece of his mind hed been holding in for too long while trying to be fair to be patient to give her and their marriage yet one more chance to be a good guy what an idiot he was what a loser what a goddamn pansy well all that was over he thought now and forever if she was done with him he was done with her too and good riddance as he ran his footsteps crunched on the granite riding the wave of his anger he wasnt consciously aware that he was saying anything but to the rhythm of every footfall he fell into the mantra and let it escape into the night on every exhale fuck her fuck her fuck her the fish that stuart heard breaking water at the first sign of the hatch was very large for a sierra nevada alpine lakea fourteeninch rainbow trout it rose to the sight of a mosquito larva shimmering off the surface of the lake slurped at the insect in the gentle way of all trout then exploded in sudden fury out of the water as it felt the set of the tiny barbless hook gina roake a fortysevenyearold attorney fought the fish on very light x line for about five minutesa really nice fight with at least four good runsbefore she netted it she stood in her mossgreen hiking shorts on a shallow submerged ledge that reached out about fifteen feet into the lake when she saw the size of the fish she whistled in satisfaction then turned and dipping the trout and her net into the water walked back to the shore there grabbing the fish through the netting with a humane efficiency she slapped its head hard once into the side of a large granite boulder besides her shorts she wore a longsleeved buttoned shirt of some spaceage fabric that wicked out perspiration and then dried almost immediately the clothes were functional in the extreme over her bare feet her legs were wellmuscled and tan her ankles slim she had stopped dyeing her hair a couple of years before and now the wisps that showed from beneath the red handkerchief around her head were a shining silvery gray laying the nowstill fish in a small concavity at the top of the boulder her movements bespoke a temperament of brisk competence removing a sixinch buck knife from its sheath on her belt she picked up the fish by its gills and turned back to the water where she paused for a moment to appreciate the setting in the dying sun she saw another person small in the distance sitting on a rock across the water returning to the task at hand she inserted the tip of the bucks blade into the trout and slit up its belly to the gills pulling out its guts she threw them out beyond the reach of the ledge where they sank into the lakes depth and disappeared from view after shed scraped the dark line of gunk along the backbone she pulled off and threw away the gills then dipped the trout in the water and rinsed it clean shed pitched her tent on a level spot back a ways into the trees campfires werent allowed here but previous campers had left a clearing surrounded by large rocks for seating as the far eastern end of the lake grew into shadow she touched a flame to her small gas stove for longer backpacking trips gina tried to keep her pack to under thirtyfive pounds besides her portable stove shed carry a girl scoutstyle mess kit and a bear canister filled mostly with dehydrated fruits and readytocook meals but shed planned this trip to be day hikes out of this base camp shed come up on friday and would go home tomorrow morning beyond that the camp was only a couple of relatively level miles from the echo lakes trailhead she didnt need to worry about her packs weight for this type of trip and shed loaded up her canister with gorpgood ol raisins and peanuts and added m msfor quick energy then for her lunches a couple of small loaves of san francisco sourdough a block of cheddar cheese a chub of italian dry salami heaven for dinner tonight she had even thought to carry a halfbottle of decent white wine using the mess kits covered pot shed boil her fresh green beans in a little lake water finishing them with fresh minced garlic pepper and salt and olive oil the trout was far too big for the mess kit frying pan too long in fact for the teninch calphalon from her own kitchen so though the concept offended her she was forced to cut the trout in half a squeeze of olive oil from its little plastic container salt and pepper mixed italian herbs a few drops of tabasco sauce beat that farallon she thought as she laid the halves of trout into the oil and spices eat your heart out boulevardfarallon and boulevard being two of san franciscos finest restaurants when she finished eating she took some boiling water and the dishes shed used down to the lake to wash them back at the camp she settled against her rock and sipped at the last of her wine from her sierra cup the moon was up and so was venus in a winedark sky the diamond in the ring on her left hand caught a glint from the bright moon and for a second she looked at the thing as though its presence there surprised her there was no rational explanation for this reactionshed worn the ring now for almost three years but in truth she didnt often think of it because it was too painful now she stared at it for a long moment putting her wine down she reached over twisted it off her finger and held it up in front of her the facets in the diamond caught more moonlight as she turned it around and around as though she were trying to find some secret magic within it but she knew there was no secret there was no more magic in her life anymore not as there had been when david freeman had stunned her by proposing marriage and then placed the ring on her finger freeman much older than she was and a legend in the law world of san francisco was a slovenly dressed bigliving profane cigarsmoking genius in an ancient gnomes body whom much to ginas initial surprise shed come to love she often felt that hed literally cast some spell on her she would look at his illfitting brown suits his scuffed shoes the rheumy eyes under unruly and wiry eyebrows the rosaceascarred nosefreeman didnt appear to be joking when he said that he liked to think of himself as mythically uglyand during the six months she had lived with him she couldnt think of a more attractive man of any age objectively he was a frog but she could see only the prince it had to be sorcery but whatever it was it had worked and she had fallen under his spell satisfied and happily in love at fortyfour for the first time in her life and freeman for his part a seventysomething lifelong bachelor and notorious womanizer apparently felt the same way about her when hed proposed nervous as a schoolboy this man who could be eloquent in front of the supreme court could barely get the words out they were already living together most of the time in davids apartment although gina had kept her own place as well and they decided to have a small nofrills civil ceremony within the week but then david who considered himself bulletproof had decided to walk home from work one night that week after hed finished at the office at the time hed been embroiled in some highly contentious litigation with a local mobster and the gang leaders men had set upon the old barrister and beaten him into a coma from which he never recovered when he died three days later gina felt a part of herself die with him but unbeknownst to her in those last months of his life david had changed his will and gina found herself the owner of the freeman building downtown on sutter street the large gracious recently renovated threestory structure complete with underground parking housed the fortyodd employees of davids firm freeman associates as well as one rogue of counsel tenant named dismas hardy in the months following davids death gina dismas and another colleague named wes farrell had reconsolidated the firm as freeman farrell hardy roake and it had become somewhat of a power player in the city but although gina had been a practicing defense attorney for her entire career and was a name partner in ffh r as time passed she took on less and less of the firms law work her heart had gone out of it she preferred to spend her time with physical exercise with hikes and solitude with the slowly accumulating pages of a novela legal thrillerthat she was struggling without much passion to finish oh david she whispered sighing a tear hung in the corner of her eye help me out here would you and suddenly as she stared through the prisms of her engagement ring she felt her shoulders relax as though relieved of a great load she felt davids hovering ghost as an actual physical presence and realized that he was letting her go telling her that she had mourned him enough he was gone never coming back and it was time to move on the writing the constant exercise the long lonely hikes even the beautiful moments such as this oneshe all at once came to see what david would have had to say about all of them thats not you roake thats avoidance thats not what you do you always attack life you engage somethings beating you up you take it on and wrestle that motherfucker to the ground why are you still wearing that ring anyway so guys wont hit on you you want to get old and live alone i dont think so youve got good years to live so dont wimp out now by not living them she was young she told herself or at least not yet old perhaps she was even desirable she brought the ring up to her lips and pressed it against them then she put it on her third finger but of her right hand this time and stood up walking to her tent in the moonlight she let herself in crawled into her sleeping bag and almost immediately was asleep in his cityissue taurus inspector sergeant devin juhle pulled up and parked where the front walk of a house on greenwich street on san franciscos russian hill met the sidewalk he was responding to a dispatch hed received just as he was leaving his home on noriega in the past eighteen months juhles previous two partners had been killed now in a compelling demonstration of the superstitious nature of his colleagues in homicide he worked solo two blackandwhite squad cars were already at the scene at the curb across the street a fire department vehicle sat in the driveway a knot of bystandersthree women one man four kidshad gathered at the corner a hundred feet away they all stared at the house as a unit curious and intent waiting for some official person to come over and tell them what had happened thus far no media had arrived but juhle knew that this aberration in the natural order of things would soon correct itself juhle waited behind the wheel and let his mind switch to what he called his detail gear from here on out he wanted to register everything he saw heard thought or felt hed trained himself to pay attention from his first moments at any crime scene now satisfied that he had taken in all he needed from the street he looked at the house a pair of uniformed patrol officers stood at its open door the occupants of the second squad car juhle presumed were inside he checked his watch it was just shy of on monday september juhle exited his car and took one last look around the morning was glorious the sky blue and cloudless the sun casting its long shadows down the street in front of him he turned and walked toward the house stuart gormans hollow eyes stared into the distance over devin juhles shoulder im sorry what you said you got home just before six i asked you where you had been gorman brought his eyes back weve got a place at echo lake up by south tahoe i was there for the weekend so you must have left there early a little before two i couldnt sleep so i figured i might as well come on home and you were up there alone yeah gorman raised his chin thick with stubble his face was drawn the skin with a pronounced pallor even under the sunburn the whites of his eyes were shot with capillaries im a writer i went up there to do some work they sat across from each other at a round wooden table in a kitchen that was considerably more wellequipped than juhles own a bank of windows in the eastern wall admitted a bright line of sunlight up where it met the ceiling and reflected off the surfaces of the bright copper pans that hung from the opposite wall juhle had faced gorman so that he wouldnt have to watch the crimescene techs and assistants to the medical examiner as they passed through the living room and out to the back porch where caryn drydens naked body still lay on the wooden slats of the deck next to the hot tub they were just getting started juhle had his small tape recorder concealed and running in his pocket to any homicide cop the death of a spouse always entails initial suspicion of the surviving partner when husbands got killed you looked first to the wife and vice versa and even though the death of caryn dryden might from what he now knew be ruled a suicide the possibility of murder lurked somewhere in the back of juhles mind but the last thing juhle wanted was to raise a flag with the husband at this point he kept his questions innocuous did you get any writing done no gorman ran a workingmans hand down a ravaged cheek i might as well tell you the last time i saw caryn was here at the house on friday afternoon she told me she wanted a divorce thats all i could think about while i was up there howd you feel about that getting a divorce gormans gaze went off again then came back you married inspector i am you love your wife juhle nodded most of the time me too except when i hated her that happen a lot most of this weekend to be honest with you so you didnt want to divorce her gorman said the wordwe called it the dwordit wasnt something i allowed myself to entertain i figured once youre saying it out loud to yourself it starts having its own reality caryn and i were together and committed and that was that i thought for better or worse so i never wanted to give myself that option juhle nodded okay but she wanted out and got herself out didnt she juhle leaned back in his chair you think she killed herself thats what it looks like to me by drowning thats a reasonably difficult trick to pull off by yourself if gormans shrug struck juhle as chillingly nonchalant his actual words were perhaps colder she was a doctor you check i wouldnt be surprised if it wasnt a drowning after all she kept a stash of vicodin upstairs take some pills have a few drinks go sit in the hot tub turned up to oneohfive adios absorbing this intelligence juhle felt all of his senses sharpen stuart gorman had just supplied him with chapter and verse on a perfectly plausible scenario for caryns deathone that if adopted by the medical examiner and the police would remove him the husband from any suspicion if hed been involved in his wifes death this was a slick highstakes gamblesmart and dangerous can we go back juhle said to how you found her gorman indicated the room behind him i already told those guys whats it matter because now ive got you on tape juhle thought to himself and in fact it probably wouldnt really matter but juhles aim was to keep him talking just making sure we get the record straight youve said you got here a little after six and parked in your garage under the house all right he sighed i expected her to be up by then she usually is on monday but the house was quiet so i figured she was sleeping in and i thought id let her maybe shed had the kind of weekend id just had so i make a pot of coffee and go out to get the paper i finish them both and its still quiet i dont hear the shower yet so i go upstairs and shes not in bed its still made so i figure maybe she took off someplace for the weekend herself where would she have gone i dont know her sisters maybe or up to visit the first real sign of distress gorman brought a hand to his forehead oh christ kym our daughter shes up at college in portland she just started a couple of weeks ago oh jesus this is going to destroy her ive got to call her juhle didnt want to stop in the middle of his interview he said are you sure you dont want to let us do that for you i can call the portland police and have somebody with her juhle watched gorman pull himself heavily to his feet and cross to the phone on the kitchen counter no there he paused again his hands flat on the counter all of his weight on them his head flopped forward and juhle heard the deep exhale of a sigh oh jesus he said again he picked up the receiver brought it to his ear then placed it back down on the counter ive got to do this myself juhle left him like that working up the strength to make the call leaving the kitchen the inspector looked left through the large highceilinged living room beyond the cop stationed at the front door he could see that sure enough a couple of minicams and their news crews had arrived he wasnt about to talk to them not at this stage anyway instead he turned to his right and walked through a leathercouch kind of booklined den and out onto the enclosed deck the body lay covered now with a sheet that still clung in wet places a police photographer was snapping pictures of the hot tub and deck behind him some me assistants were wheeling a collapsible gurney through the house two other officers in uniform were down the steps in the backyard conversing on the tiny fenced lawn in shirtsleeves lennard faro lean and dark with a welltrimmed black goatee was a lab specialist with the crime scene investigation unit seeing juhle at the back door he closed his cell phone and walked over he break yet the husband faro asked he wasnt here he was up in the mountains youre saying this is a homicide a shrug faro wasnt going to commit until the medical examiner had drawn his conclusions and he himself had spent some time in the lab still he said shes got an impressive and id guess recent bump over her right ear enough to kill her we wont know until the autopsy but id say its not impossible how long has she been dead faro frowned the hot tubs going to screw that calculation up for a while nobodys going to know until we get cutting on her body temps way up but thats what youd expect when the waters still at oneohfive the number struck a chord exactly oneohfive pretty close the thermometers still why that a magic number no its nothing juhle didnt want to start a rumor hed get what he could then see where it led him any sign of what caused the bump maybe we found some broken glass plus one big piece up against the bottom of the tub some still have a whiff of wine on em another empty glass was in the sink the rest of the broken glass and an empty bottle was in the compactor in the kitchen so she was drinking maybe blood alcohol will tell the husband said shes got vicodin upstairs in their bedroom he thinks its a suicide faro pulled at his goatee she hit herself on the head maybe she fell first slipped on the wet wood faro was still scratching at his beard without comment as the two uniforms came up the four steps and onto the deck the older onethirty pounds on the wrong side of healthy with jowls and a walrus mustacheintroduced himself as captain allen marsten from central station on vallejo the other man was jerry jarrett marsten told juhle that they had been the first ones to arrive after the call he was just getting off his graveyard shift when the call had come in did juhle need anything else from him if not since now the scene was secure he wouldnt mind going home and getting some shuteye and he didnt think sergeant jarrett would mind it either anything either of you feel like i ought to know juhle asked marsten looked at his partner got a shrug then worked his lips for a moment under his hanging mustache nothing jumps out at me hethe husbandleft the front door open for us and we made it here in id say two three minutes after the call came in we come inside and hes got her out of the tub and on the deck where shes lying now still trying to do cpr on her although you could see a mile away it was too late for that so he must have thought shed only recently gone under i dont know about that we took a pulse and called him off and whatd he do he just stopped no fight in him breathing hard you know then he stood up and tried to cover her up with that towel over there what do you mean tried well it was too small for all of her and you can see shes a little bent up he started low then moved it up then over her face then back down it was kind of pathetic tell the truth then finally jerry here walked him off and sat him down inside sitting on the counter still on the telephone stuart gorman was crying silently making no attempt to stem the flow of tears his shoulders were hunched one arm tucked under the other one he barely whispered saying i know and yeah baby i dont know and juhle could watch no more instead he went back outside to the deck and stood in silence as they bagged the body and began to lift it and load it onto the gurney juhle didnt want to watch that either reflecting that there werent that many fun things to do at homicide scenes he went back to the kitchen he pulled around a chair and sat on it the phone conversation continued a few more minutes before gorman said do you need me to come up there youre not where are you youve only been up there two weeks and okay okay youre right it doesnt matter call me when you get close and ill come get you he clicked the phone off and as though it were a high explosive placed it next to him on the counter he closed his eyes and for a long moment didnt move finally juhle spoke she going to be all right gorman tried and largely failed to arrange his face into a controlled expression i dont know he said i dont have any idea he exhaled heavily i dont believe this this cant be happening juhle resisted his urge to leave the man to his miseries if he had in fact killed his wifeand his obvious pain and possible remorse now did not in the slightest degree rule out that possibilitythen this was the time to exploit his vulnerability juhle needed to get him talking again so he asked what school does she go to reed my alma mater although it turns out shes down in santa cruz now dont ask me why but shes enrolled at reed he paused shes smart and weird like her dad and the place worked pretty well for me how were you weird a dry chuckle caught in gormans throat how was i not weird i just never fit in as a kid i was big gangly ugly he pointed to the birthmark on his face this thing i liked solitude i wanted to write that by itself is weird enough when i think about it that was probably half the problem with me and caryn she wanted someone normal and i wasnt him normal in what way motivated by money for example guys my age were supposed to be driven by money its how we gauge our success in the world right he shrugged i dont really think too much about money and never have and this bothered your wife gorman smiled but there wasnt any humor in it are you kidding me what greater failing can a man have than not to be the primary wage earner in his family you werent that another shrug i make more than decent enough money i think eighty or a hundred grand a year give or take im a writer so theres good years and bad years but eighty grand to me is a fortune its not like i dont publish like im not putting out good work it just doesnt pay enough to suit caryn she wanted you to make more he shook his head impatiently it wasnt so much that with her income we certainly didnt need any more money she made enough for most thirdworld countries juhle cast a quick glance aroundthe eightburner stove the subzero refrigerators the shining copper pots and pans all the gadgets on display on the counters the other creature comforts hed noticed everywhere to say nothing of the size and location of the house itselfprobably four to six million dollars in real estate and furnishings alone so she felt she was carrying you financially was that it did she resent that gorman paused i dont know what she felt anymore inspector i didnt think she was anywhere near asking me for a divorce until friday but then she did i mean after kym left for school we both knew thered be adjustments but here its only been a couple of weeks and thats it its all over like we never had anything together like everything wed ever done was just a fucking stupid charade he stopped abruptly then started again more calmly she was just waiting for kym to go after that there wasnt any reason for us to stay together no discussion more like an announcement my life with you is over do whatever you want youre nothing to me that bother you no i fucking loved it what do you think did it bother me give me a break inspector taking that as a yes then gormans eyes narrowed he visibly reined himself in you dont know how hard i tried to keep it together and she wasnt easy let me tell you she was never easy the last few years you know what thats been like and then hearing that youre a nonentity that her world is just so much more important than yours more financially rewarding more everything hows that make me feel like a piece of shit like a worthless piece of shit something was going on behind juhle in the living room and suddenly gorman straightened all the way up hey wait a minute what are you doing boosting himself up from the counter he was across the kitchen before juhle could even stand in the middle of the living room the medical examiners assistants with the gurney and its body bag had stopped at the interruption what are you doing gorman demanded again juhle stepped in front of him theyre taking the body downtown sir the medical examiner is going to need to do an autopsy then you mean hes going to cut her up to determine the exact cause of death yes but gorman turned from juhle to the men pushing the gurney then back to the inspector a lowwattage panic now evident in his eyes why do you have to do that i told you she had pills upstairs if shed been drinking and then got in the hot tub thats one way it might have happened juhle said yes well what else she might have slipped getting into the tub theres a goodsized bump on her head this news seemed to confuse gorman but he shook his reaction off that doesnt matter what matters is shes dead if she killed herself or it was an accident what difference does it make he brought a hand back to his face rubbed at the birthmark jesus christ this is unbelievable shes just now dead its only been a few hours dont you understand that you dont have to cut her up it wont make any difference juhle wondered if gorman could in fact be so clueless or if this was some kind of an act every schoolchild knew that homicide victims got autopsied juhle had been playing his role as understanding cop comforting a victims relative up until now but this was the time to bring some reality into the discussion mr gorman he said surely you realize it makes a difference if somebody killed her gorman opened his mouth and started to say something then decided not to his shoulders sagged he shook his head from side to side god help us he said after getting up at dawn and hiking out from tamarack lake gina roake drove to her pleasant street condominium on nob hill in under four hours by noon she had unpacked and stowed her gear showered and changed into her work clothesa light mauve business suit and black low heels as she came out the doors onto the sidewalk in front of her building gina discovered that somewhat to her surprise she wasnt inclined to go straight to her office true that had been her intention since last night but now that the moment had arrived something about it didnt feel quite right she knew that she could go in and report to her partners that she was ready to get back in harness at that announcement right away they would probably be able to throw her some work on cases they were handling get her back up to speed give her some billable hours but gina knew that those hours rightly belonged to the nineteen longsuffering and hardworking associates within the firm each one of whom was expected to amass twentytwo hundred billable hours in the course of a year a daunting and unending struggle for young attorneys that demanded fifty weeks of eightbillablehour days lunches didnt count administrative hours didnt count prep time and research often didnt count and certainly schmoozing by the water cooler didnt count hours were limited and finite and it wasnt uncommon for an associate to put in twelve hours on the clock in order to bill eight of them as a partner gina was under no illusion that her legitimate role was to garner clients for the firm and they in turn would provide the billable hours of work that she would then dole out to her associates she was ready to go back to work all right but damned if she was going to be a drain on the firms resources she needed to reestablish her contacts in the city and attract her own clients to the firmto do otherwise would not only be unfair to her associates it would put her in a subservient position visavis her partners and she wasnt going to let that happen by the time she got to the corner shed made up her mind and when the cab pulled over to pick her up she slid into the backseat and said hall of justice please seventh and bryant in terms of longevity in the city lou the greeks wasnt exactly tadichs or fior ditalia or even original joes or the swan oyster depot nevertheless with fortyplus years in its same location across the street from the hall of justice it had its full complement of tradition albeit in a slightly less savory vein than those other famous eateries the whole eatery designation was something of a misnomer certainly anyone drawing up a business plan for the place in todays world would be hardpressed to attract investors with a menu that included only one item per daythe specialand very few appetizers besides the occasional edamame or dried wasabicoated peas forget about lunch standards everywhere else such as chicken wings or hamburgers or fried calamari or garlic fries or god forbid salads or other raw green stuffthe regulars at lous referred to martini olives as the vegetable course instead lous wife chui sought on a daily basis to meld the disparate culinary cultures of her own china and her husbands greece with original and it must be admitted creative dishes such as sweet and sour dolmas or pita stuffed kung pao chicken or mysteries such as the famous yeanling clay bowl whatever a yeanling was often edible but just as often not the food was not why people gathered at lous like so many other restaurants lous location was the key to its success if you had business with the criminal justice system in san francisco lous was where you ate it didnt matter that it was stuck down in the basement of a bailbond building that it always smelled a little funky was darkly lit and illventilated it wasnt fifty yards from the front door of the hall of justice so juries on their lunch breaks cops reporters lawyers and their clients witnesses snitches families of victims and visitors to the jaila vast often unwashed and unruly certainly boisterous clientelefilled the place from the first legal drink at am until last call at am now gina roake fresh from her cab ride walked down the six steps from the street and waded into the surging tide of humanity on the other side of lous blackpainted glass doubledoors the crowd did not intimidate her this was her milieu smiling jostling pushing her way inside she cleared the immediate crush and across the room saw her firms chief investigator wyatt hunt sharing a fourperson booth with another man in ten seconds she was standing over them if i joined you would i be interrupting important business she asked not at all hunt said we havent even ordered yet youre sure you wouldnt mind sharing half your bench with an old woman hunt leaned forward and back looking around behind her no problem he said where is she but grinning up at her he slid in to give her room then pointed across the table you know devin juhle i believe homicide sure how are you inspector better now that its not just me and wyatt hes decent company for about fifteen minutes then usually starts to babble its when i start using longer words hunt explained devin gets confused he uses them in the wrong context he needs to take a course or something i tell him its no good using big words if you dont know what they mean teleological hunt said a perfect example juhle turned to gina as you can see he said youre not interrupting then to hunt and no way is that a real word teleological hunt held out a hand across the table how much lunch youre on spell it for the record hunt strung out the letters then said gina word or no word she made a reluctant grimace across at juhle i think its a word inspector sorry it is a word hunt said it means relating to design in nature like a teleological argument man started to walk upright because he got out of the trees and started hanging out in tall grass where he had to stand to see over it which got himus i mean the human raceto walking imagine that juhle said i never would have guessed across the table juhle sotto voced to gina were getting into the babble phase i told you about fifteen minutes later they were all having the specialpot stickers stuffed with taramosalatawhich was not particularly by unanimous opinion chuis greatest triumph but by now they werent paying any attention to the food anyway just a feeling in my gut juhle was saying but anytime youve got a murdered spouse and a megamilliondollar estate youve got to think maybe the husband huh gina said do you have anything on him juhle shook his head its too soon we dont even know time of death yet but if there was foul play and the bump on the head looks an awful lot like there was then it was either him or somebody else she knew pretty damn well why do you say that hunt asked she was naked juhle said shes not having wine and getting naked with whoever he might have hired to get rid of her i dont care how cute he was does this guy have a lawyer gina asked juhle started to pop a pot sticker then thought better of it and put it back on his plate he shook his head again too early its never too early we dont even have a murder yet much less charged him with it but you talked to him this morning and you let him tell you all this stuff i didnt twist his arm and about money and being resentful of his wife and spending all last weekend just thinking about how much he hated her somehow i think that if a lawyer had been with him he would have toned things down a notch or two juhle pulled down the sides of his mouth erasing the smile that had started there he might have at that but fortunately no offense he didnt think to call one hunt spoke up in his heart devin already thinks hes guilty im getting that impression gina said not true devin said im in wait mode thats all are you going to talk to him again gina asked probably later today if hes where he should be as opposed to his house juhle was matteroffact hey i went upstairs with him so he could get some fresh clothes but no way he spends any more time at his house until were through with the place so wheres he staying the travelodge down on lombard its close enough and youre going down to see him there thats my plan and he still wont have a lawyer this time juhles smile stayed if my luck holds he said gina hated it when cops played these silly territorial games for juhles benefit and mostly just for the fun of it she decided to put a little of the needle in she turned to hunt just as good citizens wyatt we ought to get in touch with this guy and give him a heads up hey come on juhle put some humor in it but not all that much give a poor cop a break besides he gets lawyered up im really going to think hes guilty having a lawyer means hes guilty gina asked no of course not how silly of me juhle remained genial youre absolutely correct perish the thought dont be fooled hunt said he doesnt agree with you im picking that up wyatt juhle stabbed one of the awful pot stickers with his fork and picked it up staring at it for a second he again put it back down on his plate ginas casual dig at him had obviously struck a nerve lets put it this way he hasnt been charged with anything yet if the autopsy comes back looking like someone murdered his wife i would hope that hed want to cooperate in every way he could to help us find the killer if hes got a lawyer there with him running a screen every time i ask him a question im going to wonder about whats going on with him a lot more than i would if he just sat and talked to me but you admit youre trying to get him to implicate himself no then patiently im trying to get at the truth if hes innocent the truthpardon the phrasethe truth will set him free only in a perfect world inspector you know that okay granted juhle said but an innocent guy doesnt call a lawyer before hes even charged with anything gina thought this was turning into a ridiculous discussion for two old pros to be having shed started out totally goofing with juhle and now she was enjoying the rise she was getting out of him so she went on he does if hes going to talk to cops and say things that could get misconstrued thats all im saying and all im saying juhle responded is that to us cop types that happens and were going to think the guys got something to hide well to quote the beatles hunt said trying to lighten everybody up everybodys got something to hide cept for me and my monkey thanks wyatt gina said that was helpful selfeffacing hunt said i try to contribute i think i got your friend mad at me naw thats just devin hes a cop so he thinks like a cop its a whole mindset they test you on at the academy first question is whether you think if a guys got a lawyer is he guilty if you say not necessarily you flunk out how heartening they were crossing bryant street at the light so hunt asked what brings you down here i havent seen you near the hall in forever at least maybe longer i dont even remember the last time i was down here reaching the opposite curb they turned right together and started up the block in front of them unmarked as well as blackandwhite police cars and taxicabs were doubleparked in the street all the way up to the front steps of the hall someone had chained a large doberman to one of the handrails in the middle of the wide and shallow stairs and his barking competed with the jamaican in dreads who was exhorting all and sundry to embrace rasta as their salvation and haile selassie as the one true god a homeless man wrapped in newspaper slept just beyond the hedge that bounded the steps a full dozen attorney types stood talking with clients or cops in the bright sunshine while regular citizens kept up a stream in and out of the glass doors can you believe i think ive actually missed the place roake said you get inside i predict youll get over that pretty quick you meeting a client no im hoping to latch on to a conflicts case these cases were very common the public defenders office would in the normal course of events be assigned to an indigent client who had been accused of a crime if that suspect committed the crime with a partner the pd could not also defend the accompliceit was a conflict of interest so the court would assign a private defense attorney such as gina whose fees the city would pay to represent the accomplice they reached the steps gina stopped hesitated gestured to the door you going inside no i was just doing some computer searches at home and devin called to have lunch and i took pity on him i live just around the corner again gina showed a slight hesitation what hunt asked she lay a hand on his arm i was just wondering if inspector juhle happened to mention the name of the husband we were talking about back in there sure its stuart gorman the writer she shook her head im afraid i dont know the name what does he write outdoors books fishing mostly ive read a couple of em hes pretty good a couple of them maybe three by now i hate him already gina said ive been trying to finish my one damn book for almost four years and hes already finished three maybe he started earlier than you maybe hes just better at it could be that i suppose though youre probably a better lawyer than hed be if he were a lawyer which based on devins talk with him hes not hunt said and that in turn leaves you wondering if hes got himself legal representation yet doesnt it now roake smiled no flies on you wyatt the thought did occur to me you want me to call him and find out for sure gina shook her head thanks i can chase my own ambulances the mans just lost his wife lets go wildly out on a limb and presume for a minute that he had nothing to do with killing her in which case hes probablyno undoubtedlydevastated but i kind of think hed be better off if he gets somebody before your devin gets another shot at him well hunt said if i know dev like i think i do hed better hurry at a few minutes after one oclock a haggard stuart gorman collapsed in a wing chair next to the television in his hotel room hung up the telephone i cant believe these people sitting across from him on the front two inches of his bed his longtime friend and excollege roommate jedd conley raised his head conley was the first call stuart made after the police had chased him out of his own house that morning in spite of being the state assemblyman representing san francisco conley had cleared his entire calendar for the day and met stuart at the travelodge within twenty minutes of checking in conley had a good face closely shaved both his nose and his sixfoot bearing were strong straight aristocratic the broad unlined forehead under his dark hair could have belonged to a man twenty years his junior but the youthful look was somewhat mitigated by the lines around a mouth that had perhaps been forced to smile more than it wanted to today conley was wearing a tan business suit with a white shirt and light gold tie who was that he asked some guy capping for a lawyer wanting to know if id retained legal representation yet the distinguished citizen had somebody he wanted to recommend what a sleazeball i got rid of him i heard you fucking shysters howd they find me here so fast conley shrugged word gets out its already been on tv they probably called the cops and asked its just business just business stuart gorman blew some of his anger into the dim room it sucks i dont know conley stood up and crossed to the window where he pulled a cord on the blinds and let in more light turning he said youre going to need a lawyer after all you cant blame them i wasnt here jedd i wasnt physically present when she died stuart said evenly his mouth tightening up how am i going to be a suspect i didnt say you were a suspect i said youre going to need a lawyer the cops the press the estate its an automatic as you know ive already done that talked to the cops it was no sweat besides i dont know why were talking about me needing another lawyer ive already got one if im not mistaken conley pulled at his forelock sighed shook his head he chose his words with care listen my man he said hand over heart youre my best friend and my heart is breaking here for whats happened to caryn to you and her and kymberly but i havent done one lick of actual law in ten years so id be lousy at representing you besides which maybe youve noticed ive got another fulltime job it just cant be me but youre going to need somebody stuart stared coldly at his old pal for a few seconds and then the anger passed and he settled back into his chair we dont need to argue about it a pause and then conley said when youre ready theres somebody id recommend conley was back on the edge of the bed and now he came forward dont be an idiot stu you have no idea how all this stuff works even if caryn took some pills and drowned hey read my lips i was up at echo lake whatever happened last night i wasnt any part of it can you prove that what do you mean i mean did anybody see you up there did you have company last night did you talk on the phone when stuart didnt respond conley continued im taking your silence as a no and this in turn means that your alibi sucks and youre going to be on your cops list okay maybe if caryn was murdered conley shrugged maybe even if she wasnt you remember that guy a couple of years ago he was like a telemarketer or something and she owned about half the real estate in the western addition anyway the two of them went camping and the story was that she went out for a midnight swim all alone while he was sleeping and didnt come back turns out she drowned and the husband stood to inherit like fifty million dollars did in fact inherit fifty million bucks you dont think the cops considered him a suspect you think the fact that she drowned was a defense against them thinking he killed her you want to know the truth you want to kill somebody drowning thems probably the best way to do it evidencewise okay but did they charge him did they have any evidence this brought conley up short do me a favor stu dont ask your friendly inspector that kind of question what kind of question evidence questions whether or not crimes got charged legal questions why not because they demonstrate what they call a degree of criminal sophistication how about that it could sound to a trained investigator like you had premeditated your actions and possibly even studied the rules of evidence i was just asking you if they brought to trial the guy you were talking about conley said in the end no but i was around at the das for a few of the discussions about whether they had enough to bring charges or not the cops position was that they had fifty million good enough reasons and they came this close to taking it to the grand jury even without a shred of evidence and the grand jury would have indicted so why didnt they charge it because they would have lost at trial and the da knew it and hell nobody doubted even for a minute that the husband had done it he was there where she drowned he was going to inherit theyd been having troubles in their marriage which i know you and caryn spreading his palms out conley continued anyway you see what im getting at how much was caryn worth on her own six seven million plus your life insurance jesus jedd get used to it stu youre going to hear it from the police and youre going to have to know how to answer them or even whether or not to answer them and you dont have a clue which can hurt you a lot kymberly too thats all im saying friend to friend finally stuart seemed to get the message he settled back into his chair chin down on his chest his arms hanging over the sides so who do you know he asked oh god its true then isnt it its really true debra drydencaryns younger sisterstood just inside the rooms doorway in front of stuart her face washed in anguish then she stepped into his embrace pressing herself up against him holding him tightly she began to shake stuart held her and let her go on his hands locked around her back over the silk of her blouse i know he whispered its all right at last he extricated himself and stepped back when i got your message i didnt want to call you back debra said i didnt want it to be true stuart nodded i know he halfturned i dont know if youve met jedd conley debra lifted a hand perfunctorily thanks for being here for stuart i couldnt not be conley said the womans obvious pain and suffering did nothing to camouflage and perhaps even served to enhance her physical beauty shoulderlength whiteblond hair surrounded a captivating face turquoise eyes finely pored light tan skin debra wore a short white skirt and teal silk blouse a gold necklace and diamond earrings she brought both hands up to her eyes and dabbed under them she said to stuart but what are you doing here why arent you home theyre not letting me go back there until theyre finished with their investigation but why you said she drowned in the hot tub is that possible she may have been drinking and then taken some pills youre saying she might have killed herself stuart shook his head if she did i dont think it was on purpose of course it wasnt conley said she wasnt suicidal debra turned to him a cold eye at the interruption how do you know that i just talked to her friday afternoon stuart spoke with some surprise you did sure conley went on you know that stu she was all in a tizzy about her invention remember shed asked me to have my office look into some questions with her vcventure capitalpeople id been reporting back to her pretty regularly debra asked what does your office have to do with that nothing specific conley said but im with the state assembly and caryn thought i could find out some stuff that wasnt public yet and she may not have been all wrong about that what was the news friday stuart asked it wasnt anything that was going to make her want to kill herself wed found some evidence that piithis was polymed innovations inc the manufacturer of the dryden socket which caryn had inventedhadnt reported some negative results in the clinical trialspostop leg clotsthat apparently theyd known about caryn was furious about it and furious is pretty much the opposite of suicidal maybe she started out furious debra said but over the weekend it turned into depression if she had gotten herself depressed by last night it wasnt about business stuart said he drew a breath both of you might as well hear it from me since its going to come out eventually she wanted a divorce debra said thats not wanting to kill yourself either thats wanting to move on ask me how i know im three years free and havent regretted a day of it i dont want to believe it was a done deal stuart said but it is what she told me she couldnt have wanted to leave you debra said i mean youre she came at the thought again in what way exactly have you not been the perfect husband stuart said a lot of ways debra too many believe me conley touched his friends arm youre getting whacked every which way but loose here arent you stu whyd she want to leave you did she say maybe a boyfriend a quick shake of the head i dont think it was that when would she have had the time but i dont know for sure it could have been anything or everything she just wasnt happy with us together debras eyes had gone glassy again she reached out to touch stuarts arm then moved a step closer to him lets not think about that right now okay lets all just try to get through what we need to do here and now good idea conley said maybe you could help talk stuart into getting himself a lawyer ive got someone in mind and with this divorce in the mix hes going to need one her hand still on his arm debra nodded stuart she said softly i think you ought to listen to your friend in the normal course of events devin juhle would not have heard word one about the autopsy of caryn dryden for at least a few days but in the great yin and yang of the citys population this turned out to be a slow weekend for death san franciscos homicide ratewith about two killings every weekwas not comparable say to oaklands eleven miles across the bay with its two hundred and twenty murders a year but since autopsies were mandated not just for violent deaths but for deaths of the homeless deaths anywhere with an element of suspicion to them usually the medical examiners office had an autopsy backlog of at least a couple of days after the body arrived at the morgue but today still hungry from his lack of lunch at lous juhle wasnt ten seconds back inside the door to the homicide detail on the fourth floor in the hall of justice when his lieutenant marcel lanier saw him and called out his name the door to laniers small office built into the corner of the cluttered room that served as headquarters for the citys fifteen homicide inspectors was open behind it at his outsized desk the lieutenant was having his lunchan enormous construction of marbled rye bread stuffed with three or four inches worth of what looked like pastrami or corned beef with cheese and pickles lanier finished chewing took a sip from his can of diet coke swallowed and said this is impossible if its true so its probably a hoax but strout this was john strout san franciscos septuagenarian medical examinercalled and said theyre done with the preliminary cutting on your girl and maybe youll want to go down and see where theyre at juhle would normally have attended the autopsy if hed known it was going to happen but hed never expected it so soon theyve got something thats what it sounded like i cant see him calling us up if he didnt have something to talk about yeah that wouldnt make any sense okay then lanier sunk his teeth again into the sandwich you going to eat all of that marcel id pay you five dollars for a bite lanier chewed another few seconds drank swallowed smiled why am i thinking you had lunch at the greeks if you want to call it that lunch i mean whats the special today i dont know what it was some kind of fish eggs and this rubbery doughy stuff i couldnt eat two of em i dont know how the guy stays in business clucks like yourself okay then ten bucks one bite come on juhle wanted to get to strouts office but the sandwich was going to come first dammit lanier took pity on him and since very few mortals could eat an entire pastrami and swiss on rye from davids deli at one sitting anyway he gave him half of it for free said if his legendary generosity went toward motivating his troops that was enough thanks for him so feeling motivated at least in spirit juhle left laniers office and poured himself a cup of coffee then went to his desk to eat juhle couldnt believe how good the sandwich tasted the pastrami was still warm the swiss cheese nearly melted the mustard pungent enough to get his eyes watering it somehow made even the stale coffee more than palatable for a second he idly wondered if maybe lou or his wife hadnt yet heard of the concept of sandwich as a possible lunch item maybe juhle could swing by davids and buy a few pounds of lunch meats and cheeses a selection of condiments and some loaves of rye bread deliver it all across the street and leave chui written assembly instructions fresh sandwiches on the menu at lou the greeks might improve the dining experience for the citys entire criminal law community for generations to come as the source of the bounty juhle could become a cultural hero meanwhile though he thought as he ate the last delectable bite he was a cop on a case that if his gut was right looked like it was about to become a righteous highprofile homicide suddenly energized he pushed back from his desk and went out the door where he turned left and began to jog down the hallway toward the elevators the ambient temperature in the medical examiners lab was fiftyfive degrees since this was very close to the average san francisco temperature regardless of season or time of day or night most of the time visitors to the morgue were dressed in enough layers of clothing that they didnt notice the chill today though the city basked in its sixth consecutive day of an unusually warm indian summer and juhle was in shirtsleeves in his hurry to get downstairs after dawdling in his sandwich reveries the jog had worked up a light sweat now standing with strout over the table where caryn drydens body lay he found he was having to fight himself to keep his teeth from chattering oblivious to his visitors discomfort lost in his work as he always was the medical examiner had paused in his perusal of the internal organs most of whichjuhle was happy to seewere thankfully still inside the body cavity now strout probed at a spot in the skull at the temple in front of the right ear the surrounding area of which hed shaved bare i went ahead and measured the diameter of the depressed skull fracture which here you can see ive concluded this was probably caused by an object with a rounded cylindrical surface like say a baseball bat why do you say that no cut nothing with an edge anyway this looks like somethin round hit her you got a round indentation in the skull strout nodded id say enough to knock her out which might have been the point of it juhle persisted but something round looks like that from the fracture a wine bottle coulda been juhle folded his arms over his chest for warmth there was a wine bottle in the trash compactor strout nodded then spoke in his trademark southern drawl you want to go get it from evidence and bring it on down i could tell you if thats probably what hit her they ought to check that sucker for prints and blood and hair which youre probably already doin right although the guy had any brains he washed it before suddenly the me frowned the trash compactor yep in the kitchen strout wagged his head most folks here in the city dont you think if we get glass we recycle it strout was right most san franciscans of a certain economic leveland the gormandrydens fit within itrecycled glass and paper as a matter of course the city even provided separate receptacles for regular pickup the people he was talking about simply did not normally throw an empty wine bottle into a trash compactor so what does that say to you john juhle asked well two things one whoever threw it away wasnt thinking straight maybe in a panic over what hed just done two maybe he didnt know where they normally threw away the recycling i dont like that one so much juhle said why not it would tend to eliminate the husband yes i spose it would you thinkin it was him juhle played it close he called it in it would help if i knew what time she died since he says he didnt get into town until six this morning well if thats true it wasnt him although due to the hot tub immersion the exact timins goin to be squishy im afraid i dont want to hear that an amused flicker crossed strouts face somehow i didnt think you did inspector but even so there might be enough to hang your man im listening well the plain fact is that by the time we got my people there this morning she was in full rigor meaning shed been dead at least an hour one hour i thought i know what you thoughtthat rigor kicks in at about two hours but the heat speeds it up and it can be well advanced in an hour which would have given the husband plenty of time maybe it would have cept for one thing whats that for an answer strout reached out and grabbed caryns arm by the wrist lifting it to bend at the elbow when he let it go it fell back down to the table the rigors pretty well passed as you can see time we got her in here and on the table which was eight fortythree exactly it had already got to where you could move her joints if you exerted some pressure so full rigor which is from about hour three to hour eight was over and that makes the latest time of death at twelve fortythree or sometime the hour before what about her body temperature strout shook his head useless here im afraid she cooked up to right around oneohfive her core temp when my staff arrived at her house was a hundred and three when she got here it was still over a hundred you want you can put on some gloves and get a feel for where shes at right now go ahead ill pass john thanks well suit yourself he put his own rubbergloved hand into the cavity hed cut below her chest and nodded as though verifying something to himself damn close to what you and me are right now he said my guess is she was in the tub most of the night and that agrees with the time of death were talking about juhle folded his arms and tried to rub some life into them so she didnt drown you cold inspector we could get you a lab coat no im fine thanks cant let it get too warm in here you know what im sayin but to answer your question yes she did drown probably got knocked out first then held under the water but definitely drowned the blow to the head would it have killed her if she didnt drown first no my guess is somebody pushed her down and held her probably didnt take thirty seconds and of course she probably couldnt put up much of a fight but its going to be a hell of a thing to prove juhle frowned whys that strout lovingly ran his rubbergloved thumb over the shaved contusion well this area around the fracture were looking at you can see its got some swelling which means blood flowed to it after she got it any good defense attorney is going to say that she just banged her head sometime before she hopped in the tub and theres no real solid way anybodys gonna prove she didnt and by the way her blood alcohol was point one one so she was legally drunk plus she had what looks on the first scan like she had some opiate on board vicodin juhle said strout shrugged dont know yet but could be the point is she could have just passed out from the wine and drugs and heat and slipped under the water and drowned no way to prove she didnt so youre not going to call it a homicide strout knew the game intimately and his enjoyment of it played on the features of his face well its a homicide you know until i rule otherwise and from what im seeing here with this bump im not going to call it suicide so the doors still open for you anyway but youre not ready to call it a homicide juhle broke an easy grin id buy you a nice lunch at lous cant sorry not there yet if it was a murder and just between us im thinkin it probably was you got yourself a tough row to hoe guy did a hell of a good job just speakin from a professional point of view gonna be damn hard to prove a righteous murder since i cant swear on the stand that it even was one theyll ask me if it could have been an accident or even a suicide and im gonna have to tell them yes and thats not what you want to hear is it okay but heres the other image i cant seem to get out of my mind after he left strout juhle had stopped upstairs on the third floor where the das worked and in particular the cramped office of an assistant district attorney named gerry abrams juhle was seated in the uncomfortable wooden chair behind the desk of gerrys office mate who was in court for the afternoon stuart gorman gets home at the ungodly morning hour of what six oclock six thirty somewhere in there right you ever start a drive at two am me never anyway he putzes around for a while goes upstairs and sees the bed is empty then goes down and out to the hot tub and finds his wife you with me abrams feet up on his desk hands templed at his mouth opened his eyes and inclined his head about an inch he was paying close attention he made a circle in the air with his index finger indicating that juhle should keep talking okay so he pulls her out of the tub and when the first cops arrive hes doing cpr on her juhle stopped get it he asked abrams opened his eyes again whats the problem with that if he knows cpr hes going to try but juhle held out his palm not so fast tonto the problem according to what i just heard from strout is that this would have been while she was still in absolutely full rigor she was stiff as a board and i dont care how much experience somebody has with seeing dead people even if its your first time youre not going to mistake a body thats already stiffened up with somebody whos got a chance to get resuscitated probably true abrams eyes flicked the corners of the room and the point is the point juhle said is that gorman obviously had to know his wife was dead how could she not be he was putting on a show for when the guys from central station answered the emergency call and showed up they come in and see him doing cpr you see what im saying he looks like hes trying to help not like he killed her maybe he just panicked and was really trying to save her gerry shed been dead underwater for six hours this isnt like a close call in real life maybe not but its colorable as they say to a jury if im defending him i can hear myself ladies and gentlemen of the jury in the intense emotion of finding his beloved wife of twenty years dead in the hot tub mr gorman couldnt think of any other response than to try and breathe some life back into her even if it seemed impossible he loved her so much maybe that love could produce a miracle there was literally nothing else he could do abrams spread his hands this flies on gilded wings dev two or three out of your twelve are going to completely accept it no problem t v j i cant well of course not its ridiculous on the face of it so since when has that been a reason not to make an argument to a jury abrams finally brought his feet to the floor and pulled himself up in his chair elbows on his desk hows his alibi he says he was on the road driving down from echo lake a little southwest of tahoe leaving as i believe ive mentioned at two oclock because he couldnt sleep so he could have left at say eight the night before and who would know right nobody so you think its him while hed been talking juhle had straightened out a paper clip and now he was bending it around his finger ill tell you what i got in some kind of order and then you tell me first shed told him just friday that she wanted a divorce second she made a ton of money i mean evidently a large tonand now its all his although hes never really cared much about money no abrams said me neither few are so shallow juhle agreed then the cpr thing except really for truly it doesnt strike me that hes in any kind of mourning their daughter being hurt by all this okay that got to him but the wife they were over anyway you got all that from him from gorman most of it not the cpr but everything else horses mouth finally he plants this scenario with vicodin and alcohol and a hot tub with a temperature of exactly a hundred and five degrees which he just happens to mention to me in case i needed to have a theory for how she died and which ps fits the facts perfectly abrams his eyes with a faraway look they got when he was concentrating scratched at a blemish in the wood of his desk too perfectly youre thinking juhle nodded strout even said it was a damn professionallooking job finally abrams met juhles eye well youve got your work cut out especially if his alibi holds i wouldnt go near a grand jury yet with what youve got abrams paused shook his head disconsolately strouts sure huh cause of death was drowning juhle nodded cause drowning is a bitch to prove murder any sign of struggle just the bump abrams was staring at the wall behind juhles head suddenly he snapped back into focus flashed a quick smile well he said its early innings meanwhile you hear about the womans body they found this morning out in the flats in the bay no what about her she was so ugly even the tide wouldnt take her out wow juhle shook his head in admiration a joke right and people say lawyers dont have a sense of humor wes farrell rarely wore a coat and tie except when he was in court and almost never when as now he was in his thirdfloor suite at the sutter street offices of freeman farrell hardy roake when gina walked in on him after returning from her frustrating time in department one of the courtrooms in the hall of justice the nearlegendary schlumpiness that was wess trademark was even more pronounced than usual he wore only a tshirt red running shorts that read stanford across the back a pair of black kneelength socks and birkenstock sandals his long graybrown hair was partially tied up in his usual ponytail and he was down on one knee over by what passed for a work desk by the window wes liked to think that he had the worlds greatest collection of epigrammatic tshirts and perhaps he was right the one he wore today read im out of my mind please leave a message am i interrupting something gina asked mostly in jest what are you doing training gert or trying to he looked vaguely over to the other side of the large room his office was haphazardly decorated to say the least a couch with some floral touches a battered coffee table two leather upholstered chairs a television set on an old library table a sagging barcalounger over by the wet bar which was in turn piled with drafts of legal briefs and old newspapers cmere girl come on now bring the ball good girl gina stepped farther into the room closing the door behind her and only then saw wess new labrador puppy chewing a yellow nerf basketball as soon as she saw gina the dog forgot the ball entirely and bounded across to her tail wagging turning in little circles jumping up wes hopped up to his feet scolding no gertie no no no bad girl gina reached down to pet the dog who was now on her back in apparent dog glee its all right wes shes a good girl gina scratched her belly arent you sweetheart good girl then to wes have you been bringing her in here a lot nothing on my calendar this afternoon i thought id work on her fetching im starting to think shes got a learning disorder or something adhd gina said all dogs have it bart didnt for nearly fifteen years bart had been wess pet a goodsize boxer that hed had to put down a few months before the experience had nearly broken his heart until his girlfriend sam had come home with gert about three weeks ago you threw a ball for bart he knew what to do with it gertie doesnt have a clue maybe its a guy thing a guy thing you know bart was a guy gerties a girl maybe girl dogs dont like ball games maybe you havent trained her yet wes could that be it im trying weve been at it half an hour now and look at her gert was still enjoying the tummy rub gina was administering hopeless gina straightened up and brushed some dog hair off her skirt well keep at it im sure shell get it someday suddenly she seemed to notice her partner for the first time nice outfit by the way very professional id like to have seen phylliss face when you passed her phyllis the firms elderly opinionated and dictatorial receptionist manned the phone banks from an oval station in the center of the lobby one floor down with all the warmth and personality of a glacier wes looked down at himself and shrugged she has yet to see me this afternoon i came up by elevator directly from the garage a pause hey i told you i wasnt expecting clients he said or company well im afraid youve got it she boosted a haunch onto the back of the couch and swung her leg back and forth ive just come from the hall you know how many lawyers they have on the list waiting to pull conflicts cases it used to be twentyfive youd get a day about once a month now its a hundred and ten youre lucky to get three days a year walking across the room farrell picked up the nerf ball cleared a space on his library table and sat on it threes not a big number i guess the words out you bill the city and you get paid its a good gig gertie he wagged the nerf ball threw it back across the room and came back to gina and you never know what you get last time i went down all i got was a deucea drunk driving case and had to plead it out the guy was doing fine almost passed the field sobriety test but when the cop asked him when he started drinking his answer was panama wonderful gina said why were you there though last i looked we had a pretty good caseload downstairs besides which i thought youd more or less retired from as we say the active practice of the law he pointed get it girl get it yeah well i thought about it a lot over the weekend and decided it was time i jumped back in im a lawyer i ought to do some law what about the book the book isnt going anywhere itll be there if i decide to go back to it it also isnt going anywhere in the literal sense its just something to hide behind gina glanced over to where gertie was circling the ball sniffing at it anyway i didnt want to steal away billing hours from the kids ive always kept my name on the conflicts list and i decided id take my turn this time instead of passing on the library table the intercom on the phone buzzed and wes picked it up yes phyllis how intuitive of you dear yes she is hold on a second ill put her on can i tell her who it is his eyebrows went up really in person holding the mouthpiece out to her he whispered jedd conley not in person but on the phone for any number of reasons gina didnt want to talk to jedd conley in a room with anybody else in it so she had phyllis ask the assemblyman to wait for a minute while she said goodbye to wes then swiftly descended the stairs from his office down to the main lobby there she gave phyllis the signal that shed take the call in her own corner office and she halfran the length of the hall picking up on the second ring hello this is gina gina its jedd conley thats what i heard but i wasnt sure i believed it its been a long time yes it has weve both been busy havent we you a little more than me how are you im good basically good and yourself he lowered his voice i was so sorry to hear about david the man was a giant she stifled a sigh yes well thank you are you calling from sacramento no im in town down at the travelodge on lombard you know it sure but to be honest ive never really thought of you as a travelodge kind of guy youre staying there actually im with a friend of mine who is in the way of needing a lawyer right away if memory serves jedd wouldnt that be you not anymore i havent been in a courtroom in years since not long after you and i had a few of our last tussles actually gina felt a flush rise in her face she and jedd had never been seriously involved on an emotional level but long before conley had gotten married theyd indeed had some tussles in each others bedrooms as well as in the courtroom well im flattered you called but i must say im a little surprised that you thought of me well youre an excellent attorney thats why who never once beat you in court if i recall and i do thats because all of your clients were guilty i guess thats true she admitted ruefully so what about your friend is he guilty stuart gorman conley said and no hes not guilty but he does need a lawyer making sure he doesnt screw things up and to walk him through the process after a small hesitation he said i know this is short notice but thats the way these things go its not that gina said actually the timing couldnt be better youre talking about stuart gorman the writer yep youve heard of him not until a couple of hours ago but in the smallworld department i just had lunch with the cop who talked to him at his house this morning youre kidding not devin juhle who by the way isnt as sure as you that your friend just needs to walk through it he say that i read between the lines but hes a cop they always think that well he hid his suspicions pretty well stuart thought he was a good guy maybe he is he just thinks that if hes got a dead spouse on his hands the other spouse probably has something to do with it not this time do you think you could come on down when more or less now a silence then gina said im thinking you know that ive never defended anyone in a murder case it wont come to that conley said im not sure inspector juhle would agree with you all right but even if it does havent your partners both done murder trials yes but they wouldnt i mean suddenly gina shook herself oh what am i saying of course im interested i just dont want to misrepresent myself to your client hes not my client hes my friend hed be your client okay she said but make sure you tell him what i told you hes got to know who hell be dealing with so youre coming down give me a half hour gina thanks for coming jedd reached out to shake her hand his eyes took in all of her with one approving glance he covered their grip with his other hand and held it i thought under the rules we were supposed to look older as time went by she shook her head smiling up at him dont start you havent held up all that badly yourself she tightened her grip briefly then withdrew her hand am i on time neither the police nor the press have reappeared yet if thats what you mean thats what i mean then youre on time come on in he turned to reveal the two people whod just gotten up off the couch behind him gina roake stuart gorman and this is debra he stopped on a questioning note the beautiful young woman stepped forward dryden she said shaking ginas hand with a cool firm grip debra dryden im stuarts sisterinlaw caryns sister she halfturned and rested her hand protectively on stuarts arm bringing him up into the introduction her body language trumpeting at the very least a strong attraction for her dead sisters husband were so glad you could come i just hope i can be of some help gina reached around debra and extended her hand mr gorman nice to meet you stuart he said not mr gorman he took her hand everybody seems to agree that i need a lawyer so thanks for coming gina cocked her head so i gather you dont agree he shrugged as ive mentioned to all and sundry i wasnt here when my wife died so i think it might be a stretch to conclude that i killed her it might be at that gina said but you want to be careful what you say when you talk to the police did jedd tell you that just coincidentally i had lunch with inspector juhle today i didnt get the impression that he thought your wifes death was a suicide or that you couldnt have been involved stuart lifted his shoulders then dropped them well hell find out i wasnt around where were you up at my cabin weve got a place up on echo lake gina took a beat you were at echo lake this last weekend yeah whys that such a surprise because so was i tamarack lake actually right beyond echo hey i was there too i mean at tamarack god could that have been just last night it seems like a year ago you really were at tamarack she nodded camping on the western shore stuart was warming to the conversation his face showing signs of animation now through the fatigue i was on my favorite rock on the east side just at sundown oh my god gina was caught up in it herself i think i might have even seen you but debra cut in well all this is really special but whether or not anybody saw stuart up there isnt really the point is it unless she spoke to ginaunless you saw him leave his cabin early this morning debras tone brought gina up short there was more it seemed to her than mere protectiveness here it struck her as jealousy which might mean something going on between debra and stuart debra again put her hand on stuarts arm and this time he covered it with his own and left it there for a moment it doesnt matter where you were last night at sundown stuart it matters that you didnt leave your cabin until sometime early this morning gina realized that everybody else in the room knew more about the particulars of the case than she did what time stuart she asked two he said ginas face showed her dissatisfaction with that answer two in the morning maybe we all ought to sit down jedd said catch up on our facts two chairs bracketed the small couch gina and jedd took them as stuart and debra went around the coffee table and sat next to each other on the couch as soon as everyone was settled gina came forward in her chair and repeated her earlier question stuart youre telling me you left your cabin at two this morning he nodded i couldnt sleep so i decided to drive on down and beat the traffic did you stop anywhere for gas or anything like that another nod i pulled off and got gas just outside sacramento used the bathroom he suddenly shifted and brought his arm off the back of the couch reaching into his back pocket coming out with his wallet here you go he said after a quick search arco allnite in rancho cordova four fifteen am this morning he held the receipt out to gina but striking quickly debra took it first and gave it a glance when she was done she passed it over to conley who looked at stuart and said well theres your alibi finally he gave it to gina i told you stuart said i wasnt here if theyve got a security video there gina said its even better jedd conley nodded there you go well gina added its not a lock but its a help finally the pressure and weariness seemed to weigh in on stuart he came forward on the couch frustration etched in his features for the first time he raised his voice i dont understand how i keep hearing things like its not a lock whats not a lock i didnt kill my wife whats so hard to understand about that debra put a restraining hand on his knee and left it there depleted stuart sank back into the seat of the couch gina noting the physical connection drew a breath to give herself a minute if stuart and debra were lovers it complicated matters considerably she forced a conversational tone stuart she had a large bump on her head i know that he said possibly enough to have knocked her out possibly he said but even juhle said not definitely maybe she fell down that happens too yes it does gina wasnt going to argue you told inspector juhle that she told you friday she was filing for divorce yes she didnt wait for a reply how much insurance did your wife carry i think the policy was for three million on each of us ginas eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch three million she said flatly and besides that how much money are you worth today i dont really know i havent thought about that all right but in any event your own personal net worth is many millions more than it was on friday isnt it i suppose so you suppose so and inspector juhle knows that too doesnt he because you told him am i right maybe not all the details but yeah all right generally and you also told him about how resentful you felt toward your wife and in fact that youd spent all of this past weekend just thinking about how much you hated her jedd spoke up you didnt say that did you stu a shrug i might have hate sounds a little strong i dont remember saying i exactly hated her i dont think juhle was making stuff up when he was telling me about it at lunch to say nothing of the fact that hell have your exact words on tape anyway gina said clearly the fact that juhle had secretly taped him began to sink in and shake him she softened her voice still further all im saying stuart is that you are a big blip on juhles radar and you shouldnt let the bare fact of your innocence and even an apparently strong alibi lull you into thinking that you couldnt find yourself in a world of hurt and charged with your wifes murder that bump on her head is bad news so is your newfound wealth like it or not and lets not even talk about the fact that you have something of a public face which the media will eat up before you know what hit you even innocent even with your alibi you could turn into the next oj simpson in a heartbeat she sat back nearly finished thats why its better to err on the side of caution here and not let you talk to the cops alone anymore but unlike me oj actually did it stuart said no gina shook her head according to the law which did not prove him guilty he was innocent even if in fact he was not and listen up stuartjust as easily the law could find that you did kill your wife even if in fact you didnt youve got to understand that and take it very very seriously the law is not about the fact of guilt or innocence its about the settlement of disputes so basically what were trying to avoid here is having you become any part of the dispute about who killed your wife and youre already damned close to being smack in the middle of it which is where you dont want to be is that clear enough stuart said i think it stinks i couldnt agree more but its reality now if you dont mind im going to place a call to inspector juhle and tell him that youve retained me and that of course were anxious to cooperate with his investigation in any way we can but that ive instructed you not to talk to him outside of my presence from now on you think you can live with that stuart still didnt like it but he gradually started to nod it sounds like i have to thats the right answer no nonsense now gina got her cell phone out of her briefcase and started punching numbers and now if both of you dont mind gina said i wonder if stuart and i could have a private discussion debras back straightened an electric shock through her her eyes suddenly blazed as she whirled around on the couch what for gina annoyed threw her a quizzical look id think that would be obvious enough we need to talk about strategy and then he can catch me up on everything ive missed you havent missed anything havent we just established here between us that he didnt do anything wrong he got home this morning and called emergency then had the talk with your inspector which you already seem stuart butted in deb its okay thats why shes here but you need i mean she couldnt express exactly what she meant and tried it again i dont think we should have to go we can be here to help you if you need anything its the attorneyclient privilege jedd said if you talk to your lawyer and you let somebody else listen in the privilege doesnt apply but debra said this isnt a good time for him to be alone he wont be alone gina told her matteroffactly putting on a tight smile she added im afraid that this isnt really a request she spoke to stuart its a condition stuart nodded dont worry deb ill be fine shes on our side jedd was already on his feet stuarts right debra the best thing we can do is let them go to work worrying her lower lip debra seemed to be fighting it for another second but finally she shrugged huffed an okay then and stood up stuart got up with her she put a hand on his arm one more time and told him shed be on her cell phone if he needed her have you had anything to eat i could bring you dinner when youre done here or we could go out maybe he said but ive got to be picking up kym sometime shes taking the bus up from santa cruz oh god thats right kym we could go down to greyhound and get her together just let me know i will jedd conley was standing by the open door holding it gina if you need anything else from me youve got all my numbers and again thanks for coming he cast an expectant glance at debra motioned to the doorway debra turned and clipped a cold yes thank you in ginas direction when theyd gone gina sat down in her chair and let stuart get comfortable on the couch meeting his eyes she smiled sitting back adopting a casual air she crossed her legs so she said gently now how are you holding up the question caught him off guard he rubbed a palm along his unshaved cheek finally he drew in a lungful of air and let it out not too well i keep thinking this cant be real that im going to wake up and it wont have happened i know thats how it feels at first gina took in her own deep breath my fiance was killed a few years ago sometimes it still doesnt feel real im sorry he said gina shrugged you go on regrouping not having meant to reveal even so little about herself she said but youve already told inspector juhle that you and your wife were having troubles having troubles doesnt mean i wanted her to die no of course not but how you felt about her may become an issue it is an issue is that a question this is one did you love her he hesitated scratched at the birthmark near his eye once upon a time i did but not anymore we just werent very compatible anymore we didnt like to do the same kinds of things but until last friday i dont know i had more or less considered it another phase that wed probably get through like wed gotten through other ones our daughter just started college a couple of weeks ago and the house felt different without her but i figured it would settle back to normal sometime until then id just wait it out so you didnt want the divorce on your own i wasnt actively thinking about it before she mentioned it if thats what you mean gina nodded close enough so you werent fighting no she worked all the time and i mostly tried to keep out of her way when she was home but we hardly talked enough to fight gina took a beat then came out with it what about her sister stuarts face went dark what about her you and her what are you talking about theres no me and her deb and i are friends yes i could see that your wife wasnt jealous of her no or at least she had no reason to be thats not the same thing im just telling you that if you have been having an affair with your wifes sister and it gets out which it will if you were its going to cause problems stuarts voice went up a notch it wouldnt mean i killed caryn for christs sake but gina needed to nail down this fact she uncrossed her legs and leaned toward him so for the record stuart your relationship with debra is not now and never has been intimate no yes correct is what im trying to say sufficiently ambiguous gina thought and nicely camouflaged but she simply said okay because if you were involved with her it would be a very strong motive i just said im not i know you did she stared at him and waited he returned her steady gaze for several long seconds unbending finally he came forward on the couch himself besides which he said i was at echo lake when caryn was killed or died or killed herself i believe ive said this once or twice so who cares what motive i might or might not have i couldnt have done it yes gina said i know that again she waited what he asked youre not going to like what im going to ask you next and i want you to know that im not being accusatory im trying to get my arms around where you are this almost brought him to a resigned grin i think i can take it all right if you still loved caryn enough to say that you were committed to your marriage before she mentioned divorce on friday im just wondering about where youre putting any sign of grief are you sorry or even sad that your wife of twentysome years is suddenly gone because if you are im not getting much of a sense of it i told you it hasnt sunk in yet im probably in shock i dont know how im feeling to tell you the truth conflicted i guess confused if theres a book or something on proper feelings youre supposed to have when your wife dies i havent read it i loved her once we used to be great lately we havent gotten along very well last weekend i finally let myself get pretty pissed off at her and this morning i come home and shes dead his shoulders sank as he sat back rubbed at his cheek again you mentioned sad i dont know if im sad i dont know how much im going to miss her im sorry if thats the wrong answer there isnt a wrong answer gina said and even if there were that was a pretty good one so what was it that made you stop getting along he barked a onenote bitter laugh everything money issues with kymberly money me her time did i mention money what about money she became obsessed with it i didnt obsessed how the way people get obsessed with anything its all she thought about cared about worked on you name it if it wasnt going to make her money she wasnt interested and you didnt feel the same way not even close he held up a hand its a flaw in my character i know and if you didnt know shed tell you are you saying she complained about you to other people in public i imagine so she complained about me to me enough but you werent fighting were you ever tempted to hit her tempted sure did i ever no let me ask you one juhle really thinks somebody killed her he thinks this was a murder gina nodded i got the very strong impression hes leaning that way this gave stuart a moment of pause his eyes scanned the corners of the ceiling then came back to gina im starting to be pretty glad they talked me into you he said seven juhle got gina roakes message that she was representing stuart gorman but couldnt do anything about it in the near term he was only a few blocks away from the travelodge but he was on his way to russian hill to try to talk with some of the neighbors he got lucky on his first try juhle was sitting in a breakfast nook talking to stuarts nextdoor neighbor leesa moore their conversation was competing with the low drone of a television set that sat on the kitchen counter next to the microwave tuned to some talk show with a male host juhle had no idea who the host was or why anyone would want to listen to him talk to his similarly unfamiliar female guest about the details of the two months shed apparently spent from what juhle could gather by halflistening confined in a basement as a sex slave for three teenage boys in upstate new york leesa moore was a wellpreserved sixtythreeyearold who had lived in this house for twentysix years the last five of them alone after her husband had died she was a retired schoolteacher who volunteered five mornings a week at a library branch in the marina especially this past summer she was saying it seemed the fighting was just about constant between stuart and caryn oh yes did you hear anything like a threat like what exactly like im going to kill you anything like that well no not specifically that but swearing a lot of swearing it surprised me coming from a doctor like she was and such a respected writer youd think hed have a better vocabulary but it was a lot of fthis and fthat and fyou im sure you can imagine yes maam juhle had used a few fthises in his life and thought there were worse crimes but he had his witness talking and wanted to keep her in the mood do you know if the argument had ever led to anything else not to my knowledge eyes on her television suddenly leesa moore came alive oh my god she said i dont believe it do you mind inspector for a minute she pointed over to the tv then reached and turned up the volume look at this theyve got the boys on the show too and it was true the host was explaining that theyd all been released from jail by now and were in their twenties the poor woman to whom this turn of events was evidently a surprise was stuck to her chair mouth agape between tears and hysteria the television audience was going wild thats got to be staged juhle said no no he does this kind of thing all the time its a great show juhle and his witness followed the action together on the screen after the woman had finally left her chair got her language beeped as she swore at the host and ran off the stage in tears leesa moore turned the volume down again to a conversational level and brought her attention back to the inspector im sorry where were we we were talking about if stuart and caryns yelling at one another had ever led to anything else something physical i mean and you said you didnt know about it if it had thats right she squinted in concentration finally reaching over again and turning the tv sound off entirely except oh wait maybe there was one time in the middle of last summer i dont know if it was because theyd had a fight or something but i got home from work and there was a police car parked in front of the house stuart and caryns house next door yes i stopped and stood by it for a minute wondering if i should knock and see what had happened and if there was anything i could do to help but in the end i just came home when i looked out laternot too much laterit was gone youre sure it had come to their house well no i wasnt at first although it was parked right in front of their place but after it was gone i called over there and asked stuart if everything was all right that id seen the police car and all and he said everything was fine that it had just been a misunderstanding a misunderstanding thats what he said about what did you ask him no he didnt seem anxious to talk very much about it did you ever notice any kind of marks on caryn a black eye anything like that she shook her head but i didnt see as much of her anyway so you never found out why the police car was there well not from them the answer seemed to embarrass her she went on have you talked to the sutcliffs yet the neighbors on the other side not yet well harrietmrs sutcliffshe was the one who had called the police she thought somebody was going to get killed over there q three two one case number this is inspector devin juhle badge the time is quarter after fifteen hundred hours on monday september th i am at a residence at greenwich street and speaking with a sixtyfouryearold caucasian woman who identifies herself as harriet sutcliff the owner of the residence mrs sutcliff i appreciate your agreeing to talk with me how long have you been neighbors with stuart and caryn gorman a since they moved in here that was i guess fifteen or so years ago q did you find them to be good neighbors a yes at first we liked them very much especially artmy husbandwhen he found out that stuart wrote those flyfishing books arts a fisherman himself so it was really exciting for him getting to know a celebrity like that but the last couple of years we havent seen too much of them q and why is that a it just seemed that they changed first they seemed to stop doing social things together and certainly with us stuart would still come by sometimes and talk to art but we almost never saw them together anymore and then by the summer they seemed to just be fighting all the time q you heard them fighting a yes q just words or more than that a more id say q like what a well i definitely heard some things breaking over there as though they were thrown it was hard not to hear when that happened and then one day last summer i didnt want to but i felt i had to call the police i thought somebody was going to get hurt q and so you did in fact call the police a yes and a car came it stayed a short while but i dont think anything ever came of that and since then i havent talked to either stuart or caryn very much i think they must have figured out that id been the one that called and they were mad at me q did there continue to be fights after that one a a couple i think but none so bad q did you hear anything like a fight last night over there a no weart and iwe went to a movie and got back about ten thirty and it was all quiet over there dark and we were asleep by the time stuart got home q by the time stuart got home a right q and what time was that a i dont know exactly i gather pretty late q you mean this morning a no i dont think so i believe he got home last night q why do you believe that if you were asleep and didnt hear him a well i didnt see it myself but because thats what bethany said there was a bunch of us from the block that gathered at the corner this morning we didnt know what else to do so we were all standing there waiting for someone to tell us what had happened although we knew it was probably bad with all the police and everything q im sorry mrs sutcliff can we go back to bethany for a minute bethany is who a bethany robley she lives across the street that stucco place right there two houses up she and kymberly know each other q and bethany told you that stuart came home last night a thats what she said she said it was around eleven thirty q why did she think that a i got the impression that she saw him her bedrooms right in that upstairs front window you can see it from here see i cant believe he actually killed her though i guess somebody must have he really seems like such a nice man q well thats still kind of an open question the door at the stucco house across the street opened to a heavyset grayhaired african american woman in a brown jogging outfit yes can i help you introducing himself juhle had his badge out and held it up in his wallet is this the home of bethany robley it is id like to ask her a few questions if you dont mind maybe i do im her mother whats this about whats she done shes done nothing maam its about your neighbors across the street there the gormans you may have heard that mrs gorman died this morning there wasnt any mrs gorman there was dr dryden caryn married to stuart if thats who you mean mrs robley had her arms crossed and stepping forward she completely blocked the door and thats got nothing to do with my daughter she had nothing to do with them i understand she was a friend of kymberlys their daughter okay that they know each other all right but kyms gone up to school and she hasnt been over there since behind mrs robley juhle heard a younger voice its okay mom i can talk to him not unless i say so you cant the mother came back at juhle holding her daughter back with an extended palm are we going to be wanting a lawyer here inspector you think my little girl had anything at all to do with caryns dying ive got no reason to think that maam id just like to ask her a couple of questions about what if anything she might have seen last night from her window and thats all thats all promise the mother half turned and juhle caught a glimpse of a young woman of about his own height she was wearing a galileo high sweatshirt a short black skirt white tennis shoes im gonna be with you the whole time mrs robley said fine with me a few seconds passed and then the large woman sighed and moved to the side to let her daughter come forward bethany stepped up into the doorwaya clear wide forehead and a solemn expression on her face a keen intelligence seemed to emanate from a penetrating gaze out of deeply set eyes to juhle she looked far too serious for a young woman of her age she could easily have passed for twentyfive and juhle immediately recognized a key truth if bethany was going to be one of his witnessesand he thought that was a reasonable likelihood at this stagehe couldnt have asked for a better one i wont take up much of your time he began he looked behind bethany to her mother held up his tiny tape recorder id like to record what we say here he shrugged apologetically its just that i dont take really good notes and i want to make sure ive got it exactly right is that all right with you mrs robley ask my daughter bethany shrugged with a slight awkwardness thats okay i guess thank you juhle quickly dictated his standard intro into the device then came back to his subject well bethany i was just over at mrs sutcliffs house talking to her and she told me that you were one of the people with her standing on the corner this morning when i pulled up do you remember that sure well shemrs sutcliff i meanshe told me that you said you saw mr gorman get home last night is that true yes do you happen to remember roughly what time that was actually i remember exactly he got home at eleven thirty thats my lightsout time on a school night and i was just finishing at my desk when i saw him turn into the driveway and wheres your desk just under the window there that looks down on the street juhle paused to consider his next question and youre sure it was mr gorman did you see him get out of the car no but it must have been him he opened the garage automatically and went inside then closed it behind him so i never saw him but it was his car you know his car on sight her lip curled downward the question apparently striking her as insulting sure ive gone skiing in it with kym maybe ten times so yes i know the car i didnt mean any offense juhle said i guess im just asking how sure you are what that it was stuart i dont know i told you i didnt see him but if he was driving his car it was him because that was his car and how did you know that i dont know i just knew mrs robley decided to put in her two cents she knows what she knows inspector shes not lying to you of course not theres no question of that juhle spoke matteroffactly to bethany im sorry if i sound critical thats not my intention im just trying to make sure of what youre saying so now getting back to stuart you watched him pull his car into his garage across the street and then close the garage door behind him no again the question seemed to frustrate her look im sure no i just saw him pull up and im like oh stuarts getting home and then went over and got in bed i didnt think anything about it except that i noticed it the end and i didnt sit at the window and watch until he closed the garage door behind him why would i do that it wasnt all that interesting dull though the rest of my life might be juhle hesitated a fragment of a barely remembered something nagging at him but i believe you said can you give me just a second sure more if you need he thanked her then walked a few steps down to the sidewalk and rewound the tape recorder in a minute he was back up at the door with bethany here he said listen to this when he pushed the recorders play button they heard her voice saying no he opened the garage automatically and went inside then closed it behind him so i never saw him but it was his car see he said you hear it what you say then closed it behind him which you just said you didnt see him do i didnt see him close it i mean well which is it it was closed okay juhle rubbed away the crease in his forehead he killed another few seconds fastforwarding his tape recorder to the end again and turned it back to record then he said excuse me bethany for being so dumb but then how did you know it was closed behind him if you didnt see him close it for a brief moment the question seemed to stump her her normally grave expression turned to a look of neardespair before she suddenly broke into a surprisingly quite lovely smile because i saw him open it later she said so it had to be closed you saw him open it when was this twelve fortyfive pretty much exactly again she brought her shoulders up in a shrug i had insomnia i always have insomnia i hate it but then i had to get up and go to the bathroom and i noticed it had been an hour and fifteen minutes already that id been awake which made me start freaking out about how tired id be for school today she let out a heavy sigh and which i am was god so what happened you looked out the window and and stuart was backing out again backing out at quarter to one in the morning i know i thought that was a little weird too but really i wasnt thinking too much about him or anything else except getting some sleep stifling a sudden yawn she smiled again sorry just talking about it sometimes you know i hear you but i noticed you called mr gorman stuart do you know him well not well no but hes kyms dad i know him okay he doesnt like to be called mr gorman and you and kym are friends well kind of shes a little up and down you know hyper up and then kind of a drag down and lately not so much actual friends i mean except we ski together sometimes anyway weve known each other since fourth grade she brought a finger to her mouth and chewed the end of it this is going to kill her were she and her mom close no i mean her dad what about her dad well you just said what you were investigating i mean if he killed her i didnt say that bethany we dont have any one suspect right now but youre saying kymberly and her mom didnt get along the girl shrugged her mom was pretty busy most of the time reaching back she touched her own mothers hand briefly then came back to juhle caryn wasnt really that bad did people say she was bethany shrugged sometimes the two of themstuart and kymtheyd be a little sarcastic but they both loved her i think you dont think stuart killed her do you i cant believe hed do anything like that juhle kept it matteroffact im just talking to people bethany trying to get to what happened i might have to talk to you again would that be all right sure i guess juhle peeked around behind her mrs robley if its okay with her all right then thank you both for your time eight stuart was standing by the couch stretching he and gina had been going over issues for the past couple of hours when suddenly hed become aware of the time and jumped up well he was saying whether or not we hit most of it ive got to get going if i want to be on time for kym and i do if juhle calls you maybe you can just set up a time we can all talk but not tonight okay please my girls going to need me thats the most important thing right now sure of course gina had pulled her heavy satchel over in front of her and dropped her wellused legal pad into one of its sections well just stay in waitandsee mode until we hear from juhle if he calls me tonight ill tell him you need time with your daughter and ask if we can set up a time tomorrow or the next day you think he will call you tonight maybe not unless theres been some break in the case we dont know about either way ill try to check in with him again get some sense of things she looked up at him are you sure youre all right he shook his head weariness now all over him just thinking about kym staring into empty space across the room he blinked rapidly a few times and caryn shes really gone isnt she im afraid so squeezing at his temples he sighed deeply then looked across at her jesus what a waste what an unbelievable colossal fucking waste the travelodge was barely a mile from ginas condominium most of it was uphill true but to ginas mind that just made it a better exercise opportunity so after she told stuart that he should go on ahead that shed let herself out and get the door she waited until hed gone then took off her black pumps dropped them into the satchel and replaced them with the pair of tennis shoes that she always carried in her bag outside the evening was still warm although the ocean breeze had increased enough to stir up the occasional wisp of dust or debris in the gutters gina walked with an athletic ease her satchel converted to a backpack ahead of her across van ness avenue the street began its steep climb that summitted at the oftphotographed view of lombard as the crookedest street in the world when she got to the top gina was breathing hard good thats what exercise wasbreathing hard she stopped a minute to take in the view in front of her down in the valley north beach the towers of sts peter and paul church and a slice of fishermans wharf with telegraph hill and coit tower beyond them behind her the golden gate bridge the presidio and from this height the glint of the sun off the pacific ocean on the horizon as well she was aware of course that on a lot of days and nightsmaybe even most of themthe fog could be so thick here that you couldnt see your hand in front of your face but when the place conspired with the weather at a moment like this gina thought a person could live here for a hundred years and still not grow tired of it by the time she got home down and up another hill and fifteen minutes later she was ready for a shower and when that was done she put on some jeans and a pullover and went into her living room like the rest of the condo it was only as big as it needed to be but very well appointed in an eclectic comfortable style a couch with a matching loveseat diagonally faced the brick fireplace with a navajo rug in front of it a pair of reading chairsshe had bought the second for davidbracketed the large front window builtin bookshelves rose to greet a tenfoot ceiling on both sides of the fireplace now she went to the wellstocked mirrorbacked wet bar in the back corner of the room and took a very small fourounce plain leaded crystal glass off the shelf david had given her a set of four of these and she loved the feel and the look of them pouring an inch of oban neat she crossed to her reading chair where she set the drink on the chinese lacquered side table and picked up the notes she took when shed talked to stuart caryn dryden it turned out had lived a very full and complicated life replete with personal and medical interactions investment schemes research opportunities and business connections stuart didnt know the details of most of it but hed done the best he could filling gina in after shed finally convinced him that if someone had in fact killed his wife it probably hadnt been random apparently there were two unrelated areas of activity that had consumed his wifes time and energy in recent months the first was that she had been within a couple of months of opening a new independent practice with a fellow orthopedic surgeon robert mcafee the plans had been in the works for the better part of two years but stuart had picked up that something had changed in the past couple of monthshe thought she might have been trying to bring in a third partner shed complained that she was short of cash and evidently this third guy could bridge or mitigate the shortfall but mcafee hadnt been happy wasnt happy hed been calling her day and night for the past month threatening to pull out of the deal but was already so financially committed that that would have been suicide gina sipped her oban and went on to read over her notes on stuarts comments when shed asked him why or how caryn had run short of money how did that happen if she was the money wizard who brought in the big bucks it was because stuart said she was planning on making even more of the big bucks huge bucks fuckyou money she had called it caryn had been involved for several years in the development and then the clinical trials for a new replacement hip the dryden socket which degraded at a much slower rate than the current stateoftheart hip the device was evidently very close to full fda approval and when approved it promised to make gazillionaires out of all of its early investors of whom caryn had not only been one but the inventor as well apparently this investment too had run into some kind of lastminute financial difficulties the investment groups banker had come back to the original investors and offered something called mezzanine loans to hold the company over until government approval stuart didnt know what mezzanine loans were but gina did very high risk and very short term they were a common feature of a lot of deals that were close to viable but needed additional capital while the business geared up to profitability caryn had plunked more than two million dollars in cash into a mezzanine loan for the dryden socket within the past six months thereby leaving herself short on her new practice offices when there were the inevitable and unavoidable delays in construction and startup now stuart had said with caryns death mcafees ass was saved since caryn had been well insured on the project but the dryden socket was apparently still having some problemsserious enough that caryn had called jedd conleys office to look into them although what jedd had had to do with it was a mystery to stuart outside it had come to dusk gina finished her reading and her drink at the same time and sat back in her chair to consider what she thought she now knew listening to stuarts recounting of the labyrinthine convolutions of caryns business life she had by now concluded that murder and neither accident nor suicide was going to be a good bet in this case add to that devin juhles comment at lunch that caryn probably wouldnt be naked in a hot tub thinking her husband was gone for the weekend having a glass of wine with somebody she didnt know and the bet became a near certainty andthe thought brought gina up in her chairif caryn had told stuart she wanted a divorce on friday would she have been naked in the hot tub with him or maybe shed just been alone relaxing and hed unexpectedly come home but he hadnt gotten home until this morning he had that gas station receipt to prove it and having talked to stuart all afternoon gina didnt think that he had paid someone else to kill his wife all of which didnt mean he still couldnt be the target of a major investigation but at least it did not appear that her client was guilty at this early stage that was about the best she could hope for feeling good about the way things were going she decided what the hell shed pour herself another small drink live a little she was back in the game with that rara avis the innocent client this was going to be fun here is the fundamental irony of the wilderness experience its principal lesson is that we are not alone i am standing in the middle of a stream at the hour when the sun begins to clear the ridge out to the east the shadow of the mountain recedes and reveals a world of vibrant color beyond gray of rock and indigo sky suddenly the field explodes into wildflowersyellows and greens reds and pinks and blues and whites a movement out of the corner of my eye turns out to be a buff coyote stalking prey downstream a deer stops for a drink a jackrabbit breaks from its cover overhead a hawk circles in a rising thermal on the water the hatch begins and the air above the stream fills with clouds of mayfly or caddis or mosquito i cast and a trout strikes there are no other humans in sight from the direct evidence of my senses there may be none on the planet and yet my state of being is suffused with a sense of belonging in this place at this time i am in the midst of the dream of the buddhist who requesting a hamburger says make me one with everything one with everything it is singular that this experience of a healing solitude without any sense of loneliness occurs for me only in the wilderness perhaps it is because there are so few of the expectations of others to accommodate here i am responsible only to myself only for my survival a day or two out of the blandishments and distractions of daily lifeaway from the traffic and the small talk and the advertisements away from the constant assault of vulgar and voracious media of all kindsand i become increasingly aware of a deep sensory awareness that roots me to the here and now in a profound and fundamental way i am connected to the earth and always immediately to the present i am an animal both prey and predator keenly tuned i have no one to convince there are no complaints the interruptions are natural the fish leaps high in a flash of color splashes back into its pool begins a run that strips line and bends the rod my concentration is absolute the least slack in the line and the trout will throw the tiny barbless hook and i will have lost my breakfast because make no mistake if i manage to land it i will eat this fish my appetites out here are simple and attainable i dont need a raise new clothes gifts money can have no possible meaning my music is in the stream in the breeze the crackle of a fire the beat of my heart i am empty of worry and in this natural state ironically enough i get the closest to a feeling of identity with my fellow man this is the essence and i am part of it in her reading chair by the front window gina put down the copy of stuart gormans healed by water that shed picked up at book passage after her dinner alone at the ferry building to her surprise she liked the book a lot stuart had absolutely nailed ginas own feelings about the outdoors and the wildernessthat these things had been her salvation solitude without loneliness that was exactly what she felt when she went up to the mountains her eyes covered the familiar terrain of her living room just after david had died it had felt as though he had somehow imprinted himself on every object herethe books his chair of course the bar and its glassware the loveseatand his connection to these things had made her loneliness almost unbearable up in the wilderness there was nothing reaching out to snag her emotions and remind her of what was gone time she spent away from all of this this stuff lessened its painful hold upon her until finally she realized that its ability to cause her anguish was all but gone shed needed the wilderness to get to that point shed needed the long hiking days and the deep empty nights for their solitude that seemed to lift the burden of the loneliness that adhered to all these familiar things in the city getting up and walking over to the kitchen she pulled a card from her purse and picked up the telephone hoping perhaps to talk to stuart about how hed come to understand all of that what had happened to him that had driven him outdoors how she wondered had they sat together for most of the afternoon and had none of this even remotely come up but halfway through the phone number she stopped and hung the phone back up she recalled that he was going to be with his daughter tonight trying to make sense of what had befallen them calling him now would be an imposition back in the living room settling back in her chair she pulled the book over to her opening it again to her place and then the telephone rang gina roake please this is gina devin juhle i hope you dont mind my calling you at home i wouldnt have given you the number if i did but youre working some long hours inspector im gathering you got my message about stuart gorman i did he hesitated that was a pretty quick hookup getting him on board as your client i mean after our lunch today this was gratuitous and gina supposed she should have expected it in any event she wasnt going to dignify the unspoken accusation that shed called stuart as a result of what juhle had told her at lou the greeks she hadnt called him at all but shed let juhle think what he wanted since thats what he was going to do in any case yes she said the stars lined up just right on that one i assume youre calling to set up an appointment im going to want to talk to him yes sooner rather than later do you consider him a suspect a person of interest at this time you know about his alibi i know what hes said yes and you dont believe him id like to go over some details hes mentioned thats all well of course hes still upset if you tell me what you need to know id be happy to get the information for you i think id rather get it from him directly you dont want to give me a little hint about what this is about just making sure i get the story straight plug up any holes this sounded ominous to gina until this moment she had been unaware that there was enough of a case for there to be any holes gina knew how dangerous it was to have stuart talk to the police again if he said the wrong thing or maybe even the right thing in the wrong way she could watch him walk out of her office in handcuffs she knew that many of her colleagues would be appalled by the idea that shed let her client talk to the cops but she still hoped she could deflect this investigation maybe even avoid an arrest altogether if they continued to cooperate juhle already had the most damaging parts on tape and shed be sitting right there if things got ugly it was a calculated risk and she figured that she had to try i could call him and set something up for tomorrow at my office say ten oclock if you dont hear back from me i was thinking you both might want to come down to the hall and talk there now ginas alarm bells started to go off the hall of justice meant a cold and threatening interrogation room off the homicide detail with both audio and videotape running but again protocol and strategy demanded that she remain cool i think wed all be more comfortable in my office inspector she said of course youd be welcome to record the interview or even videotape it provided i get a copy immediately youre not planning to arrest mr gorman i hope i havent applied for a warrant no you and i both know you dont need a warrant to arrest him my question is are you planning to do that or not im trying to keep my options open ive got to talk to your client and i want it all by the book and on the record which means youre there with us ten oclock will be fine at your place if i dont hear back from you all right ill see you there nine with a porcelain saucer resting on the arm of his chair in dismas hardys office wyatt hunt sat back comfortably and sipped from his cup of freshly brewed coffee it was tuesday morning about a half hour before the offices officially opened in spite of that in the space behind them a dozen or more employees had already started their workday hardys office door was still open and outside from the lobby came the sounds of phones ringing xerox machines humming random bits of conversation they were waiting for gina across from hunt by the wellequipped coffee counter hardy finished pouring his own cup and turned around so when you talked to juhle you didnt let on you were working for us i dont believe it came up specifically hunt sipped again broke a grin besides i thought it might make for a stilted conversation he asked if id seen gina and i told him not since lunch which was technically true its not my fault he didnt ask if id talked to her and he seemed to be in the moodhed been on gorman all day and had nobody to talk to about it this will shock you but it seems his wife sometimes gets a little tired of cop talk at home how could that possibly be i know hunt said weird but there you go anyway he really wanted to tell somebody about everything hed found out and i happened to call lucky break for the good guys thats what i thought maybe not so lucky for the client though unless you consider an eyewitness lucky sometimes it can be im pretty sure this isnt one of those times diz hunt glanced toward the door ah the woman of the hour gina stopped in the doorway sorry im late guys working the bugs out of what may be the new work schedule hardy checked his watch ive got eight oclock straight up so youre on the dot you want coffee as the predator wants the night hardy gave her a look and said thatd be black no sugar sorry gina said ive been reading my client the style rubs off sugar please how do you like him hunt asked as a writer i mean hes okay he says some good stuff kept me up till midnight last night so i couldve called you hunt said after my talk with juhle hardy handed her a cup and she turned to wyatt so you got to him what did he have to say i was just starting to tell diz he thinks hes got a case with stuart hows he getting around the alibi hardy had crossed the room and propped himself against his cherry desk now he put in his two cents worth wyatt was just telling me about an eyewitness gina slumped into a chair to what the killing he couldnt have killed her he wasnt there well hunt said that may be a question he placed his cup in his saucer and came forward on his chair seems a neighborhood girllives right across the street friends with his daughtershe saw him pull into his garage sunday night then leave a couple of hours later she saw him thats what juhle says his car which was it him or his car hunt looked the question over to hardy who said who else would have been in his car gina hunt picked it up his story doesnt have anybody else driving his car does it gina sat back in her chair shit yes maam hunt said and thats not including a few other things devin kind of wanted to brag about im listening gina said two domestic disturbance calls two hunt nodded one this summer and when juhle ran it down on the computer he got another hit about five years ago your new client got himself arrested on that second one he told me theyd never had a physical fight i asked him specifically at his desk hardy frowned and crossed his arms over his chest maybe he forgot did he also forget to mention the ticket he got last friday night gina was sitting all the way back now legs crossed friday night she asked another nod from hunt driving up to echo lake got pulled over by the highway patrol juhle found the officer and talked to him hes been busy gina said hunt agreed he thinks hes got a big live one they dont come around every day so whatd the officer say he remembered him oh yeah no problem with that he recognized the name hes a fan too of stuarts writing which is why he didnt arrest him oh lord gina shook her head in disbelief what was he going to arrest him for he told juhle he would have thought of something disturbing the peace resisting arrest threatening a police officer he threatened him he swore at him close enough for most cops but heres the bad part that wasnt it well you decide after the guy the officer recognized who stuart was he calmed down a little and told him about the awful fight hed just had with his wife that shed told him she wanted to leave him he told the guy he was heading up to the mountains because if he would have stayed down with her he would have killed her those words gina asked according to dev pretty much verbatim hunt said hardy broke in again and this guy stuart your client gina hes coming up here when gina looked at her watch about an hour juhles coming around at ten did inspector juhle mention anything about handcuffs hardy asked last night he said he hadnt applied for a warrant ginas face was pure disgust devin say anything about an arrest to you wyatt no he wants more evidence apparently there are other issues a question oh nothing important gina said with heavy sarcasm only a threemilliondollar insurance policy several more millions that hes going to get control over to say nothing of a possible love affair with his dead wifes sister youre kidding about that last one right hunt said she leveled her gaze at him well he denied it and judging from what ive just learned since i got here this morning that means it must be true when phyllis buzzed into ginas office and said that her client was out in the lobby gina said shed be right out but she didnt move right away for the past quarter of an hour ever since shed come down from hardys office shed been sitting as far down as she could get in her deepest stuffed chair like wes farrell upstairs she had no formal desk in her corner office so she sat with her hands clasped tightly in front of her trying to come to grips with the veritable tsunami of rage that had unexpectedly enveloped her in the wake of wyatt hunts disclosures about her client and his rapidly deteriorating story she looked down at her hands all of her knuckles were white her joints stiff as she separated her hands and forced her fingers open she brought her hands up to her face pulled down on her cheeks finally taking a deep breath she whispered all right and pushed herself up from her chair oddly aware of her own crisp and echoing footfalls as she walked down the long hallway to the receptionists station gina got to the lobby and pasted the semblance of a smile onto her face as she approached stuart with her hand outstretched good morning she chirruped falsely bright and right on time aiming to please he said in his awshucks delivery though it seemed to cost him stuart had shaved combed his hair and put on nicer clothesslacks and a pulloverbut he looked if anything more ravaged than he had the day before blearyeyed and sallow complected the police show up yet not for a while if you want to follow me back this way she wanted to avoid idle chitchat so she turned and started walking they reached her office and she preceded him through the door and crossed over to the ergonomic chair by the library table on which she kept her computer sitting down she whirled around to face him he was standing a couple of steps inside the room hands in his pockets reminding her of nothing so much as a dog waiting to be told what to do she obliged him you want to get the door that done he turned back to the room anywhere he asked she waved her hand wherever it doesnt matter he chose the couch perhaps because it was facing her sitting back ankle on opposite knee he stretched his left arm out along the cushions and leaned back so he said so gina wasnt tempted to give him any help but she waited for a long beat and when nothing came from him she relented whatever he had actually doneand she was furious with him over what that might have beenhe was the man shed been reading last night who had stirred something in her soul you tired she asked you look tired his shoulders heaved as though the question were funny but there was no humor in the eyes i take a week off and sleep around the clock i might get back to tired but thats not looking too likely is it not with inspector juhle on his way down here not very no you want some coffee he shook his head im already three cups down any more and id float away anyway its nothing coffee would help thinking that this might be an opening of some kind maybe even a confession gina said so what is it he exhaled heavily and shook his head the picture of frustration kym he said my daughter our daughter he met ginas gaze you have kids no dont then gina gave a mirthless chuckle its a little late in any event theyre not on the agenda i wouldnt worry shes taking this pretty hard is she stuart pinched the bridge of his nose i dont know what to do with her i dont know what to do looking up he said its knocked her off the rails another sigh she and caryn had some issues they hadnt worked out and now of course they never will when she left for college it wasnt very pretty between them thats not making it any easier on her now no i dont suppose it is where is she now i left her back at the hotel she cried all night and finally crashed sometime around six this morning so i thought id just let her sleep she ought to be all right for a few hours anyway he hesitated debra came by early just in case and said shed stay until kym woke up and be there for her but this is killing kym i dont know what shes going to do i dont know what im going to do with her gina decided to douse him with a little reality stuart she said did you tell her that youre under suspicion here he couldnt have looked more startled if shed slapped him though he recovered quickly after you called me last night i told her i was meeting you to talk with the cops today so she knows as far as it goes which isnt very far today ought to be the end of it right gina was tempted to ask him if he was joking with her but she kept it straight frankly no stuart i dont think todays going to be the end of it there have been a few developments bethany said she saw me how could she have seen me she said she saw your car she saw me pull into my garage yes then leave a couple of hours later so she saw caryns killer come and then go that would be inspector juhles assumption i believe and he came in your car no he didnt not possible deep inside gina was somewhat heartened by the unequivocal denial either stuart was an extraordinarily good liar or he was telling the truth okay leaving the car for a minute lets talk about you and your wife not fighting specifically about you never having hit her okay forward now on the couch stuarts blood was up what about never dont you get i guess the part about the domestic disturbance call to the police last summer stuart grimaced they found that already thats one question a better one is what about it and as for them finding out about it already i told you yesterday that theyre going to find out everything about you every little thing youve ever done and theyre going to drag it in front of the whole world so its way to your advantage to come out with it right up frontanything thats going to look bad when they bring it up later like for example hitting your wife the little tirade found its mark stuart shifted defensively back on the couchlegs crossed arm out along the cushions stalling for time while he decided what he was going to say when he made the decision he kept it simple i never hit her she hit you no but the cops came my busybody neighbor called them a pause there might have been some noise i did tell you wed had some arguments so you had this one time last summer when the police came and left they just wanted to make sure nobody was hurt he shrugged nobody was they went away end of story gina stared at him her face set okay and thats it what do you mean i mean is there anything else you think might be relevant to inspector juhles ongoing investigation of you stuart that your lawyer if she wanted to protect you might need to know ginas tone had by degrees become more confrontational now she glared expectantly across the room and watched her client pretend to think until she could stand it no more you need a hint she snapped i could give you a hint he sat there frowning let me ask you something why are you being so hostile all of a sudden he asked whats that about gina couldnt come up with an answer right away she sat back in her chair gathering herself for a moment before she finally said i read one of your books last night the whole thing in one sitting yes healed by water i liked it a lot stuarts mouth turned up at the corners i didnt realize you knew that i wrote books im your lawyer gina said i know everything get used to it and thats whats bothering you that you liked my book not exactly she said evenly but since you asked im mad if your beautiful book conned me and youre really guilty i feel personally abused when i find out an eyewitness saw your car coming and going just about when caryn was killed i cant figure out why youve got all these anger issues when you write about such spiritual holistic stuff im really pissed off if youre in fact sleeping with your wifes sister im furious if youre as good a liar as you are a writer im confused about your lack of reaction to your wifes death im baffled and confused by cops coming to break up fights at your house when you say youve never hit your wife is that enough i can explain not just yet please her jaw jutted so yes i think we can say that something is bothering me that im a little bit hostile and while im on it im not in the habit of letting myself get fooled by men i had a damn fine man for a good while there and i got used to it so im afraid my guard might be down and that makes me mad too hows all that i didnt kill caryn right okay youve said that thank you you dont believe me she shrugged suddenly and very much to her own surprise she slammed her palm flat down on her computer tablea shockingly loud report almost like a pistol shot in the closedup room jesus fucking christ stuart do you think this is some kind of game or what do you have any idea of how much trouble youre in right now you dont think it matters somehow that i dont need to know that you got yourself arrested for domestic violence five years ago or that you threatened a highway patrol officer last friday night just before you told him you were getting out of the house so you wouldnt kill your wife what are you thinking this is serious shit and you are hip deep in it but how did they finally the last of her reserve broke and she was on her feet shed made no plan for itit wasnt part of her usual repertoire or strategy but she was yelling at him goddammit stuart it never happened is not the same thing as they wont find out because they always find out what have i been telling you it all comes out always thats the way it works hovering over him she straightened then whirled and crossed over to one of the windows she parted the blinds though she wasnt really looking out at anything gina had to get her anger under control letting out a breath slowly she closed her eyes concentrated on the beat of her heart when she looked over at him again stuart was forward on the couch his elbows on his knees looking at her as though he were pleading for somethingand maybe he was she summoned what calm she could and turned to face him im sorry i raised my voice that was unprofessional i apologize he made some conciliatory gesture its all right people get mad she nodded yes she said they do gina crossed all the way back to where he sat and lowered herself onto the opposite end of the couch she glanced at her watch then over to him when she spoke all the fight was out of her voice all right stuart she said inspector juhles going to be here in no time do you want to tell me about the first domestic disturbance call the one five years ago he was facing her face drawn and pale the fatigue around his eyes almost painful to see it was just another fight the first bad one really he lowered his voice ducked his head away from the admission i guess some dishes got thrown one of them cut her a little she was bleeding when the cops came thats your version so whats the police report going to say stuart whats the version the cops got he inclined his head an inch i dont know i never saw any report im not sure what caryn told them but they took you downtown yeah then caryn came down and eventually they let me go back home with her i took some anger management classes the problem went away until last summer perhaps embarrassed he looked down shrugged i never did hit her not last summer not before never okay gina was fairly sure that the distinction between stuart hitting his wife and throwing a plate at her would not make much of a difference to a jury if it came to him being in front of one but if the exact type of domestic violence hed committed mattered to stuart shed let him live with his own conscience for the time being at least so what about this highway patrol guy she asked did you threaten him no i was pissed off getting pulled over a selfdeprecating halfsmile that anger thing again i know every other driver on the road was speeding and he pulls up behind me so i mentioned that minor point when he got to the window probably i could have phrased it better okay but i didnt threaten him i gave the guy my autograph at the end so how bad could it have been he leaned in toward her gina listen ive got a temper okay i work on it living with my two girls could try the patience of a saint but the way i deal with it is to get away when i can im not a violent guy and i didnt kill caryn and thats gods truth itd do wonders for my peace of mind if i thought my own attorney believed me at least she just stared at him unable and in any event unwilling to give him even a small part of what he wanted from her the truth was that stuarts peace of mind was about the last thing she cared about at this moment there were much more pressing issues than her clients tender feelings and they were rushing at her from all directions finally she checked her watch crossed her legs and sat back weve got forty more minutes stuart before juhle gets here weve got a lot of ground to cover and wed better get to it you ready to tell me something i dont already know after the interview when juhle and stuart had both gone gina thought the knock on her door was probably stuart coming back to fire her or more specifically to rescind her hiring she wouldnt blame him if he didnt want to work with her after her attitude today although he would need some lawyer that was for sure the interview theyd just had with juhle should have removed any of stuarts doubts that his wife had been murdered and that he was the prime suspect or maybe in the ten minutes since hed left ginas office hed had a chance to think about it and decided he didnt want to fork over her retainer of sixtyfive thousand dollars in cash this was a serious hunk of change other lawyers were both cheaper and less hostile and maybe hed decided to hire one of them she almost hoped that he had she walked to the door and opened it her game face on her two partners were standing in the hallway dismas hardy said no arrest gina nodded no arrest hardy broke a grin and halfturned to farrell his hand out ten bucks he said i cant understand it gina said they had all come into her office hardy and farrell were on the couch where stuart had been sitting gina in her deep chair if i were juhle id have arrested him he cant need much more no hardy agreed but its cleaner if he gets an indictment first and lets remember that next tuesday is grand jury day my guess is hes taking what he got here downtown and sharing it with the da even as we speak see if the grand jury is going to think its enough but he might even take another week or two eliminating other suspects case with this profile hes going to want to get it right before it cranks up farrell had slumped to nearly horizontal and had his feet up on the coffee table underneath he was certainly sporting one of his trademark tshirts but to the casual eye he was dressed like a working attorneycharcoal suit and maroon tie but whenever the arrest goes down stuart is signed on with us i gave him the papers to take home and look over gina said i absolutely lowballed him at sixtyfive and still i think even that money struck him as large if i had to bet id say hes in but after juhle finished we didnt talk too much more stuart wanted to get back to his daughter who is evidently pretty destroyed by all this as who wouldnt be hardy said gina shrugged well apparently stuart himself she glanced at farrell ive seen people more torn up over the death of their dogs hey farrell jumped bart wasnt a dog he was a person gina gave him a tolerant smile my point exactly how old is she hardy asked the daughter eighteen just started college up in oregon was fighting with her mother when she left and hadnt patched it up theres thirty happy years of therapy farrell said and thats if her dad didnt do it this time he threw a quick glance at gina and thats if her dad didnt do it he repeated gina returned his look with one of her own i think in his own subtle way hardy put in wes is asking how youre feeling about your clients chances not exactly diz farrell pulled himself up to something resembling a normal posture turned slightly to face gina headon im asking if your gut is telling you hes guilty or not ginas face grew pensive my brain the jurys still way out its too early farrell pressed i didnt say brain no i know she paused for a moment took a small breath i guess at this point my gut wants to believe he didnt do it farrell looked over to hardy told you and gina went on now youre going to tell me how stupid and dangerous that is which im aware of so she addressed both of her partners what am i supposed to do then not defend him no wes said not believe him i dont believe him or not believe him wes i said that in my brain the jury is still out its just the old sentimental slob in me wants to believe that sometimes men who are accused of killing their wives didnt do it and especially men who write beautiful books about the wilderness and other issues close to my own heart wes whose own early legal career had been transformed by an extremely highprofile case where hed won an acquittal for a friend and colleague whose protestations of innocence hed believed and whod turned out to be guilty shook his head sadly some people think the marquis de sade wrote beautiful books too he said hardy reached out and put a quick restraining hand on farrells knee she gets it wes really then to gina he doesnt want anybody to have to go through what he did hes just trying to be protective physically gina roake was probably the strongest woman she knew three years before she had shot and killed a man in a gunfight now her stare had hardened i dont need to be protected she said you both should know that by now thats not the kind of protection im talking about farrell said im just telling you that if this goes to a full murder one trial its going to be your life for the next year or more youre going to start to care about this guy whether or not hes guilty and im just giving you some friendly advice based on my own experience that you might feel better when its over if you decide right at the beginning that he did it and work on that assumption ive never defended an innocent client in my life wes im down with the drill good farrell got himself upright then theres nothing to worry about and diz and i are off to a gala luncheon at lous would you care to join us gina shook her head i just ate there yesterday once a week is my limit what are you doing when right now nothing i just woke up from a nap did you hear again from juhle not yet which we can take as a good sign actually i was just looking at an old aarp magazine somebody left here in the room taking a quiz on how much i know about michael douglas howre you doing on it not too good hes not married to annette bening nope thats warren beatty michael douglas is catherine zetajones get out of here he doesnt look anything like her his wife stuart his wife is catherine zetajones i knew what you were saying but then whos his famous father heres a hint same last name i dont know john peter toby ryan the famous toby douglas stephen isnt there a stephen douglas he debated lincoln so thats not it how about kirk kirk douglas hes not old enough to be michaels father is he must be since he is or was any more michael douglas questions you didnt get costar in his first hit movie i dont even know the movie romancing the stone kathleen turner was the costar man do you know this much about the law at least possibly more some of it in latin even okay then im starting to feel better about you being my lawyer thanks so much gina said is kym with you no okay what about debra what about her i asked first she went home after lunch when i said i needed to get some sleep you get enough couple of hours at least so ill make it through till tonight so you want to go out what do you mean i mean leave your room get some air take a walk i could be there in fifteen minutes and do what talk about what more of all this basically you caryn stuff havent we done enough of that today already frankly not even close id want to be back here for when kym gets back that ought to be possible you know for a guy whos doing nothing anyway youre making this decision harder than it has to be im talking a walk a chat we go wild maybe a latte low risk you can be here in fifteen minutes or less all right ill be ready the two girls used to do a lot of things together but theyd drifted apart in the past couple of years bethany a highly strung overachiever found that she didnt have the energy after her homework and other activities to keep up with kymberly and her extreme mood swings when kymberly was down in the dumps she was a total drag often even talking about suicide and then nodding off if they were trying to do quieter things together such as studying or baking cookies or just hanging out on the other hand when she was happy she was recklessly crazy invincible and immortal and this was even harder to takestealing things making out with guys she didnt even know doing drugs it got so that the only times they could get along easily was when they both were on a hill skiing or boarding and even then it was usually stuarts presence with them that had made them comfortable he was daredevil enough for his daughter and controlled enough for bethany when the three of them were together there was lots of action but hed draw the line when kymberly wanted them all to say ski off a cliff but by now even those good times were a couple of years in the past so bethany was a bit surprised when kymberly found her on campus at galileo high school during lunchtime just walked up to her as she was talking to some of her friends hey can we talk a minute oh god kymberly sure i im so sorry about your mom yeah she was more nicely dressed than bethany had seen her in a long time although the expression on her face was strangely vacant but then bethany reminded herself shed just lost her mother the two of them moved away from the other kids over to a corner of the courtyard after they sat down on one of the benches against the building neither of them talked immediately then finally bethany said are you okay not really its not how i thought it would be i didnt think it would bother me so much with mom you know i mean kymberly sighed heavily you know bethany nodded i dont want to find out youre right you dont kymberly turned her head to look at her friend there was a lot of unmistakable anger in her face now and now my dads in trouble mostly because of you me what about me you telling the police you saw him show up at the house yeah but i did okay but he says he didnt do that she stared long and hard into her friends face dont you get it bethany if he did that makes him look like he killed mom the cop i talked to said they didnt have any suspects yet yeah well they got one now bethany sat still for a long moment i didnt mean that i mean for that to happen well what did you think was going to happen i dont know i just answered his questions well you gotta change your answers how am i going to do that just tell them you made a mistake you remembered wrong but i didnt kym you had to bethany it wasnt my dad if you say it was theyre going to get him you cant let that happen but if kymberly slapped down hard at her own pants leg listen to me forget the buts and the ifs youve got to change what you told them thats all there is to it you mean lie kymberly perhaps frustrated by her inability to get her message across more clearly fixed her with another menacing glare look bethany its pretty simple okay either you lie or or what god do i have to spell it out for you or something really bad is going to happen okay get it the walk along the marina from fort mason to crissy field is perhaps the most scenic stroll in a city justly renowned for its physical beauty today with a cloudless nearly purple sky above the vista showed itself at its best stuart and gina were in shirtsleeves hands in pockets keeping up a pace before long theyd reached the deep green sycamore and pine hillsides of the presidio the pinkdomed palace of fine arts presided over the rooftops of the marina district to ginas right a forest of sailboat masts swayed gently at their berths while beyond them the shimmering blue bay nurtured the rest of the fleet a riot of billowing multicolored sails cutting in and out of one another flirting often dangerously with the huge transport andor cruise ships that churned through the channel beneath the impossibly close rusty red cables and steel of the golden gate bridge in spite of all the full sails out on the water here on shore only a breath of a breeze blew over them the michael douglas trivia had not by a long shot dissipated all of the friction between attorney and client from their morning session at ginas office tension had thrummed between the two of them during juhles interrogation itself as gina continually stepped in answeringor more precisely advising stuart not to answer many of the questions for which juhle had already gotten answers the day before had stuart loved his wife or hated her precisely when had she told him shed wanted a divorce what had been those exact circumstances what time had he come home left echo lake how much did he stand to inherit and so on neither juhle nor stuart had appreciated her efforts it hadnt helped that the only time gina had thought it appropriate to cooperate fully with juhlewhen hed wanted to take a saliva swab for dnastuart had strongly objected in the end gina had prevailed a dna sample was something that the police could get by search warrant in any event there was nothing to be gained by refusing to provide one now nevertheless something about it had galled stuart immensely and his reaction had brought to a boil again the simmering anger that gina had been fighting to suppress all morning if he was innocent as he said why would he possibly object finally after juhle had gone theyd had the money discussion sixtyfive thousand down cashiers check or money order in her office as soon as possible but no later than the end of the week gina wasnt working for free and this was going to be taking all of her time if it went to a murder charge stuart could of course feel free to find other counsel but she cautioned him like everything else you tend to get what you pay for now to the casual eye they might have been a longmarried couple powerwalking for their exercise making sure they got their hours in talking of mundane thingsthe house the grandkids but a closer look would reveal a deeper intensity stuart had been telling gina about his daughterthe good and the rather more considerable bad of her well which is it if you had to choose one gina asked wonderful or difficult thats the thing shes both the wonderful part would be her mothers incredible brains and drive and even a goodly portion of the dryden natural beauty when she chooses to she can be very very pretty but that leads us to the difficult part in fact everything leads to the difficult part he walked on i dont know how to say this without it sounding pretty bad but shes just never really been easy in any way we called her the original high maintenance kid and thats when we were feeling good about her okay well not really okay you dont even want to hear about her eating habits which ranged over the years from gorging herself early on to some pretty intense bulimia over the last couple of years and lets not talk about mastering all the rudiments of hygienehair fingernails everything else you know what she was wearing when she got in yesterday salvation army camo thats the style stuart all right but why does she wear that baggy shit when she could be attractive i just dont get it maybe she doesnt want to be attractive maybe the attention threatens her ive got a friend whos the same way she puts on a dress or wears a tank top and guys driving by crash their cars into things ive seen it happen she hates it i dont think thats so abnormal no we havent gotten to the abnormal stuff yet which is what the true mental stuff which is really what nearly broke up caryn and me a long time ago stuart gave gina the extended version how during kyms adolescence shed tried their collective patiences with every kind of acting out in the book until finally caryn had decided that she suffered from classic attention deficit disorder and should be on a regular heavy regimen of ritalin problem was he continued that i dont really believe in a lot of the versions of add that caryns highend medical crowd tends to embrace embrace as what a onesizefitsall explanation for high energy and disruptive behavior in young people i thought that if my daughter needed attention so badly maybe it was because she wasnt getting enough from her parents myself included so i started to take her places with me the wilderness the woods the usual he shrugged for a while it seemed to help and at least i wasnt drugging her so what happened so in the end it turned out that as usual caryn was more right than i was now he came to a full stop and looked gina in the face the truth is we found out that kyms bipolar which used to be called manicdepressive she does need to be on a regular dose of lithium or she doesnt function right in the real world and unfortunately the classic situation which she fits is she forgets or refuses to take her pills when shes on them shes okay but everything in life is kind of lowkey and boring and she hates that she wants the high of being manic so she stops the pills and crashes and burns you know that time but suddenly he stopped looked out over ginas head to the cloudless sky no he said all but to himself never mind but gina put a hand on his arm never mind what what time stuart sighed and pointed to a bench next to the walkway you want to sit a minute and he told her what had really happened when the neighbors had called the police five years before when plates had gotten thrown pulling a trick out of his writers bag stuart had purposely used the passive voice when hed told gina about this before the plates had gotten thrown all right he said and caryn had gotten cut but he hadnt thrown themkymberly had and stuart and caryn at least agreed that they werent going to let their daughter be charged in the attack her life was going to be difficult enougheven if she got everything together and religiously took her medicationwithout the added burden of a criminal record shed gone off her pills again last summer and this had precipitated the many huge and highly vocal fights between kym and both of her parents the screaming between male and female voices that the neighbors had heard it had been kym and stuart daughter and father not caryn and stuart husband and wife and when the police had come he and caryn had put on the act together going along as though it had been them fightingagain to protect their daughter he was sitting on the bench canted forward staring out into nothing in front of him a couple of seagulls had landed in the grass across the path and were raucously fighting over a french fry gina cleared her throat you could tell this to juhle you know he doesnt think youre a wifebeater a lot of this goes away but stuart shook his head itd get out kyms got enough to deal with it might not get out juhle can keep a secret i dont know i just dont know anything he let out a lungful of air you want to be moving again after theyd covered some ground stuart continued theres just so much guilt about every part of this i mean the truth is that kyms problemskym herself evengot so she poisoned everything with caryn and me caryn went into her world of position and money and i just withdrew so i didnt have to confront it the whole time when i was around id try to be a good husband and father i suppose but i knew that i couldnt do anything to help my daughter or to make things better with caryn it was just what it was and i was too weak or i dont know too too goddamn impotent to do anything you thought it was your fault it was my fault im the one who originally wanted a kid so bad if it had been up to caryn it never would have happened and everything would have been better maybe not better stuart maybe just different another different couldnt have been worse believe me no kym was my genes without that caryn and i shit i dont know and this is where all the anger comes from isnt it some good percentage id say yeah why do you think i had to go away to get healed by water but then id come home and kym wouldnt have taken her pills and shed explode at me for something trivial or absolutely imaginary and the frustration would knock me sideways again and then caryn of course would blame me if i lost my temper gina had her arms crossed a breeze had picked up and blew the hair off her forehead when she spoke she kept her eyes out on the water you said kym and caryn were on the outs when she went off to school yeah that happened this past summer stuart went on to say that suddenly the sides had shifted andeven on her medication kym had begun to fight much more with caryn than she did with him she began to use street drugs selfmedicating the doctors called it kym was showing up at home with cds and jewelry and other stuff they knew she hadnt bought things around the house began to disappear she was having more or less random sex hanging out with difficult friends constantly ignoring her curfew caryn would not have any daughter of hers acting that way since it reflected on her and in this way caryn more than stuart had become the hated the enemy and that was how things stood until two weeks ago when a blessing for both parents kymberly had finally gone off to school stuart and gina had made it down nearly to the golden gate bridge for the last couple of hundred yards walking in silence but it was a more comfortable silence than theyd shared up until then and gina finally broke it so your book she said healed by water note the awkward silence stuart said while the author decides whether he should ask the reader for an opinion or not ive already told you i liked it a lot but it was more than that when i finished itit really touched me i was just so relieved i guess is the word about what about taking on a client who was intelligent and innocent i cant tell you how good that felt that id finally be able to put my legal talents to the service of someone who might actually deserve them she kept walking eyes forward hands in her pockets i said something yesterday about losing my fiance a few years ago well since then not that it matters to you but why wouldnt it matter to me i mean to your defense in any event since david ive been having some trouble committing to things to getting involved and then suddenly last night i finished your book and was just so glad that i was going to get to do this i mean defend an innocent man do you know how many innocent clients ive had in twentysome years as a lawyer i dont know ten fifteen zero stuart stopped walking turned to face her youve got to be kidding me no you think thats unusual no innocent clients ever yeah id say so youd be wrong its the norm believe me public defenders which is how i started they get assigned cases out of the courtroom and roughly a hundred percent of these people they dont even pretend they didnt do what theyre charged with its all just revolving doors into and out of jail they just want to cut a deal to lessen their time or snitch out somebody to get back on the street or convince a jury that whatever they did yeah they did it all right but they cant be guilty of doing whatever it was because it just wasnt their fault they were victims of what anything you can think of and probably a bunch you cant prejudice bad childhood republicans abusive spouses drugs and alcohol addictive personality disorder sexual dysfunction dumbshit syndrome you name it but whatever the main thing is it wasnt their fault gina came to a full stop so anyway last night the thought of getting to defend a righteously innocent client it kind of filled me up with i dont knowmotivation hope maybe something to try for an hour later as they got back to the marina gina had more to work with although juhle in his zeal to connect stuart to his wifes murder to date hadnt seemed too aware of the maelstrom of drama that apparently swirled in all corners of the life of caryn dryden stuart had lived inside of it for years once hed gotten his arms around the fact that caryn had probably been murdered he amplified quite a lot of the information that they discussed the day before reinforcing ginas impression that at least two other people might have had a motive to kill her besides those definite two stuart told her that he thought it possible that his wife had been having an affair or maybe serial affairs which opened up another whole world of possibilities in stuarts opinion the most likely suspect to have killed his wifeand for all he knew to have been sleeping with her toowas her main business partner robert mcafee with whom she had been trying to open her new practice as stuart had intimated yesterday caryn was trying to bring in a third partner michael pinkerta mediocre though very rich surgeon this was infuriating mcafee who didnt want to work with pinkert any more than he wanted to split their potential profits three ways the selling point of the deal for mcafee had always been the efficiency and professionalism and synergy of him and caryn working together but pinkert could bridge the money gap that was threatening their startup caryn and mcafee had taken out insurance policies against their business startup loans and now with caryns death mcafee would likely be able to open his own clinic and reap all the profits himself but even half of her own private clinic was nothing compared to caryns other major endeavor shed not just been your average runofthemill dimeadozen orthopedic surgeon instead she was a total joint surgeon specializing in total hip replacement or arthroplasty beyond that as if that werent enough stuart had said shed done her undergraduate work and then a couple of years of graduate school before she transferred to med school in polymer chemistry evidently in her spare time caryn had invented a new plastic cupside for the hip joint that marked a significant improvement in the plastics unfortunate tendency to degrade in the body over time pii the company in whose lab she worked had even named the thing the dryden socket and after fda approval which was pending it looked to become the worldwide gold standard hip joint as such projected sales would make it worth millions every year but as evidently was almost always the case when the fda got near giving its final stamp of approval some problems had surfaced lately caryn had been far more upset about her socket and her dealings with pii and the projects point man with the venture capital crowda palo alto investment banker named frederick furth whod arranged the mezzanine loanthan with anything about bob mcafee as gina had discovered last night the mezzanine loan had left her cashpoor on her new practice offices when there were the inevitable and unavoidable delays in construction and startup and the dryden socket apparently remained in limbo if these facts and alternative suspects did not directly impact the evidence that juhle was collecting on stuart gina knew that at least they would be useful in muddying the prosecutorial waters at this stage that would be its own reward still some long blocks from the travelodge and with most of their legal business out of the way for the moment gina found herself coming back to stuarts books asking him which was his favorite i like them all he said theyre all my babies you know but its gratifying that other people like them too im very lucky i get to do what i do you do it very well i identified with a lot of it which i guess is what youre going for but stuart shook his head no im not really going for effects on the reader im trying to get to something else sometimes im not so sure of what it is myself clarity maybe he shrugged almost swallowed the next word truth that sounds arrogant i know but its what im trying for something real well you got that you really did shrugging that off he cocked his chin at her if you dont mind my asking what did you identify with really quite a bit of it the analogyyou were talking about being in the moment the step after step after step of say getting to the top you had it from guitar lake to whitney ive made that exact climb three times now how its really not about getting to the top its about the thin air the pain in your legs the keeping on when you dont think you can suddenly she stopped ive done it is my point she said in a huskier voice but i havent analyzed it very much or expressed it the way you did it was just something i needed to do to get healed your fiance who died she nodded stuart nodded back at her with me it was the family my family what i had to get healed from i picked that up not that i didnt find the experience of being married to a workaholic genius and raising an impossibly difficult child totally fulfilling this is my great failing and im not the kind of guy who can just ignore it or have affairs or be emotionally absent or however else were supposed to cope but sometimes i just had to get away for a few days to find myself again to hear some silence to get the strength to recommit to coming back to it when so much of it didnt seem that it would ever be worth it for me gina said it was this whole i guess it was the whole question of what lifes about and i couldnt get an answer here in the city it was just too loud too inyourface you know then of course you know its not particularly profound he said were all too much in it all the time weve got to slow down but we dont but i didnt write it to try to teach anything my goal was just to figure out for myself what worked and why it worked thats what the writings about not the magazine articles so much but the books figuring stuff out taking other people there too maybe hopefully that happens in the process if i write it right which i suppose is why the books sell and that just shows that there must be a lot of us in the same boat maybe most of us so gina hesitated then figured what the hell she wanted to know what about writers block do you ever get that no i dont never now stuart broke one of his first true smiles im talking to a writer arent i gina lifted her shoulders let them down halfway through a bad legal thriller wondering how you get all the way to the end just keep going ha well its what i do i suppose i get times where the ideas dont exactly flow but the best definition of writers block i ever heard was that it was a failure of nerve its not something outside of you trying to stop you its your own fear that you wont say it right or get it right or wont be smart or clever enough but once you acknowledge its just fear you decide youre not going to let it beat you and you keep pushing on kind of like climbing whitney except that if its never any fun then maybe its something inside trying to tell you that you probably dont want to be a writer youre not having fun with your book not too much some at the beginning then i got all hung up on whether anyone would want to read it and if theyd care about my characters and i started writing for them those imaginary inthefuture readers whoever they might be well yeah but thats not why you write you write to see where youre gonna go at least i do and in your case nobodys paying you for your stuff yet are they no hardly well then just do it for yourself and have some fun with it or start another story that you like better or take up cooking instead or get up to the mountains more but if you want to write write a page a day and in a year youve got a book and anybody who cant write a page a day well theres a clue that maybe youre not a writer a page a day cake stuart said theyd gotten to within sight of the travelodge and gina recognized three of the local news channel vans doubleparked in a row on lombard street she put a hand on stuarts forearm stopping him in his tracks looks like theyve found you she said you really think theyre here for me i think thats a safe assumption yes so what do we do you say nothing i say no comment we get inside your room and close the door behind us and hope they go away you ready i guess so as ill ever be all right nice and relaxed lets go when devin juhle got back from his interview with gorman at ginas office he was not in good spirits and his mood wasnt much improved when in spite of his discoveries the day before assistant da gerry abrams wasnt moved to convene a grand jury to weigh his evidence just yet in the first place none of it was physical evidence abrams pointed out that an eyewitness seeing and possibly even identifying gormans car did not even under the most generous interpretation rise to the level of proof of anything about stuart himself and while the assistant da found the two domestic disturbance calls compelling enough these bore no direct relationship to the murder either beyond that forensics team boss lennard faro had come up with no fingerprints on the wine bottle which dr strout said was of a compatible shape to allow the inference though not the absolute conclusion that it was the weapon that had knocked caryn unconscious microscopic traces of her blood on the label didnt hurt either there were partial fingerprintsnot carynson pieces of the broken wineglass in the garbage disposal and a complete and clear print on the one large shard theyd discovered under the hot tub but none of the prints matched stuarts or anyones in the criminal data bank forensics had found a few drops of blood in the garagestill tackybut whether or not it was stuarts would have to wait for the dna results for which no one was holding their breath juhle had his reluctant swab of stuarts saliva all right but the actual testing and results could take days and even then so what stuarts blood in his garage meant nothing he could have cut himself shaving or lacerated his finger on his workbench that morning or a couple of days before they just didnt have enough in abrams cramped thirdfloor office juhle with a haunch on the opposite desk and sucking on a pencil eraser sat staring between his two companions so whats it going to take gerry we just ignore his motive yeah but you know motive abrams shrugged all of these law professionals knew that while motive was a nice plus if you could get it by itself it meant next to nothing okay in spite of his frustration juhle didnt want to appear to push he kept his argument lowkey weve got the history of domestic violence we do have the girl identifying his car if he acknowledges that he had the car with him all night but abrams was shaking his head she never said she saw him it wont fly dev it will if we can put him and only him in his car hes more or less said the same thing putting him there himself in fact juhles face lit up as he reached into his jacket pocket look at this he passed the plastic evidence bag across the desk faro whod been slouching by the door moved up a few steps to take a peek what is it he asked its his alibi but it just occurred to me that maybe itll hang him abrams opened the baggie and pulled out the crinkled piece of paper holding it up is this the original yep i got it this morning from him and his lawyer they kept a copy what is it faro asked again its a gas station receipt from monday morning four fifteen am from rancho cordova up beyond sacramento on fifty abrams put the thing flat on his desk and as faro picked it up assumed his thought positionfeet up hands templed at his lips whats this supposed to prove whyd he give it to you he says it proves he left echo lake at two am its where he stopped to get gas on the way back to town but im thinking what if he left the city after doing his wife hightailed up to rancho cordova and found this place so he could get the receipt and drive back down whats that get him faro asked if we believe it it keeps him out of town until his wifes dead so he couldnt have done it but what it also does is prove he was in his car in rancho cordova at four fifteen am which meansif the timing works and we can place the car in san francisco at the time of the murder and we canthat he was the one driving it it couldnt have been anyone else we could make bethany seeing his car the factual equivalent of seeing him abrams kept his eyes closed his lips moving unconsciously finally he said even if the timing is right its still got problems but with everything else added on maybe its getting closer rein it in ger faro said we dont want you going all enthusiastic on us i like it juhle said it might be a start abrams agreed if the timings right and we ought to be able to find that out in about two minutes pulling himself up straight abrams reached for his computer mouse and the screen on his desk lit up whats gormans address here in town juhle gave it to him abrams typed it in faro moved over to look whatre you doing mapquest abrams drew the receipt closer to him and looked up again at juhle and this is the address of the place he stopped at four fifteen we know this pretty certain juhle said i called them and theyve got a videotape running twentyfour seven which well be getting tomorrow stuart went in to get a coke when he stopped he ought to be on it abrams typed in the address faro moved over as juhle came around to look after about ten seconds abrams pushed his chair back and glanced up at his colleagues with a look of mild satisfaction ninetyseven and a half miles one hour fortytwo minutes faro pulled at his goatee only if he drove the speed limit which nobody does he might have if hed just killed his wife and wanted to make sure he didnt get pulled over abrams said which would have blown the alibi but juhle was shaking his head it doesnt matter if he was speeding even if we call it almost twice that say three hours he left the house here at quarter to one he could have been there at quarter to four more likely it was probably closer to two hours so hes at the arco station at three am max faro was leaning over abrams desk consulting his copy of the original receipt yeah but thats too early he bought his gas and his coke at four fifteen this wasnt an impediment to the assistant da who suddenly had a clue he might be able to use hands at his lips abrams was matteroffact so he hung out up here for a while len trying to decide what to do maybe he just sat in his car maybe faro pulled at his goatee i dont suppose i need to tell you guys that if he did kill his wife going back home was dumb he drives back up to his cabin and nobody would have known shed probably still be sitting in that hot tub right now and nobody the wiser juhle shrugged and said not to sound cliched about it len but murderers have been known to return to the scene of the crime make sure they didnt leave any clues laying around faro wasnt going to fight about it im only making the point dev deep in his thoughts abrams held up a hand cutting off any more discussion lets stay on point here guys gorman left his home at quarter to one he was in rancho cordova at four fifteen devin do you have his exact address up at where was it echo lake why dont you just try that abrams typed again and they all waited again call it eighty miles even one and a half hours uhoh juhle said abrams opened his eyes what one and a half hours from two oclock is three thirty yes it is dev abrams said and this means what it meant obviously had jacked juhle up he crossed the tiny office knocked on the opposite bookshelf a couple of times and then turned back with a light in his eye okay follow me here he drives up from san francisco after doing his wife all right none of us have any problem with him hanging around killing time in rancho cordova until he gets gas and heads back down right without waiting he went on but the same is not true if hes coming down from echo lake this situation hes on his way home hes not going to kill fortyfive minutes or more before gassing up hes going to stop for gas and continue on his way maybe he left later than two faro said maybe he did but he said it was actually a little before hes got an extra fortyfive minutes that just plain doesnt work even if we use his own timetable finally abrams sat up straighter and stretched i like this he said this a jury can understand if he left echo at two and didnt get to rancho cordova until four unless he got a flat tire or there was some traffic problemwed better check with the highway patrol and nail that downthen what was he doing whereas if he left the city at one hed just wait around until he could put some space between him and the murder thats it juhle said we get him to give us a sworn clean and specific timetable we can hang him on it he looked at his forensics guy this doesnt sing for you len faro was back scratching at his beard no problem as far as it goes he said but still no physical evidence unless im missing it which im not abrams flashed a disappointed glance at juhle clucked once and said lens a spoilsport but hes not all wrong juhle returned to the homicide detail to find the place unusually jumping normally this time late on a weekday afternoon a few bodies might be sitting at desks reviewing transcripts of interrogations or writing up reports or reading of the fifteen homicide inspectors in the unit six would be a big number present at any one time but devin had heard the lowvolume but electric buzz out in the hallway and he came in to pretty much a full house there was a little bullpen area just inside the entrance to the room next to the doorway to lieutenant laniers office perennially open but now strangely closed a couple of steps in juhle stopped dev darrell bracco appeared from between the lockers that divided the room with a quick comeonin hand motion he got juhle moving forward again nodding around at his colleagues stuffed among the desks juhle threw a look toward his lieutenants closedup office hey darrell whats going on marcel all right you didnt hear i guess not what my old partner harlan fisk the supervisor he got a tip at lunch that the fab five is on the way over here theyre gonna do marcel is that perfect or what so till they get here sarahs in there keeping him tied up what do you mean theyre going to do marcel the fab five dev the fab five right but my kids arent teenagers yet are they some band i dont know them rolling his eyes bracco leaned in toward him queer eye for the straight guy theyre going to do marcel what are they going to do with him dev come on tell me youve never watched the show okay ive never watched the show overhearing the conversation emilio thorsten butted in you gotta check it out dev the shows a riot these five gay guys they find some prototypical straightbasically marcel i mean hes perfect who dresses wrong and wears the wrong shoes and glasses and lives in like a gym and they fix him up the house the clothes the look the whole schmear gay guys do this why its a tv show darrell said thats why theres five of them the fab five they take some straight nerd and make him hip or more hip anyway and theyre doing this to marcel today closing time according to harlan whos never wrong its gonna be awesome juhle had been in homicide for six years and hed seen worse attendance at mandatory callups it occurred to him not for the first time that he was more than a little out of the loop among his peers not only had he never seen the show he obviously hadnt been part of the grapevine of communication today that had connected every other person in the detail theyre going to come with like tv lights and a crew and surprise marcel he asked thats the idea then ive got a good one too devin said a good idea i mean whats that bracco asked somebody better get marcels gun off him hes going to blow their asses off supervisor harlan fisk missed on this one after about an hour of progressively more disappointed waiting fisk called bracco and told him his source had gotten it wrong fifteen minutes after that six fully dispirited homicide teams had finally gone grumbling out of the detail and were on their way back to their beats to their witness interviews to their snitches or to their homes marcel laniers door was open again and the lieutenant appeared to have remained unaware the whole time of the gathering of his troops and their subsequent dispersal devin juhle had subpoenaed caryn drydens home telephone records but he wouldnt have those numbers for a couple more days in the meantime he sat at his desk with a list of the numbers hed taken from her cell phone which had an easily accessible record of the last ten calls shed both placed and received he punched in one of them hello a young womans voice this is inspector juhle of san francisco homicide who am i speaking to please this is kym gorman just a second he heard the voice speaking to someone in the room with her its the police then a mans voice this is stuart gorman who is this mr gorman this is inspector juhle jesus inspector dont you guys ever give it up why are you harassing my daughter im not im calling numbers from your wifes cell phone your daughter called her twice over the weekend and she called her back once did you know that no not specifically but last time i checked it wasnt a crime for a daughter and mother to talk on the phone no sir its not i was just checking the numbers finding out who your wife talked to in the last days of her life your daughters was the first number i tried all right then youve tried it a pause look inspector shes having a bit of a hard time dealing with things right now as you might understand would you mind please letting this go for a few days would that be too much of a problem for you no i could do that id appreciate it i really would all right then but you know while ive got you can you tell me one small thing you know what my lawyer says id better not but youve already said this one thing evidently i said a lot and youve got it all on tape right use that all im talking about juhle went on is what time you left your place at echo lake you said a little before two i just wondered if youve had a chance to rethink that why because im trying to get my timetable straight you said a little before two last time you want to change that now juhle waited through some silence until stuart said no it was a little before two im pretty sure there juhle said that wasnt so hard was it kymberly was halfwatching the turneddown television from the couch she glanced at her father slumped now in one of the rooms reading chairs daddy are you okay stuart threw her a weak smile i think im finally running out of gas here hon he drew in a shallow breath i didnt know youd talked to mom over the weekend yeah a little after a hesitation kym shrugged is that what the police wanted he mentioned it thats all what did you guys talk about not much really i got her twice saturday but she was running around so we only actually got to talk one time on sunday what was she running around doing on saturday another shrug you know it was mom something she didnt say much as stuart was striving to keep everything lowkey this question brought the beginning of a rise kym brought her eyes all the way away from the tv and over to her father what why are you looking at me like that do you think im trying to hide something from you no and im not looking at you any way i thought your mother might have told you something about what she was doing why she couldnt talk to you and that might have had something to do with whoever killed her since it wasnt me jesus dad are you saying do you think it was me here we go he thought but said no dont be silly she sat up straight now eyes growing wider you do you think it could have been me dont you god i dont believe this his hand went to his forehead hed learned that he could sometimes control the direction of his daughters outbursts by refusing to continue the confrontation kym he said evenly from behind his hand lets not go here i dont think that and never could i know you loved your mother im trying to imagine who could have done what they did and all i want you to believe is that i didnt have anything to do with it thats all i want miraculously it worked kym seemed to pull back within herself for a second then she nodded and got up from the couch crossing over to him kneeling down in front of him her hands on his knees of course i believe that how could i not believe that the same way i couldnt believe it about you sweetie never ever ever stroking her hair he went on soothingly but with all those reporters who were out there you saw them and you heard what gina roake said theyre going to make me the suspect because thats where the story seems to be right now we should be ready for that and not get mad getting mad isnt going to help anything i know she whispered into her hands i know that i know you do he said and thats why youre not going to be mad at me if i ask if youve taken your pills today she raised her face to look at him and nodded solemnly i started again this morning im sorry i felt so good at school i thought but then i came down here there was this party i heard about where a bunch of the new kids like me were going down to santa cruz she stopped i know im sorry im trying he let that go it was going to have to be good enough you went and saw bethany what did she say she said it was your car but it couldnt have been i wasnt here i know but she thinks it was dad she saw it it opened the garage door and pulled in who else could it have been maybe nobody maybe she dreamed the whole thing did she notice the license plate stuart had a personalized california plate that read ghotia little private joke compliments of george bernard shaw the gh sound from laugh the o from women the ti from action so ghoti if pronounced correctly spelled fish she didnt say specifically well if she didnt see that it wasnt my car i know but what im saying is that maybe she could try to remember that one little detail do you think shed be willing to talk to me i dont know i think maybe now it would scare her a little i dont think she really got it that she was telling the police that it must have been you who killed mom until i told her and then she was all i didnt mean to say that except shes sure it was your car you know how many darkcolored suvs there are black green blue brown come on and she never saw me personally did she get out of the car or anything like that no but who else could it have been i mean who else had an automatic opener to get in the garage that would mean mom and and somebody i know hon i know what it would have to mean at about eight thirty theyd finished dinner and the suspect walked out of izzys steaks chops with his daughter on one arm and his sisterinlaw debra on the other immediately a swarm of news people closed in around them cameras flashing voices raised and demanding stuart give us a comment huh whyd you kill your wife how much was she worth how much are you worth now who are these women you got a girlfriend stuart stuart finally stopped at the corner of lombard and faced them i know you people are only trying to do your job he said but id like to ask you all politely to leave me and my family to our privacy and our grief on my left this is my daughter kym and this is my sisterinlaw my wifes sister debra i did not kill my wife and im going to cooperate in every way i can with the police in helping them to find who did kill her a reporter said you know that the police consider you the prime suspect what do you have to say about that theyre welcome to their opinion you notice i havent been arrested though if they had evidence id be in jail they dont and they wont get it because it doesnt exist i didnt kill my wife thats all ive got to say now if youll all excuse us you saw the picture of course gina asked him on the phone me and debra they led the eleven oclock news with it yeah i saw it whatever you say people are going to think shes the other woman you know that let them it wont help you all this public stuff is stupid gina it wont hurt me if theres no evidence and i dont see any evidence do you no but it probably wasnt the smartest move in the world to rub that in juhles face on television either hell get over it maybe itll teach him not to share his suspicions with the media hes going to fight me there im going to fight him back in fact im half inclined to sue him for slander already you do slander gina gave a little laugh not this week ive got a murder case that seems to be heating up my client keeps talking freedom of speech use it or lose it and speaking of which he told her about this earlier conversation with juhle the disputed time hed left echo lake and you told him maybe it hadnt been two no i told him it was have i mentioned that the preferred term of art is just to say no comment i tried i tried a silence and finally gina said so hows your daughter shes a wreck she cried all night her moms gone and its starting to sink in that and all the things left unsaid between them thats hard those unresolved issues when she went off to oregon to school i told you about some of it today theyd just had it out about what she was bringing upor more what she wasnt bringing up no makeup one change of clothes people up there werent going to be shallow like they are down here caring about all that external stuff so bottom line she didnt even give caryn a hug she didnt come in and say goodbye she just walked out the door and the next thing she knows is her mother is dead shes trying to find a place to put all that does she have somebody she can talk to a regular counselor are you kidding a shrink a day thats our motto but im not sure thats what she needs right now is she taking her medicine as of today maybe if i believe her do you about as much as usual say sixty percent gina asked and how about you how are you doing she waited stuart his voice was different gruff unprotected its started to hit me too i think its he sighed heavily its hard i get the feeling its going to get harder missing her it took him a second caryn not really just this emptiness like the spaces around me are all too big or something im all disoriented im not saying it very well youre saying it fine im not you remember how you said you were waiting for me to show some grief yes well i dont know when or even if thats ever going to happen he paused then went on in a rush what ive been hit by is this sense that what caryn and i really had for the last several years at least what i was convinced we hadwas a commitment more than anything else certainly more of a commitment than actual love whatever that is we werent going to cheat i thought we werent going to embarrass each other we were going to do as good as we could with kymberly try not to get in each others ways support each others career choices but somewhere along the way it stopped being being anything personal really we shared the house and were basically polite to each other and i thought it would change back someday maybe when kym left maybe later but now im just starting to realize that even if she wasnt dead that was never going to happen and thats what i feel this emptiness about its like with her gone im suddenly allowed to feel whats been there and what ive been denying all along for five six maybe ten years i know i should feel more grief i feel guilty that i dont but there it is in some ways i feel like im starting to wake up how wrong is that its not so wrong although i wouldnt go out of my way to mention it to the press ill try to resist and while were on it theres something else you might try to avoid around reporters whats that debra i told you theres nothing i know what you told me but im talking about perception shes beautiful and whether or not you like it her body language is claiming you wait up an hour and watch it again on the late news and youll see what im talking about she isnt there with you now is she she didnt even come in gina she left after we had dinner okay and stuart she may be the nicest woman in the world thats not my point my point is the reporters have now seen her so shes in the story and if theres any way she could get a bigger part in it that will happen without either of you doing anything so for the last time theres no bigger part for her in this is there nothing stuart he sighed into the receiver what ive told you is true weve never been involved weve never had sex okay clear enough except that i hear a but another pause three years ago when she was going through her divorce caryn suggested that i take her away from all the madness she was going through so i took her up to the lake and we hiked around up there a while how long he hesitated five days five days youre in a loveless marriage and shes getting divorced and nothing happened we didnt have sex if thats of course thats what im saying dont go all bill clinton on me theres not she would have maybe she wanted to maybe i was tempted i thought it was a good idea to cut off the last two days and we came home early i was married to her sister for christs sake we had a deal and i wasnt going to break it and thats the truth swell who else knows you guys went up there who might tell well certainly her exhusband maybe some of her friends ginas voice went flat so its going to come out and itll be part of your motive except that nothing happened and nothing is going to happen i promise you people can believe it or not im not thinking about people in general stuart im thinking about nineteen specific people on the grand jury or maybe twelve in a murder trial ill just tell them the truth stuart you just told me the truth and im not too sure it helped well i dont know what else i can do did you hear what else i told those reporters tonight something else that was true whats that that im willing to cooperate with whoever it takes even the police to find who killed caryn in fact just between you and me maybe im going to try to find out myself not a good idea this is why we have police except at the moment they think i did it no theyre just saying youre a person a person of interest i know i know and that means im the prime suspect as soon as they find something they can use as evidence and then im in jail i dont want to go to jail even for a day no youre right there you dont well then whats my option sit around and wait until juhle piles up enough innuendo and hearsay to bring charges against me listen gina if hes not looking for somebody else then hes not looking for whoever did this because i didnt have i mentioned that before a couple of times i believe and that brings us to some good news at last whats that your lawyer is starting to believe you the travelodge did not have room service so stuart let his daughter sleep and went out to pick up breakfast and a newspaper so at about stuart and kymberly were drinking their starbucks and eating croissants at the coffee table in his hotel room his daughter turned a page of the paper leaned forward over it for a minute then looked up youve made usa today dad writer denies implication in doctor wifes death oh god nationwide can i see she passed the pages over and he scanned the article quickly it wasnt long maybe two hundred words in the regional news section under san francisco before he had a chance for any kind of a comment the telephone on the side table next to the couch rang once and stuart grabbed it hello yes speaking but after that he wasnt speakinghe listened for a minute at the end of which he said all right thanks then sat holding the phone dad startled out of his reverie stuart smiled awkwardly at his daughter then hung up and lifted his coffee cup to his mouth that was the police he said we can go back home home kym said whats home going to be like now he met his daughters eyes saw the incipient tears and put his arm around her bringing her in next to him holding her as she broke kym didnt think she could stand to be inside the house where her mother had been slain she wasnt sure she could ever go back through that front door again and fortunately before theyd even finished their coffee debra had shown up unbidden at the hotel she volunteered to take her niece shopping for some clothes no argument about the shallowness of fashion this time from kym and then out to lunch someplace nice after that they could both go back to debras apartment where kym was welcome to stay with her as long as she wanted and at least until the funeral the medical examiner hadnt released the body so they werent sure yet when that would be certainly no sooner than next monday so at a little before noon after wandering aimlessly in the empty house for most of an hour stuart found himself alone upstairs at his computer in his small writing office next to his bedroom he hadnt checked his emails since thursday night and now he was scrolling down through nearly a hundred of them it did not appear that the police whod searched his house so thoroughly over the past couple of days had opened his files and this surprised him but maybe theyd dumped his hard drive data onto a disk and taken it downtown to peruse at their leisure the correspondence was mostly predictablefully half in spite of his spamblocking software was unwanted unsolicited mail of one kind or another eight or ten were messages from people whod enjoyed one of his books or others of his writings both his agent and his publisher offering any kind of assistance but possibly not exactly heartbroken over the commercial possibilities of him being in the news another twenty forwarded jokes that he routinely deleted fifteen or so from people whod heard about caryn he had almost gotten to the bottom of the queue when he saw a familiar senders monikertsnkthat brought him up short and caused his stomach to go hollow stuart had heard from tsnk before twice the first time had been a little over a year ago a few days after sunset had published a short piece that featured some of stuarts favorite outdoor recipes for cooking trout at that time hed printed out the offending email but then decided to ignore it it had to be from some crank stuart hadnt considered calling the police or the fbi he never even mentioned it to caryn stuart though had kept the message but hed never had to go back and look at it to remember it in its entirety it is bad enough when the ignorant kill gods and natures noble animals in the name of food or sport but when someone who glorifies himself as the friend and benefactor of nature does it the crime rises to the level of evil now we know who you are punishment for your crime might come at any time prepare yourself thou shalt not kill tsnk hed heard from them or him or her one other time four months ago in the wake of another article hed donethis one published in field streamon an albacore run hed taken with a party boat out of morro bay the seventyfoot party boat had left the dock at midnight and after a night running southwest for about sixty miles theyd hit a goodsize school of tuna although every one of the twelve other anglers hooked up in the aftermath of bringing the fish aboard stuart had been appalled by the general greediness on the boat the common attitude seemed to be that suddenly all of the boatmates were potential enemies intent on stealing each others catch two fights broke out fists actually flung when one of the mates tagged a bigger fish they were all within three pounds on either side of forty as the catch of one man when another was sure he had boated it afterward when the run was over the men sat apart guarding their burlap sacks of catch lest another fisherman substitute his name tag to try to get more fish the story stuart wrote for field stream had been his kneejerk solution to the rampant avidity wasabi and soy sauce in hand hed gone up to the first mate and asked him to bring up the largest fish stuart had caught and cut up half of itfifteen pounds of fillet into sushi for breakfast for every man on the boat the other half he gave to the shortorder cook in the galley and told him to make as many variations of albacore as his heart desired to keep the crew and his fellow fishermen happy so besides the sushi theyd all fed like lords on fresh breaded albacore on seared sesame albacore on garlic stirfried albacore and on albacore with butter lemon and capers by the end of the day the meneven the earlier pugilistswere all friends sharing recipes tips and even tackle trading their fresh tuna for each others canned planning other fishing trips as a group stuart had thought it a very successful story about how an example of simple sharing could break the grip of irrational territorialism on a bunch of alpha males tsnk apparently didnt have the same opinion youve been warned once and you have not heeded your influence could heal and instead you choose to let it harm the helpless creatures ofthe deep the albacore shall have their vengeance thou shalt not kill this second time stuart did report the email to the police who directed him to the fbi who in turn told him they would pass it either to fish game or up the chain to homeland security as a possible threat from a terrorist organization but stuart had never heard another word about it from anyone and in his heart he believed that the authorities considered the whole thing more or less a joke and in truth he knew it was highly unlikely that alqaeda cared much about whether he killed the fish he caught on the other hand there were organizations that did if you said the word terrorism on us soil before you would have probably been more likely and accurately to conjure up images of timothy mcveigh or the work of peta or the earth liberation front than of osama bin laden and his followers these people were serious and they or someone perhaps sufficiently like them had him in their sights in the emotional devastation hed been enduring since last friday when caryn had told him she wanted a divorce the thought of his most recently published article an atypical foray outside of the fishing world in western sportsman hadnt crossed his mind since hed handed it in six weeks before though hed worried sporadically that his tale of the boar hunt hed gone on in the sierra foothills might draw the attention of tsnk now the simmering of his alltoofamiliar anger welling up again within him he clicked twice on the message it was dated last friday at in the afternoon the beasts of the fields are sacred unto god and now you have taken to slaying them as well as their brothers in the waters this is intolerable we know where you live there will be no more warnings soon you will suffer as your victims have suffered tsnk from her office gina placed a call to wyatt hunt computer whiz she was at stuarts house a half hour later is it possible juhle missed this they were in the kitchen a room in which stuart felt marginally comfortable he was sitting on the counter by the sink wouldnt he have told us if he saw it it may be why he hasnt arrested you well theres one way to find out gina placed the call from the kitchen phone and got the inspector on his cell phone he was down in hunters point interviewing another witness in a suspected gang slaying but he wasnt making much headwaythe homey aint be membrin nothin no im out on the stoop now hoping nobody shoots at me whats up gina she told him and read the latest message the bare fact of it made very little impact on the inspector its an email no we didnt download his files but thanks for the idea devin this looks to me like a threat to stuart and maybe to his family it says that they know where he lives that its the last warning are you sure he didnt go to some internet cafe and mail it to himself reasonably sure yes he got two other similar notes in the past year from the same sender on the second one he notified the authorities when was that i dont know exactly four or five months ago he could have been planning it back then set up the story gina said look inspector im giving you the courtesy of this phone call if you want to come here to look for yourself my client would let you in without a warrant its your call no ill be there dont erase anything dont touch anything give me an hour one hour gina said hanging up she softened her tone to stuart he was underwhelmed but hell be here he doesnt think its impossible you sent it to yourself stuarts smile showed a few teeth they get an idea in their heads they hold on to it pretty hard dont they okay so even forget this thou shalt not kill guy isnt juhle looking at anybody else any other suspects i dont know he should be thats all i can say she hesitated looked out the window over his shoulder came back to him made an involuntary grimace what are you thinking he asked something im thinking id like to see where it happened if you could deal with it he took a beat then said sure and boosted himself off the counter out here the hot tub was still uncovered still filled with water although someone had turned it off and the temperature was now tepid theyd left the blackout blinds open and the backs and sides of the neighboring homes and backyards were visible on all sides stuart dipped a hand into the water and stirred it outside the early autumn weather kept imitating summer from a feeder by the back fence birdsong punctuated the stillness a smell of chlorine hung in the air a hint of humidity stuart didnt turn around but spoke quietly im starting to believe somebody drowned her somebody hit her on the head and pushed her under ive got to find out who that was weve talked about that stuart thats the police a bitter laugh theyre not motivated like i am he turned back to her now you want to ask if i didnt love her anymore why would it matter so much all right that did occur to me its not so much caryn its me im the one whos going to have to live with the suspicion for the rest of my life people thinking that i killed my wife you think i want to look into my daughters eyes and have her not be absolutely certain that i didnt do this to say nothing of my friends acquaintances publishers i cant have it i wont have it the small outburst seemed to settle something in him theyre not locking me up whoever did this whoever did it gina said will have made some mistakes stuart when juhle widens the net a little hell get to them hes not looking theres no net there will be though i promise its only been two days and hes been spending his time eliminating you wasting his time eliminating me and after four days murders dont get solved do they well this one has to get solved stuart again put his hand into the lukewarm water he kept it there moving it slowly back and forth okay he said as though hed been arguing with himself and had reached a conclusion okay then wyatt hunt was upstairs in the small office sitting at stuarts computer gina and stuart were packed in standing behind him theres no way hunt was saying that you can identify where this came from cant we go to the server stuart asked i mean its at gmail dot com dont they have to have an account sure but what does that tell you nothing theres no physical address they probably signed up online work out of a laptop if its in a public place we could maybe locate the computer but so what they could be anywhere but wait hunt held up a finger another idea strikes hold on his fingers danced over the keyboard he stared at the screen typed some more did it all again finally he pushed back shaking his head nope an idea but not a good one whatd you do gina asked googled tsnk also thou shalt not kill other than bible sites no record of anything like it as you can see here and if theres no record on google it doesnt exist maybe it is really just a lone crackpot like you thought originally but whats all this i know where you live a shrug cheap terror tactics thats all theyve written two of these before and done nothing right no attempt on you the guy might be holed up in some cabin in idaho or maine or anywhere why should this time be any different this time stuart said my wifes dead i think thats different enough of course hunt said sorry i wasnt thinking its all right stuart replied that seems to be going around i wasnt thinking either the last few days im only just starting to now he looked over to gina back down at hunt so what youre saying is that i could have done just what juhle said emailed myself from anywhere with this threatening stuff essentially right hunt swiveled halfway around toward the others maybe if we found the actual computer this was emailed from we could download the hard drive and prove the threat had come from that machine but again so what wed know who owned it by itself it wouldnt do us any good just to be clear wyatt gina said since we cant identify who sent it devin isnt going to be able to rule out stuart on this is he no i dont think so wait a minute stuart said with some sharpness to wyatt you know this guy what guy juhle who both of you are suddenly calling devin hunt glanced up at gina shrugged yeah we go back why because maybe he needs somebody he trusts telling him that i didnt do this hunt coughed made a noise in his throat and gina waded into the edgy silence um thats not really the way its played stuart i dont give a damn about how its played gina this isnt a game its my life hunt recovering said okay its your life but devin doesnt trust anybody that much not me not his wife nobody hes a cop he follows the evidence in spite of the fact that hes got none on me hunts shrug was a little more elaborate this time youre the spouse sir the spouse usually did it thats where hes got to start all right then but what about if there are other suspects how about that he finds some evidence hell look at them but he wont go chasing down another motive not until hes eliminated you and thats no matter what i say or do so im guilty until proven innocent to juhle probably i thought it was supposed to be the other way round hunt gave him a flat look you see much else in life that works the way its supposed to let me know and ill buy stock in it gina put a hand on her clients arm listen stuart juhle might not think so but you are at least being considered innocent which is why youre not in jail right now they dont have enough proof and thats the nut of it and of course im going to communicate all of caryns relationships to the inspector and he may follow up on some or all of them i may even lodge a complaint about the course of the investigation thus far with the da who happens to be a friend of mine of course she added thatll go nowhere but it might be a fun exercise so meanwhile what am i supposed to do gina and wyatt exchanged a look that might have been conspiratorial or skeptical most people gina said in a relaxed tone wait it out see what happens well call me a pain in the ass stuart replied but thats what ive been doing the last couple of days and any more of it doesnt really appeal to me a few minutes later theyd moved downstairs to the living room and along to the question of the garage door stuart had typically brushed off bethanys testimony that it had been him in his car and wanted to concentrate on the bare fact of somebody getting into his garage concluding with what he had up to this moment always taken to be obvious but that means it had to be somebody we know or that caryn knew excuse me gina said but hasnt that been the assumption all along anyway she was after all in the hot tub naked she always went in the hot tub naked stuart said but now im wondering we dont know that whoever it was went in the hot tub with her or even drank that other glass of wine it might have been caryn who knocked the first glass off onto the deck where it broke so she got out and cleaned up most of it then her killer showed up snuck up and hit her with the bottle then pushed her under it didnt mean she was having an affair with him or with anybody thats true gina conceded maybe she wasnt wyatt agreed quickly stuart perhaps needed that belief and hunt was inclined to let him have it but lets go back to the garage door youre saying caryn must have known her killer because he had a device or some other way to open the garage door which shed presumably given him is that it right stuart said well no sorry but not necessarily hunt said lots of cars nowadays theyve got buttons in the visor or the roof and you can set them to the frequency of your garage door so you dont need the little box so anybody whod ever been around your garagea meter reader a tradesman the gardener the garbage man anybodycould have essentially stolen your frequency if they wanted to so youre saying maybe this tsnk guy not impossible hunt said anybody gina saw movement out the window and spoke up heres devin she said gina went to open the door and juhle was one step inside halfway through his greeting to her when he stopped glaring at hunt wyatt he said with a measured calm what are you doing here hunt standing with stuart by the couch shrugged working too hard as usual starting off jovially but when juhle didnt respond he said gina had a computer question so youve been on his computer without waiting for a reply his eyes now dark juhle spun back to gina did i dream telling you not to touch anything until i got here did you think that didnt include wyatt then back to hunt how long have you been on this hunt shrugged again gina called me and i drove right on out im not talking this particular computer problem wyatt you know that i mean how long have you been involved in this case i just met him hunt said not what i asked juhle snapped but gina stepped up into his space what are you getting at devin i asked wyatt to come out and look at stuarts computer see if he could tell where these threatening emails might have originated thats all there is to it no it isnt wyatts working for you while hes pumping me for information no pumping was involved dev you never asked and for the record i wasnt on anybodys clock but while im on stuarts case here ive got to tell you this email hes got is what i believe you inspectors would call a clue and since you missed it and were giving it to you so you dont wind up making a big mistake maybe you could chill a bit on the accusations about whose side im on im here for the same reason you are dev gina asked me i think wed all like to get a handle on who were actually looking for caryns killer hows that juhle clearly still didnt like it he threw a last malevolent glance at hunt another at gina even halfturned as though he would be going back out the door hed just entered but at last he got himself settled enough to talk so what have you actually got suddenly though and to everyone elses surprise stuart spoke up before we get to that inspector he said we should tell you about the garage door what about it gina held out a flat palm hoping to cut off her client stuart no he said this is relevant wyatt was just telling us how anyone stuart ginas voice cut through the room brooking no dissent i mean it we dont want to hear it maybe i do juhle said by now gina had moved up between the inspector and her client im sure you do but youre not going to she turned back to stuart making sure he was getting her message everything was strategy very little was truth let juhle think that theyd found holes in his case and let him convey that impression to the da now inspector she continued i invited you out here to look at these emails if youre interested the computers upstairs she turned and started walking and the men fell in behind her hunt sat again at the keyboard and the rest of them huddled behind him in the small room hunt took them all back to the first email and this was after what again juhle asked an article in sunset stuart replied just recipes for cooking trout outdoors juhle glanced briefly at the threatening email guys obviously a nutcase the point gina said is that it wasnt stuart he didnt send this you got any way to prove that from the console hunt spoke up thats the problem dev we cant but suddenly stuart interrupted excuse me gina permission to speak she looked over at him probably not not here anyway how about out there stuart indicated the adjoining room it might be worthwhile okay she spoke to the other men give us a second guys be right back gina and stuart were about five steps out of the room when juhle started in i dont know if youve ever heard of it wyatt but weve got this thing in law enforcement called obstruction of justice where if you impede an investigation you can go to jail hunt tapped idly at the keyboard has somebody we know impeded an investigation briefing a suspects lawyer on the progress of an official investigation might even fall under aiding and abetting hunt stopped with the keyboard turned around more impatient than angry he laid it out straight give it a rest dev you know i work for ginas firm you knew she was representing stuart if you chose not to put that together thats your problem my friend not mine i never admitted nor denied anything about my involvement or lack thereof with gina when we talked the other night and you never asked so whats the issue juhle started to say something but hunt held up a finger stopping him and you didnt give me any information i wouldnt have known by the next day anyway none of which i might add convicts gorman of anything taken together it well might wyatt but hunt shook his head which parts taken together that he was pissed off at his wife that he yelled at a highway patrol guy juhle shot back at him how about that hes got a history of domestic violence or that hes having an affair with his sisterinlaw that hes suddenly worth several million more dollars that his neighbor saw his car pull into his garage i know i know it might not have been him driving but guess what who else could have been driving his car except if it wasnt his car right the neighbor girl who admits she likes gorman also wants to nail him for murder so she lies to put him at the scene come on wyatt none of this speaks to you pointing at the computer screen hunt said not as loud as this stuff you dont really believe he sent these threats to himself no he probably didnt but i also dont see them as much of a viable threat except that the wife is dead a shrug he just as easily could have gotten his last message from this lunatic on friday and realized it would be a good distraction in fact it just as well might have been the thing that made him decide that this was a good time to do what he needed to do with his wife hunt rolled the chair back from the computer desk crossed his arms looked up at his friend its unbelievable what is how little any of what we actually know makes any difference you realize that its all mindset you think because hes the spouse he did it so everything reinforces that i know the same facts and nothing proves he did it do you know for a fact hes boinking the wifes sister i mean do you have hotel receipts pictures anything real not yet were looking very strong its all guesswork hunt looked up at his friend you know what this reminds me of me and you remember when cheney shot that guy last year the hunting accident so im out with some guys and one of em makes a joke about how dangerous it is going hunting with the vice president and another guy across the table kneejerk he says hed rather go hunting with cheney any day than get in a car with ted kennedy that reminds you of me and you my point is that cheney could have done anything killed the guy even and no matter what the facts were his supporters didnt care no matter what cheney does ted kennedys always going to be worse thats what im talking about fixed positions except im not fixed wyatt im trying to build a case and many elements of what ive found so far point to the same conclusion are you looking at anybody else nobody else has popped up as too likely how about the business partners juhle shrugged ive talked to three of em so far furth from her investment group down in palo alto and her two medical partners mcafee and pinkert and yep there might be some motive but also theres lots of alibi midnight sunday night good alibis thats a little weird itself dont you think i mean if they werent home sleeping they were all of them hunt chuckled well there you go again they have wives you ask them one divorced two blissfully married and no no reason to not yet nothing points to any of them wyatt you or roake get me something that looks real ill look into it i promise meanwhile its all gorman all the time why because he did it thats why hes made some mistakes guaranteed i just havent found any of them yet gina was back at the doorway stuart behind her what havent you found yet juhle didnt miss a beat any way to tie these threats to a person or even a location its going to make it tough what have you two been up to out there indicating her client gina said stuarts got some diaries he keeps up notes on his trips pictures since we know the dates of these emails he wanted to check if he was out in the wilderness when they got sent which would pretty much eliminate him as the sender right possibly and well the first date august twentythird last year he was in the middle of a sixday hike in the bitteroots with two friends of his one of them jedd conley california assemblyman jedd conley who probably wouldnt lie about whether or not theyd brought computers along they didnt heres the photo of the three of them identities and dates on the back gina thought the photo was persuasive enough as she passed it over to juhle three guys with loaded backpacks gathered around the hood of stuarts suv and stuart didnt send these messages inspector theyre legitimate threats and the last one appears to have been carried out juhle took in that information with a stone face wyatt hunt twisted around to look at him and said well its a complication juhle conceded except that the threats werent really directed at caryn were they juhle having gone the defense team was back downstairs in the kitchen hunt sat across from gina at the table his hands folded in front of him from his perch on the counter stuart said facts arent going to make any difference are they juhles not seeing them gina said hes going to have to deal with this latest stuff on some level all things being equal we bring these emails up in front of a jury weve got a good leg up on reasonable doubt right there okay but i dont want to keep talking about being in front of a jury that means im arrested weve got to keep it from getting to there granted gina said but weve got to be realistic too and prepared so what are you saying stuart asked that hes going to arrest me no matter what even if he doesnt find any new evidence what do you mean new hunt asked he doesnt have any yet does he not much physical evidence no gina said and as i say today might actually have slowed him down she threw a glance at her client but realistically weve got to be aware that its not going to take too much more stuart maybe just the da saying he wants to go for it its high profile enough that gerry abrams just might want the opportunity whos gerry abrams an assistant da hunt said a tad ambitious as gina will attest she nodded gerry does love a challenge terrific stuart said so what do i do in the meanwhile gina and wyatt shared a glance neither of them had an answer for him no thanks he didnt have much of an appetite and didnt want to join gina and wyatt for lunch when theyd gone stuart paced in a cold fury from the hot tub on the enclosed porch in the back out through the library back into the kitchen across the dining room and then the large living room and up the stairs to theirnow hisbedroom down the hallway to kymberlys room at the front of the house he peeked through one of the two windows through slats in the blinds and noticed bethanys window in the house directly across the way her own blinds were open the rooms light thoughtlessly left on and if he squinted through the stillbright noon sunlight stuart could just make out what appeared to be a poster on bethanys bedroom wall scanning down he got to bethanys front door abruptly stepping back from the window he realized how close the two buildings werea hundred feet less he could clearly read the greenish brass numbers of their street address set in the stucco next to the door bethanys identification of his car even in the dark would be credible if not compelling if she got it in front of a jury the thought of himself in front of a jury turned him around and brought him beyond the master bedroom to the back end of the house there beside his tiny office in a closet filled with file cabinets piles of manuscript pages rarely worn clothing and free samples of fishing and other outdoor gear hed endorsed he moved an old blanket and some sweaters and junk out of the way and got down on one knee with the door open behind him for the light he worked the combination on his safe reached in and felt the old crown royal bag in which he kept his gun wrapped and pulled it out as always the smith wesson gve pistol felt heavier than he knew it to be its empty unloaded weight was less than two pounds but the thing always had what he considered to be a psychic heft that made up for its diminutive size at four inches of barrel length the gun was a short snubby recreational weapon that hed bought on a lark long before his marriage and rarely used since hed bought it basically for fun but today in his nonreflective mood he stood with the velvet bag and its gun in one hand its two clips and one box of bullets in the other and crossed the room to sit at his desk moving his keyboard out of the way he reached in and pulled out the gun doubly wrapped as it was in an old oilstained tshirt he unwrapped the package and set it down in front of him he always kept it clean and well oiled and now he felt a modicum of satisfaction that it was ready to shoot checking the date on his nearly full box of mm bullets he realized that he must have bought the ammunition on his last trip to the range at the beginning of the summer more good news he didnt want to have to stop and buy more bullets and face even the cursory questions of a clerk or worse possible recognition pulling each bullet out individually he checked them for external imperfections but found none in any of the nine eight for the clip and then after racking a round one in the chamber that he slapped into the pistols handle neither were there any bullet problems for the second clip that he slipped into the pocket of his levis the gun loaded now the safety on and doublechecked stuart stood up and leaving his empty crown royal bag and half box of bullets on the computer table he went back to the safe reaching in he grabbed from a pile of fiftydollar bills that he kept there for just such an emergency flipping through the money it seemed to him that it was significantly less than he thought hed put away but there were still several hundred dollars all told plenty to get by on for a while closing the door and twisting the combo lock he went back to his computer moved the ammunition box out of the way and put the loaded gun onto the desk proper in his ergonomic chair he brought the keyboard back down in front of him on his email screen he stared at the latest threat for the briefest instant before hitting the reply icon and typing his own message back out of habit he reread what hed typed for spelling mistakes and typos and finding none moved his mouse up to send and clicked the text come and get me you cowardly son of a bitch satisfied he turned off the computer picked up his s w and carried it into his bedroom where he placed it carefully on the madeup bed he did not own anything but a generic belt holster and had no intention of using that nor did he have a permit to carry a concealed weapon and that is what he fully intended to do but first he needed to throw some things together he kept his travel duffel bag on a peg in his bedroom closet and he put that next to the gun on the bed then went to his dresser and pulled out a weeks worth of socks and underwear he didnt know how long this was going to take at the moment he couldnt have said with any specificity what this even was his brain took him to the probable day of his wifes funeralthe following monday or tuesdaybut refused to go any further all he knew was that he wasnt going to jailnot for a week not for a day not for an hour in the bathroom he gathered up a small selection of essential toiletries he thought he might find himself having trouble with sleep over the next few days so he threw in a truly ancient perhaps no longer effective halfconsumed bottle of dalmane sleeping pills that caryn had needed for a while and her remaining vicodin a few tablets back in the bedroom he rolled up another pair of jeans four tshirts a lightweight fleece undershirt and two identical brown pullover sweaters it was warm today but you never knew this was san francisco and it could be midwinter by dinnertime the telephone by his bed rang and he started to lift the receiver but finally let it go until the machine picked up on the fifth ring he heard a female voice downstairs on the answering machine but couldnt tell who it was exactly debra gina kymberly some reporter he couldnt say and didnt care finally in the new jangling quiet he stood in his closet staring at his hanging clothes he needed a moderately heavy jacket that allowed freedom of movement that would call no attention to himself that would cover where he intended should the need arise to tuck his gun into his belt at the center of his back he chose a graygreen frontzipping parka from mountain hardwear and wrapped the gun in it then stuffed it into the duffel and zipped it shut downstairs leaving his duffel bag on the dining room table stuart went out to the hot tub area one last time he leaned over the tub for most of a minute but nothing in these surroundings stuck to him he picked up no sense of caryns presence of her ghost there was only humidity and the faint whiff of chlorine and a vast emptiness the house had a side door that led to a walkway along the fence at the edge of his property aware of the growing probability of reporters lurkingjuhle had reported a sighting on the street when hed come by as had gina and hunt earlierand wanting to avoid them at all costs stuart went down through the garage and out that door then along the fence into his backyard a small wasteland of yellowing grass and untended planter beds stopping on the grass and looking up at the back windows of his surrounding neighbors he made sure that no one happened to be staring out just at that moment satisfied he continued down to the end of the fence where a gate opened into another steep uphill walkway between two other houses coming out on larkin he walked downhill for three driveways and stopped at the fourth taking one last quick look around for reporters or bystanders no one he already had his key out and now he put it where it belonged in the garage door turned it and opened the door up scarce parking everywhere in san francisco but particularly here on russian hill had forced him to rent this place for his old black ford f pickup truck for about the last seven years beginning at eighty dollars a montha hundred and fifty now and considered a bargain at that throwing his duffel bag onto the floor on the passenger side he slid in behind the wheel he fished around in the glove box for his leatherman tool then got out with that and walked to the street which was lined with parked cars picking out a vehicle at random and making sure it didnt have the window sticker that identified it as one of the neighborhood cars he squatted quickly down and removed the back license plate replacing it with his own trucks plate he went to the front and repeated the process in less than three minutes the new plates were on his pickup one minute later hed backed out closed and locked the garage behind him and driven off in the direction of jedd conleys office in north beach they sat drinking their coffees in the window of marios bohemian cigar store mostly a lunchcounter restaurant that sold cigars but only incidentally at the corner of columbus and union they were looking out at washington square park with its contingent of tai chi classes frisbeechasing dogs and because of the sunshine picnickers spread out over the grass but they werent paying any attention to the scenery or to their drinks stuart had just told him that he was going down the peninsula to talk to some of caryns business connections down there conleys face was drawn in concentration as he spun his coffee cup slowly in its saucer you want the truth i dont think its a particularly brilliant idea stu you dont know anything about these guys what theyre like and if one of them killed caryn im going on the assumption that one of them had to have killed caryn jedd not necessarily maybe it was this thou shalt not kill guy stuart went still for a second before shaking his head if it was him hell try for me next time regardless of what i do now but you just told me i know i know and if it keeps juhle offbalance for a day or two its all to the good but look at this in the first place he doesnt quietly come into my home while im not there and apparently without a weapon no hes at least got a gun hes not coming to my house to stab me in my sleep the guys writing me threats on the internet for christs sake jedd hes never going to risk letting me see him or get me into some kind of handtohand combat if he does anything hes going to shoot me probably from a distance plus he wants me not caryn maybe to punish you i dont think so and theres no sign of a struggle which there would have been if she heard the garage door and she would have she would have thought it was me coming home early and that would have got her out of the tub with a towel around her at the very least maybe not maybe while you were gone she thought about the reality of you two getting divorced and changed her mind stuarts mouth curved up but it wasnt quite a smile thats a kind thing to say jedd but that didnt happen so what are you saying im saying she knew who it was she was expecting him conley suddenly seemed to remember his coffee and took a sip then put the cup down with exaggerated care so you want to talk to who everybody i outlined to gina the people caryn did business with all the other suspects my other suspects i should say but you said they all had alibis no juhle said that they were all sleeping in their homes apparently or maybe not it could have been any of them so what do you expect to accomplish i talk to them all maybe ill flush the one who did it and then what a shrug play it by ear i suppose break the guys story take it to juhle or gina or maybe since hes already killed once hell just take you out too conley shook his head listen stu this is a bad idea you said ginas got an investigator working for her he does this stuff every day right questions witnesses checks out alibis huh let him do it and meanwhile what do i do sit around and wait for juhle to come and arrest me youve got funeral arrangements dont you youve got kym you got debra im not spending any time in jail well thats what gina no the vehemence of the answer brought conley up short hey easy he straightened up in his chair no what stu youre talking about gina and her investigator but the fact of the matter is that neither of their jobs have anything to do with keeping me out of jail if im arrested im sure theyll be great but listen to themall of them gina hunt juhle listen to them talk and you get the impression that the whole arrest scenario isnt really in anybodys hands it can just happen when some kid of a da gets a wild hair but ginas kept it from happening up till now not exactly true its either her or the fact that juhle cant find evidence that i did it in spite of my blabbing my guts out to him on day one finally stuarts features seemed to relax to a degree im not complaining about gina jedd im glad shes on board for which i have you to thank but i cant sit around and wait until somebody decides i need to be in jail ive got to do something understandable conley cocked his head so youve come back to me not that i wouldnt help you in any way i can but i cant really afford to get mixed up in this in a public way stu i get it politics hanging out with a murder suspect is bad form the help i want wouldnt be any more public than we are right now conley finished off the dregs of his coffee during which time he came to his decision all right he said what are friends for what do you need stuart cast a glance around the tiny restaurant then leaned in across the table you said youd talked to caryn on friday youd been working with her on some of the problems with pii and the socket how serious were they as though appreciating the question for the first time conley nodded almost imperceptibly his eyes narrowed all things being equal pretty serious evidently in some of the clinical trials thered been problems like what conley hesitated like apparently people dying apparently people dont apparently die jedd they actually die did caryn know about this she must have she was trying to understand what had happened first there was ambiguity how could there be ambiguity people either died or they didnt right right sure but these deaths happened after the study had been published so due to the length of time before the problem showed up there was some question about whether it was the result of the hip replacement or not and caryn was trying to find out essentially yes you know as a public service my office looks into certain kinds of business fraud on behalf of some of our constituencies and caryn asked if jedd you already got my vote im sure you did what you needed to do but youre saying caryn might have been threatening to blow the whistle on pii about these deaths which would cost all of the investors big money wouldnt it i dont know if shed gotten to that yet but it id say she was in the process of deciding what she was going to do and who was she talking to about this besides you the guy in palo alto furth mostly yes i believe fred furth elbow resting out the drivers side window letting the warm and fragrant air swirl around him in the trucks cab stuart gorman kept his pickup at the speed limit all the way on the countrys most scenic freeway the out of san francisco down the fortysome miles to palo alto he almost missed the small polishedgranite sign indicating the headquarters of sand hill equities banka long low black glass building that appeared to be built directly into a tawnybrown hillside off page mill road as he pulled into the parking lot which was graciously shaded with olive trees stuart realized that his ride didnt exactly fit into the prevailing motif of luxury automobiles he wondered about the location of the local dealership that obviously gave away all the mercedes bmws lexuses and the random porsche since he figured there was no way that this many people could afford to buy them parking far over to one side to retain a tenuous obscurity he got out of the cab in the nowimpressive heat and caught a glimpse of himself reflected in the buildings surface jeans tshirt hiking boots he couldnt put on his jacket in this weather to cover his s w which meant that the gun remained wrapped in the jacket inside his duffel bag so much for preparation idiot he said it didnt matter the receptionist somehow conveyed the impression that billionaires dressed any way they damn pleased and when fred furth heard who was waiting outside in the lobby to speak to him even though stuart didnt have an appointment he came right out in his midthirties with a square jaw perfect teeth and an athletes body molded into a twothousanddollar suit he nevertheless managed to exude both sincerity and sympathy mr gorman frederick furth fred stuart furth had a crushing grip its good to meet you at last although i wish it could have been under less difficult circumstances we are all still devastated here about caryn and of course anything we can do to help you he turned to his receptionist well be in my office carol no calls please no interruptions mr gorman stuart this way they walked in silence down a cool wide dove gray corridor and into a very spacious office made distinctive by a floortoceiling window that covered twothirds of the facing wall until it disappeared into the hillside into which the building had been built behind furths desk the back wallwindowlessfeatured six inset computer terminals and two television screens all of them on and in the case of the tvs with the sound turned down but furth didnt head toward his desk but instead to a seating area of functional leather chairs over where the room was brightest as stuart was sitting down taking in his surroundings the banker asked if he could get him anything if it helps you decide im having coffee peets sounds good stuart said blacks fine a hightech burnishedsteel coffee machine claimed pride of place on the counter furth moved efficiently he pulled mugsnot cups and saucersdown from the builtin cabinets placed one under each spigot on the machine and pushed one button in less than a minute the coffee was in front of them and stuart took a sip thanks for seeing me i know you must be busy i probably should have called first but ive been running on automatic for the past couple of days furth waved that off id imagine so id actually thought of calling you but he paused but you wanted to see if i got myself arrested first a muted acknowledgment shoulders slipping an inch a quick twitch of an embarrassed smile maybe a little of that sorry stuart nodded for the record i didnt kill my wife the papers everybody in factseems to have it wrong i wasnt there when it happened all right furth said it wouldnt be the first time the media got things wrong they need a story for the moment youre the story ive been there too we can agree that it sucks now how can i help you stuarts drive down here had been an unraveling and evolving fantasy where he terrorized the men with whom caryn had been involved furth the first of them now he was facing this charming and confident businessman in the flesh and suddenly his very presence here struck him as somewhat ludicrous even surreal to be honest with you im not certain he began im trying to get a handle on some parts of caryns life that i didnt know too much about one of the first things i came across is i understand that she was having some issues with pii financial and otherwise and that you were the point man she talked to about all that im not sure of everything youre talking about but youre probably right that was me but if youre saying you think theres some connection between those issues and her death id say youre wildly off the mark im not saying that not yet anyway i dont even know what the issues were furth killed a few seconds with his coffee then put the mug down on the glass table in front of them and sat back in his chair crossing a leg it was the opposite of an antagonistic posture relaxed and open he seemed ready to talk you said financial and otherwise whats the otherwise i guess it would fall under ethics shed heard her socket had killed some people a cock of the head i thought you said you didnt know the issues not all of them and i just found this one out an hour ago so its true well furth said thats still to be determined there are questions certainly and caryn wanted them answered before final fda approval that would have been her choice yes and what was holding that up getting answers furth brought his hand up to his adams apple and pulled at the knot of his tie he cleared his throat well the company pii did the usual rigorous clinical testing of course as the fda mandates on any new product and the results of these tests assured the company and the investors that there was no problem with going into full production except that there was a problem well of course when people die youve got at the very least a perceptual problem now furth uncrossed his legs and came forward a bit in his chair a smile that begged for understanding but the fact is the deaths were only reported long after the study period so they were outside the studys parameters but the people really did die didnt they werent there autopsies to find out why in some cases yes but the results were inconclusive inconclusive how in the way that blood clots can come from any number of sources not necessarily from complications of hip replacement surgery three to five years before so these people they died of blood clot complications basically yes how many of them to date weve had formal confirmation of six but you have to remember that this is out of over six hundred surgeries so its exactly in the ballpark of typical postop clots which is about one in a hundred and remember that none of the patients were under sixty the dryden socket wasnt causing those deaths it was most probably the surgeries themselves typical complications tragic of course but typical and what did caryn think about that furth shrugged turned his palms up utterly forthcoming if you want the truth i think she was just hypersensitive because it was her invention with her name on it and everything once pii goes into full production the numbers are going to be staggering the profit numbers i mean sheboth of youwere going to become very very rich i think the magnitude and reality of it made her nervous stuart strongly doubted the truth of this if anything the oppositethat she would experience even a temporary setback in her pursuit of moneywould be more likely to make her nervous but there was nothing to be gained by voicing that opinion instead he said so what was she calling you about she wanted me to intervene with pii she thought they could solve the problem in two years or so once they got a clear understanding of what it was again from the late reports some more autopsies that sort of thing she wanted to put production on hold seeing that stuart seemed to understand and accept the basic issue furth sat back more comfortably again essentially yes whichi think you must knowwell you know about caryns mezzanine loan of course sure the broad strokes well hers wasnt the only one and a delay of two years or more at this stage i mean some of the investors another shrug i think you can see the problem i think so stuart clipped out the response and realized that he was struggling to keep the outrage from his voice caryn was threatening to blow the whistle on what shed come to believe was a faulty product and if she succeeded it would cost some people maybe millions of dollars isnt that about it i dont think she was quite to the point of blowing the whistle on anything she just needed some handholding the usual lastminute reassurance she wanted to go forward as much as the next investor i believe she didnt talk to you about trying to postpone piis production not with any specificity no there really was just too much riding on all this in another couple of months both of you would have been smiling all the way to the bank im sure of it stuart felt that if he sat more than another minute or two under furths unyielding gaze with its unflappable geniality he might be forced to come back inside the building with his gun and blow the guy away just on general principles but there was one more avenue he needed to explore if gently so fred let me askhas a homicide inspector named juhle called you the change of topic didnt scare furth in fact it seemed to put him on firmer ground somehow matteroffact he nodded yesterday he asked what i was doing sunday night let me guess stuart said sleeping in bed eleven oclock sunday night what would anybody be doing if youve got to be up at five thirty five thirty wall street time youre in the markets thats when youre up if you want to make the sixthirty bell but you already knew what id told him a question stuart said i asked him if he was even looking for any other suspectsbesides meand he said hed checked alibis with everybody on caryns cell phone which included you so now youre asking me the question didnt seem to bother him or maybe fred furth was so programmed for affability in his career that like marie antoinette he wouldnt show any anger or resentment even if he were facing his executioner i mean no offense stuart said adopting the tone but somebody must be lying about where they were if they killed caryn and i intend to find out who that was well again palms up unfeigned innocence it wasnt me id say you could ask my wife or any of my three kids but id really prefer you didnt see the need to do that but because my heart goes out to you it really does ill tell you more than the inspector asked i barbecued a chicken on my new rotisserie it was great rosemary and lemon outstanding and had half a bottle of wineyou know chalk hill chardonnay awesome stuff then put the kids down by seven thirtythe oldest is six so bedtimes always early and i was sawing logs myself by nine so no i didnt kill caryn besides which i thought she was a great person smart interesting fun stuart nodded and suddenly found himself unable to speak evidently his wife had remained smart interesting and fun to some people right up until the time shed been killed covering his emotional lapse with a sip of coffee stuart put his mug down and got to his feet one more thing if you dont mind did any of the other investors know she was working to get this postponement on going into full production not that i know of not through me certainly someone may have gotten some wind of it out of pii directly but even that would have been unusual well a chagrined look on his face stuart held out a hand thanks for your time sorry for the questions no problem furth said i wish i could have been more help the cab of stuarts truck baked at close to one hundred degrees out in the lot opening both doors for crossventilation he checked behind the front seat on the passenger side where hed stashed his duffel bag and saw that it was where and how hed left it and then on second thought brought it out and reached down to the bottom where hed thrown in his littleused first generation cell phone going to stand in the shade of an olive tree while the cab aired out he punched in his daughters number hey dad where are you how did you know it was me youre kidding right youre in my address book you call your name comes up where on the window in front hello but lets play another game where are you palo alto talking to some people mom did business with what about what she was doing with them if maybe it made somebody mad at her shouldnt the cops be doing that theyre not though and ive decided im not going to get arrested so its up to me what do you mean youre not going to get arrested i mean pretty much the standard meaning im not going to jail yeah but dad i dont think its like they ask your opinion no i know which is why i wanted to call you and tell you how you could reach me if you need to youve got my cell number didnt we just do this its in my phone how else would it know it was you calling right yeah of course but my point is that you can reach me anytime but dont tell anybody you know where i am anybody what about your lawyer no ill contact her if i need to what about debra you can tell debra but i dont really want to talk to her why not shes being nice to me i know that shes a fine person and im glad shes letting you stay with her but i just cant talk to her right now okay and i promise ill do what i need to for the funeral but for now ive got to do some things and maybe stay out of sight but what if i mean if they say youre under arrest they can just come and get you if they can find me which is why i dont want you telling anybody about my number but they might shoot you dont they do that for like resisting arrest nobodys going to shoot me kym im just laying low okay i dont like it i really dont like it daddy well what if they do shoot you then what first mom and then i mean what am i supposed to do if this stuart knew was classic kym beginning her downward spiral and it was only going to get worse if he didnt stand firm sweetie sweetie sweetie hold up whoa well be in touch all the time you and me im not going to confront any policemen i promise if they find me ill go along but i really really want to avoid that im not going to let anybody kill me cops or anybody else you know what you tell me whenever i say anything like that no what famous last words it took him the better part of five minutes to end that conversation on anything less than a disastrously negative note but he kept at it until his daughter was at least giving lip service to respecting his decision in the course of the talk though he asked her if shed tried to reach him at their house earlier in the day and shed told him no debra hadnt tried to call him either hed been sure it was a womans voice on the answering machine when hed been packing so it must have been gina which meant there may have been a development he considered it for a few seconds and decided it probably wouldnt be profitable to talk to her in person plus he was all argued out with his daughter so he called his own home number to get the message gina must have left but it wasnt gina hello this is kelley gray rusnak from pii calling for stuart stuart i dont know if you remember me but i was caryns lab assistant down here you and i met a couple of times i see what theyre saying in the papers about you and caryn but you know ive read all your books and i just dont believe youre the kind of person who could hurt someone especially caryn and i dont know maybe youre already in jail but i havent heard that on the news yet and i probably would have so i thought id try to reach you at your home number i think maybe theres something you should know about thats been going on here that caryn was kind of worried about the pii corporate offices and laboratories were located in the industrial flats pocked by lowrise development near the san francisco airport kelley rusnak seemed relieved to hear back from stuart but didnt want to talk about it on the telephone stuart convinced her to take some time off and meet him in half an hour at the hungry hunter a steak house just off the freeway in san bruno perhaps ten minutes from where she worked the cab of the truck had cooled to mere lava but stuart barely noticed kicking himself for not having answered the phone in his house when kelleys information whatever it was might have done him some good in his discussions with fred furth or even juhle he was obviously speeding as he flew past a palo alto city police car waiting at the front of a line at a red light on el camino slamming on his brakes then jamming down a couple of gears his eyes were glued to the rearview as the cop turned in behind him and lit up his red flashers a murder suspect driving a vehicle with a stolen license plate carrying a loaded gun in the cab stuart put on his blinker and began to pull over but the patrol car swung left around him as it passed the officer in the passenger seat wagged a finger at stuart but evidently theyd gotten a call to some event that trumped his traffic stop raising his own hand acknowledging the warning with a wary smile stuart continued on the el camino for another block before turning off the main thoroughfare into a side streetany side street with his stomach churning and his head gone light with the close call he wound his way through a neighborhood of mostly brandnew mansions to the freeway entrance he was at the hungry hunter parking lot fifteen minutes later it was past lunchtime now and still an hour or more before happy hour was to begin so there was no problem with parking stuart was rolling up his drivers side window when a knock on the other window almost made him jump when hed gotten kelleys message and even when hed talked to her and set up this meeting he hadnt been completely sure which of caryns lab colleagues kelley was but now reaching over and unlocking the door he recognized her right away she was an inch on either side of five feet tall probably in her midthirties with shoulderlength black hair and a faintly cherubic face unadorned by makeup of any kind even lipstick do you mind if we just talk out here in your cab although shed already climbed in and closed the door behind her turning to face him she let out an anxious breath tried a mostly unsuccessful smile and said hi hi how are you doing im a little nervous to tell you the truth what about coming to see me not just that but that too yes driving over here i even thought somebody might have been following me they passed by and went on the freeway but still why would somebody be following you no reason really and they probably werent but things have been so weird lately and then with caryn im so sorry about her she was really really special i still cant believe it im having some troubles with that myself stuart turned and looked around behind them out over the parking lot well kelley we seem to be the only ones out here if you want we could go someplace else or just drive whatever you want she shook her head no im sure this is all right im just being paranoid a quick smile which of course doesnt mean that theyre not after me who would be after you well i guess whoever might have been after caryn were talking concerns about the dryden socket right she nodded stuart took a beat then rolled his window down again and rested his hands on the bottom of the steering wheel just before i called you i was visiting with frederick furth down in palo alto he said you know him by name sure he was caryns goto guy for the money stuff right he told me that caryn was just having some lastminute jitters thats all it was nothing serious you dont agree with that not even a little bit thats just not true she was going to try to stop them from going into full production if she could at least thats what she told me last week but why kelley furth told me about the problems that didnt make it into the clinical studies okay but those werent problems stuart they were deaths right furth acknowledged that he wasnt trying to hide anything that i could see he said youre always going to get a certain percentage of deaths in any major surgeries like these from various complications postop clots that kind of thing right a certain percentage did he happen to tell you what that percentage was he said about one in a hundred which is whats coming back from these clinical trials i think he said theyve had six deaths in six hundred surgeries something like that which is right in the pocket for this kind of surgery in general she was looking at him in disbelief he told you one in a hundred hes off by a factor of five how could that be i mean all this stuff is published isnt it its public record right and so farso farits true theyve had those six confirmed deaths that have been in the first published studies the ones that came in just a little too late i suppose youve heard about that since thats what all the fuss has been about the late reports except what mr furth left out is that these arent the only studies reporting fatalities theyre just the only ones that have been vetted and published so far and caryn knew about others of course shes the inventor she wanted to see the earliest drafts which evidently they tried to keep from her too and pretty successfully who did furth the money people and of course bill blair our ceo once we pulled through the first round of clinical trials they were all gung ho for full production but caryn had gotten some calls from docs she knew that had had problems she even had a couple of her own patients show some disturbing signs and it worried her some of these details rang with a distant familiarity in stuarts mind he was sure that caryn had mentioned some of this to him back when she was first starting to test her new socket her concerns about every aspect of the product but he hadnt paid very close attention caryn was all about problems and their solutions she was the original girl who cried wolfeverything was a crisis a problem a challenge their daughter wouldnt eat dinner one night and caryn would harangue his ear off about how kym was borderline anorexic or bulimic if a patient had a rough nights sleep after surgeryand almost all of them didcaryn would worry it to death until finally stuart feeling it was out of selfdefense just finally shut her off he couldnt listen to any more what ifs shed talk and talk one critical topicmoney the state of health care polymer chemistry her patients kymberlyflowing seamlessly into the next and each one fraught with danger possible failure alternatives to consider exhausting constant and exhausting until he was left nodding pitching in with the occasional uhhuh but now sitting here with kelley he realized that many of the things that engrossed caryn might in fact have been damned interesting even compelling certainly the details surrounding the dryden socket were fascinatingand incredibly importantto him right now at this moment but back when it had been a part of caryns daily existence he had been tuned out deaf to the songs that gave meaning to his wifes life it had not all been her shutting him out at least not at the beginning hed been equally complicit perhaps more so in the dissolution of their intimacy the thought hit him suddenly and unexpectedly in a wave of regret and loss and brought him up short his hand suddenly at his forehead as though pressing away a migraine stuart are you all right he nodded at her im sorry my mind just went out where were we clotting kelley said hypercoagulability sure stuart said i was going to say that youre teasing but its a real thing its what caryn was trying to fix could a layperson understand it if he wanted to explain it to his lawyer for example i think so you know that the basic problem caryn set for herself was to find a plastic for the cupside of the hip that didnt degrade right generally yes okay so she knows polymer chemistry inside out she discovers this one particular type of highdensity polyethylene whoa kelley were dumbing it down okay an impatient pout then kelley continued highdensity polyethylene is dumbed down im afraid you dont want to hear the technical name bottom line is she found a plastic that worked in animal trials as you know what wasnt working before stuart asked the basic problem some people caryn included believed that the industry standard plastic was the proximate cause of even the one percent of blood clots and even worse over time the plastic elutes a chemical it does what elutes produces a chemical that dramatically increases coagulation in some people its called small particle diseasetheres a laymans term for youand its often fatal and thats what caryn was trying to avoid right she thought or hoped anyway that she could drastically reduce that one percent clotting number maybe down to one in a thousand cases or less so i think its important to understand that even if mr furth was correct on the fatality number he gave you and hes not the dryden socket at one percent failure was no improvement over what weve been doing for years and in fact caryn was most of the way to convinced that it was worse how much worse kelley bit at her lower lip and took in a deep breath maybe a lot maybe as much as five percent those are the preliminary figures from studies that arent completed yet five in a hundred deaths from the same thing small particle disease no in fact weve done several coagulation cascades and this is kind of the opposite where were seeing the creation of multinucleated giant cells which essentially become osteoclasts that eat bone eat bone not good im guessing it is bad its going to be much worse though if pii goes into full production but if they know this why would they go ahead with it i mean theyve got to realize that theyre looking at lawsuits forever theyd be killing themselves not if they could get the problem fixed soon enough they could take orders start some cash flow going have the delay later in the process rather than sooner caryn was already working on it narrowing down some other options another plastic right and pretty sure she was on the right track she told me she thought we had a good chance to solve the problem in two years maybe less but its a time and money game with pii theyre evidently strapped pretty badly right now and if theres more delay before the fda gives them a green light i know about that at least i know that caryn put up a lot of shortterm money stuart struck with another insight drummed his hands on the steering wheel which would mean that at the time she did the mezzanine loan she must have believed pii was going into production pretty soon right and was okay with it but she wasnt okay with it i know she wasnt a silence settled in the cab finally kelley said look she thought the money she gave them was to buy time for her research that was her clear understanding except then she found out they werent reporting the negative studies and planned to go ahead anyway and when did she find that out im not sure exactly but recently certainly by last week she was down here i think it was on wednesday and had evidently just gotten word from mr furth that the fda was days or weeks away from approval and she was having a fit about it she went into mr blairs office and he told her that the deaths had occurred after the study was completed and therefore they shouldnt technically affect the fdas ruling which was going to send pii stock through the roof and meanwhile she should just keep up her work on the next generation how did she respond to that how do you think she told him it was unconscionable and that if he went ahead she was going to go to the newspapers it was her name on the socket and she wasnt going to allow it to hurt people so what did blair do he backed down a little evidently at least thats what caryn told me when she came back out to the lab they were all going to have another meeting this week and see if they could all come to some decision that made everybody happy but she wasnt too optimistic and the meeting was supposed to be this week probably today kelley said she usually came down here to work on wednesdays except of course now there wont be she stopped abruptly as her eyes teared up for a few seconds she fought the urge to cry at last swallowing gathering her strength she went on so you see why i felt i had to talk to you assistant district attorney gerry abrams showed up uninvited at devin juhles desk in homicide at a little after four when juhle had just gotten himself arranged to write up an incredibly depressing witness interview hed had with a despondent mother in a case he was following up on after hed left stuart gormans house abrams breezed by the lockers across from him knocking on the top of one of them to announce his arrival when juhle looked up he started right in the soul of enthusiastic good cheer i must say you look a bit peaked my good man ive been thinking about gorman and i predict itll cheer you right up juhle threw his pen down on the desk relieved after all at the respite he pushed himself back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest you know who ive been thinking about ger fidel fucking rayas thats who wondering why weve got to waste time and money on a trial for the son of a bitch because my son as im sure you know and appreciate hes innocent in the eyes of the law until proven guilty who is he christina hidalgos boyfriend also ps the killer of her son age five months shook him did he juhle nodded maybe a bit more than that although hes on his way to convincing christina that it wasnt his fault at least enough that she wont testify to it he didnt really shake him he just picked the kid up trying to quiet it down and then he just stopped breathing maybe because his skull got cracked somehow falling off his bed maybe abrams closed the gap between himself and juhles desk and plunked himself on a corner of it tell her if it wasnt him the only person that leaves is her that ought to bring her right around drawing a deep breath fully disgusted juhle let out a string of matteroffact profanity i want to just shoot him right now he concluded i swear to god i do abrams nodded i couldnt agree more dev really the saddest thing about life here in san francisco is theres no chance getting a death penalty maybe you could arrest him and accidentally slam into a telephone pole while youre driving him downtown guys like fidel i bet theyre too macho to use their seat belts youre going fast enough hes toast juhle perked up straightened in his chair you know what ger thats not a bad idea cost of a car against a murder trial the city wins big time i could get a medal juhle took a breath seemed to shake the evil thoughts off his body changed the subject so what were you thinking about gorman i thought yesterday we didnt have any evidence you get something i dont know about no but i watched the news last night the fox his wifes sister you saw her then she was hard to miss vavoom huh at least but you put her in the mix suddenly we might be at a tipping point is she in the mix were they together abrams fairly beamed why i love television noon news just breaking her exhusband says they went up to his cabinthat cabin againfor nearly a week alone together juhle whistled impressed but wait he said theres been another development beyond that not saying its going to untip you but you need to hear about it whats that abrams listened while juhle explained about the tsnk emails when the story was over he said hes going proactive thats all trying to give us something else get us off him thats how i read it too juhle said but it was a pretty good press his lawyer and her investigator whos the lawyer gina roake abrams brightened roake i dont recall her ever doing a homicide before i should ask around if she hasnt its something else to consider the call on whether or not to bring him in is close enough if hes got a firsttimer defending him odds on us go up maybe only slightly but with everything else that might be enough so what were you thinking about that brought you down here what we actually had suddenly the assistant district attorney was on his feet pacing between juhles desk and the lockers look weve been going on about the lack of physical evidence and theres no doubt thats a problem the question is whether its insurmountable with this woman finallythe sisterinlawim starting to believe maybe it isnt im listening okay youre a jury you hear about gorman leaving the lakes at two oclock in the morning squirrelly right off the bat no he takes way too long to show up at rancho cordova and by the way i did check and there were no traffic problems any way you cut it theres lost time in there it makes more sense that he drove up from the city after the murder then hes got a neighborand not just any neighbor someone whos going to be a hostile witness for us and his daughters friendwho puts him and his car at the house hes doing cpr on a corpse in full rigor when the first squad arrives then theres the money and finally now the other woman this thing sings like pavarotti youre preaching to the choir gerry but youre the da youve got to make the call abrams eyes flicked at the ceiling came back to juhle we dont do something hes gonna walk are you expecting more from the morgue or the lab nope we could always get surprised but abrams crossed back to the lockers one more time his finger tattooing the echoing metal trying to make up his mind just at that moment the telephone on the desk rang juhle held a finger up to abrams and picked it up juhle homicide he all but came to attention in his chair straightening up grabbing for his pen yes mrs robley he said go ahead im listening and as he listened his face clouded over until it was set in darkness yes maam he said should i talk to her no sure i understand after another minute of monosyllables juhle hung up and looked over at gerry abrams bethany robleys mother he said the son of a bitch sent his own daughter to threaten bethany to change her testimony this wasnt good news for the witness by any means but it brought a cold smile to abrams face weve just tipped dev go talk to her on tape nail it down then lets go find us a judge get the sucker in jail while weve still got the chance robert mcafee greeted wyatt hunt in the doorway of the newly built warehouselike structure on geary at the eastern edge of japantown the site of the citys soontobecompleted total joint clinic was not in a lowrent neighborhood by any stretch and its nowsole principal betrayed a distinct pride of ownership as he shook hunts hand mcafee dressed more like a construction worker than a doctor in heavy work boots tan denim pants and a black and gold giants windbreaker looked young and fit enough to play with the big club he had all of his hair and none of it was gray above a subtle widows peak that bisected an unlined forehead with his piercing gray eyes strong nose good teeth and dayandahalf stubble he was as handsome as a movie star he also accepted without question and without looking at the proffered business card hunts description of himself as a defense investigator looking into the death of caryn dryden offering only but i already talked to one of your partners whose name escapes me im sorry devin juhle hunt volunteered willing to take advantage of mcafees lack of distinction between police and defense investigators hunt had done what the penal code requiredidentified himself and given the witness a business card what the witness chose to believe after that was not hunts problem that was it juhle i told him i was asleep on sunday night which i was though of course i was devastated to hear about caryn i still am but i dont know what else you need to know from me i hadnt seen her since last thursday surely im not a suspect am i hunt loved it when he was mistakenly taken for a policeman he answered with an open guileless look until somebodys arrested the fields technically open but you were home in bed when the murder occurred he phrased it as fact although he knew from gina that mcafee was stuarts pick as most likely suspect which if true meant the alibi was bogus thats right so my real interest is that as caryns business partner you might know something about her and either not know that you know it or not realize its importance okay thats possible mcafees smile came and went haphazardly hunts presence and questions clearly were rattling him but i thought youd more or less settled on stuart hes in the mix doctor but as i said theres been no arrest yet the medias made up its mind if it has one but there are some questions hunts intention wasnt to let his cop impersonation intimidate the witness he wanted to get him relaxed and talking he looked over mcafees shoulder to where construction sounds could be heard and put some enthusiasm into his tone i love these infill projects i live in a converted warehouse myself down on brannan how close are you to being finished here well now with caryn gone thats all a bit up in the air if youd like a quick tour while we talk id be happy to show you around a little thatd be great id like that thanks mcafees relief at leaving the immediate subject of caryns death was palpable he turned to indicate the reception area well where we are here this is pretty much finished he led hunt behind the counter showing off the stations the computer outlets the phone bank how many patients were you planning on handling we hoped to get up to eight a day eight a day that many people need new hips and shoulders and knees and yes even hips alone eight a day at least you and caryn were going to do four operations each every day perhaps this struck mcafee as funny perhaps he was still nervous at any rate he had a loud uninhibited laugh though he cut it off after the first couple of notes im sorry he said but no we hoped to be able to bring in associates fellow orthopedic specialists and have them on staff here within a year or two any one doctor shouldnt do more than one total joint surgery in any given day although there are some who try hunt decided to take a risk michael pinkert the name stopped him wiped the joviality from mcafees face yes hed be one of them have you been talking to him not yet but obviously you know that hed been in some negotiations with caryn and with you right you want to talk about it clearly mcafee didnt he looked back over his shoulder quickly as though considering whether he should take his inquisitor on the next leg of the clinic tour but finally flashed another false smile and leaned back against the wall you have to understand that caryn and i we went back as far as our residencies together she was an incredible womansmart driven a workaholic really like me with so much going on in her brain all the time it wasshe wasa joy to be around not that everybody saw that part of her of course she could be very abrupt i suppose and shorttempered impatient with stupidity that was all she wouldnt have liked me hunt said trying to keep his witness at least marginally on his side for as much time as he could which he was afraid wouldnt be much longer i think youre being modest inspector mcafee said in any event what im getting at is that she and i were an immensely compatible team from very early on we shared the same work ethic the same approach to our practices dr pinkert has a different philosophy than either caryn or me i didnt see him working well with us dont take offense at this doctor but were you and caryn intimate mcafee let out a breath and with it went some of the confidence in his posture i should have expected it would come to this he said mostly to himself then he nodded for about a twoweek interval about twenty years ago no more like eighteen soon after kymberlyher daughterwas born she and stuart were having troubles the girl was evidently he shook his head anyway she decided she wasnt going to leave him or end the marriage back theni dont know whybut she and i we both realized it was a mistake meeting hunts eye he said i know this looks bad but we havent been together since then and thats the truth we were friends and business partners thats all and suddenly she was betraying you by asking pinkert to join you both on this clinic well not betraying me thats a bit strong we disagreed about it sure but i didnt kill her inspector i wasnt her lover anymore youre saying she had one i cant say for sure but still you think its true mcafee wrestled with the question for a moment the reason its important hunt said is if she was having an affair her lover might have been her killer im not looking for a name doctor just a yes or a no finally mcafee nodded all right then id say yes although who it is or was i dont have any idea but i think so why anything specific nothing i could put my finger on but as i told you i knew her very well and for a very long time you pick up on changes sometime last summer she changed in what way well over the past couple of years shed become grim it was all money and business or responsibilities with her family and she did it all with a kind of lockjawed determination she wasnt going to let it beat her that things were hard that life was work and nothing else he shrugged took a beat then her daughterhave you met kymberly though he hadnt hunt nodded well on top of everything else caryn was going through a particularly difficult time right around kyms graduation very difficult id hold her handnot literallybut id listen to her complaints she was at the end evidently kym had a new boyfriend shed started sleeping with and she was staying out all night and doing drugs and stealing things and for a while there caryn seemed to lose the ability to cope with it all she felt it wasnt ever going to end that her home life with stuart and kym was this chain around her neck that was choking her and shed never get it off so what happened so one day suddenly she came in here and she was i dont know how to describe it other than radiantly happy really like her old self the change was so dramatic i had to ask her what had happened and what did she say she said shed just realized how beautiful she was i told her that of course she was and she just smiled at me and said i had no idea that was all except that after that she started to take more care with her looksnot that she needed to but i dont know how to put it exactly she looked more obviously attractivebought some new clothes wore her makeup differently smiled more she had more energy for her work she was just different and not because anything changed at home no im sure of that rather the opposite in fact i remember she found out kym had pierced herself in a very private area around this time and rather than agonizing over it as she would have a few months before she was almost breezy she said ive just got to give her a home until she goes off to college i owe her that much then im free and never a word about stuart it was like he simply ceased to exist hunt pulled out the small tape recorder he kept in the pocket of his sports coat im not so hot at taking notes he said echoing the disengenuous and universal theme you mind if i record what we say i want to make sure i get it exactly right no go ahead satisfied hunt looked up lets cut to the chase doctor do you think it was pinkert again the unexpected guffaw again cut off quickly i suppose i just inadvertently gave my answer away in all seriousness he continued id be surprised if it was mike why first youve got to know him he needs to lose fifty pounds caryn hates extra weight on people the other reason might be me when caryn and i had our thing one of her big worries was that word would get out around the hospital she told me that if she was going to do that again it wasnt going to be with anybody she worked with she didnt want gossip she didnt want to hurt her husband she just needed to do what she had do to maybe thats a small thing and maybe she changed her mind but i think she stuck with it you think she had other affairs well at least two which eliminates any moral objection to the idea doesnt it so it would have been a matter of convenience id say probably as though just remembering mcafee snapped his fingers are you really interested in seeing the rest of this place sure hunt followed mcafee through a door into a long hallway since mcafee had never asked him to turn it off he checked to make sure his tape recorder was still working it was as they took the tour it was evident that construction was well along the internal walls separated administrative and medical offices from waiting areas and from operating theaters the rugs werent down yet but the lighting was installed the place about half painted most of the equipment and furnishings still to come but to hunt it felt like a mostly unfurnished medical complex not a warehouse anymore when they got down to the far end hunt said looks pretty close to done when are you opening mcafee crossed his arms over his chest proud of what hed wrought im shooting for the first of the year give or take a couple of weeks i start hiring staff in the next week or two so everythings a go pretty much theres always lastminute problems and im sure there will be on this but all in all im fairly confident hunt decided to take the gloves off pretty big change in a week isnt it mcafees face went slack then reddened what do you mean by that well i mean obviously last week you were fighting caryn over a partner you didnt want in the business but you needed his money to keep construction going now both those problems are gone also gone is an original headstrong partner who was giving you nothing but headaches how much life insurance did you and caryn take out on one another i dont have to answer that and i resent the hell out of the implication i loved caryn how much insurance hunt repeated its in the public record if you make me look for it i might get cranky how much two and a half million each each and whens the last time you saw caryn friday here no saturday morning i ran into her at the hospital where we both had patients we barely spoke because of the tension between both of you and pinkert no because we were busy looking at patients i just told you that yes you did but it seems to me that if youre having all of these issues you might have talked about them a little wed just done that the day before she finished before me at the hospital on saturday and left maybe to go see her lover i dont know but we didnt talk all right what about sunday no i didnt see her on sunday what did you do sunday night i already told your partner that you were asleep im talking earlier dinnertime where did you have dinner i dont know id have to think go ahead take your time hunt pulled out his notebook again ostentatiously flipped pages grabbed his pen sunday he said curtly three days ago mcafee rubbed his hands together he forced a painful smile im just not remembering im drawing a complete blank sunday sunday sunday hunt said you were in bed by eleven maybe your wife would remember he shook his head were divorced im living by myself out on fillmore im really drawing a blank here though just a second do you mind if i make a phone call not at all mcafee pulled his cell phone from his belt and said office into it a few seconds later he started talking marcia hey its me whats my calendar got me doing on sunday last sunday sure ill wait a minute that nervous comeandgo smile then nothing no im sure i did something i just cant okay okay thanks then bye clicking off he shrugged dramatically i guess im going to have to think about it whatever it was it wasnt too memorable doctor didnt inspector juhle ask you about this sure i told him i had surgery scheduled monday morning so im sure i was in bed he didnt ask about before you went to bed what kind of car do you drive a toyota highlander thats an suv right yes what color black oh wait sunday there it is i had the kids you had the kids my three kids im remembering now we went over to tilden and swam in the lake had a picnic we bought a lunch at that deli in montclair mcafee wiped at the sheen that had developed on his forehead yeah then we all went to spengersyou know in berkeleyfor dinner and then i dropped them back with jenny their mom it must have been about eight eight thirty just dark anyway god how did i not remember that i dont know hunt said so you left the kids at eight thirty and then what then i went home it had been a long dayyou know three young kids and i watched a little tv then went to bed probably around ten just what i told inspector juhle alone yes of course okay doctor thanks a lot youve been very helpful and hunt folded up his notepad put it again in his back pocket and started up the long hallway on his way out gina had started out typing on the computer in her office thinking to take her clients writing advice and get in one page for the day and to have fun with it it seemed as though shed been writing for about fifteen minutes when the phone rang when she glanced down at the bottom of her screen and saw that shed been lost in the work for almost two hours and had written five pages she was so shocked that she didnt hear the next couple of telephone rings and finally had to grab hurriedly at the receiver hoping she hadnt missed the call this is gina roake ms roake inspector juhle gina noted with a tingling sense of alarm that shed ceased being gina and juhle was no longer devin something about their relationship had shifted i wonder if youre with your client right now no im at my office yes maam thats where i called you and mr gorman isnt with you no do you know where he is to my knowledge hes still at his house thats where i left him right after we were all there together this morning what do you want to see him about ive got a warrant for his arrest gina felt her head go light something went out of her shoulders thats not possible since we saw him this morning thats right whats changed inspector this doesnt make any sense it makes sense to gerry abrams and thats good enough for me juhle didnt have to explain anything to her at this pointthey had their warrant but he couldnt help gloating a little did you know that your client and his wifes sister went up to the mountains together alone for a week yes but so now weve got the bad timing on the drive down from his cabin the money and another woman in the picture i also just heard from mrs robley bethanys mother did you know about your client threatening her if she didnt change her testimony i have no idea what youre talking about stuart didnt do that hed never do that well bethany says he did his daughter delivered the message it took bethany a few sleepless nights to help her decide she had to tell her mother abrams says weve got enough he wants him in custody and i dont blame him but this is crazy inspector i know stuart didnt threaten anybody much less a young girl and he told me all about debra they werent up there a week it was five days and they didnt oh never mind about that gina realized how ridiculous she sounded making excuses youre bringing him downtown as soon as i find him youre sure you havent heard from him of course im sure because theres another thing you might want to consider it wont change the fact that i havent heard from him but whats that when nobody answered the door at his house i let myself in and found half a box of ninemillimeter ammunition out on his computer table his dresser drawers were mostly cleaned out and so was the bathroom cabinet as soon as were off the phone here im going out with an apb that your clients on the run and should be considered armed and dangerous well before you do that gina said have you tried his daughter shes staying with caryns sister maybe he went over there to see them do you know where that is no im sorry no number gina had his home telephone number and shed reached him at the travelodge yesterday butanother failureshe hadnt bothered to get his cell number she was badly out of practice and her client was likely to suffer because of it the sister may be listed she said the last name is dryden ill look into that juhle said another thought struck her and gina asked what about the reporters who were camped at his house didnt any of them see him leave theres a way out through the garage a gate in the fence opens onto a walkway between a couple of houses out of the backyard he was just avoiding the reporters she said hell be with his daughter im sure well ill tell you what juhle said his patience thin to begin with was clearly just about worn through why dont we both keep looking but if i dont hear from you or him by say five oclock im putting out the bulletin thats only an hour from now inspector thats right juhle said so wed better get looking shouldnt we jedd this is gina im sorry to bother you at your office but im in kind of emergency mode here have you heard from stuart lately you can bother me anytime you want gina would lunchtime today count as lately you saw him at lunchtime where over here in north beach do you know where he is now no but he said he was going down to palo alto to talk to some of caryns investment people i assume thats where he went whats the emergency about him only that theyve issued a warrant for his arrest and now they think hes on the run armed and dangerous armed and dangerous stuart evidently he left some ammunition out at his house and juhle found it stuart owns a gun he had a gun when he was with me i dont know about that it sounds like it though i just wondered if you had a way to get ahold of him he needs to know whats happened and especially that hes wanted he thought it might get to that even without good evidence thats why he took off he told you that word for word he said he wasnt going to jail the cops werent looking for who might have really killed caryn so he was going to on his own for the record i told him to let you and your investigators do that but he wasnt much convinced jedd hes got to come in he could get himself shot ive got to talk to him do you have any way to reach him ive got his cell number and youre welcome to it but from what he was telling me today youre not going to have an easy time talking him into coming in especially if that means hes spending any time in jail he was pretty firm on that jedd theyve got the warrant hes going to jail not if they cant find him jesus jedd on top of everything else he doesnt want to be in the middle of a manhunt things are bad enough as it is i hear you i do gina but he thinks he can get somewhere the police havent gotten to with his own investigation well hes an idiot then ive got good investigators stuarts met one of them wyatt hunt he just got a load of dirt today on caryns business partner were all over this case i believe you but stuart doesnt care about that he doesnt have faith in the system gina he doesnt think the innocent naturally go free he thinks mistakes happen this arrest warrant being a perfect example he doesnt want any part of the process its too late for that jedd its started without him now the trick is to contain the damage and if he doesnt show up on his lawyers arm in the next few hours everything from here on out is going to be much worse you know that i know that you know it do you want me to call him first try to talk some sense into him at least hell probably pick up if its me theres a heartening thought gina considered for a second all right but promise youll get right back to me as soon as im off regardless of what he says ill give it my best shot i know you will and jedd yo not that i didnt appreciate it and all but next time youve got an innocent man referral for me to defend maybe youll want to resist the urge at seven thirty that night with no dinner inside her gina was driving south on the bayshore freeway on the way to san mateo where stuart was staying near coyote point in room of the hollywood motel jedd conley hadnt had any luck changing stuarts mind and neither had gina in a second long talk with her client from her apartment in spite of that she still entertained some hope that the facetoface discussion shed talked him into might make him come around but the knot in her stomach and nervous tic in one of her eyelids were better indicators of her odds dusk was welladvanced by the time she knocked quietly on the door which faced a twolane road perpendicular to the freeway and along the edge of san mateos municipal golf course a light was visible in the room through the venetian blinds a shadow moved across it in response to her knock and then she was standing looking up at her client who had his cell phone to his ear motioning her in closing the door behind her my daughter he mouthed all but silently nodding gina moved into the room and sat in a chair beside a linoleum table against the wall the room was large with two queen beds and a halfkitchen behind her in the back stuart went back to the near bed and sat propped with the pillows hed piled against the headboard that wasnt your fault hon stuart said that was between your mother and me it didnt have anything to do with you gina watched her client as he listened some more his face a mask of pain and regret grimacing at something his daughter was saying he brought his free hand up to the birthmark near his eye and rubbed it mechanically thats just how she was with everybody no especially the people she cared about she was just one of those insecure people who needed what she did to matter more than who she was so if she wasnt accomplishing something i dont know something tangible like her inventions or her operations well the rest of it didnt have as much meaning to her yeah that was me too well of course it hurt but by that time you and i were just getting in her way i know she was your mother hon i know its not fair stuart looked across at gina gave her a distracted nod and held up a finger asking for another minute or two nodding she half listened to a longsuffering father trying to explain the inexplicable to his devastated daughter with something of a shock she suddenly saw the handgun in full view out on the stand under the reading light between the two beds to take her eyes off it and to give stuart a bit more privacy with kymberly gina stood up and walked back into the halfkitchen where she poured herself a glass of water the sight of the gun had roiled her stomach anew and now having drunk the water she put the glass down and leaned against the counter arms straight and with her weight on her hands her face up her eyes closed she exhaled heavily telling herself that the sudden stab of nerves was irrational yet recognizing it for what it was it was fear what had she been thinking before in her life she had only defended guilty suspects and now here she was alone with her client and his gun with a warrant out for his arrest for a murder drawing a deep breath her eyes still closed she sighed again the words seemed to explode in her ear directly behind her are you all right she brought a hand to her chest and whirled on him oh my god you scared me to death im sorry he flicked on the kitchen light overhead the blessed brightness dissipating the shadows and im sorry about the phone i had to talk to kymberly i heard shes having a rough time my hearts breaking for her she doesnt understand why caryn didnt love her she wants to have a chance to ask her one time what she did wrong what kym did wrong why would she think she did anything wrong its a little circular isnt it because her mother had stopped loving her it wasnt just kym not saying goodbye to caryn when she left to go to college caryn didnt make any effort to say goodbye to her either she was all just thank god thats over and shes gone now i can get on with my life was she that hard really kym stuart searched the corners of the ceiling for an answer he ran a hand through his hair i dont have anything to compare kym to maybe all kids are hard on their parents or their marriages all i can say is she sucked the energy out of both of us i kept thinking we both thought that somehow it was our fault that wed spoiled her but really i dont think it was that from the beginning she was just so hard but isnt that the norm gina asked everybody says once you have kids your life is never the same stuart met ginas eyes thats true but there are degrees most of our friends back when we had mutual friends theyd joke about how their lives had changed but there was always good to go with the bad with us from early on it was always waiting for the other shoe to drop you know kym didnt sleep through the night until she was four years old you know how tired you get with four years of no sleep she was in diapers until she was almost eight i mean but he couldnt find the words he shook his head trying to shake the memories sorry theres nothing to be sorry about it must have been difficult he almost laughed difficults a good word so now how am i supposed to console her she drove her mother away thats the truth she wore us both down until caryn just gave up maybe she would have come back to caring about kym after she wasnt living with us fulltime anymore but now caryn will never get the chance for that and its just killing my little girl suddenly he checked himself apologetic but you didnt come all the way down here to talk about kym im happy to talk about kym whatever you want obviously youre still trying he shrugged what am i going to do shes my daughter i love her but lord sometimes you wonder when its going to get better if things are ever going to improve gina was leaning back against the counter in the narrow kitchen maybe the first step is believing that they can he gave her a weak facsimile of a smile that would be a pretty thing to think then perhaps not meaning to sound so dismissive he added but maybe youre right i am right stuart it happened with me a year ago i would have told you i was a lost cause im not change is not only possible its the only possibility gina had him listening and she pressed on you know stuart she began youre the one who told me you dont want to live with suspicion hanging over you for the rest of your life has it ever occurred to you that getting legally cleared getting an acquittal is the best way to put that suspicion behind you once and for all you want to ask oj about that hes the exception that proves the rule okay but whos to say there wont be another exception or worse im the innocent guy who pulls life in prison for the crime he didnt commit no thanks and so you think thiswhat youre doing nowis helping your case you mean doing my own investigation i mean being on the run any chance you have of ever getting reasonable bail in this case evaporates if the cops have to run you down he shook his head being on the run is a nonissue it goes away if i find something he came forward listen i talked to both fred furth and caryns lab assistant today at pii they both say that theres something seriously going wrong with the dryden socket and caryn was blowing the whistle on it maybe as early as this week she was really going to make a stink about it andthis is your theorythat because of this somebody killed her to stop her i think its absolutely plausible so do i so what what do you mean so what its a strong motive agreed strong motive and again so what do you have a specific person in mind who had a way to get into your garage then have a glass of wine with your wife thats not how it happened stuart snapped back at her his voice rising he snuck up on her and hit her from behind do you know that how do you know that gina pointed a finger at him no you dont know that stuart in fact the much more likely possibility is that whoever it was didnt come over with the intention of killing her he came over to have sex with her no she was but gina pressed ahead dont be ridiculous listen to yourself think about the reality not what you wish might have happened to spare everybodys delicate feelings she was naked in the hot tub he got there because theyd been having an affair for a while and thats what theyd arranged you with me so far you dont know any of this i know it as much as you know anything about the motive forget the motive for a minute the facts point to him being in the tub with her and for the obvious reason she knew you were going to be gone kym was already gone she had the house alone and they set it up together they were being romantic having a glass of wine everything was cool and then they had some disagreement about somethingprobably not something like the dryden socket which had been simmering for weeks or even months something personal some change in their status quo maybe she told him she wanted to stop and she told him this was their last time maybe anything the point is he couldnt deal with it so he got out of the tub went behind her did what he did and got out of there his face set stuart nodded all right suppose we go with that the problem is juhle thinks that mystery man must have been me same scenario exactly she told me she wanted the divorce and i lost it and killed her except that i didnt it wasnt me right gina said im giving you the benefit of the doubt on that part in fact i dont think it was you stuart if it was you i dont think you would have come back down the next morning you never would have done the cpr and mostly i dont think you would have done it to kym he looked across at her never he said never i know but my real point is youre not going to get to any of this yourself not solo not even with me and wyatt looking and certainly not while the police are trying to find you whos going to talk to you once the word is out in the news theres no chance so what am i supposed to do gina drew a breath and held it for a minute youre supposed to come in with me stuart he glared at her defiantly i cant do that you have to she said theres no alternative if you dont want to be taken by force when they find you which they will and then if you dont actually get shot when they come to arrest youwhich is not impossiblethen you start off not only as a murder suspect but as an armed fugitive in which case youre in twice as deep shit as you are now stuart stood unmoving i know theres something going on with the socket yafuckinghoo gina said im sure youre right and theres also something going on with bob mcafee wyatt had a long talk with him today and his alibi isnt as strong as juhle would like to have us believe then why have they decided to arrest me she stared at him are you kidding me stuart nobodys that naive not even you what you send your daughter to talk to a critical prosecution witness she conveys the message that her testimony is inconvenient what does that look like to you youre lucky kyms not in jail herself right now for witness intimidation her clients unyielding and uncomprehending expression pushed her into a rage goddammit to hell stuart they think youre dangerous get it dangerous killer on the loose armed threatening witnesses gina shook her head what the hell is the matter with you do you understand that the first cop that sees you will be ready to shoot you dead but thats not i mean none of that is they could go around like this forever gina reined in her anger controlled her tone she had to close the deal look stuart the good news is that we can get a hearing in ten days and if they dont have their evidence by then the judge might not hold you to answer at trial might not stuart held out his hands pleading with her i dont get it even if they really think it was me why would they go ahead if theyve got no way to prove it why wouldnt they wait she shrugged that off you want more beyond all of the above okay youre a name your wife was important when important people get killed the public wants to see somebody charged and if nobody is the da comes under fire so gerry abrams is protecting the reputation of his boss and at the same time if abrams convicts you he makes his name so its just politics stupid city politics politics ambition bad luck you name it but whatever it is these are the cards we got dealt and the only choice is to play them im sorry stuart but there it is thats why i came down here tonight theres no other option the alternativeyou hiding out this wayonly puts off the inevitable and you have to believe me it would be much much worse i could leave the country you could gina agreed never see your daughter again live with the constant fear of extradition have everybody in the world believe you killed caryn then your passport expires what do you do then you want to do that stuart closed his eyes his body sagged finally he looked over at her i dont know if i can do jail gina the idea of being with those guys scares the shit out of me i know i dont blame you but theres a separate section in the jail outside of the general population called administrative segregation adseg for short its where they keep atrisk prisoners after you surrender ill try to make sure that thats where you wind up surrender just a word stuart just a word shit i couldnt agree more gina parked her jetta in her space under her building and making sure that the garage door had closed behind her took the inside stairs to the back door of her condo walking up the short hall turning lights on all the way she went directly to her kitchen and opened the freezer section of her refrigerator where she had a stash of commercially frozen dinners as well as several labeled plastic containers of her own preparations the largest of these was a deep square tupperware holder with a piece of tape on the side that read lasagnasausage and she pulled that out took off the cover recovered the dish with a paper towel and stuck it in the microwave setting the timer for ten minutes she walked over to the bar area and flicked on the radio which since david shed kept tuned to classical to the strains of a flute and guitar performance she went to her bedroom took off her clothes and got into a hot shower gina considered herself a nononsense person and never more so than when she showered in five minutes she was clean and dry again except for her hair which she toweled for half a minute then combed out damp from her dresser she grabbed an old comfortable pair of blue jeans and one of davids white buttondown dress shirts washed over the years now to a frayed neartranslucence soft as silk back in the kitchen nook barefoot she opened one of the straw bottles of chianti that shed bought at cost plus a month before and poured herself a glass she laid out a regular setting complete with placemat cloth napkin fork knife pepper and salt tabasco and parmesan cheese on the small table by the front window and had just finished watering her early blooming christmas cactus in its tiny pot on the same table when the microwave beeped she brought the steaming lasagna over to her place it wouldnt be cool enough to eat for a few more minutes but gina sat down anyway picked up her wineglass took a healthy drink from it the guitar and flute on the radio had given way to chamber music perhaps a mozart concerto she sat back let out a long deep breath and took another sip of chianti smaller this time and started going over the events of the last couple of hours in her mind shed finally convinced stuart that he had no choice that he had to give himself up in his presence at the motel shed called juhle on his cell phone and told him that she was ready to surrender her client how about tomorrow say am she also wanted to make clear to the inspector that stuart was not now and had never been armed hed simply taken some money from his safe for random expenses and had to take out the box of ammunition to get at it then in his haste to get out on the road hed forgotten to put it back hed snuck out the back way to avoid reporters not to evade capture aside from those small lies shed basically told juhle the truth of what stuart had been doing all daytalking to people who might know something he didnt about caryn he hadnt been running from the police and from his arrest he hadnt even heard about the warrant theyd be at the hall of justice at ten oclock sharp the next morning the lasagnaone of her specialtieswas cool enough to eat she took a bite closing her eyes and savoring it glad shed made it with the hot italian sausage rather than the mild the sauce from the vineripe fresh tomatoes shed picked up last month at the ferry building all in all she thought the night had been a success a definite win for the home team although stuart wasnt quite seeing it in that light yet but gina had no doubts that getting him into custody especially given the weakness of the case against him was by far the best course of action he could take albeit still one fraught with risk indeed though it was the only one that made any real sense more than that in making the argument to him in dealing with his very real and legitimate concerns in the intensity she had to draw upon to prevail she recognized a flame of passion in herself for the law and for her work that had lain as a neardead ember for the better part of three years that had been part of the general malaise and shutdown shed experienced after davids death but if nothing else tonight had validated her return to her vocation in an immediate and gratifying way this was the right thing for her to be doing the best use of her time and talents over her clients reservations and even violent disagreement and whether he saw it or not she had already done him a world of good if she had not prevailed if stuart had become the object of any kind of real manhunt when there would have been no question that he was in armed flight from prosecution his prospects could have been terminally dashed and she had prevented that it felt goodbetter than good a breath of fresh air after too long underwater ten thirty the dishwasher cycles competed with the background music turned down low on the radio but gina was aware of neither her second glass of wine was still full on the reading table next to her she was in her reading chair by the living rooms front window having already read through all of her notes and other miscellany in the folder she was keeping on stuart the thin blue volume of the everpopular california evidence code now lay open on her lap she made it a point to read it through once a year as a discipline shed gone through nearly two thirds of it at this one sitting and though she would have denied that it was pleasure reading it wasnt by any means a chore this was the nuts and bolts of her work lawyers talked in numberspenal code sections criminal code evidence code numbered jury instructions it was the language and she was as immersed in it as she would have been in cramming her rusty italian if she was planning a vacation to cinque terre at first she was not sure whether it had been anything at all that had caught her attention and made her look up dishes rattling settling in the dishwasher she scanned the room saw nothing that caused the noise and was about to go back to her book when here it was again unmistakable she glanced up at the clock on her mantel frowned and dogeared her page though her frontdoor entrance was slightly recessed from the street and not visible from her front windows she looked through those windows anyway and saw that someone had parked illegally on the sidewalk directly across the street so she crossed over and used the peephole then turned the dead bolt and opened the door hey jedd conley in his business suit hands in his pockets projectingfor himan unusual reticence is this a bad time its a bit of a surprising time but no i mean its okay she pointed out behind him is that your car youll get a ticket parked there but conley shook his head legislative plates not automatic but most cops recognize them and cut some slack i think ill be safe so what can i do for you are you all right im fine a quick nervous smile slightly uptight maybe you want to come in thatd be nice thanks she stepped back opening the door letting him in so what are you uptight about life my work the usual i dont know why i said that though why that came out he let out a breath tried another smile that didnt quite succeed im fine okay good then thats settled can i get you a drink ive got a little of everything some scotch wouldnt be bad it never is maybe ill join you she was moving behind the bar have a seat somewhere is oban okay oban would be perfect perfection is my goal she said ice in a single malt surely you jest she shrugged some do though for the record i dont either she had her special glasses out on top of the bar filling them about halfway a good couple of shots each and carried them over to where he was sitting on the couch facing the fireplace public health notice she said leaded crystal drinking from these glasses could cause health problems and may impair your ability to operate heavy machinery god forbid conley said i think ill risk it brave man she handed him his drink holding the glass up checking the generous pour with obvious satisfaction he clinked her glass a woman after my own heart drinking a little he settled back thank you im happy to inform you that youve attained your goal my goal perfection well she said surprised at the flush she felt rising in her face my pleasure when shed finished with stuarts folder shed tossed it onto the coffee table she hadnt really noticed but the picture of all the pals from the bitterroot camping trip had slid out most of the way now jedd picked it up turned it over this has to do with stuarts case somehow i dont know she said probably not she explained about the threatening emails and stuarts contention that the picture proved he hadnt sent them to himself since hed had no access to a computer or anything else jedd said but dont get me wrong it was a great trip at least till the ride home what happened on the ride home my damn car threw a rod cost me two grand i didnt feel right about asking my fellow campers to chip in but they could have offered it put a slight pall on my memory of the trip but stillhe put the picture back into the folderi guess it was worth it getting away is always worth it yes it is gina by now was seated at the far end of the couch and she turned to him so what can i do for you jedd i dont know really i was out at one of horaces endless events tonight just over at the fairmontyou know horace tremont not personally but of course you know hes my fatherinlaw i remember reading about all that when you got married your wife is lexi right right the lovely lexi he smiled but his inflection put an ironic spin on the words anyway it seems that horace and some other of his kingmaker friends wanted to feel out my interest in running for the senate the us senate would you want that he shrugged at least feigning nonchalance its something to think about ill be termed out next year in the assembly im going to want to do something i dont know it might be fun well see its a long way off anyway he continued when the meeting broke up i got to wondering how things had gone after you talked with stuart since i was so close to you up here i took a chance and drove by and saw the light on and thought you might be up im surprised you knew i still lived here he shrugged smiled tell you the truth i wasnt a hundred percent sure until i saw your name in the mail slot but i dont think i could have imagined you anywhere else the place looks great by the way terrific furniture cool art i dont even remember the bar thats because it wasnt here the last time you were i remodeled about ten years ago then added some stuff for david even though we spent most of our time together at his place well you always had great taste its beautiful he raised his glass toasted her and drank a sip so he said stuart howd it go relieved to turn away from the personal stuff about herself gina took a sip of the scotch she felt herself begin to relax finally okay it took the phone call then a trip down to san mateo and a lot of convincing but hes coming in and giving himself up tomorrow ten oclock very reluctantly i might add but hell show you must have been persuasive as hell when i talked to him he wasnt spending any time in jail period well hes not that much better but i got him to go along howd you do that gina smiled my usual equal parts charm guile and threats i made him an offer he couldnt refuse conley enjoyed the phrase i thought he was a grieving widower not that kind of an offer jedd she lifted her legs up onto the couch and tucked them under her so the senate thing is that what youre uptight about conley paused threw her a direct look you dont let much get by you do you youd be surprised you said it was work and life running for the senate seemed to qualify well he sipped his drink sometimes the profile is difficult to manage thats all it gets inside you apparently making up his mind to tell her about it he went on as for uptight i had to let go my assistant today and if historys any judge shes going to slap me with some kind of bullshit lawsuit when the plain truth is the woman was just incompetent and couldnt do the job but you fire anybody nowadays you become the bad guy you know this hell everybody knows it and still it goes on he sighed in frustration anyway its done now im just hoping i documented everything correctly well see what happens well if you need a lawyer he chortled quietly ill keep you in mind thanks maybe she wont do anything because god knows i made sure i never did anything even remotely suggestive around her if theres one thing ive learned in life if youre going to mess around you dont dip your pen in the company inkwell if you choose to mess around at all that is he drank off some more of his scotch a silence pregnant with their mutual history gathered in the spaces between the lowvolume tinkle of piano music from ginas radio jedd finally looked down the length of the couch at her you know gina i said it the other day when you came to the travelodge and i meant it then but ill say it again you havent aged a day in twenty years not true she said ive aged about twenty years and i feel every one of them well you dont show them no makeup hair still wet and look at you right now youre just incredible she gave him a long and piercing look a smile tickled the corners of her mouth and then slowly she shook her head from side to side i dont think so jedd nice try but it wouldnt be a good idea it was never a bad idea with us if memory serves and it does yes it does but it would be now a bad idea why what would be different you being married for one thing lexi wouldnt ever have to know we used to be pretty discreet if i recall but i would know jedd a girls got to have a few rules and not sleeping with married men is one of mine okay we wont sleep no she said he wagged his head back and forth no hard press but he was enjoying the game it doesnt really seem right it does to me im afraid she finished her oban and got herself upright off the couch im flattered jedd really youve made my week but nos got to mean no fair enough if you really mean it he was up then closing the small space between them standing in front of her ill make a deal with you if you can still say no after one small kiss ill take it as your final answer she looked up into his eyes confident enough amused enough to give him a full smile my momma didnt raise no fools jedd now you can either finish your drink and go or you can go right now but were not doing this any little part of it you need to go home and kiss your wife shell be in bed so wake her up come on gina its not about her its about you and me there is no you and me jedd ducking around him giving herself room she stopped behind the couch if you leave your wife after the divorce is final i might let you buy me a drink and well see where that might take us but even then its not a promise its a maybe youre a cruel woman roake i am she admitted and getting crueler all the time crossing over to the door she put her hand on the knob and turned back to face him now are you going to finish your drink first or just walk accepting defeat with a nod jedd toasted her silently again and drained his drink placing the glass carefully on the coffee table he got to the nowopen door and stopped you cant blame a guy for trying he said well you can a little bit she said good night jedd with a gentle shove she moved him along until he was outside then closed the door behind him and with a sudden emphasis she threw the dead bolt hard enough to make sure he heard it it took juhle about an hour with his cell phonetracking technicians to trace the approximate location from which gina had called him to arrange stuart gormans surrender the next morning and most of another hour to arrange for two sf police officers and their squad car and some san mateo county swatteam backup to meet him when he closed in for the arrest cell phone technology possibly hadnt been much a part of the normal police arsenal the last time gina had worked a major case but now juhle thought that everyone in the crime business must know that it was childs play to pinpoint a locale from a phone call wyatt hunt had told him in passing that gina had been out of the game awhile and that stuart was her first murder case ever but even so he was amazed and happily surprised when she called him on her cell phone in stuarts presence and especially after the hardball shed been playing with him on the interview and everything else he wasnt in the mood to be doing her any favors anyway and if gina thought that juhle could know the whereabouts of an armed suspect who was the object of a murder warrant and knowingly let that person remain at large for even one extra minute she had another think coming so no sooner had juhle gotten off the phone with gina than he told his wife that hed be out late and put some wheels in motion the cell tower site gave him a confined area to search all the district cars started checking out parking lots for vehicle license numbersby now the plates stuart had stolen had been reported the result was that at pm juhle flashed his badge at the night clerk at the hollywood motel showed the man a recent picture of his suspect and was told that the man he sought had checked in this afternoon under the alias of stuart ghoti the clerk specifically remembered because he paid cash which he did not see too often he was in room around the corner and about halfway down the block now just after juhle had the street blocked off in both directions by the san mateo county presence and had his own san francisco team of two officers out of their car accompanying him to the motel room door all of the men had their holsters unbuttoned ready for action stopping at the door juhle listened for a minute and heard the low hum of a television that also cast its flickering glow on the window blinds he figured he had enough adrenaline flowing now to pull a locomotive uphill and tried to gather himself to get control over his emotions and excitement but it was a losing battle for one last time he considered other options such as having one of his backup people call the room or even simply knocking on the door and announcing himself but hed already rejected those options stuart gorman might try to flee through them all in one of those situations he might learn that he was surrounded and panicstricken commit suicide with the gun that juhle believed in his heart that he still and had always had with him no the thing to do was what hed decided to do a nowarning storming of the room none of this bullhorn comeoutwithyourhandsup bullshit they had the door opener a massive cylindrical metal weight on chains one swing at the flimsy motel door would be all it took looking side to side at his two acolytes he nodded the wood shattered as if it were balsa the door flew backward and juhle followed it in hitting the light switch just inside stuart a deer in headlights leaning back on pillows set up against the headboard took in the situation in a heartbeat then threw a lightning glance at the pistol that was still out next to him on the bed table dont even think about it juhle yelled put your hands over your head now juhle was crabwalking straight toward him his gun centered right between stuarts eyes to make sure he had his complete attention three steps later juhle had stuarts gun in his left hand his own in his right his backup team was already all the way across the room on the far side of the bed their own weapons out leveled at the suspect for a long moment time froze no one moved the television nearly masked the sound of the mens heavy breathing finally stuart said youre making a mistake i dont think so juhle said then added being a smart guy you probably already figured this out but youre under arrest you have the right to remain silent at am sharp on wednesday september nine business days after stuart gorman was arrested on a charge of firstdegree murder with a cheerful good morning his attorney walked into the reception area outside the office of san francisco district attorney clarence jackman gina in high dudgeon at what she took to be juhles lies and even betrayal had scheduled this appointment on the morning after stuarts arrest his preliminary hearing was scheduled for the next day in judge cecil toynbees courtroom department jackmans secretary was a large handsome lightmochaskinned woman in her early forties named treya glitsky whom gina knew very well both professionally and socially treyas husband abe was deputy chief of inspectors in the police department and also the best friend of ginas law partner dismas hardy so it was a tight circle and a good morning to you too treya looked over from her computer and broke a welcoming smile getting up out of her chair and coming around her desk to hug her visitor clarence is expecting you she said then added more quietly but i wanted to warn you that he had gerry abrams in here yesterday afternoon for a good while to brief him id assume or just bring him up to speed this things gotten big in a hurry hasnt it its crazy gina said you get a little celebrity buzz youd think the world revolves around it but its also between you and me the reason clarence has to step in and call this thing off its going to be an embarrassment to him well treya said gerrys been beating his own drum pretty hard too dont i know it indeed it would have been hard for anyone to miss since the arrest the media had been having a field day with the story of the newage outdoor writer and his brilliant doctor wife and gina had no doubt about the source of the dozens of leaks that fueled the nearly endless recaps and updates over the past two weeks gerry abrams had become almost a household name in san francisco as had stuart gorman and of course this had increased ginas profile as well even if her mantra throughout it all had been that she had no comment except to say that her client was innocent and would be acquitted if there was a trial but still she had to admit that the constant barrage of media analysis was taking its toll on her confidence while it remained true that the physical evidence pointing to stuarts guilt was in her opinion light to nonexistent nevertheless she found herself on several occasions over the last couple of weeks blindsided by one or another reporters fresh recapitulation of all the circumstantial evidence andshe had no need to remind herself because it remained a truism throughout her entire careercircumstantial evidence was sufficient to convict gina had used her own spies in the hall in the past couple of weeks to find out when abrams was scheduled to appear in court and shed come down and sat in the gallery during two of his hearings he had to her mind a scary amount of charisma and a persuasive style that for all of its homespun sincerity could not disguise the obvious intellect she knew that a prosecutor such as gerry abrams could present his circumstantial case with such a strong narrative that it could quite literally trump a complete lack of physical evidence in fact the pervasive onslaught had actually brought her back to some significant doubt about stuarts factual guilt or innocence by the time shed come to the motel in san mateo and talked him into turning himself in shed come to have faith in her clients story all of his explanations and actions even including going out to interview caryns business colleagues had seemed convincing to her but in the relentless prose of the print media and the endless analysis of the radio and tv pundits the consistency of stuarts guilty scenario was viscerally so powerful that it had literally several times made her sick and now on stuarts behalf she was about to take another huge professional and personal risk she hadnt been lying or making any kind of false threat to devin juhle when shed referred to the da as her close personal friend in fact shed been a member of jackmans informal kitchen cabinet meeting regularly on tuesdays for lunch at lou the greeks for most of his administration she considered him a fair just good man and one with whom she shared a real friendship the fact that he had apparently gone along with this prosecution even to this point filled her with a deep sense of foreboding if he had serious misgivings about this case he was keeping them private but she knew that this wasnt jackmans style if he didnt believe in the case he would have counseledor ordered abrams to abandon it when shed all but demanded this appointment after stuarts arrest jackman had been uncharacteristically impatient as though he found ginas positionthat her client was truly innocentsomehow distasteful hed granted the meeting she felt as a personal favor rather than a professional courtesy and this was another source of real discomfort now she heard the door open behind her and turned to see her old friend the citys chief prosecutorall six feet four two hundred and fifty pounds of himstanding in the entrance to his office as always jackman wore a perfectly tailored suit today in a dark blue with a light pink shirt and muted blue tie his face though smiling in greeting was a slab of jetblack granite under a tight gray buzz cut he tended to speak very quietly but the pitch of his voice was so deep it seemed to resonate in her bones when he said aha and heres my favorite defense attorney now if gina was jackmans favorite she would not like to imagine how the scene would feel to someone he liked a little less it was all lowkey and ostensibly cordial of course clarence didnt go to his power position behind his desk but he made sure gina was comfortably seated in the upholstered chair out in the living room section of his office that she had a fresh cup of good coffee that business and her health were both good preliminaries out of the way he got himself situated on the leather couch across from her coming forward with an open expression elbows on his knees now gina he began with the voice of god how may i help you i guess the best thing you could do clarencefor me for my client mr gorman and maybe for you yourselfwould be to drop this insane prosecution at least until gerry abrams gets some evidence that might tie my client to the crime of killing his wife jackmans face was set in a patient neutrality i take it youre convinced of mr gormans innocence thats not the point sir the point is that mr abrams and inspector juhle have worked this case from the beginning with a presumption of mr gormans guilt and not his innocence and without that presumption that illegal and unethical presumption of guilt there is simply no case against him jackman nodding thoughtfully said what about the neighbor girl who saw his car excuse me sir but she allegedly saw his car she never saw him clarence because he wasnt there the people have to prove he was there i dont have to prove he wasnt thats exactly what im talking about and your clients threats to her he never made threats clarence thats not what she said its not how she felt he never saw her i hope youre not denying that his daughter did see her twice to find out what she really saw that was all the da appeared to be considering her words all right lets even between you and me grant that how do you explain the attempt at cpr the question was unnerving jackman had apparently been thoroughly briefed on the details of the case hed been prepped by gerry abrams and looked like he was going to be ready for her objections but she wasnt going to roll over without a fight frankly i dont know what made him do that panic frustration a lastditch hope her body was still warm remember he just couldnt give up without trying something and the domestic violence his arrest some years before what about those inadmissible irrevelant maybe both really but the truth about those clarence is that both times the police were called out to their house it was because of fights they were having with their daughter says he well yes have you talked to the daughter about that and even if you have dont you think that if it could have a bearing on saving her father from going to prison she might decide its okay to lie about that this is the same girl who went across the street and threatened her neighbor right i cant see that a little perjury for her fathers sake would bother her much jackman pushed himself back into the couch and straightened his back i am not prejudging your client gina but you keep referring to the lack of evidence in this case and im not at all certain i agree with you im talking about physical evidence i understand that and of course thats the strategy for your position but its also one that either denies the existence of or willfully ignores a rather substantial circumstantial case if it was so substantial clarence why didnt abrams take it to the grand jury first jackman raised his shoulders then let them fall he didnt want to wait to call them into special session he was concerned about your clients flight risk he became convincedbecause of the weight of circumstantial evidence that he and inspector juhle had amassed that your client needed to be in jail gina opened her mouth to respond but jackman cut her off before she could say a word and i must add that your clients behavior after he found out about the warrantharassing private citizens carrying a loaded firearm on that clarence if juhle hadnt broken our deal that gun would have been back in stuarts safe the next morning ah but as it was it turned out that your client had the gun with him at the precise time that you were telling inspector juhle he didnt for the first time jackmans tone grew firm you dont lie to policemen gina youre an officer of the court i dont know what you were thinking what if juhle had gone to make his arrest and somehow acted on your assurance that mr gorman was unarmed does the potential for disaster there escape you chastised and justly so gina still held her ground we made a deal clarence if juhle broke the deal how is that my fault because his mandate is not to keep deals with defense attorneys his mandate is to arrest murder suspects when a judge has seen fit to issue a warrant if he can do that before the time you arranged thats what he needs to do we dont let suspected murderers go have a latte until its to their convenience to appear for their arrest we arrest them surely this is obvious enough surely its equally obvious she retorted that with so little evidence gerry abrams hurried this arrest so he could get his name in the paper clarence thats what that is about jackmans voice rumbled that allegation is beneath you gina mr abrams has never before been a hound for the press he has a consistent and unified theory on this case i talked to him at some length just yesterday and he is convinced that thegranted heavily circumstantialevidence allows for no other conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in his mind that your client killed his wife thats just a kneejerk prosecutors reaction clarence you know that if he did he didnt acknowledge it well jackman sighed if his evidence is flawed or inconclusive it seems to me that its to your advantage you pressed for an early preliminary hearingtomorrow if im not mistaken rightand no doubt that request has hampered and will hamper the peoples ability to build an impregnable case he spread his hands out i dont really know what youd like me to do gina which is how we began here today im not going to overrule mr abrams hes built a case that will either fly or not on its merits thats how we do it stuarts an innocent man clarence someone else killed his wife not him thats why we have trials gina and hearings mr abrams has to prove that and its your job to stop him if you can maybe but it shouldnt have even been allowed to get to this stage they have nothing this is just wrong clarence she realized at once that shed gone too far jackmans nostrils flared briefly a tightlipped smile came and went well rubbing his hands together jackmans face cracked in a parody of a smile as he got to his feet maybe mine is just another kneejerk prosecutors reaction he said but i only see one suspect in this picture gina and i also see a defense attorney whos perhaps feeling the pressure of her first murder trial walking a very thin ethical line of her own clarence im not youre not presuming upon our years of cooperation and friendship and making a personal appeal to the district attorney to subvert the system and dismiss charges that have been brought by this office in a timely and legitimate manner no im ah good then i must have been misunderstanding you i hoped i was somehow gina was standing by now too and clarence was moving her hand on her elbow toward the door then he had his hand on the doorknob show us what youve got at the hearing tomorrow ill keep a close eye on the evidence your client will get a fair hearing gina thats what hes entitled to and thats what hell get understandably juhles betrayal on the arrest deal also knocked the bottom out of ginas well of credibility with stuart how in the world he wondered aloud to her in angry terms at his very first opportunity before the arraignment and bail hearing could she possibly have been ignorant of the fact that juhle would trace her location by cell phone surely this was a standard police procedure done every day surely she should have known about this and avoided such a telephone call at all costs and if she did know why did she trust juhle not to do it was she stupid or naive because clearly she was one or the other then she should absolutely have known that her assurance to him that he would be able to peacefully turn himself in on their timetable was chimerical at best and negligent at worst not only was his decision to surrender based on that faulty presumption but his very life was immediately and directly threatened if hed had his wits about him enough to actually reach for the gun right at his tableside there was no question either juhle or one of his backup officers would have shot him dead surely this was malpractice if ever there was such a thing as if that wasnt bad enough shed talked him into agreeing to something he desperately didnt want to do and also shed done it in a way that had actually and dramatically hurt his case and the perception of his guilt in fact although stuart never used the gun the mere fact of his possession of it created a sea change in the tone of reporting on the case why had she not warned him to get rid of the gun before she made the phone call before the killing was newsworthy because of the personalities and profiles of the principals stuarts marginal fame the usual glamorous smorgasbord of money complicated business issues and sex and although stuart was clearly the frontrunning suspect in most of the early stories there was a sense of debate did he or didnt he what were the pros and cons how much evidence really was there and what did it matter since the arrest and its detailsthe flight to a motel room registering under a false name the loaded gun within an arms reach on a table next to the bedhad become public the presumption of innocence or even the suggestion of possible innocence was no longer in the mix and this of course made it easier to believe in stuarts threats to bethany and even in his threatening visits to fred furth and kelley rusnak in spite of these latter witnesses statements to the contrary it didnt matter if they had felt threatened during their talks with him stuarts very presence was a threatening act the talking heads and columnists got it right an armed murder suspect with an allpoints bulletin out on him calls on you while youre working theres an element of threat but beyond even that the nearubiquitous perception that stuart was at the very least no better than every murder suspect the hall had entertained over the years had other immediate and personal consequences the first of these was bail normally there is no bail in a murder case or at least no bail that anyone could reasonably be expected to make but occasionally especially when there may be issues of selfdefense or of lofty community standing a judge will grant bail of say a few hundred thousand dollars which of course in stuarts case would have been doable but at the bail hearing gina could hardly argue with any credibility that her client wasnt a flight risk everybody in the courtroom and most certainly the judge knew that hed already tried that once first the judge simply denied bail then when gina quite correctly pointed out that some bail was required in a noncapital case the court promptly set bail at million secondly and more upsetting especially to kymberly than almost anything else was the judges refusal to allow stuart even accompanied by armed sheriffs deputies to attend caryns funeral from stuarts perspective this was pure spite and an indication of how reviled hed come to be among the regular denizens of the hall not that any of this would necessarily be admissible or deemed relevant at the hearing or trial but for a million understandable reasons it all played hell with stuarts confidence in his attorney also with kyms and debras after living with his confusion and doubts and anger for nearly two weeks when he came in to see gina in the attorneys visiting room at the jail stuart had finally made the decision to put it to her directly why shouldnt he let her go and get himself another attorney with more experience didnt she think it might be better for his chances if she simply withdrew so now having just been chewed up and spit out by her friend the district attorney gina found herself fighting for the job she now wanted more than anything else in her career more than anything in her life in fact since shed prayed for david freeman not to die stuarts question itself didnt surprise her she had expected something like it or stronger an actual dismissal for some days now but if he was going to give her a chance to talk herself back into his trust and the question implied that he hadnt made up his mind definitely to fire her she was going to take it first she began i admit i screwed up the arrest itself how it went down was my fault i should have taken the gun from you and i should have made the call to juhle from my office all of that is true and im sorry stuart sat a few feet down from her on a plain wooden chair limp as a puppet with cut strings looking lost in his brightorange jumpsuit he had already lost some weight in jail the deeply tanned skin showed a distinct pallor under the hollowedout cheeks i hired a supposedly experienced criminal attorney who was comfortable enough charging me sixtyfive thousand dollars to take the case he said thats true but its also true i told you that id been out of practice for a while and that sixtyfive is a discounted rate for this kind of case and by the way how much of that have you paid me up to now the answer which they both knew of course wasnone of it and yet im still here arent i every day she held up a hand the point spoke for itself she was committed to him and to this case all im trying to say is that a murder case is the major leagues and once in a while they throw at your head i didnt expect juhle to do that but he did he wont catch me off guard again gina hated making excuses for herself she was in fact fairly intolerant of them in others as well davids motto borrowed from churchill she believed and which shed long ago adopted had been never complain never explain and it had served her well too yet here she was begging this man she hadnt known a few weeks ago to understand her and to forgive her for what shed done so she was forcing the words out but her body language betrayed no weakness she sat at the rooms one long table an elbow resting on it her legs crossed in a relaxed posture her confession concerned her technical failure but there was very little mea culpa so we took a hit stuart my fault more than yours but there it is but i didnt screw this up all by myself i didnt let kymberly talk to bethany and if you had bothered to tell me that you were going to let her i would have pointed out what a truly terrible idea that was i didnt run from the police and as for the gun you seem to forget the reason they found it on you is that you refused to give it to me all right fine stuart said ill accept all that but why should i have to keep paying the price for it now well the easy answer is you dont have to stuart you say the word and im gone and thats the end of it her bulldog expression dared him to call her on it if that was his decision she wasnt going to show any sign of wanting or needing this job she could take whatever he could dish out but when his eyes fell away from her gaze it seemed to her to be a small retreat she still had some control over her fate here for some reason perhaps only inertia maybe a fear of the devil he didnt know he was reluctant to pull the trigger and tell her he was going to go with another lawyer the thing is stuart she said i dont know if you can tell or if you care but im pretty angry right now at juhle mostly but also at gerry abrams and even clarence jackman they didnt have to play your arrest the way they did i was being cooperative we were coming in the next morning and they knew it so it was all macho bullshit pretty effective macho bullshit though sure sometimes it is but now i know where theyre coming from i know how they intend to play it ive been doing this defending people in superior courtfor twentysome years im on great terms with the judges and bailiffs and clerks and dont let yourself believe that doesnt matter we get into court and mr abrams and inspector juhle will i hope suddenly discover that im a bit of an old pro myself and now im an old pro with a grudge and a score to settle and i dont intend to make it pretty she paused if youd like me to stay on given that are you sure youd want to yes of course i thought id made that clear but while were talking and before you make up your mind for good theres one other thing weve got to get straight stuart sighed and scratched at the stubble on his neck whats that well with all respect she mustered her calmest voice i understand how you feel about the arrest and then me telling juhle you werent and never had been armed that was a mistake too if i hadnt told him youd never taken the gun okay were arguably in a much better position right now so thats strike two on me but the problems havent been all on me i didnt take the gun in the first place you took the gun and thats why you had it with you thats not anything to do with me if you remember i wanted to take it home with me that night get it out of your hands i pleaded with you to let me have it that was my advice but you overruled me i thought i might need it right thats what you said your ecoterrorist friend might have followed you somehow but the point is why youre in all this trouble right now it isnt all me it isnt even mostly me i wish it were but i need you to see that so much of this is what you did talking to juhle that first day deciding to take your gun with you sneaking out through your back door stealing license plates using a phony name asking kymberly to talk to bethany she did that on her own maybe but thats not what bethany said she told her she got it wrong then stuart put both of his hands up to his forehead god god god he looked across about four feet of space to where gina sat so remind me what are we arguing about about whether i keep my job or not youve lost a lot of confidence in me and i understand that i wouldnt blame you stuart but id like you to be sure that its me after all not just these shitty circumstances and dont get me wrong theyre plenty shitty i didnt predict any of this happening and maybe i should have he nodded then grew quiet for nearly a full minute until he finally took a deep breath help me out here gina kyms all over letting you go sos debra gina shrugged its not their call stuart but then who do i go with jedd conley i dont know any other lawyers i do gina said i could recommend any number of them though probably not jedd she added with a trace of humor then in all seriousness either one of my partners would take you on and theyre both excellent but he said i hear a but no you dont theyre good guys and good lawyers with lots of experience and they almost certainly wouldnt suffer from the incredible handicap of believing youre innocent wesone of my partnerseven told me whatever you do dont start believing hes innocent hell just break your heart sounds like a sweetheart he is she met his eyes hes just another pro whos seen it all before he often says he doesnt believe anybody except his dog he loves his dog though stuart cocked his head what about your david the question quickened her somehow what about him i mean with his clients didnt he ever believe they were innocent she took a moment before shaking her head his rule was hed never ask and never let them tell him it was one of the first things he always told his clients i dont want to know all i want to know is what evidence theyve got and if i can make the jury doubt some or most of it thats the job whether you did it or not doesnt matter to me he didnt really feel that oh yes he did really for truly with his whole heart and what about you wellshe felt herself break a rueful smile and it surprised heryoure watching me break new ground if i had come to this from a different angle i dont know what id be thinking probably that like everybody else you dont get all the way to arrested if youre not guilty as i say thats the professional approach this time i really do hear a but yep she said you do she raised her eyes and stared him full in the face but in this case i dont believe you killed caryn lowering her voice she went on wes may be right ill get my heart broken over it but i dont think so i wont break your heart stuart said see there i go believing you again she met his eyes all business but look this is fulldisclosure time you know this is still my first murder case you know that so far to say it hasnt gone well is an understatement theres some chance that even though im watching a lot more closely and im a lot more pissed off i might get sandbagged again you might be better served with one of my partners or any number of other pretty good lawyers in town guys wholl believe i did it probably but most wouldnt care to know one way or another stuart met her eyes again but briefly then abruptly he got up and walked over to the glass block wall that ran along one side of the room he stood there for a few seconds before nodding to himself and turning around i didnt kill caryn gina i didnt love her anymore but i didnt kill her i know that i believe that he closed his eyes for a second with obvious relief then opened them and met her gaze straight on i think thats the most important thing i think so too gina said though were in the minority im comfortable in the minority stuart said thats where i spend most of my time anyway crossing back over to his chair he pulled it around up closer to gina and straddled it backward so this hearing tomorrow he said how bad is it going to be the conference room at freeman farrell hardy roake was a large oval with floortoceiling windows and a set of glass doubledoors looking out on a small grassy roof garden and similar large windows facing the main lobby the idea had looked terrific in the architectural plans and even when the remodel had been completed but in practice it soon became obvious that the place was a fishbowl everybody walking by could clearly see who was inside and often exactly what was going on in there around the huge circular table in the land of attorneyclient privilege and secret negotiations this did not turn out to be a plus for the business to rectify the situation david freeman had ordered several large potted trees to be delivereddieffenbachia palms some citrusto partially block the view or at least mitigate the lack of privacy over the years more greenery had been addedgiant ferns rubber trees a california redwood that now scraped the thirtyfoot ceiling bringing potted flora to the office became an unspoken trophy moment for freeman and his associates after a win in a big case and the room came to be known as the solarium and here today technically a few minutes after the close of business gina had her discovery folders and yellow legal pads spread out on the table in front of her she turned at the knock on the side panel of the door hey wes come on in dont let me bother you he said gert and i are just passing through she nodded absently as her partnerhis tshirt today read take the message on your bumperand stick itled his labrador back behind gina through the room and out onto the grassy lawn where theyd put in the memorial bench for david in another minute the outside door opened again and they were back inside poor girl wes said i thought she was going to die if she didnt get outside to pee but theres no way i bring her down here before phyllis leaves i dont see her as a dog person do you gina straightened up in her chair her shoulders rose and fell wes she motioned to the many piles of paper surrounding her youre busy im sorry the hearings tomorrow gorman thats the one is it as bad as the papers make it look close but wes he held up a hand got it youre working im out of here come on gert gina still likes you im sure she notices that youre not even on a leash shes just busy gina looked over shaking her head wearily but unable to suppress a small smile sorry gert she said good dog very impressive whats impressive dismas hardy suddenly appeared behind wes and gert gina finally put her pen down pushed her legal pad a few inches away whats impressive is how anybody gets any work done around here she turned to face her two partners guys hearing tomorrow im a little overwhelmed gorman farrell said to hardy i guessed hardy said then turned to gina he pay you yet since hed become managing partner of the firm he kept a pretty firm eye on the bottom line hes had a little trouble getting to the bank gina said in fact hes had a pretty tough couple of weeks in general maybe youve read something about it in the papers hardy broke a grin that would be no then a little more serious now so bring him a blank check in jail im not worried about getting paid diz hes good for it not if he did it farrell said gert sit anyway gina you kill your wife you dont get to collect the insurance on her its one of those dumb rules yeah well he didnt kill his wife so it wont be a problem uhoh farrell said gina sat back in her chair just because you believed a guilty client who lied to you wes that doesnt make it a general rule of the universe innocent people get arrested and go to trial and get acquitted right farrell said all the time when was the last one exactly though i forget was that scott peterson oh no thats right he was guilty i believe mr hardy here has seen a few innocent clients if im not mistaken well he got some of them off anyway hey hardy struck as quick as a snake punching farrells shoulder they were innocent thats why seefarrell rubbing his new bruise turned to ginaits sad he still believes it its easy to believe things if theyre true hardy shot back im just saying gina dont get your hopes up no you wouldnt want to do that you wouldnt want to believe anything good was ever going to happen okay then wes said as long as that concept is clear he looked down at his dog cmon gert shes going to be all right its time for us to go home dismas hardy stood in the doorway for another moment and made sure that wes and his dog had gone up the stairs then he stepped inside the solarium and closed the door behind him so hows it looking bad enough gina flashed him a weary hopeful evanescent smile then this new discovery i got an hour ago discovery was of course supposed to be all of the evidence that the prosecution had collected in a casepolice reports witness testimony forensic and medical records photographs everything gina had gotten the first box of these records from gerry abrams office within two days of stuarts arrest the rest of itfurther transcripts with witnesses more police writeups whatever came intended to arrive in dribs and drabs if i didnt keep getting ugly surprises id be happier hardy pulled up a chair next to her like what she grabbed at a manila folder and passed it across to him as he turned over the photographs contained in it she explained their significance juhle went up to stuarts mountain retreat at echo lake with a warrant last week he thought he might find some evidence of deliberation or premeditation im thinking he hit the mother lode hardy turned the picture over what happened here it looks a hurricane hit the place either that or some guy named stuart you didnt know about this he never mentioned it its never come up hardy was flipping through the folder his second time through this is the wife i presume he held up a closeup of a smiling woman in a frame behind a web of shattered glass another picture showed a table and chairs knocked over or lifted up on their sides lying in a scattering of broken plates bowls and other glassware in another the mattress was halfway off the bed its stuffing coming out well hardy held up the bed picture at least now you know why he couldnt sleep i couldnt get comfortable with the bed like this either then seriously he asked have you talked to him about this yet no i just got it this afternoon after id spent half the day with him and oh did i mention my charming half hour with clarence this morning too thinking it might be better news hardy took the bait howd that go i cant decide which part was worse my ethical failings or my incompetence she gathered the folder of pictures back to her then sighed deeply he was as mad at me as ive ever seen him diz it was bad maybe irreparable i doubt that hardy said hes eaten me for breakfast a few times and were still pals hell get over it if you will gina nodded the picture of glumness let me ask you something diz youre up on this case right a shrug just whats in the news whats it look like to you honestly hardy killed a second or two admiring the ferns then came back to gina with a somber look i might be wrong he said but since your pxa preliminary hearinghas a probablecause standard of proof which is a long long way from a reasonabledoubt standard bottom line the judge holds him to answer this was legalese telling gina that she was going to lose tomorrow and her client was going to have to go to a full trial of course thats assuming im a reasonable mind which is not a slamdunk assumption but if youll grant me that then youve got a reasonable mind with a strong suspicion that a crime has been committed and that your client committed it and thats what the statute mandates even without any physical evidence hardys brow went dark what are you talking about they got physical evidence up the wazoo an autopsy probably a murder weapon pictures of a tornup cabin plus a strong motive an eyewitness prior domestic violence a bunch of lies your client told and oh wait before i forgethe grabbed a gun and took off before the police could get him in jail did i leave out anything of course he did send his daughter to threaten a witness too but maybe that was her idea your clients going to trial gina you better get used to it hardy gave her a shrug you asked me on a less confrontational note he added you got anybody else to point at gina shook her head no wyatts talked to caryns business partner whose life got way better when caryn died plus he had an affair with her a while ago his alibi is weak too but we cant put him at the scene he even provided fingerprints to wyattvoluntarily and no match beyond that theres nobody else close except maybe this guy who sent stuart a couple of threatening emails his car is whats killing us the neighbor girl seeing it hardy reflexively corrected her you mean saying she saw it i didnt say that i thought i did no what you said was the neighbor girl seeing it and not to beat on you when youre down thats the kind of slip thatll kill you youre right you are so right ginas face went blank her voice hollow you know she began stuart wanted to fire me this morning i talked him out of it im thinking now that maybe that was a mistake that im not ready for this everybody feels that way gina its performance time youll rise to it like you have before a hundred times but never in a murder case hardy embodied nonchalance same rules same procedures same people in the courtroom youll get your sea legs and be fine but let me ask you one sighing again she nodded all right shoot you believe your man didnt do it right hes factually innocent and forget about wes you dont have to explain why to me if its good enough for you okay yes hes innocent so use that if hes innocent what really happened whats your theory on the case gina pursed her lips looked into the middle distance she was expecting somebody he came and they had a disagreement about something important no more than importantlifealtering somehow she was going to ruin this guys life so he had to kill her hardy contemplated that for a moment so she was having an affair yes definitely a beat then yes okay then theres your case so heres ten cents of free advice prove it it was still dark out when gina heard her morning chronicle hit her front door and since she wasnt sleeping anyway reached out in her pajamas and brought it in the end of the balmy spell prefigured for the past several days by increasing winds and scudding cloud cover was now reality enough that the paper was wrapped in plastic to keep it dry and although the actual rain hadnt begun to fall clearly it was going to be wet and cold gina had stayed at the office with her discovery folders until nearly nine oclock then packed them up in her lawyers briefcase thinking it might bring her luck and wondering all the while at the same time if it was a good idea she had taken a taxi to the rue charmaine the restaurant directly under david freemans old apartment on mason one block straight downhill from the mark hopkins hotel that had been their favorite rick came out of the kitchen and showered her with attention then in a custom longestablished by david rick first determined what wine shed be drinkingin this case a half bottle of gevreychambertinand then brought her several small private special dishes that did not appear on the menu to match the wine home by eleven wrestling with all that surrounded her case stuart david juhle clarence caryns phantom lover and killer she finally fell asleep sometime after the last time she remembered glancing at her clock until she was looking at it again at wide awake when the paper hit the front door it was the excuse she needed to throw off her covers she knew she wasnt going back to sleep today might as well not fight it in her singlemindedness since stuart had been arrested gina had neglected to do any grocery shopping and now the pickings in her home were slim she told herself that this wasnt smart if she was to have the energy she was going to need in court but that wasnt going to help her this morning nothing remotely resembling a meal spoke to her from the pantry shelves but she had one frozen teriyaki rice bowl left in her freezer and not really in the mood for it she nevertheless put it in the microwave and started the coffee going six cups worth returning to the kitchen table sitting down opening the paper she felt some undefined sense of relief that at least for today stuart was off the front page although ironically enough she thought here was a picture of jedd conley and his wife on page three at some fundraising event with an accompanying article about his anticipated run for the us senate he was still being coy and hadnt definitely committed but obviously someoneone of horace tremonts political allies no doubthad floated the rumor to see how it played on the street judging from the article it was going to play pretty well thinking back to the night hed put the make on her ten days before gina shook her head in a kind of disgusted wonder she didnt hate or even dislike jedd in fact to the contrary but why she wondered was it always these guys with a kind of slippery personal morality who got drawn to highlevel politics and all too often elected it drove her nuts which is why she rarely allowed herself to think about it but seeing the story now in the paper she resolved that if jedd did decide to run she wouldnt vote for him even if he was charming sexy discreet it wasnt going to happen the timer on the microwave sounded as gina finished the first section of the paper she turned it over as she was getting up stirring the rice absentmindedly she brought it over by the coffee machine put it down and poured herself a cup with a spoonful of sugar on automatic coffee in one hand rice bowl in the other she returned to her seat at the table noticing that outside it was still dark the cup stopped halfway to her mouth and she put it back down softly staring at the familiar name under the headline in the regional news that had caught her eye apparent suicide in foster city police in foster city are treating as a probable suicide the death apparently by sleeping pills of a woman found yesterday in her bed in the harbor creek condominium complex kelley gray rusnak years old and unmarried had been a laboratory specialist for the san bruno medical technology company polymed innovations inc for the past years when she failed to appear or call in her absence at work last friday and then this monday her employers became concerned and notified the police william c blair piis president said kelley was one of our most reliable employees and when she didnt call in sick we were very concerned that something bad must have happened fully clothed when found ms rusnak police say appeared not to be the victim of foul play blair acknowledged that he had heard reports from the victims colleagues that she had been depressed in recent weeks and had recommended that she seek counseling an autopsy is pending funeral arrangements have not been announced but the family asks that in lieu of flowers contributions be made to gina knew that rain or shine or fog wyatt hunt usually started his day early with a jog from the warehouse in which he lived near the hall of justice out to the embarcadero then north to maritime park and back he didnt answer his phone at home when she called him so she left a message and her breakfast and coffee forgotten ran to her room and got changed into her wellworn jogging outfit and tennis shoes she would run across town down california and market and cut him off if she missed him shed go by his place she didnt miss him at gina ran at his side slowly enough through the light drizzle that they both could talk she was going to be one of my witnesses wyatt she was one of the two people stuart saw down the peninsula he wasnt fleeing from the arrest but going down to talk to these people and find out what they knew about caryns business i tried to subpoena her but couldnt get the damn thing served well now you know why this has to be related to stuart and to the dryden socket somehow she said she told stuart something was seriously wrong with the product so she killed herself over it why would she do that id be surprised if she did but you just said i said the cops in the paper were calling it a probable suicide im calling that pretty unlikely i mean two deaths in two weeks and the women were partners in the same project this doesnt raise a flag for you they jogged on together its a definite question wyatt said after a few more steps he added i could look into it but it would be an expensive fishing trip and hows that helping stuart in the here and now yeah i know its not theyd gotten pretty much to the end of the line where the asphalt of their running path ran into the breakwater a few hundred yards beyond the maritime museum at the corner of ghirardelli square out on the open water the bay was a churning mass of graygreen studded with whitecaps the cloud cover was dark thick unbroken and low over the golden gate bridge the wind gusty and fitful without discussion they turned and put the wind at their backs now allowing it to push them along making it easier to talk too okay gina said lets leave kelley and go back to caryn do you think she was sleeping with somebody wyatt huffed probably diz says thats our killer hes probably right so who do we got actual names mcafee maybe pinkert the guy down in palo altofurth conley gina came to an abrupt stop conley you mean jedd conley hunt keeping up his pace jogging in place shrugged sure why not they talked on friday maybe they made a date for sunday night seeing ginas reaction wyatt said im just throwing out possibilities gina everybody we know she talked to i dont know if anybodys even asked conley if hes got an alibi i could find out quick enough you ought to do that gina went back into her jog wyatt falling in beside her eliminate him if nothing else but whoever she was seeing they had to meet up somewhere they had to plan it somebody might have seen them or heard something maybe not wyatt said not if it was doctor bob mcafee wyatt bobbed his head lots of places to hide out in their new clinic space it would have been a piece of cake gina as long as they mostly didnt want to do it laying down the same would hold true of pinkert too even if she didnt like fat guys who said that mcafee well she liked pinkert enough to ask him to be her partner whats his alibi i dont have one for him either mcafee basically just said it was no chance okay we should get that too they ran in silence for about half a block then gina went on id like you to put in all the time you can on this wyatt go back to the hospital and start with the assumption that caryn was having an affair see what you can find do you have her phone records they were with the discovery docs i havent done much with them ill want them done what else but think fast theyd gotten to the ferry building the foot of market street this is my turnoff both of them came to a halt neither breathing hard ive probably got most of the rest ill call your office if i need anything else you wont forget the alibis for everybody right wyatt said everybody in the whole world the whole kelley rusnak situation refused to go away but before gina had even gotten home from the runwalking up the steep grade of california street on the way backshe got to thinking about something that struck her as anomalous in the news story and that led her to what she thought was a pretty good idea by the time she was in her kitchen she was sold on it it was still early just after seven oclock but she had no compunction about making the phone call to another longtime acquaintance who was also a member of jackmans kitchen cabinet jeff elliott was the columnist who wrote citytalk every day for the chronicle and gina had what she believed was a legitimate scoop jeff had been conspicuously silent to date on the gorman case probably because he didnt deal so much in innuendo as in hard news he wasnt starstruck and he had friendsjackman and ginaon both sides of the matter he was also generally regarded as a class act who didnt feel the need to spin the truth for a headline wheelchairbound now with slowly advancing multiple sclerosis he already had his column and his byline he had nothing to prove and he usually avoided trolling in the turbid waters of slander and leakage favored by so many of his fourth estate colleagues he picked up on the second ring apparently awake for hours this is jeff elliott jeff good morning its gina roake back in the fray too he said i must say i appreciate the personal invite but i was already planning to attend attend what your hearing today thats what youre calling about isnt it as a matter of fact no not really although ive got a story that might be related might be probably is i just dont know how which is where the ace investigative reporter comes in gina thought no wonder jeff was so universally wellliked exactly she said im guessing youve seen the paper today im further guessing youve still got it within arms length would i be correct its almost scary he said okay ive got it what second section page six under digest she heard him turning the pages over the phone so were not in the city there was no mistaking his disappointment jeff drew his columns almost exclusively from within the boundaries of the city and county of san francisco interesting news might happen elsewhere but if it wasnt on his turf he usually passed it along to someone else so gina spoke up quickly im predicting were going to get here pretty fast you see the suicide in foster city got it kelley rusnak thats her lab assistant at pii guess who she was the assistant to dont say marie curie shes not old enough caryn dryden stuart gormans wife although jeff had not yet written a column about the case he knew that the hearing was scheduled for this morning and he knew the principals by heart correct although you notice the article doesnt mention that it also doesnt mention perhaps because the reporter had no way of knowing that id tried to subpoena ms rusnak for stuart in the preliminary hearing gina paused for a second letting jeff absorb the fact you also might notice that the spokesman for the company isnt some personnel person somebody with hr its the ceo himself william blair talking about being worried about a lab assistant because she missed two days of work this in a company with over a hundred and fifteen employees on site okay jeff was following her she went on the reason i know all this and the reason i wanted her to be my witness is because on the day that stuart gorman was arrested last week he got a call at home from kelley rusnak and then met her in some parking lot down the peninsula what did she have to do with him nothing directly shed only met him a few times but she gives him a reason to be down the peninsula other than running from an arrest warrant she also thought something about the work they were both doing at pii might have had something to do with caryns death a long silence ensued during which gina read jeffs mind i dont blame you for considering that this is me trying to get another version of events out in front of the public jeff but two things first i just wouldnt do that youve known me a long time thats not my game second all this is easily and independently verifiable you call bill blair ask a few questions you like his answers you leave it alone but i dont think you will like his answers i think theres an enormous story here about what these two women some of that yes but more about the project they were working on have you ever heard of the dryden socket no well sit tight and hold on she gave him a succinct rundown of what shed learned about caryns invention the incredible profit it was poised to make the problems with the clinical trials the late reporting caryns threats to expose piis behavior the pending fda approval the mezzanine loans fred furth and his venture capital group and now they would have us believe that this young woman kills herself she concluded i think bill blair is at the very least involved in some kind of coverup he wants that socket to get to the market with fda approval and hes going to hide the negative test results hows he going to do that clinical trials theyre public documents right but these results came in after the trials were completed technically theyre not part of the approval process now apparently theyre coming in mostly as questions to pii could this death or this clot be from the socket so if theres no whistleblower on the inside like caryn or this poor girl kelley nobody gets to find out about whats going on jeff hesitated then said youre right about one thing this changes the complexion of things around gorman if i put it out and any part of its true its all true you can check it all yourself as im sure you will of course but if this is any part of your case with the coverage youre already getting what im saying is its going to go national in a heartbeat that would be a nice bonus i admit get another version of things out there in the ether plus something else might shake loose this case needs another suspect in a bad way what do you think jeff took most of thirty seconds a very long time before he said i like it up to caryn drydens murder anyway but i still cant understand why this girl killed herself if she was whistleblowing on this unless someone threatened her somehow but even then gina cut him off thats the part i cant figure out either jeff and with my case heating up the way it is i cant even send investigators out to look theres no time and ive got other priorities but im sure theres something here something big and it would be an incredible coincidence if it wasnt somehow connected to my case i just cant see how it wasnt until shed hung up that another thought struck gina the coverup scenario shed just described so eloquently to jeff elliott would benefit anyone who held stock in pii or stood to gain from the timely approval of the dryden socket with caryns death the ownership of all of the familys pii stock as well as the huge negotiated return on caryns million mezzanine loan would all go to stuart other suspects as shed hoped aloud to jeff elliott might in fact shake loosebill blair fred furth but if one were inclined to view her client as guilty to begin with and this seemed to include the whole world at the moment then shed just set in motion an investigation that would only give stuart more not less motive her stomach tightened and she fought her way through the cramp with shallow breathing then shakily stood up to go in take a shower and get into her courtroom clothes a covered but opentotheair corridor extends from the back door of the hall of justice past the jail on the left and the morgue on the right and ends at a parking lot reserved for police and other official vehicles today at am the walkway was wet and windswept and gina was hurrying headdown to get to the jail to meet with her client she nearly walked into the young woman who stepped into her path oh im sorry i kymberly what are you doing out here in the cold like this i tried to see my dad but they wont let me in thats because its early for visiting hours but what are you doing here your father said youd gone back to school she shrugged schools bullshit she gestured to the jail theyre letting you in arent they yes but im his lawyer the girl didnt look good she was in flipflops a pair of torn blue jeans and a camouflage sweatshirt with a hood weather what weather she hugged her arms to her body the hollows under her eyes were dark enough to be bruises her shoulderlength hair hadnt seen a brush or a comb since shed last slept which might not have been recently are you okay kymberly im fine what did you want to see your dad about nothing have you eaten anything today are you back staying with debra maybe i dont have to tell you where im staying no thats true but i need to be able to find you if youre going to testify who said i was doing that didnt your dad tell you about that you remember well need you if bethany starts talking about how your dad threatened her she probably wont though thats bogus i know but she might believe thats what happened i doubt it shes not stupid gina gave up all right but just to support your dad itd look good if you were in the courtroom and then if it came up we could use you sure thats what you guys do isnt it use people so feel free walk all over me if you want i wont do that im trying to avoid having to issue you a subpoena and if youre just there with us i wouldnt have to exasperation played over her features but gina trying to stay nice took another tack so are you getting enough sleep you look very tired kym so do you that was enough gina decided to confront the overt antagonism straight on why are you being so rude to me because youre screwing up and its hurting my dad you ought to quit i offered to do that yesterday your dad decided to keep me on why would he do that because i believe hes innocent most other lawyers probably wouldnt he seems to think thats important gina much more heavily dressed nevertheless was starting to feel the chill and knew that kymberly must be near freezing she pointed to the door that led to the jail im cold standing out here she said putting it all on herself lets go inside the lobby was all glass block and industrial linoleum as welcoming as a bus station but it was dry and there was no windan improvement gina walked over to the plastic bench against the righthand wall and sat at one end kymberly took the other as far from gina as the bench allowed so youve taken some more days off school do you think thats a good idea the young woman turned on her school what do you care if im in school what am i going to do in school falling into adult mode gina tried to give her a reasonable answer whatever you were doing there before this happened with your mother kymberly you had plans then dont lose them over this kymberly rolled her eyes right heres the thing though how about if i never went to school in the first place is that true is that true is that true mocking ginas tone why is that such a shock nice little kymmie didnt do what her mommy wanted what do you think like schools going to do me a lot of good right im going to be a better person give me a break like all that education made my mom such a sweetheart shaken by this information gina barely trusted herself to breathe she wanted to know more but knew that if she betrayed that fact to kymberly the girl would stop talking her expression neutral gina looked across at her but you wanted to see your dad today my dads okay i wanted to tell him how important it is he gets off on this he knows that no he doesnt not if hes willing to gamble on you just because he likes you what do you mean likes me finds you attractive hows that clear enough did you ever think it might be because im a good lawyer how would he know whatve you done good yet gina opened her mouth but found no words kymberly shook her head just like with mom whats just like with your mom kym its the way his brain works he decides hes with mom and so he stays all those years even when she drives him out of the house for weeks at a time and gives him nothing back he decides he likes you so now hes keeping you on its just who he is even if youre not doing the job he needs done im trying to do that job kymberly i really truly dont believe he killed your mother its not believing dont you understand i know he didnt do it one of the jails admitting officers glanced over from where he stood behind the counter everything all right over there gina held up a handeverything was under control turning back to kymberly she said what does that mean you know it how can you know it more than i do is there something specific you should tell me the questions stopped kym abruptly she looked first down then across to the admitting counter then at last back to gina i just know him i just know him shaking her head as though to clear her thoughts she said youve got to keep him out of prison he cant go to prison dont you understand that cant happen tears welled up and brightened her eyes gina reached out to touch her and offer her some comfort but suddenly she bolted up and with an anguished sob broke for the door gina immediately on her feet got outside only in time to catch a last glimpse of kym as she disappeared around the edge of the building in the attorneys visiting room trying to shake off her reaction to kym gina heard the knock from the deputy and a second later was standing up preparing herself to look strong for her client as stuart appeared at the door when she saw him though she could feel something go out of her out of the forced animation in her face where are your dressout clothes she asked her voice sounding hollow and shaky even to herself dressing out was a courtesy afforded prisoners going into trial they were allowed to wear their own clothes and shoes instead of the orange jail jumpsuit and paper slippers the idea was to minimize the bias that jail garb creates for a jury that wasnt the rule at prelim where there was no jury to be prejudiced nevertheless gina had over the years tried to dress out her clients as often as she could if only for the tiny psychic lift it might give them the nod to dignity from time to time her requests to dress out her client for prelim had been granted expecting the same result with this latest request shed gone to stuarts home over the weekend and brought a couple of changes of clothes down to the jail shed never received notice to the contrary so it really hadnt occurred to her that the courtesy would be denied in this case but here was stuart now not just in the typical jail orange jumpsuit but a red flightrisk jumpsuit shackled hand and foot she seemed to be taking it worse than stuart who actually struck a fauxmodeling pose for an instant flashing a smile at her i thought id go for something bold in red he said then shrugged as though it were of little import to him i asked the guards when i should change and they said it wasnt happening christ gina leaned back against the table stuart came and stood about a foot in front of her hey its okay she looked up at him not really stuart but all the weight of the morning again bore down on her and she hung her head christ she said again he touched the side of her arm you all right finally she looked up and met his eyes its just been a monster of a morning youre going to want to sit down kelley rusnak hit stuart pretty hard like gina he in no way believed that she had killed herself she had not been depressed when hed been talking to her quite the contrary she had been outraged eager to help right a wrong ready for a fight there must be more to the story that hadnt come out yet that would perhaps be discovered at the autopsy gina told him about her call to jeff elliott that he was going to try and follow up on the story if he could that if they got lucky it could broaden the case away from him although since stuart still stood to gain from any dryden socket profits that effect might be mitigated of course he said you wouldnt want unmitigated good news dont worry about that they were both on the hard wooden chairs at the long table and gina knocked on the tabletop okay that brings us to number two again not pretty how many do we got four first was kelley second these she opened her briefcase and took out the photos of the echo lake cabin that shed shown her partner in the solarium just last night stuart took them and it seemed to take him a minute to recognize the first picture for what it was when he finally did he swore under his breath then quickly flipped through the bunch of them whered they get these juhle got a warrant and went up to your place stuart took in a deep breath then let it out in a rush i got really drunk he said ive always said i was furious then can they use these ill try to have them excluded but if i were the judge she stopped youd say they spoke to my state of mind i think i would too okay he said were now officially even in what way well the problems with the arrest we can put that on you but these pictures i bet i could have remembered what id done up there and had somebody go by and clean up a little gina nodded at him i bet you could have too its just with finding caryn and all i get it and thats going to be my argument back at them you had all the time in the world to get back up there and clean it up good as new and it never occurred to you because you hadnt done anything to make you think you needed to clean it up thats really okay yahoo he sat back in his chair and crossed his arms so whats number three number three she said is kymberly he showed nothing but perplexity kymberly what about her she was here this morning where here at the jail she wanted to see you but they wouldnt let her in it was too early bastards its a jail stuart theres visiting hours he sighed in frustration then suddenly the obvious question hit him wait a minute she was down here what about school debra told me kym just went back up after the funeral she cant be missing this many classes he brought his hand to his forehead squeezed at his temples god ive got to talk to her is she coming back later will she be at the hearing ive got to see her stuart gina kept her voice lowkey the thing is she just told me she never went up to school in the first place the confusion played all over his face what of course she did i talked to her up there that first week every day i mean he stopped stared at gina completely at a loss you called on her cell phone didnt you or she called you she never went up there thats what she said so what where is she staying i dont know id guess somewhere in the city maybe a boyfriends i dont know you didnt ask her yes i did she told me it was none of my business she wants me off the case she says im no good for you youll wind up in prison she got very upset very upset then ran out crying stuart took it in with his arms crossed his chin on his chest evidently gina said and this is number four youre keeping me on because youve got some kind of a schoolboy crush on me and if thats the case thats a bad reason i will get you through this hearing and then help you find another attorney he sat still for several more seconds before he opened his eyes and looked across at her my wife has just been killed gina no offense to youyou seem like a terrific personbut no matter what my daughter says im not in the market i never said anything remotely indicating that ive got any romantic thoughts about you or anybody else because i dont its just too soon i dont have any feelings at all if you want to know the truth except this fear over how all this is going to turn out this is so entirely the kind of thing that kymberly might imagine and make real for herself is she taking her pills did you ask i didnt ask if i had to guess id say no he sat with it for another moment she never went up to college at all unless she was lying to me this morning which i hate to say it we cant rule out could you call up there and check reed college in portland of course i can do it right now it didnt take five minutes kymberly had never checked in at the college theyd already given her dorm room to another student on their waiting list stuart all but talked to himself so she might have been herei mean in san franciscowhen she talked to caryn on saturday and sunday for a long beat gina sat frozen to her chair what did you just say when just now that kym talked to her mother on both saturday and sunday yeah he said i told you that he leveled his gaze at her didnt i i must have told you that im sure i would have remembered stuart this is the first im hearing about it what did they talk about kym never said i never asked we got off the topic kym never said gina repeated you never asked a long and disappointed sigh i thought she was in portland stuart said right thats what you thought what do you think now i think im a fucking idiot it never occurred to me she might be down here where did she he ran his hand up through his hair oh never mind god with a hangdog look he said im killing us here today arent i first the cabin pictures now this gina was frustrated and furious with her clients consistent failure to understand his own plight but she wasnt about to beat him up again over it he seemed to be doing a good job of that on himself she simply shrugged you didnt know she said how can you help that i could have thought about it about all these things i dont know what else there might be but suddenly im afraid i havent given it all to you which puts you in an awful place she wanted to say that wherever it put her it was better than where he was instead she forced a nonchalant smile ill live and tell you what she said if anything new comes to you dont worry about repeating yourself ill deal with the redundancies hows that enough with the recriminations and the handholding though she thought meanwhile gina went on it would be good to know what kym talked to caryn about if she comes by to see you again maybe you could ask her or hey with a little flourish she handed stuart her cell phone and after a slight hesitation he punched in his daughters number she wasnt picking up and he said kym its me gina tells me you came by to see me this morning and they wouldnt let you in maybe you could be in court todaydepartment nine thirty and then we could have a visit after that if you need to get a message to me its okay to go through gina i just want to know that youre all right he closed the phone and handed it back i didnt want to mention the calls to caryn until im with her probably a good idea for a brief second there was eye contact between them but both attorney and client looked away the unspoken thought that hovered in the air was too dangerous to voice there was every chance that last sunday kymberly had finally told her controlling mother that she wasnt going to school perhaps shed come to the house and told her in person it would not have been pleasant in any event kymberly would know considerably more about some of her mothers thoughts and actions on the last day of her life than anyone else it was gina knew even possible that kymberly was in some way involved in caryns death she sensed that her client was wrestling with the same thought or maybe hed already decided how he was going to deal with it stuart she said you remember how you took the heat for kymberly on those domestic disturbance calls you said you had done it when you knew it was really her he shook his head im not saying i did it in this case though this was of course technically true but the fact remained that while he was under suspicion his daughter was not to what length she wondered would stuart go to protect kym would he even hide something from gina and sacrifice himself if that were the choice but before she could frame the question the deputy knocked on the door and announced that they were out of time they were shackling the jailed prisoners together for their short walk over to the hall of justice and its courtrooms peeking out from where she and stuart were waiting in the cell that served as a holding tank behind department gina could see that as advertised it was going to be a full house even by the standards of the busy prelim courts the courtroom itself was a utilitarian space completely windowless with its old blond furnishings and high ceiling it had the feel of ginas old high school library the gallery featured theaterstyle seating with about eighty chairs once the judge had gotten rid of the normal crush of business fully three fourths of them would be cordoned off for the media every seat was already taken and though there was very little standing room the back wall accommodated those willing to deal with the discomfort gina recognized several talkinghead types from the networks as well as some local print reporters including jeff elliott in his wheelchair in the center aisle she might have expected it but didnt and was therefore happily surprised to see both dismas hardy and wes farrell there on the defense side to lend their moral support jedd conley sat a row in front of them chatting amid the hum to debra dryden who was there on stuarts side of the gallery as a witness albeit a hostile onefor the prosecution debra along with all the other witnesses would have to leave the gallery as soon as the first witness was called but at least stuart would see her in the courtroom showing her support when he came in there was no sign of kymberly gina wondered at the rest of the crowd on her side of the gallerypeople shed never seen before trial groupies or lookieloos she thought until she noticed that a couple of them in the front row were holding what appeared to be various copies of stuarts books fans she realized and the sight of them for some reason cheered her slightly the other side was just as crowded but gina didnt recognize anyone except the medical examiner john strout len faro from the forensics team devin juhle and bethany robley and her mother besides faro several uniformed policemen filled in the entire third row of spectators in front of them inside the bar rail gerry abrams was officiously arranging folders while making easy small talk with one of the bailiffs she turned around to face her client who hadnt much enjoyed being chained to twelve other inmates who had walked in their paper slippers now wet into the back door of the hall and around to their cages behind the respective courtrooms he sat slightly forward on the concrete bench that afforded the only seating in the cell looking as though he didnt have a friend in the world she looked down at him i think weve got some fans of yours out there she said theyre holding your books my books stuart shook his head talk about a different world then suddenly he seemed to perk up himself did i tell you i got a message from my publisher yesterday youll never guess your sales are going through the roof no fair he said you guessed not exactly through the roof but theyre going back to press with all of them can you believe that sure from the one ive read they should its a great book yeah well im afraid the sales dont have much to do with the literary quality of the books themselves in fact gina heres a great idea maybe we want to string this whole trial thing out even longer time were done ill be rich youre already rich stuart and weve got to talk about money by the way im going to need a check from you soon my partners are getting a little antsy he cracked a small grin maybe we ought to wait and see how things go out there in the courtroom today that she said is a really bad idea hear ye hear ye the superior court state of california in and for the county of san francisco is now in session judge cecil toynbee presiding all rise toynbee was relatively new to the superior court bench and completely unknown to gina when he came through the door at the back of the courtroom she thought there must have been a mistake and some law student had run off with the real judges robes but no the freshfaced cleanshaven young man ascended to his chair peered out over the courtroom and smiled at one and all with an unfeigned enthusiasm gina felt as though she could almost hear him thinking this is so cool he leaned over and greeted his court reporter a decadeslong veteran named pat crohn and then sat down and clearly he wanted this prelim instead of doing the expected sending out this long prelim to another courtroom set aside for the purpose he did the opposite he quickly reassigned the other fifteen matters on his calendar dividing them up among the other halfdozen prelim courtrooms he was going to keep this one for himself and gina thought she knew why this wasnt going to be a typical hearsay prelim with police officers reading the statements of witnesses into the record true to his word jackman was giving her a real shot a real look at the evidence in the case the prosecution was going to call the actual witnesses to these events and even more extraordinarily abrams had told her that she could call any defense witness that she wanted this was going to be the real deal and toynbee wanted to watch it come down now gina sitting down at the judges cue put a hand on stuarts arm and gave it a little squeeze trying to impart to him a confidence she didnt quite feel a preliminary hearing was different from a trial in many ways not simply because of the standard of proof required from a strategic standpoint neither side gave an opening statement the prosecution would simply begin by calling witnesses whom the defense could crossexamine motions were rarely filed in advance judges would rule on the fly gina had no fewer than half a dozen objections to what she expected the prosecution to present and a good ruling on any of them could help out considerably even if it would not likely affect the outcome the judge comfortably seated now looked again with satisfaction at the gallery for a moment casting his eyes down in front of him he appeared to be scanning over some pages the hum in the gallery picked up for a minute and then gradually subsided on its own when it was perfectly quiet toynbee raised his eyes and nodded to ms crohn lets call the case pat he said with great amiability amiable or not though toynbee wasnt proving to be much of a friend to gina and stuart in the next ten minutes she asked formally to allow her client to dress out at least from now on she asked to have him unshackled if he couldnt be unshackled she asked at least that he shouldnt be chained to his chair she asked that photographers and particularly tv cameras be barred from the courtroom since witnesses were not allowed in court except while testifying but juhle as the investigating officer would be permitted to remain throughout the prelim she asked that he be required to testify first and so it went denied denied denied by the fourth or fifth denial toynbee actually seemed to be straining to put a moreorless friendly spin on the things im afraid thats another denial ms roake sorry the gallery behind her tittered with either sympathy or humor or both gina leaned over and whispered to stuart for the record i didnt think we were going to get many of these but i had to try stuarts response as he stared straight ahead with his hands folded in front of him on the defense table was a continual tiny nod as though he were humming a tune in his head at last that part of it was over gina closed her eyes and released a silent sigh of relief trying to remind herself that she really hadnt expected any different result although shed harbored small hopes on a couple of the motions but she consoled herself with the fact that at least abrams hadnt simply brought his case before the grand jury when no defense attorneys and no judges even were allowed to be present it was a truism that by using the grand jury a district attorney could indict a ham sandwich nor had abrams simply called juhle to recite the statements of the witnesses at least at this preliminary hearing stuart wasnt automatically going to a murder trial gina would have a chance to crossexamine the prosecutions witnesses raise doubt even call witnesses of her own beyond that shed get a chance to see the kind of case that abrams was going to present as well as a preview of the witnesses and evidence he would use at trial if it came to that not that she had much doubt of the eventual resultgiven the probablecause standard a trial was virtually inevitable but that was as david freeman used to say one of the many beautiful things about the law you just never knew exactly what was going to happen you kept firing your best guns andwho knewyou might hit something and do some real damage but now gerry abrams was on his feet rearranging yet another folder calling his first witness dr john strout as her partner dismas hardy had reminded her just the night before the prosecution only had to prove two things to succeed at this hearing that a murder had been committed and that the probable person who had committed that murder at least enough to bring a strong suspicion to a reasonable mind was the accused so abrams decision to call strout was both expected and expedient with one witness the prosecution would get half of its job doneprove that there had been a murder except this case wasnt so cut and dried the cause of death had always been drowning and the da only could get to murder by comparing the wine bottle theyd taken from the garbage can in stuarts kitchen to the fracture in caryns skull she thought calling strout was going to give her an early opening she came forward in her seat her nerves and the failure of her motions forgotten strout had been the medical examiner in san francisco for so long that his very presence on the witness standespecially for the professionals in the courtroom the lawyers and the judgemet the gold standard of instant credibility tall asceticlooking his white hair thinning but still slightly longer than conventional strout was every inch the picture of the country doctor in whom families would unhesitatingly place their trust in reality of course he was an urbane forensics wizard whose collection of torture instruments argued for a less benign characterization over the course of his fortyyear career hed probably spent a total of a full year actually testifying while sitting on the hard wooden chair in the witness box the inherent drama of the situationpronouncing upon the exact cause of a violent deathhad long since clearly lost its power over him to enthrall looking at him now as he took the oath gina thought that if he were any more relaxed theyd have to wake him up gerry abrams wore a pale green suit yellow shirt brown tie dumb clothes if thered been a jury gina knewway too flamboyantbut probably not an issue here he came a few steps out in front of his desk to her left greeted the good doctor and started right in doctor strout could you please give your name and occupation for the record they were under way john strout chief medical examiner for the city and county of san francisco and how long have you held that position normally without great cause gina would not intrude early and out of turn in any proceeding it tended to annoy judges but this time she felt she could start making some friends in the courtroom your honor she said defense will stipulate as to doctor strouts qualifications thank you ms roake mr abrams abrams turned to her and nodded his thanks doctor strout he said you did the autopsy on caryn dryden the victim in this case did you not i did with his accent the phrase came out ah deeid would you please tell us your findings and the clinical observations that support them among his other attributes strout was thorough he began with the delivery of the body to the morgue still in the final stages of rigor still warm due to its immersion in the hot tub at abrams prompting he talked about the blood tests he ran that indicated a blood alcohol level of point one one and also the presence of the narcotic pain reliever vicodin he described the depressed fracture behind caryns ear to which abrams said theyd return in a minute finally strouts unequivocal finding was that the cause of death was drowning now doctor abrams said could you talk for a minute about the time that death occurred i could strout replied but im not sure i could get it all done in a minute strout was enjoying himself as best he could time on the witness stand could get stultifying if you didnt break it up the gallery behind gina showed its appreciation with this tiny joke toynbee smiled too still obviously delighted to be where he found himself then back to business strout ran down the various permutations surrounding death in a onehundredandfivedegree bath its effect on both the onset and relaxation of rigor mortis core body temperature and how these issues affected the calculation of time elapsed since death but you were in fact able to calculate the time of death were you not fairly precisely i would say more precisely than if she hadnt been immersed in hot water clearly abrams and strout had rehearsed this moment yes sir slightly more so she died between about eleven fortyfive and twelve fortyfive the night before thank you doctor abrams then went over to what was usually the evidence table in the center of the courtroom although today there was very little on it he picked up the wine bottle that strout had referred to earlier it was distinctive enough to be recognizable the label said it had held edna valley chardonnay abrams had it entered as peoples one then handed it to strout on the stand do you recognize this bottle peoples one doctor i do when did you first see it inspector juhle brought it to the morgue at his request did you compare it to the injury on the victim to determine if it could have caused that injury in this most clinical of settings caryn was the victim and would be until the prosecutor used her name in front of a jury to humanize her at trial i did what did you find it was a perfect fit could you explain that further sure earlier i had shaved the hair from the scalp to expose the fracture which was pronounced and clearly defined i compared it to the shape of the bottle and concluded that the bottle could definitely have caused the fracture but doctor couldnt any bottle of this size and shape have caused an identical injury of course any object could have caused the injury but it would have had to have been the size and shape of this bottle doctor was the blow to the victims head enough to render her unconscious yes certainly enough to stun her for some period of time perhaps enough to knock her out so the blow itself didnt kill her no as i said the cause of death was drowning there was water in her lungs she was definitely breathing when she went underwater thank you abrams turned to gina your witness he said gina took what she hoped was an invisible deep breath pushed her chair back and got to her feet her legs much to her relief felt strong dismas hardy had cautioned her to watch out about standing up too fast or moving too far away from her table before she felt her sea legs come in under her wasting no time she walked to the center of the courtroom good morning doctor did you say that the blow from the bottle to the victims head rendered her unconscious no not exactly i said it could have it could have but not necessarily did no not necessarily was the blow hard enough to fracture the skull doctor yes doctor how long before being submerged in the water did ms dryden sustain this injury i dont know well wasnt that fracture associated with the bloody wound on the scalp yes it was and would that injury have bled after she sustained it yes now typically when you have a bloody injury you can see by the clotting and scabbing how long the victim survived after the injury isnt that true strout threw a glance over to abrams neither of them was smiling now in some instances well what you mean doctor by some instances is that if there had been significant scabbing an injury like this could have been sustained hours or even days before the drowning isnt that so no i dont think days if able to do so the victim would have sought medical attention after receiving this injury but certainly hours correct because this body was submerged in water any evidence of clotting or scabbing would have washed away right correct so for all you know caryn dryden could have sustained this injury hours before she was submerged in water isnt that the truth that would be accurate now also doctor you cant say that she was struck with the bottle as opposed to striking the bottle with her head correct let me be clear you dont know if someone hit her with the bottle or if she stumbled and fell and hit her head on the bottle im not sure thats a likely scenario were talking about an awful lot of force here are we doctor this injury was in front of her ear was it not right at one of the thinner parts of the skull yes so doctor it is true is it not that you cannot rule out the possibility that ms dryden for example walking on a slippery floor full of alcohol and vicodin stumbled and hit her head on a bottle of wine that she was carrying well no i cant absolutely rule that out and by the way doctor when you say the blow was enough to render her unconscious i think youve already said it would not necessarily have done so true so having inflicted this injury on herself she could have recovered from being stunned and thrown the bottle and the broken glass she was carrying into the trash compactor true i cant absolutely rule that out well doctor when you say you cant absolutely rule it out what youre saying is that you cant rule it out correct that is correct i cant rule it out all right leaving the fracture and the bottle for the moment let me ask you what if anything you found on the victims body that indicated someone had pushed her under the water im sorry other bruises finger marks on her shoulders tissue under her fingernails other signs of a struggle no there were none of those so is it not entirely consistent with the medical evidence that ms dryden could have injured herself and not realizing the extent of the injury got into the hot tub passed out and drowned well counsel i think anybody with this kind of an injury would have sought medical attention after a very short period of time if they were able to do so it would have been a very painful injury doctor what is vicodin it is a prescription drug and isnt that precisely the sort of prescription drug that a person might take if theyd just suffered a very painful injury yes thank you although she knew exactly what her next question would be gina paused for the judges benefit consciously frowning as though she were confused most uncharacteristically strout was showing small signs of discomfort shifting in the chair straightening his rimless bifocals adjusting his collar he was so nearly always infallible and considered so that this type of minute questioning was a rare occurrence and clearly an unwelcome one if she were in front of a jury gina would have slowed down even more at this point she wouldnt have wanted to stack her own credibility against the kindly and obviously very knowledgeable older gentleman but here she had no such concerns even though she believed that caryn dryden had been murdered she needed to nail down the fact that the testimony of san franciscos medical examiner in no way proved that point all right doctor she said moving along to the question of the victims sobriety at the time of her death youve testified that her blood alcohol level was point one one is that true yes and this level is considered legally drunk in california yes in fact isnt the legally drunk standard actually quite a bit lower at point zero eight thats true so caryn dryden wasnt just drunk was she she was smashed objection gina knew this was coming from gerry abrams even before shed finished saying her last words and was frustrated that shed allowed herself to get carried away and say them she didnt want anything to get in the way of her flow her rhythm judge toynbee didnt even have to think about it sustained he said gina came right back at strout doctor youve already said the victim also had a narcotic in her blood did she not is the use of alcohol contraindicated with the use of vicodin yes and why is that because theyre both central nervous system depressants and when someone mixes vicodin with alcohol what is the result it varies depending on the dosage of each but certainly lethargy respiratory depression maybe extreme somnolence skeletalmuscle flaccidity he shrugged it can bring on a host of problems up to and including cardiac arrest and incidentally doctor certainly the sort of thing that might make someone slip and fall down right thats right now in your vast experience and excluding ms dryden have you seen deaths that you attribute to excessive alcohol and drug consumption combined with hot tub use i have can you explain i sure can he sat back in the witness chair crossed one leg over the other and gave a short course on the dangers of alcohol abuse in conjunction with extended time in water that was above degrees respiratory failure collapse of the central nervous system he ended with but thats not what killed the victim in the case she drowned so youve testified doctor but in this case is there any way you can state with certainty that the victim inebriated as she was and with vicodin in her bloodstream did not simply pass out and slip under the water where she drowned no i cannot state that unequivocally i cant state it at all strout could barely keep a straight face hed just been subjected to as good a cross as any in his career he had to give the devil her due this was still probably a murder though his testimony had done little to prove it but as he liked to say this was his favorite sort of problem somebody elses abrams original battle plan had probably been to use strout to establish the murder and make the connection between the bottle the skull fracture and the drowning then never considering the possibility that gina would do to strout what shed just done hed call lennard faro from the csi team to establish the provenance of the bottle the socalled foundationwhat it was where it came from how it was relevantand then move on to his heavyduty motive evidence maybe ginas crossexamination of strout had left him shellshocked in any event gina was pleasantly stunned when abrams gave her the gift of calling faro to the stand and putting him through his very short paces gina knew exactly how to take advantage of this strategic error sergeant faro she began you said that you found this wine bottle in the trash compactor in the kitchen is that right yes maam and you took it out and labeled and bagged it and sent it to the police lab for analysis well not exactly like that as i said earlier i took the whole garbage bag to the lab and on my instructions they took out the bottle and any other relevant items and by relevant items you mean shards of glass in that same trash compactor do you not yes we compared those pieces with a part of another wineglass we found under the hot tub and they matched i see and did you find fingerprints on any of these glass pieces yes did you find stuart gormans fingerprints on any of these glass pieces no we didnt did you identify whose fingerprints they were no they didnt appear in our database having gotten all she could from that topic gina moved on now the bottle and the broken glass were in the trash compactor bag together is that correct yes faro didnt seem to know where she was going with this line of questioning and this suited gina fine was there anything else in the trash compactor bag sergeant any more glass you mean no i mean anything at all well sure i mean it was for garbage there was other garbage in it his tone and attitude induced a small buzz of laughter from the gallery he was trying to play the question as ridiculous and did you ask the lab to analyze this garbage as well the onlookers out in the theater seats now somewhat primed for drama from ginas earlier performance with strout had been listening quietly even intently but at this question another low hum of laughter rippled through the gallery thinking everyone was laughing at ginaperhaps they were faro couldnt quite hide a quick and confident smirk did i ask the lab to analyze the rest of the garbage he repeated right thats my question for what still playing it for a laugh gina shrugged i dont know evidence realizing that even if ginas question was ridiculous she was serious about it faro sat up i was with the lab techs and watched as they went through the whole bag we got the bottle and other pieces of glass but there wasnt anything else to look at just garbage yes just garbage hmm were there fingerprints on the bottle no it had been wiped now by wiped you mean that someone had taken a cloth or some other material and rubbed along the surface presumably to remove evidence that was found there right yes correct can you distinguish between an object that just doesnt happen to have any usable prints on it and one that has been deliberately wiped down yes we can typically an object such as a bottle will have something on it unless its been washed down or wiped dust debris smudges partial printseven if those partials arent good enough to give us an id and thats particularly true on a surface such as glass which is a good medium to hold fingerprints we found nothing like that on this bottle in the absence of evidence that it had just for example been washed it would appear that it had been wiped before it was put in the trash compactor but there was still blood on it isnt that true caryn drydens blood yes so the wiping wasnt completely successful was it no some microscopic traces had soaked into the label and whoever wiped the bottle failed to remove them completely but i have to tell you that otherwise he did a pretty darn good job let me ask you this sergeant was there any indication in the trash bag of what had been used to wipe the fingerprints off the bottle and presumably some of caryns blood as well like what like kleenex or paper towels maybe a dish towel faro looked confused well there might have been some paper towels but there wasnt any sign of blood on them but do you remember any such towels specifically from behind her abrams objected relevance your honor where is this going toynbee said i think i see where this is going ill listen to a few more questions overruled then he pointed a finger at gina i said a few ms roake yes your honor back to faro sergeant were there paper towels in the trash i dont specifically remember probably if so though are they still available for analysis no as i said it was just garbage after we went through it we tossed it out of course sergeant you are aware you could get dna from a paper surface such as a paper towel seeing the trap faro hesitated gina went right on so if someone indeed used that bottle to hit ms dryden and that same person wiped the bottle at the same time that they were removing their fingerprints they could have been leaving their dna isnt that right yes suddenly faros jokes about garbage werent feeling so funny but you didnt either save or analyze any of those materials did you faros eyes darted over to abrams out to the gallery this was the crux of the matterhe hadnt collected the most important evidence sergeant your answer it took him nearly a full minute which is a long and eerily silent time in a packed courtroom until finally he shook his head and said uh no and if you had retained that garbage as you called it and we had the paper towels used to wipe the bottle we might be able to know whether my client was the person whod wiped it down wouldnt we objection speculation it was but gina didnt care what the ruling was shed made her point from the bench before gina had even turned around to go back to her table toynbee tapped his gavel and called for the lunch recess standing at her place in front of the witness box gina let faro walk by her and turned to watch him stop to say a few possibly uncharitable words to gerry abrams she waited until faro had let himself out through the bar rail then on an impulse she walked the few steps to the prosecution table abrams was standing head down arranging his folders but after a moment looked up well he said looks like you drew first blood its a bad case gerry he shrugged its what it is and i wouldnt get my hopes up if i were you its still going to go to a jury without a murder youre kidding yourself another shrug well see its still a murderyou got nothing to rule it out anyway true but traditionally youre supposed to be able to prove it i intend to and a jury will buy it your mans guilty get used to it dismissing her out of hand he turned and walked through the gate in the bar rail out to the gallery where he cracked some joke that got the uniformed policemen chuckling gina stood rooted paralyzed with a sudden spike of anger these guys she thought what were they basing their prosecution on if it wasnt the facts of the case because surely the facts as shed seen them couldnt support anything approaching the bedrock certainty with which abrams juhle even jackman obviously felt that they were right could it be that it was just a question of arrogance she had the feeling that the pursuit of stuart did not spring from any sense of justice but from a belief that he was vulnerable convictable and that was all that matteredhed be another notch in the belt that was all a career step for gerry abrams a timely closed case for devin juhle proof that clarence jackmans administration was equalopportunity in prosecuting those who broke the law here they were in the midst of a wellattended highprofile hearing the states apparatus for punishing the guilty was in full array the district attorneys position set in stone and yet she had just shredded their contention that a murder had even been committed at all and gotten a straightforward admission that they hadnt collected the strongest possible evidence that might have tied stuart to what had happened whatever it had been and still obviously on a fundamental level none of this mattered to the prosecuting team it wasnt personal either to them or about stuart nor should it be she knew she was fine with that in the normal grinding mill of the legal system where most of the time there was no real question of the defendants culpability but the problem with that was that it seemed to create this mindset that was literally blind to the concept that someone could get into the system and be innocent perhaps this was really what wes had been warning her about all along you dont get involved with people you believe to be innocent because the fundamental function of the law wasnt to dispense justice shed said it herself not long ago it was about conflict resolution you say hes guilty i say hes not lets decide this case and get on to the next one before lunch because weve got five more of them this afternoon justice was nice something everyone hoped for and even usually attained but it was fundamentally a byproduct of a system designed effectively to settle disputes short of clan warfare if a conflict could be resolved by a conviction and that was apparently the case here then a warm body who could be convicted was all the system demanded and once those wheels were set in motion they inexorably rolled on perhaps farrell was right after allit shouldnt matter this much it was business the job was to provide the best defense the law allowed period but she suddenly saw with great clarity that even the best defense might very well fail and if that happened this case might wind up consuming years of ginas life to say nothing of stuarts she couldnt let this case be about conflict resolution a simple verdict it was going to have to be about the truth the medical offices for most of the doctors who worked in parnassus hospital and this had included caryn dryden were on the upper three floors of the sixstory building it took wyatt hunt the better part of a half hour starting with the information booth on the first floor to wade through the bureaucracy the hospital administration and then the various nurses and scheduling stations upstairs before he finally found himself in the staff canteen and lounge on the sixth floor stirring a paper cup of coffee pulling a plasticandmetal chair up to a table across from a young woman named cindy delgado cindy was probably in her early thirties short and slightly overweight she wore a neat blue kneelength skirt and starched white blouse mediumlength curly black hair framed a lovely face made prettier by the easy and bright smile with which shed greeted wyatt when hed introduced himself to her at her station down the hall a few minutes ago she wasnt smiling though as she stirred her own coffee and said its such an incredible waste she really was one of the best doctors and im not just saying that because shes not here anymore you know trying to say nice things with caryn everybody acknowledged it right from the beginning its so hard to believe that something like this can just happen to somebody like her out of nowhere in the middle of everything and then boom your life is over well it didnt just happen to caryn though somebody made it happen i guess thats true she sipped her coffee so you said youre working for stuarts lawyer does that mean you dont think hes guilty i dont think much of anything yet cindy were trying to understand a little more about caryns life do you think stuart could have killed her the directness of the question brought her up short i dont know ive just been hearing about it everywhere you know from what theyre saying it seems like he might have do you know him stuart she shrugged not really ive never actually said hello to him or anything that i remember he didnt come up here too much if ever really so no i cant say i know him how about when you first heard that caryn had been killed do you remember your thoughts then your very first ones she shook her head just that i couldnt believe she was dead that it had to be some mistake but of course it wasnt how about when you heard that it was a suspected murder i dont know im sorry i guess i didnt really think anything except maybe it was a breakin at her house or something like that and then they started talking about her husband so you had no reason to doubt it was stuart like what like maybe something that was happening here at the hospital something you might have heard or seen or simply known were you and caryn friends outside of work no i dont think she had too many friends outside of work okay then how about here how long had you worked for her four years exclusively well no but mostly i kept her book and you got along well really well we just didnt do things together outside of work so in all that time didnt you ever share any personal stories some i guess but really not too many her daughter and my son once in a while what about them were they together are they cindy smiled broadly my son is seven her daughter is eighteen no just mom stuff but beyond that she was a very busy person one appointment to the next boom boom boom then off to surgery time is money you know shed say that this brought another smile it wasnt a bad memory every day i bet wyatt half finished with his coffee had nothing cindy delgado seemed to take the world at face value and was clearly not a gossip if he was going to get any useful information here he was going to have to push her pushing his cup to the side he leaned in over the table cindy let me be honest with you he said caryns husband is in trouble he swears he had nothing to do with her death and my boss believes him she thinks caryn was having an affair in a couple of seconds cindys face went through a range of expressions initially immediately after wyatts words the suggestion the very conceptobviously caught her off guard her vivid eyes registered first surprise then perplexity and finally some kind of resolution but covering well she only said why does your boss think that wyatt shrugged when they found her she was naked in her hot tub there were two wineglasses caryn knew stuart wasnt going to be home that night my boss thinks she invited somebody over so youre saying that person came and killed her thats our working hypothesis yes he lowered his voice cindy when i first mentioned this you thought of something i saw it in your face no i for what its worth some of the other doctors who knew her thought caryn was seeing someone too starting sometime in the past few months did you notice any change in the way caryn was acting or seemed to feel about herself back then cindys coffee cup was on the table in front of her and now she reached out and started to turn it slowly staring at it as if it were a crystal ball without looking back up at hunt she said one day i opened the door to her office to deliver some xrays i thought shed gone out to her new clinic otherwise i wouldnt have just gone in anyway she must not have heard me come in and i heard her say i love you too and then she hung up and turned around and saw me standing there and it was like all of a sudden she was scared to death she actually went white saying id startled her and then she blurted out all panicked like that was stuart and i kind of made a joke of it and said i would hope so now cindy looked straight at wyatt but maybe im thinking now it wasnt so who thinking now was it she thought another minute biting her lip stopping herself she went on but no that would mean the perplexity was back in her eyes as she stared across the table at wyatt it would mean he killed her no i didnt say that no you didnt i did cindy this is too important to fool around with who are you talking about i cant imagine that i mean bobs got a family and bob mcafee i thought he was divorced yes but the three kids hes still in their lives he couldnt have killed anybody guys with children kill people every day cindy how well do you know him to talk to you know like all the doctors here maybe a little better because he was around more setting up the new clinic with caryn would they have had an opportunity to get together here what do you mean i mean physically get together conduct an affair here in the hospital maybe wyatt was going too fast but he had cindy talking about an uncomfortable topic and he didnt want to give her time between his questions to think about whether or not she should answer them she kept twirling her paper cup in front of her avoiding hunts eyes well i mean its a building full of rooms with beds in them what do you think so did you notice a change in caryns behavior over the summer a little bit maybe but mostly i just thought she was feeling all gung ho about her clinic and her inventionyou know about that hunt nodded except then both those things got complicated again she talked to you about them a little bit the last couple of weeks she was pretty uptight so i asked her and what did she say that it was just business stuff maybe shed spread herself too thin did she say anything specific about mcafee not that i remember how about doctor pinkert no she said no what cindy no i dont think they were personally involved bob maybe doctor pinkert id have to say no with that cindy broke out of her uneasy trance she stopped turning her cup she glanced at the clock on the wall doublechecked it with her watch uhoh i really should be getting back to my station she pushed her chair back and started to get up could you do one or two more questions with a small sigh she settled back into her chair just a couple though okay okay thank you you kept her book was that just for her medical appointments and surgeries mostly but youd have to know about her other activities so you avoid scheduling conflicts right sure of course so is there anybody else she saw on a regular basis that was in her life if you will well you mean all that stuff down the peninsula there was mr blair at pii the president you know and kelley her lab assistant and mr furth who was her broker she liked him i know mr furth yes she thought he was really hot i mean she joked about it she brought her hand up to her mouth but i probably shouldnt say that should i i dont mean she was having an affair with him she just thought he was cute cute maybe but with a good alibi so you dont have to worry about getting him in trouble however at her mention of kelley rusnak wyatt felt he owed cindy some information in return for all of her cooperation this is not good news but i should probably tell you maybe youve already heard but kelley caryns assistant apparently killed herself late last week the young womans mouth hung open her eyes flat the fact nearly decked her theres no apparent connection to caryn wyatt continued at least that weve heard about yet but its a pretty big coincidence if nothing else finally cindy found her voice again she wasnt murdered too then apparently not wyatt said sleeping pills man cindy was shaking her head in disbelief i dont like this this is too weird nobody likes it cindy but we dont know what it means if anything well its got to mean something dont you think she didnt just randomly kill herself a couple of days after caryn for no reason did she we dont know cindy we just dont know youd think there might be some connection but we dont know what it is but while were still on pii maybe you can tell me something about jedd conley who jedd conley assemblyman from san francisco evidently he was looking into some of the issues with pii for caryn do you know if they talked a lot or met up somewhere still obviously shaken by the news about kelley rusnak cindy took a beat before she said i dont really even know the name hes not in my book she looked into wyatts face god i still cant believe about kelley i know cindy took a deep breath let out a long sigh wow after a long moment of reflection on the tragedy suddenly she remembered to check her watch oh god she said ive really got to get back to work while he was at parnassus wyatt took the opportunity to go down one floor and see if he could get a minute with dr michael pinkert even though no one seemed to consider him as a fitting candidate for caryns lover the fact remained that he saw quite a bit of her and that she thought enough of him to invite him to join her and mcafee as a coequal third partner in their clinic so it would seem on the face of it that he could have had no motive to kill caryn since she was the one fighting mcafee for his inclusion in the clinic and its profits in fact though wyatt realized that pinkert fit as perfectly as any of the other possible suspects into ginas theory of the casethat she was in the hot tub with her lover and took that moment to tell him of a decision she had come to that would have struck him at the very least as an immense personal betrayal something that perhaps would have a profound financial impact as well and that might in fact ruin his life entirely it took no imagination at all for wyatt to hear caryn telling pinkert that shed decided mcafee was right they couldnt afford to take him on so she reluctantly was withdrawing her offer to him as well as her physical favors if added to this pinkert also suffered from the neurosis of the monthchronically low selfesteem anyway because of a weight problemand had become infatuated with caryn only to be summarily dumped after all the financial and personal promises hed made to her the risks hed taken for her hunt had no doubt that there was plenty of motive here for murder wyatts luck and timing couldnt have been better pinkert was between surgeries in his office when his scheduling person told him that there was someone who wanted to talk to him about caryn dryden he came right out and brought wyatt back into his office with him sorry about the accommodations pinkert said besides the doctors own chair by his tiny desk the only place to sit was on the papercovered examination table no problem wyatt boosted himself up onto it i appreciate your seeing me without an appointment if its about caryn im going to be available if its possible he said im still in shock if you want to know the truth ive already talked with the police so you must be with stuarts team thats right thats not a problem for you not at all why would it be wyatt shrugged you were close to caryn if you thought stuart killed her maybe you wouldnt want to help out his defense but pinkert brushed that off not a problem i find that if you tell the truth things tend to sort themselves out now how can i help you physically pinkert came as advertised probably closer to fifty years old than to forty he needed to lose some serious weight and yet he didnt strike wyatt as obese so much as softa man who because hed always been the class geek and always studied had possibly never done a lick of hard exercise in his life and whose sedentary nature had gradually caught up with him the handshake outside had been weak with the skin of his hand feeling almost bloated stretched over too much flesh as were his cheeks and the folds in his face around his protuberant eyes his lips were outsize toopurplish wet and swollen though this didnt appear to be a function of fat but of heredity which made hunt wonder since the trait was singularly unattractive he would have thought that people with those lips would have had more significant trouble finding a mate than their competitors and that over time they would have selected themselves out of the gene pool but apparently not beauty obviously continued to be in the eye of the beholder on pinkerts desk wyatt couldnt miss the large framed wedding photo of the doctor and his wife even at a glance a really lovely asian woman next to that formal wedding shot was another framed headshot of the wife she had a particularly beautiful modelquality face above the desk on the wall a more recent professional photo showed him and his wife and the four kids two boys and two girls the corkboard on the wall was a collage of maybe fifty snapshots held in place by pushpinsmore family lifeeveryone smiling healthy happy youve got a lovely family hunt said thank you its my greatest blessing he followed wyatts gaze over to the pictures and let them replenish him for an instant but then solemn he turned with a small sigh and said now caryn all right lets start with the clinic i gather youre out of that now it appears so they needed my capital and now bob mcafee oesnt how do you feel about that well disappointed of course i think the namebrand recognition caryn was going to get because of her dryden socket was going to be a terrific marketing tool for the clinic so i thought it was a tremendous opportunity but therell be others all in all it was a good learning experience if doctor mcafee does well with it i might open a clinic of my own someday and this will have shown me how it could be done so theres no hard feelings not really no not on my part anyway it was just a business decision all right do you mind if i ask you about your relationship with caryn a small patient smile did i kill her do you mean but he held up a hand stopping wyatts response its all right obviously if stuart didnt youre trying to find out who did so my answer to you is that i liked caryn very much and respected her as a doctor you may not know but ive already told the police that i was at home on the night she was killed my wife and i are hooked on masterpiece theatre sunday nights nine to eleven we never miss it especially jericho we love jericho of course that means itll probably be canceled he threw a quick glance over to his wifes picture and i know that leaves the time after eleven ive told the police id be happy to take a liedetector test if they felt they needed one but i had two surgeries that next day monday and to be fresh and rested for them i needed to sleep and that is what i did wyatt didnt feel like he needed a liedetector test he believed pinkert implicitly but there were still a few questions doctor let me ask you this did you get any indication that caryn was involved with anyone else besides her husband that assumes she was involved with her husband yes it does she wasnt well at least not the way i am with my wife how do you know that you pick these things up hes a rather wellknown authority on flyfishing you know and a couple of years ago kiyoko gave me a fly rod for christmas so i asked caryn if i should perhaps talk to him about getting lessons or how to start or any of that and what did she say well it was the strangest thing she just looked at me for a long minute like she wasnt exactly sure what i was talking about until she finally just shrugged at me and said she could give me his email that was her entire response his torso heaved as he took a breath my point is that i was fairly excited about the whole idea and usually you know well my experience is that if someone shows an interest in your spouses specialty or expertise you tend to show a little excitement yourself i mean when people come to me about kiyokos paintingsshe does incredible japanese block printswell you see im doing it there but with caryn and stuart with her really there just wasnt anything like that it was like she didnt want to be reminded that he was in her life very odd i thought all right he said so was she involved with anyone else pinkerts smile struck hunt as sad i really couldnt say at all i never saw her outside of a medical environment and she was always strictly professional in that context beyond that i spend my time either with my patients or with my family i find thats plenty so i tend not to notice little personal things that might be going on right under my eyes kiyoko makes fun of me about it that im such a nerd but i cant really help that its who i am i wouldnt worry about it said hunt you seem fine to me well im happy pinkert said the large unfortunate ugly mouth turning up in a cheerful smile and happiness i believe is the key dont you think your mouth to gods ear hunt said an hour later wyatt hunt was in north beach jedd conleys office was on powell between stockton and grant around the corner from mooses one of everybodys favorite restaurants so since his next stop was conleys he took the opportunity to eat a real lunch at one of the best bars in the city he ordered a simple moose burger which bore little relation to the fast food item of the same name at your local burger stand consisting as it did of freshly ground prime beef grilled over mesquiteblood rare in defiance of the food police and their ubiquitous threats of e colion a freshly made sourdough bun with lettuce and tomato and onion grilled if requested and a pickle made on the premises sated wyatt walked back out into the drizzle and turned left turning left again he walked uphill for half a block until he came to the storefront whose etched front window announced that it housed the offices of the assemblyman for the th district of california inside a counter divided the welllit space two doors in the back indicated the presence of some private suites or possibly one big one a large poster of a beaming jedd conley commanded one wall it was surrounded by smaller framed shots of the assemblyman posing with what looked like at least one representative of each and every demographic unit san francisco had to offer which made for a crowded wall the opposite wall featured an enormous map of the city and also the official framed photo of arnold which struck hunt as somewhat incongruous since the governator was a republican can i help you a sweetlooking matronly woman in her midfifties had gotten up from one of the two desks behind the counter the other desk was clean with only a computer terminal and a telephone the woman seemed to be the only person here which wyatt thought surprising until he realized that conleys main office was in sacramento this was merely a satellite office he used as a local base and in turn this gave him an idea and an opening since he realized that walking in and announcing that he was looking to establish an alibi for conley in a murder case probably wouldnt get him a whole lot of cooperation well i dont know really he began with a selfconscious tentative handshake my name is wyatt and im a graduate student in poly sci out at san francisco state and im thinking about doing a report kind of like well do you know william jamess book called the varieties of religious experience the woman looked at him warily im sorry but no not really this is assemblyman conleys office maybe you want to go to the archdiocese no i dont think so i know its mr conleys office and its all right not knowing about william james wyatt said i only said that because im thinking about my report and calling it the varieties of political experience so you see its not entirely stupid no it doesnt sound stupid actually that sounds very interesting well i dont know yet i hope it will be but i thought id come down and talk to somebody who was in the business so to speak and see if i could get a good place to start youre not too busy are you i dont want to bother you the woman ostentatiously looked over wyatts shoulder then turned around both ways and came back to him smiling i think ill be able to squeeze you in she said my names maggie even long e and i wish it was evans too but its just not its maggie even when i was dating jack my husband i used to tell all my friends what im going out with him formy plan is im going to get even and i did jack i mean now its my name too little did i know she shook her head anywayshe put out her hand again maggie wyatt thats what you said just to let you know it hasnt changed he grinned at her they were now pals anyway i was hoping to get some record of the kinds of stuff mr conley does in the course of say his average month like fundraising or talking to groupseverything really well maggie even said weve got a little problem because im just a volunteer until they hire another fulltime person and im pretty new here myself but if you want to come aroundshe indicated the hinged opening in the counterim pretty sure i could find a record of his appointments somewhere todays special at lou the greeks was saltbaked merides ovenroasted baby smelt over rice served with a searingly spicy sweet red sauce on the side the consensus at ginas tableherself hardy farrell and jeff elliott in his wheelchairwas that possibly because she had done essentially nothing to a fresh and delicious single ingredient chui had conceived and executed her bestever greekchinese meal the novelty of the unexpectedly excellent food brought the table to silence for a moment and this served to punctuate the end of the shoptalk that had been going around since theyd come over from the hallmostly about ginas stellar performance at the morning session now jeff elliott said so gina after we got off the phone this morning i did a little research and googled the dryden socket then got bill blair on the phone before i came down here he didnt seem all that happy to be hearing from me gina put her fork down turning to her two partners she quickly filled them in on the kelley rusnak suicide and where it either intersected or not with stuarts case when shed finished she turned back to jeff talk to me well first im sure youre going to like this but the main thing i had to understand is that no matter what i might have read online or anywhere else there is nothing wrong with the product it sailed through the clinical trials its already been used on hundreds soon to be thousands of happy patients ninetynine percent of the alleged problems came in long after the trials were complete and the reports written and those reports havent been vetted yet either so theres no story so you thanked him for his time and hung up hardy said i really wanted to but force of habit danged if just one more question just kind of slipped out before i could stop it what was that gina asked i asked him if it were true that kelley rusnak and caryn dryden had both been working on the socket and whether or not their two deaths in the past two weeks might have been in some way connected to their work at pii or to each other that would have been the part he didnt like farrell said jeff nodded not too much youre right gina normally would have tolerated if not joined the banter but today she was all attention so whatd he say that caryn had been murdered and kelley had been depressed and was a suicide there was no connection between them but stuart told me she wasnt depressed at all have they done the autopsy on her yet hardy asked if not id call down to san mateo and see if you can talk somebody into putting a rush on it ive already done that this morning gina said with a resigned shake of her head i called the homicide da and asked him to call the coroner they were either going to get to it right away or else they werent i know somebody in the coroners office down there farrell said no promises but i could make a call thatd be good gina said if kelleys a murder then she was killed when stuart was in jail thats a good alibi for him jeff said better than that hardy said two murders makes it way harder to pretend theyre not related even for abrams id bet thats a beautiful thought gina said but old gerrys hung his hat on stuart diz hes not going to let another murder get in his way jeff wanted to get back to his point but heres the thing about blair guys i pushed a little bit about why he didnt see fit to mention anything about caryn dryden in his statement to the press about kelley he said and i quote honestly it never occurred to me did he say at that particular point in time farrell asked i love it when they add that at the end gina ignored wes but thats got to be a lie she said to jeff obviously and since i had him lying anyway jeff continued i thought id see if he had anything to say about his relationship with caryn did he have one gina asked personal i mean a shrug they showed up together a lot on google they evidently did a lot of show and tells for investors and not just in silicon valley they traveled together gina asked overnight at least i didnt have the time to go looking for hotel reservations and airplane tickets but therell be a paper trail and maybe witnesses if you send somebody to look into it so what did this guy blair say hardy wanted to know about their personal relationship they had none jeff said naturally everything between them was pure business she was an immensely talented inventor and scientist and he was a marketing and sales guy although of course he was devastated by her death maybe we ought to send wyatt down and see if we can get him to have a talk with this guy hardy said find out where he was when both these women were killed or killed themselves if only to tell it to the judge in there not that thats going to matter too much at this stage farrell ever helpful added struck by the phrase gina turned on him what do you mean by that wes farrell meant no offense i mean youll have all these answers by the time you go to trial you dont really need them for this hearing where theyre not going to make any difference anyway well gina said what if im not willing to concede that just yet that this hearing is a lost cause i mean i killed them in there this morning yes you did farrell agreed i never meant to imply that you didnt but im going to lose anyway farrell held up his hands hey you might not kymberly gorman was smoking marijuana with her boyfriend trevor stratton in the volkswagen camper van in which theyd lived for most of the past weeks except for the few days after her mothers death when shed stayed with her aunt debra the two young people were parked at almost the precise spot where wyatt hunt and gina roake had turned around during their jog that morning in one of the parking spaces where beach street deadended beyond the maritime museum at aquatic park although in theory a twohour parking limit applied in practice it was a good place to lay low since very few cops ever ventured down the foreshortened street and even the meter maids typically avoided the tight turnaround at the end preferring to shoot up polk street for easier pickins kymberly and trevors parking place was also less than six blocks from the gormandryden home currently unoccupied trevor stratton was twenty years old at six feet tall pounds he was a wellbuilt goodlooking kid in a slacker kind of way at least when he got cleaned up but like kymberly mostly he didnt see the need for that today for example he wore a wispy threeday stubble his long hair was blonder than it was brown sporting tattered jeans and yearold ruined red tennis shoes he was exactly the kind of guy kymberly could never bring home to meet her mother which made him perfect not that it had been that hard but trevor had helped talk kymberly out of actually attending college when shed been on the verge of going away he himself had started at university last year at usf and had completed most of his freshman work but his parents back in illinois had never flown out to visit him or asked to see his grades and he realized that they never would so he stayed for the summer bought the van and told his parents that he was living in an offcampus flat so they sent him checks for food and rent every month which he picked up at a friends apartment it was a pretty great existence most of the time except for having to deal with kymberlys moods and stuff but most of the time she was up for sex and her whole attitude was radical and kind of cool plus she was a lot prettier than she thought she was really pretty in fact trevor got a lot of points with most of the guys he knew for just being with her except now and for a couple of days now she was in one of those difficult moods manic to the max he didnt think shed slept more than an hour or two per night since the funeral when shed been so depressed then this morning deciding she needed to visit her father in jail and that hadnt worked out except to make her cold then theyd come out here with the van and had a few hitstrying to slow her downbut instead she got it in her head that they needed to play some music for tips so theyd broken out his conga drum and guitar and walked down to the cable car turnaround hed strummed his acoustic guitar and sang a bunch of his own monotonic songs while shed slapped the drum tirelessly for a couple of hours when kymberly got going on something she had tremendous energy he had to give her that and theyd made nearly twenty bucks which was definitely worth it but all of it had been in the steady drizzle and while trevor had worn his rainproof parka he hadnt been able to talk kymberly out of her flipflops and tshirt with no bra which probably didnt hurt the tips but now back in the van she was whining again still wound up and endlessly needy he might have to try to talk her into taking some of the lithium although it brought her down and got her off her high when shed get as boring as she was exciting now shed probably sleep for a couple of days if he did that so he thought at least they ought to get it on one more time before she checked out i just want to get some more clothes she was saying im cold just use the blanket there kym here let me wrap you up but she shrugged that off too hot too hot too hot arent you listening to me plus it smells bad what did we do with those clothes i got with debra did i leave them with her i dont know i didnt see them you did too he shook his head you never brought them back here the suspicion was back in her eyes lately this seemed to be her fallback position with him not trusting him when in truth he was the one providing for herthis ride her food her dope her drink her needs but this was the thing he knew that made her so difficult at certain times and so kind of fascinating at others you just never knew what her reality was going to be and suddenly now she sat up her stoned eyes flashing in anger at him you sold them didnt you thats what you did trev you turned them back in at the store for the money no i didnt kym you never brought them back you left them at your aunts i wouldnt have done that i liked those clothes you said you hated them i did not youre making that up but something about it seemed to strike her as possible if not actually true and she shifted gears in that infallible way she had lets just go up to the house i dont think thats a good idea why not nobodys there ive got my old clothes in my room in my closet im really cold trev im not kidding i dont want to get sick you dont get sick from being cold thats an old wives tale i dont care about that and i dont believe it either she was patting her pockets feeling around in the pile of blankets and other stuff on the mattress with her where are my keys youre not the boss of me im just going kym he picked up the blanket from behind her and tried to wrap it around her shoulders we cant go up to your house we just cant do that she grabbed at the corner of the blanket and pulled it off her again where are my keys did you take my keys too i didnt take them you gave them to me so give them back now do you even know where they are yes so where are they you have to tell me theyre mine theyre ours kym and theyre in a safe place cant you leave this blanket over you please just until you warm up then we can talk about it but i want to go to my house and get my clothes kym your mother was killed there remember that you said youd never be able to go in there again but i could now my moms not going to whatever the evanescent thought was it had vanished she sighed and said anyway you could come with me i cant go in there kym i can never go back in there dont you get that if somebody saw me and knew that you were with me and then they got my fingerprints somehow they might put me in jail no you cant go to jail too i know i know but if anybody saw us there sunday nobody saw us trev it was in and out i know the combination we hit the safe take the money we shouldve taken all of it and the gun too no that would have really been dumb i know my dad he wouldnt have known exactly how much hed put in the safe but hed notice if all of it was gone and we dont need the gun what do we need a gun for we could have sold it someplace and there was just so much more there kym for the taking stuff they never even would have missed i bet but now that chance is gone forever we should have got more when we could but then she had that faraway look in her eyes again and she went silent now reaching for the towel and pulling it tightly around her smell or not i knew you wanted to go back its so lucky you didnt go back she reached out and touched his leg you didnt did you go back of course not kym you know i didnt i told you that she recited the explanation as though she memorized it i stayed with jen and you went to jeremys and bought this weed instead she said right with the money we got from the safe and luckily i didnt go to your house cause whoever was there might have i mean i might have got in the way too like mom did right just like that but thats why i cant go back there now they might think somehow i had something to do with your mother which i did not kym i swear to god i didnt kymberly nodded and nodded until the movement became so pronounced that it turned into rocking a tiny frail humming started deep within her and in a few seconds had turned to a fullthroated keening that trevor had to muffle by pulling her against him and holding her to his chest rubbing her back smoothing her hair whispering soothingly to her its okay now its okay and then just as suddenly as the moaning had come on it broke into a cathartic sobbing that wrenched at her chest and seemed to involve her whole body dont leave me she cried please please please dont leave me trevor continued to stroke her back i never would he whispered close to her ear never ever ever kym this is gina roake again how did you get my number your father tried to call you this morning on my cell phone so the numbers on it okay what are you all right you always ask that you know that im sorry bad habit it sounds like youve been crying what if i was my mothers just been killed i guess i can cry if i feel like it is that okay with you gina thought that there was no winning with this young woman biting her tongue repressing a sigh that she was certain would be misinterpreted she summoned her most neutral voice and said im on my way back to your fathers hearing and i have a question for you i might not know the answer she said something else that gina couldnt pick up what was that nothing i was talking to somebody else whats your question when you talked to your mother on that last sunday did you tell her you werent going to school no why would i do that i dont know im just asking your father wanted to know too why do you always say your father like it was this big formal thing why dont you just call him my dad okay kymberly your dad wanted to know what youd talked to your mother to your mom about if it wasnt about school money to tell her i was going to need money wasnt she sending you money yeah but that was directly to the dorms i told her i met some people and wed decided to rent an apartment instead so she should just send me the money directly and what did she say to that what do you think that she wasnt going to do that did she say anything else the usual was i taking my pills i shouldnt leave the dorms blah blah blah so that was the whole talk pretty much she had to go out as usual so she cut it short did she say where she was going she said she had an appointment did she say with who no it was just the usual ive got an appointment covers for everything kymberly gina said would you please try to remember if she said anything about who she was meeting it might have been the last person to see her alive before she was killed it might even have been her murderer nothing again from the daughter she said she had an appointment thats all hey is my dad there can i talk to him hes in a cell behind the courtroom right now kymberly he left you a message that maybe you can come see him this afternoon during visiting hours hed like that yeah well she said i dont know you can tell him i took one of my pills im getting a little tired ill see how i feel and without another word kymberly hung up gina sat at the defense table waiting for stuart to be brought in judge toynbee had declared the lunch recess a little early and now a long afternoon loomed before her though it shouldnt have made any difference she was acutely aware that the rooting section of her lunch mates had all gone back to their regular jobs the fact that dismas hardy was going to try to get in touch with wyatt hunt and assign him to get some facts about pii and bill blair didnt quite make up for the irrational feeling gina had that shed been abandoned ridiculous she knew she was a big girl but the show of support in the morning had been unexpected and very nice she glanced back debra dryden was still waiting in the hallway because abrams had subpoenaed her and she had to stick around in spite of debras strong and positive feelings for stuart to gina she really didnt feel like much of an ally and jedd conleys appearance this morning had evidently been token as well since now there was no sign of him on the prosecution side however the only evacuees were the mornings two witnesses strout and faro at this very moment abrams was talking animatedly with juhle clarence jackman and a couple of the uniformed cops whod been out there all day suddenly a general laugh broke out in the group no doubt someone with a joke guys sure could find a way to laugh just about anytime she noted and in fact what wasnt for them to laugh at they sure didnt have to prove much at this hearing they were a united team nothing was that serious anyway it was a mans world gina abruptly turned her back on the gallery thinking fuck that noise she wasnt going to let herself get sucked into that negative thinking she might be alone here all right but she was a damned competent lawyer whod beaten many a man before and she told herself this time she had the truth on her side okay guys she thought im ready bring it on by its nature a preliminary hearing tends to be short on narrative thread there is no real opportunity for or tolerance of argument in theory the proceeding marshals and presents the evidence against a defendant in such a way that it speaks for itself this structure coupled with the probablecause standard of proof allows both sides to play a little fast and loose with witnesses and even sometimes with physical evidence since no formal explanation of the relevance of the various elements of a case is required in advance this would probably be good for gina when it came time to present her own alternative theories of her casethe connection of caryn dryden to kelley rusnak and to pii the inadequate police interrogations of alternate suspects with strong motives and into caryns financial and personal lives the rush to judgment on stuart because he was the spousebut it made it difficult to know how to deal with a prosecution witness such as officer george berriman of the highway patrol a wellgroomed goodlooking friendly man on the sunny side of thirty over ginas continuing objections on relevance berrimans testimony put into the record that stuart had been upset when hed been pulled over on the friday night before caryns death and that hed said he was going up to the mountains for the weekend because otherwise he might kill his wife with whom he just had a bad fight there wasnt anything gina could do it was what it was not devastating but very far from helpful but she thought she could make a small point or at least put in a dig to abrams officer berrimanshe stood again in the center of the courtroomin the course of your average working day do you pull over many people and give them speeding tickets sure thats a big part of the job and youve testified that mr gorman was very upset when you pulled him over is that right yes well let me ask you this officer do you run into a lot of people who are ecstatically happy that youve pulled them over to give them a speeding ticket a ripple of low laughter ran through the gallery behind her as berriman told her no but she barely waited to hear him say it before she all but waved him away with a curt no further questions without moving she looked up at the bench the judge took the cue i think i hear a relevance objection from ms roake ill let it in for whatever its worth which i have to say isnt much buoyed by toynbees rebuke to abrams gina went back to her table fighting to hold back any sign of smugness or confidence but when she sat next to stuart she leaned over and whispered were now three for three which makes them oh for three okay at last youve convinced me stuart said ill cut you your check youre hired before calling his next witness abrams introduced as evidence the tape of the call stuart had placed after discovering caryn in the hot tub gina of course had obtained a transcript of this with her discovery documents and was familiar with the actual words but hearing it played back in the courtroom underscored even more dramatically the absence of any sense of grief stuarts voicecalm rational detailed matteroffact to a chilling degreecouldnt have sounded less like a panicked husband whod just come home to discover his wife dead abrams didnt dwell on the tape but called his next witness captain allen marsten from the central police station the first police officer on the scene who did his own damage dealing as he did with stuarts attempted cpr on caryn while she was in a state of full rigor mortis his testimony was certainly relevant and gruesomely powerful with him entering through the open door in other words stuart hadnt started trying to resuscitate his wife until after he had called and then opened the front door easily persuading stuart to give up on the artificial respiration describing the contorted position into which caryns body had stiffened particularly effective was the wrapup which gina knew was a preemptive assault on what would be her only argumentthat stuart had been so overcome with emotion after hed discovered his wife in the hot tub that he had tried to breathe life into her even though it might have been apparently hopeless so captain marsten abrams said after the defendant stopped with his attempt at artificial respiration what did he do next well he stood up pulled a towel over the body and asked us if wed like some coffee coffee yes he said there was a fresh pot hed made before he discovered his wife sergeant jarrett and i both told him no thanks was the defendant crying or otherwise visibly upset no sir all right what did he do then he told us he could use another cup and walked into the kitchen did he look back at his wifes body at all no sir he just went inside and poured himself a cup of joe gina stole a glance up at toynbee just as he allowed himself a piercing gaze at stuart obviously marstens testimony unadorned as it was had made an impression on the judge he was looking at stuart as though hed never seen him before after this strangely powerful leadin abrams called devin juhle to the witness stand his testimony based to a large extent on her clients own conversation with him on that first morning was relevant and potentially damning over an hour and a half it all came out it began with stuarts direct testimonycaptured on tape and transcribedstarting with the divorce ultimatum stuarts various admissions about the troubles in the relationship the financial ramifications of caryns death and the couples marital history including his interviews with the neighbors whod told him about the two domestic disturbance calls to the home it went on with stuarts suggestion to juhle about about the vicodin upstairs and the degree hot tub then bethany robley and her unwavering identification of stuarts car on the night of the event plus the threats to her delivered on stuarts behalf by his own daughter gina objected that they couldnt tie the alleged threat to stuart but after that abrams backtracked to the warrant juhle had pulled on the cabin and the havoc wreaked therein talked about the discrepancies in the timing of the drive from echo lake offered his own scenario of a more plausible late nightearly morning drive from san francisco to rancho cordova and back then abrams fastforwarded juhle through to some of the details of the arrest stuarts apparent armed flight down to a motel in san mateo the loaded gun in stuarts possession when juhle broke in the door to make the arrest in all it was exactly the kind of narrative from a highly skilled and experienced witness that abrams was prohibited from delivering himself the prosecutor didnt have to say consciousness of guilt a formal legal construct that sometimes could possess the power to convict his witnesss testimony eloquently delivered the message this was the way it was supposed to work but remembering davids rallying cry that defense work wasnt for wimps when abrams turned to her after hed finished and said your witness gina gave stuart next to her a couple of confident pats on his forearm then briskly rose from her chair and strode to her place in the middle of the courtroom after a respectful nod at toynbee gina then directed her attention over to juhle who sat relaxed in the witness box inspector juhle she began your testimony about stuarts timetable on the morning after the event was based on the discussions you taped that morning with him isnt that correct in an effort to humanize her client to the court gina would always try to refer to stuart by his name whereas the prosecution would always call him the defendant or even simply defendant without the the these little honorific games might be silly and may or may not have ever made an actual difference in a verdict but attorneys for both sides tended to feel that they could only ignore them at their own peril was based on the discussions you taped that morning with him isnt that correct yes it is he told you he left his cabin at echo lake at around two am isnt that right he actually said it was a little before two ah a little before two thank you now would you please tell the court how you came into possession of the receipt from the gas station in rancho cordova indicating that stuart pumped gas there at four fifteen am you gave it to me so i did gina said she thought the point would be clear enough to the judge as stuarts lawyer she wasnt about to hand any evidence over to the police if she thought it pointed to his guilt and did you have occasion to discuss with stuart the discrepancy in time that you brought up in your answer to mr abrams yes i did i asked him if anything had held him up on the drive down from his cabin that could account for the extra time and he said no did he elaborate beyond that yes in a later statement after he was in jail he said he must have been wrong with his initial guess of when he left in other words his earlier statement about his timing was an estimate not as you testified earlier definite objection your honor calls for conclusion it did and gina knew it but she didnt care toynbee sustained the objection but she went right on she knew that there was precious little she could do about stuarts admissions that he and caryn werent getting along or about the kind of money he stood to come into upon her death and shed deal with the neighbors and bethany robleys testimonies when they were on the stand but she knew that the entire consciousness of guilt edifice that abrams and juhle had so carefully constructed and that had made juhles testimony appear so formidable was largely built on sand and she intended to kick the foundations out from under it inspector juhle on the morning of stuarts eventual arrest did you have occasion to see him at all i did at his house did you go over there to serve your warrant for his arrest no we didnt have the warrant yet you didnt have the warrant yet this was the day the warrant was issued was it not yes but you didnt have it yet then why did you go over there juhle shifted in the chair his first real sign of nerves you called me on your clients behalf and asked me to come over to look at some emails hed apparently received emails what was the nature of these emails they were apparently threats to your client what kind of threats death threats from whom i dont know someone who signed himself thou shalt not kill how many of these emails were there three and when did my client receive the last one on the friday before before the friday before he said before the event you mean gina wasnt going to refer to caryns death as a murder since the prosecution had been unable to prove that it was juhle clearly hated this event business yes before the killing so two days before the event in question stuart had received an email threatening him with death is that correct thats what he said its what it looked like and what did you do with this information inspector i didnt do anything i thought it likely that your client had sent it to himself and the other ones as well yes including the one during the week he was wilderness backpacking with a california assemblyman and another friend in the bitterroot mountains juhle shrugged he could have had anyone send it to him true gina admitted but again inspector this was possibly exonerating evidence in this matter just like the credit card receipt from rancho cordova that stuart voluntarily shared with you isnt that right for what it was worth juhle replied which wasnt much move to strike your honor gina said nonresponsive sustained just yes or no please inspector gina added spare us the editorializing abrams was on his feet your honor now hold on both of you toynbee said were not doing this you both know how to ask questions and make objections and youll do it from now on clear gina bit back her replythat nothing stuart had given to juhle appeared to have any worth to him because the inspector had already made up his mind ahead of the evidence but she didnt want to get into a pissing contest not when she had a better way to bring him down inspector while you were with stuart on this same morning the day of his arrest did you inform him that he was a suspect juhle broke a tolerant smile he already knew that he did how did you tell him i assumed hed read the papers hed hired a lawyer all right again gina wasnt going to argue the merits though they were on her side she had juhle without them and so because stuart was a suspect you ordered him not to leave the city to stay in your jurisdiction isnt that correct the first signs of anger coming off him like tiny sparks juhle flicked a look at abrams before he came back to gina no thats not correct we hadnt decided to arrest him yet so stuart was an unconstrained citizen free to go where he liked technically not just technically inspector absolutely he could have taken a plane to another country and not been disobeying any order of yours isnt that true juhle took a while to answer finally he got it out i suppose so you suppose so and do you also suppose inspector that stuart was fleeing when he eventually did hear about the arrest warrant i dont know about that you dont but i assumed so i went back to his house to pick him up on the warrant and found open and mostly empty dresser drawers and discovered half a box of ammunition out on his desk i made the assumption hed armed himself which turned out to be true he also snuck out of his house and didnt respond to calls to turn himself in when we did get the warrant ah yes the famous armed and dangerous weve heard so much about isnt it true inspector that stuart legally owned the weapon you recovered from him yes it was his gun and when you broke into his room at the motel in san mateo did you see this gun it was on the end table next to his bed in other words in plain sight in other words it wasnt a concealed weapon was it not at that time no to your knowledge did he at any time carry it concealed on his person no and youve just finished telling us that he had received repeated threats on his life true yes all right when you broke in did he reach or lunge for the gun there were three men pointing guns at him yelling dont move he didnt move no he didnt gina turned and quickly walked back to her table ostensibly for a sip of water in fact she didnt want her aggressiveness to get the better of her and she needed a little time to frame her last few questions from this key witness when she was back in her place the calm tones of her voice came as a bit of a shock even to her inspector juhle to recap stuart did not know he was a suspect in this event there was no warrant issued for his arrest when he left the city to interview some people on his own in connection with this event behind her she heard the scrape of abrams chair and the objection calls for a narrative your honor and assumes facts not in evidence toynbee sustained the objection as she knew he would but at least shed put the reason for stuarts trip down the peninsula into the judges consciousness and that had been her intention juhle saw his one shot and took it and of course he stole license plates from another car and put them on the truck he was driving this gina knew had been just another flatout mistake on stuarts part of course stuart had correctly suspected that thered be a warrant out for his arrest shortly and had developed the strategy to avoid detection and identification but she wasnt here to argue that pointtoynbee would have to factor it in and draw his own conclusion gina pasted on a tolerant smile kept any rise out of her voice yes he did inspector would it be fair to say that this case has attracted about as much media attention as any case in recent memory it has had some well you know dont you inspector that the press has been hounding stuart since the day of his wifes murder i dont know about hounding well how about following around with cameras and microphones in groups of five and six every time he walked out his front door you know theyve been doing that inspector because youve seen it and because weve complained about it to the police department im aware youve made those allegations could it be inspector that stuart didnt want to have his truck followed by an aggressive pack of reporters who didnt leave him alone objection speculative well your honor gina said mr abrams wants you to draw one conclusion about this licenseplate business but id like to suggest that there is a far more sensible one obvious to anyone who knows the facts whats sauce for the goose mr abrams ill let it in for what its worth toynbee said which once again ms roake isnt much lets move on now lastly inspector and still on the subject of stuarts alleged flight to avoid arrest can you please tell the court how you came to learn of stuarts presence at the hollywood motel in san mateo this was going to be bad and juhle knew it i traced a call made from a cell phone and made its location and what was the nature of that call inspector juhle hamstrung couldnt bring himself to describe it behind gina she was aware that the entire courtroom was still hanging on juhles response but it wasnt forthcoming after a long moment gina broke into the silence isnt it true inspector she asked in her gentlest voice that that call to you was made by stuart gormans attorney who had heard about the arrest warrant and wanted to arrange her clients surrender the next morning at ten oclock and that you agreed to accept such a surrender juhles eyes kept flashing between abrams and gina finally judge toynbee leaned over from the bench and addressed him directly were going to need a yes or no out loud inspector all right sorry your honor juhle brought himself back to gina it still took him another few seconds until he finally mumbled it out just audibly yes but you and i both know counselor that a lawyer is supposed to surrender a wanted client immediately and just because i told you id be around if your client decided to come in later didnt for a second mean that i was going to stop looking for him this was a murder warrant not an invitation to drop by the hall of justice gina felt she could allow him the little rant she ran through the notes shed been balancing in her mind stuarts alleged consciousness of guilt was based on knowing that he was wanted and acting on that assumption by arming himself carrying a concealed weapon and his flight from prosecution satisfied that shed touched all the bases she now made a small bow to her witness thank you inspector no further questions the short recess was over almost before it had begun stuart didnt even leave the defense table but asked gina if he could borrow a pen and one of her yellow legal pads when she got back from her bathroom break he didnt look up immediately but continued until he got to a good stopping place what are you doing she asked writing a few notes i got an idea ill take anything youve got from where im sitting you dont need any help im almost starting to feel like were going to beat this thing he saw gina try to hide the grimace you dont think so i hope so gina said she halfturned to make sure no one was hovering near them within listening distance behind the bar rail coming back to him she spoke sotto voce i think were all right up to now but just about everything theyve talked about so far even juhle is just interpretation of facts not the facts themselves no you beat him on that one not really stuart maybe i did get toynbee to see another alternative and plausible explanation for the timing and consciousness of guilt isnt flying too high either that unfortunately leaves guilt itself and thats where bethany robley comes in but gina didnt want to entirely deflate stuarts newfound hopes it was surely true that shed stymied the prosecutions efforts up to now and if bethany robley was like the other witnesses so far then gina might allow herself some hope about the results of this hearing but not until then meanwhile they had to get through bethany gina put on a false face but ive got a plan that might do some good so well see meanwhileshe pointed to the legal pad in front of himwhats your idea he was covering the page with his hands casually but definitely nothing really its not about this anyway i mean us here what were doing now its just a few random thoughts well if you get so youd let somebody read them id be interested you dont have to say that you know he indicated the pages this is just for me not for your readers well them too he paused i mean theres the people who read me but then theres the people who surround me in my life and traditionally those people arent really into what i write its just not it just wasnt that important he broke a tentative grin or relevant as you lawyers would say it wasnt that relevant to them gina said you mean her caryn stuart smiled looked away let out a breath i got used to it she was silent for a beat how about if i really would like to read it if i just like the way you write well he drew another breath that might be nice bethany robley looking terrified and sleep lagged from her days of insomnia came up to the bar rail down the center aisle on her mothers arm though her very large mother didnt seem a logical choice to be steadying her daughter since she herself was walking with the aid of a cane as she passed into the courtroom proper mrs robley let go of bethanys arm watched her walk on for a couple of steps then suddenly lurched to her right just behind ginas back and got ahold of stuarts jumpsuit at the shoulder pulling him back in his chair toward her how dare you threaten my daughter how dare you she brought up the cane with her free hand and swung it overhand stuart taking the hit mostly on the arm as it glanced off the side of his head immediately toynbee was gaveling the courtroom to order yelling for the bailiffs some of the media people in the front row were up and clearing out of the area while gina turned one way to see what was happening behind her then the other to get out of her chair and somehow try to restrain this crazy woman stuart stunned as the rest of the people in the room turned in shocked surprise clair wait mom bethany yelled stop but clair robley wasnt waiting or stopping swearing violently at stuart now in a mad rage she pulled him off his chair and all the way back to the rail and repeatedly swung at his head with the cane as he tried to cover and defend himself she was still swinging when the bailiff whod been guarding the entrance got his arms around her and managed to hold her relatively still which allowed the other two bailiffs time to get in range to restrain her further it was all over within thirty or forty seconds mrs robley still held by the three big guards a crying nearhysterical bethany now back beyond the bar rail in the first row of the gallery trying to get to her mother gina was helping stuart get up from the floor once to his feet he righted his chair himself collapsing down into it there was a lot of blood coming out of his forehead at the hairline the judge kept slamming his gavel order he kept saying order order there wasnt much choice the bailiffs took clair robley into custody stuart had to get some medical attention for his bleeding head poor bethany rattled into hysteria was in no condition to testify judge toynbee recessed the hearing for the day with todays plan a the hearing suddenly scuttled ginas plan b after only a little thought and all the success shed had with abrams witnesses was to return to her office to start organizing her notes for the eventual motion for a directed verdict of acquittal that shed have to file when the prosecution rested after presenting its case in chief at the trial true this might still be most of a year awayalthough she was going to try to shorten that time if she couldbut the morning had provided just too many opportunities to take this case apart board by board and while her arguments were still fresh in her mind she wanted to commit them to paper of course if they got to trial abrams would be a lot more careful to prepare officer whatshisname from the highway patrol again and faro wouldnt try to be cute about the garbage but gina wanted to be ready to pounce if any hint of these weaknesses made their way into the trial as it stood now the prosecutions case looked like it was all going to come down to bethany robleys testimony in all gina was somewhat heartenedbethany had never seen stuart that night and better yet had never even said she had so it came down to the car and from what shed seen in discovery shed never mentioned stuarts personalized ghoti license plate but as it happened wyatt hunt called ginas cell phone to report in on his morning interviews soon after she got outside the hall of justice and into the continuing drizzle and it looked as though ginas immediate implementation of plan b was going to have to wait as well here was ginas chance to go down the peninsula and personally meet up with william blair and she wasnt about to pass it up so hunt picked her up out in front of the hall in his mini cooper at a few minutes after three and as they swung around the hall and back onto the freeway going south he said i thought this hearing was going to run all day what happened mayhem she gave him the short version ive never seen anything like it wyatt shifted into the freeway traffic enjoying the story like most other of his fellow professionals in the field of criminal justice hunt found that his sympathy over any one persons individual misfortune stuarts bethanys juhlesusually got subsumed in the pure joy of the absurdist theater of it all i wish id been there a cane big ol cane in retrospect gina was beginning to see the humor in it herself pretty soon now theyre going to have to rig the hall with cane detectors i can see it hunt agreed first no metal then no cell phones with cameras now no canes i bet shoes are next wyatt put on his announcers voice coming soon to a jurisdiction near you the naked courtroom for security reasons you must leave all your clothes at the door and people think trials are ugly now they drove on in a companionable silence the windshield wipers slashed back and forth the drizzle picking up into something approximating real rain after a minute wyatt looked over at her so did devin get to talk before they called it off he did but im thinking about now hes wishing he didnt his version of things started out good but it was all spin i told him that too he should have listened to you always though he rarely does its tragic really ill have to go over to his place and make fun of him but gina shook her head id give it a couple of days wyatt seriously it wasnt pretty not for him anyway after a small hesitation she said so howd your morning go good mcafees still in play and even though mike pinkerts basically got the same alibi as mcafeein bed except he was there with his wifei believe him unless my gut is completely useless hes just not in it you dont believe mcafee not completely and i still like his motive more than anybody elses tonight im going to talk to the people in his condo building see if anybody saw him go out or come in around eleven meanwhile ive got to say that pinkerts pretty much out of contention oh and while were on it sos your mr conley hes not my mr conley wyatt hes everyones mr conley maybe soon everybodys senator conley hes alibied up greenpeace fundraiser with like five hundred people at the marina yacht club unless hes got a body double some politicians do you know another thought that struck gina as funny not jedd i dont think she said so do you know where were going now pii right he pointed at the terminal screen in his dashboard i got it on the navigation system before i picked you up of course you did gina said hunt nodded we aim to please bill blair wasnt in at first and gina thought that was instructive in itself then wyatt said to his secretary thats a shame because ms roake had some questions for mr blair on the kelley rusnak matter kelley was supposed to be ms roakes witness in the caryn dryden murder hearing anyway shed like to keep this private and hoped to give him a chance to answer a few questions but if hes not around shell have to take her questions to jeff thats jeff elliott of the chronicle and see if he can get some answers for her so if mr blairs not here i guess hell just have to read the paper tomorrow and respond to that though she was a woman the secretary reminded gina of the william h macy character in fargo smiling miserably at both of them she swallowed a couple of times then said let me just run and check to see if maybe hes gotten back when i wasnt at my desk gina almost said yah shure in that great frances mcdormand norwegian accent but stopped herself in the nick of time thatd be nice she said thanks less than two minutes later they were making their introductions to mr blair a short heavy man of about fortyfive with small eyes and colorless hair combed into a very short pageboy his corner office seemed almost to sulk behind its tinted windows on this gray afternoon fluorescent lighting overhead gave the room an impersonal feel that wasnt much mitigated by the view of the enormous parking lot outside the lack of even massproduced art on the two remaining walls a massive light oak desk was piled high with neat stacks of papers and documentsa small sign of order perhaps hiding a larger chaos a couple of selfconsciously modern chromeandleather chairs sat on industrial carpet facing his work space and blair indicated that his guests take them then went to his own chair behind the desk and sat down gina wasted no more time mr blair she began thank you for seeing us without an appointment but time is short kelley rusnak was going to be a witness for me in stuart gormans hearing on the murder of his wife which is going on in san francisco this week kelley met with stuart down here about two weeks ago she told him she might be in some kind of danger because of her involvement with the dryden socket nobody murdered kelley apparently she killed herself apparently gina said did you know kelley well her reply and then the following question both seemed to surprise him were a small company but no not really more than anyone else less than some she wasnt management after all i noticed though that you gave the statement about her death is that the company policy well fortunately until lately we havent had to have a policy on that in this case we needed a statement for the paper so i ginned one up im afraid i dont really see anything particularly sinister about that with one hand he moved one of the piles of paper to a new location about a quarter inch from where it had been i told all this to mr elliott this morning youre trying to muddy the waters surrounding your client laudable in an attorney i suppose but actually fairly tedious for the rest of us so gina thought the gloves were coming off early she gave him a saccharine smile be that as it may the reason mr elliott was interested in the story had little or nothing to do with my client but with the coverup around the dryden socket that both caryn and kelley were trying to expose he shook his head his lips tight there is no coverup ms roake i dont know how these rumors get started but there is no problem with the dryden socket its a remarkable device that marks a major improvement in the technology of hip replacement the fda will be issuing its formal approval any day now and were gearing up for tremendous worldwide demand if we thought the product was harmful do you imagine one that the fda would give its approval and two that wed be so foolish as to go ahead with increased production with all the lawsuits that a faulty product would entail one gina didnt miss a beat the fda would give its approval if they never got wind of problems because they occurred after the formal closure of the clinical trials and two you would if you needed immediate cash had huge overseas orders that you could fill first and were already working on an improved product that you could have in the pipeline before too much damage was done she leaned back in her chair looked over at wyatt back at blair this issue isnt going to go away some folks have suggested the possibility that caryn dryden was killed to shut her up dont be absurd do you remember what you might have been doing on the night caryn was killed i dont even know what night caryn was killed it was sunday wyatt hunt offered helpfully three weeks ago blair scrunched his tiny eyes the muscles in his cheeks working steadily this is beyond the pale he said i have no idea what i was doing three weeks ago on a sunday night im quite certain though that whatever it was it wasnt drowning one of my longtime stars suddenly he pushed back his chair and got himself onto his feet im afraid this meeting is going to have to come to an end he said the issue isnt going to go away gina said as she stood up but blair didnt move safe behind his desk he stood almost at a military attention i have nothing further to say to you he said and you are not to return to these premises or ill have you removed go be ridiculous in the courtroom where people have to put up with you and while youre at it you might brush up on the libel laws before you start spreading any more vicious lies wyatt dropped gina at her sutter street office the nowconstant rain hadnt speeded up the commute any and they didnt get back until about four fortyfive it had already been a long and exhausting day was it only this morning that shed learned of kelley rusnaks death and gone jogging with hunt it seemed impossible as she was coming up the stairway to the firms main offices on the second floor theyd expanded the firstfloor offices to accommodate an influx of new associates and a new word processing department a wave of exhaustion suddenly washed over her she actually stopped a few steps short of the top and put her briefcase down wrestling with the idea of simply turning around catching a cab for home and maybe even squeezing in a short uninterrupted nap before the inevitable written or dictated recap of her day at the hearing and then of course shed also want to go over all of her discovery again to be sure that nothing escaped her in the continuing crush of events plus shed be needing to review bethany robleys statement so shed be ready for her crossexamination tomorrow or at least she hoped it would be tomorrow clair robleys courtroom attack on stuart today might have repercussions beyond those anyone expected and she had to be ready for them too and then she needed to check on stuart to see how seriously hed been hurt and make sure she got wyatts latest news after he and his crew interviewed the people about mcafees alibi and then she had to remember to call fred furth whom shed subpoenaed along with kelley to corroborate stuarts explanation of why hed disappeared down the peninsula and maybe segue somehow from furths testimony into some of the pii issues and then stopping herself she realized she was already beginning to spin out of control she had to keep her focus the minute her mind started to relaxeven standing in her stairwella half dozen other ideas chores and responsibilities assaulted her consciousness maybe shed manage a few hours of sleep before dawn but that was all she could realistically expect or allow herself she picked up her briefcase and finished her climb only to be greeted by phyllis as soon as the receptionist saw her ah ms roake in the rarefied and humorless world of the firms ancient spinster of a receptionist attorneys did not possess first names mr farrell wanted to see you the minute you got in on the gorman matter shall i tell him youre on your way up gina looked across the lobby to the stairs leading up in her present state of fatigue the dozen or so steps suddenly seemed as insurmountable as the final ascent to the peak of whitney or shasta or kilimanjaro all of which shed summited in the past three years but there was nothing for itwes wanted to see her right away about her case but she still couldnt quite get herself to move to start the climb in her short hesitation staring wearily over at the steps phyllis read her mind and in response cleared her throat if you wont be needing it up there you could leave your briefcase behind the counter here with me ill keep an eye on it ginas briefcase of a kind specially built for lawyers in trial or other litigation was more than a foot thick and loaded as it was with reference materials and other law books her file folders copies of all the discovery wyatt hunts interrogation tapes and other junk hed collected in his investigations and so on it weighed more than twentyfive pounds if she was going to be forced to make the ascent to farrells lair at least she could do it without carrying the added weight smiling weakly she put the briefcase down and pushed it behind the counter thank you phyllis thats a good call a crisp nod ill tell him youre on your way it wasnt after all such a long or difficult journey ten steps across the lobby fourteen stairs another few steps to farrells welldecorated door in keeping with his tshirt motif farrell had much of his office door covered with liberal bumper and otherwise tasteless stickers sometimes both at once somebody give bush a blow job so we can impeach him lawyers guns money the oil has hit the fan my last good case was anchor steam beer but gina had already read them all and today they didnt even register she knocked once cracked the door you decent probably not come on in watch out gert doesnt escape wes was over by his refreshment counter watching espresso drain into a tiny cup and turned as she entered his tshirt today read a friend will help you move a really good friend will help you move a body phyllis said you looked like you could use some coffee he said how much you got gina asked shes a dear that woman actually wes replied company secret but shes a robot and the next generation supposedly theyre making them with personalities i cant wait he handed her the demitasse so guess what kelley rusnak was probably murdered the cup stopped halfway to ginas mouth that had been her assumption all along but it was nice to get the formal verification and the vindication farrell leaned back against the counter my guy down in redwood city called me about an hour ago kind of an interesting sequence of events actually his theory anyway you want to hear it all as opposed to what half of it dont get snippy he said dont ask dumb questions and i wont all of it yes please okay the first thing a little weird was she had three mostly undissolved pillstylenol with codeinein her mouth undissolved how could that happen well one way somebody could put them in her mouth after she was already dead or close to it again though why maybe because that was the only drug she had on hand with the prescription made out to her the empty bottle was next to her bed where they found her which is why they initially thought it was straight od but it wasnt why no codeine in her blood none zero she died from an overdose of elavil also called amytriptilene which is a prescription antidepressant gina put her untouched coffee down on the table lowered herself onto the couch absently stroking the dog whod come over but let me guess there was no bottle for this stuff in her place with her name on it right but wait listen it gets better the other thing she had on board was rohypnol gina knew what that was the daterape drug exactly and she could have taken it herself of course technically but the odds are she didnt my guy thinks somebody was with her and got it into her drink then when she was woozy popped her full of amytriptilene she would have been feeling funny anyway dizzy andor sick maybe he told her it was aspirin theyre tiny pills and it looks like he gave her a lot of them so the roofiethe street name for rohypnolkept her from waking up as she went into tachycardia from the amytriptilene and after she was out somebody tried to throw off the investigationat least for a whileby trying to force some codeine down her throat as well thats a bizarre way to kill someone gina said wes shrugged maybe sometimes youve just gotta take whats available no stuart said kym used to take amytriptilene it was one of the first things we tried but her current doc put her on lithium and it seems to work better at least when she takes it the way shes supposed to ginas fatigue was forgotten she was still running on the adrenaline rush shed picked up in farrells office kelley rusnaks probable murder eliminated the last shred of doubt stuart hadnt killed caryn two women working on the same project for the same company had now been killed within three weeks of each other and the idea that these murders were unrelated was too much for gina to swallow and not only were they related in all probability they were committed by the same person the dryden socket had now become the center of ginas case and ironically enough it was still no formal part of it there was no evidence about it no testimony related to it she doubted if gerry abrams had ever heard of it but what it meant for stuart of course was that he was innocent gina thought she might even get wyatt hunt to persuade juhle to give the matter some of his attention but that would be for later if at all now it was seven thirty and gina had still not gone home but rather had cabbed directly from her office down to the hall of justice again she and stuart were in the semicircular main attorney visiting room at the jailthe glass block the long table the two chairs stuart had sustained several bruises on his arms and a couple more on his head along with the one gash at his hairline that had bled so prolifically but all he had to show for it was a twoinchsquare bandage on his forehead so why do you want to know about kymberly and amytriptilene he asked her gina considered her response then decided she had to give it to him straight because kelley rusnak died of an overdose of amytriptilene a confused frown passed over stuarts face i dont see the connection what could kelleys suicide have to do with kymberly im getting ahead of myself gina said as it turns out kelley wasnt a suicide after all carefully leaving nothing out she filled him in on farrells information anyway she concluded amytriptilene is a link i wanted to see where it might connect youre not saying you think that kymberly could have had a part in any of this gina looked hard at his face tortured now by this possibility i talked to her before the afternoon session today stuart she said gently i asked her what shed been calling caryn about on that last weekend she told me she asked her for money and that caryn turned her down you realize that if youre in jail and caryns dead shes going to have nearly unimpeded access to all of your money you cant believe any of this what im wondering stuart is why you cant once caryn was out of the way who was the only person standing in the way of the dryden socket coming out on schedule kelley rusnak when kymberly visited you here in jail did you mention your visit down to kelley did you tell her what youd talked about i told a lot of people everybody who came by i wanted it clear kelley and furth were proof i wasnt running and hiding from juhle he ran a hand down the side of his face she could never have killed her mother and she didnt have any amytriptilene anyway keeping her calm gina asked were her expired prescriptions refillable suddenly slamming his hand flat on the table no goddammit no out of his chair now he grabbed the back of it and gina thought for a moment he was going to throw it in his fury but he got himself back under control enough to look her in the eye and say were not going there you hear me were not doing this abruptly he turned from her and walked as far away as he could get in the far corner he stood with palms pressed against the glass block his head down after a long minute gina got up and walked over behind him she touched his shoulder her palm flat against his back she felt his shoulders heave once then again then they gave way altogether in a series of smaller silent quakes in the presence of such abject and obvious pain memories of her own agonies over david freemanwhen her resolve and her spirit just brokecame swelling up over her making her head swim tightening her throat she didnt trust herself to move all right stuart she whispered all right since she was never going to get anything like a nights sleep in her life again anyway when wyatt called her at home at ten thirty she told him he could stop by and talk to her in person on his way back to his place when she opened the door he grinned wearily and said weve got to stop meeting like this but that was as light as it got before it got heavy again before hed even gotten a chance to report on bob mcafee she told him about kelley rusnak and her fears about kymberly at least now we know why shes laying so low why she didnt want to come to the courtroom i need you to find her wyatt i need to find out where she was and what she was doing last friday drop everything else ive got her cell number if she picks up even for a few minutes juhle can somehow get at least her approximate location maybe juhle can gina but im not sure i can get him to do that for us could you call in a favor from devin after what you did to him on the stand today probably not well i need to find her maybe if you tell devin about kelley being murdered hunt shook his head not in his jurisdiction hes not interested hes got to be kelleys got to be part of caryn he has to see that its still his case heres his chanceif he solves the mystery he can still be a hero if it turns out it doesnt make any difference hes still the dedicated cop who spares no effort in the pursuit of the truth clearly from hunts expression he thought it was an extreme long shot but he finally shrugged what the hell cant hurt to ask you mind if we sit down gina whod been on a tear of intensity for longer than she could remember felt the tension in her break sure im sorry im a little wound up you feel like a drink or a beer or something why do i look like one he waved it off no im good he said but with all this talk about kelley and kymberly and how everythings all got to be related i hope you havent given up completely on the good doctor mcafee gina rolled her eyes dont even tell me why because it appears that he forgot to mention taking his car out of his garage sometime around ten or so the night caryn got killed youre kidding me hunt held up three fingers scouts honor somebody specifically remembered that three weeks ago howd that happen young love to the rescue once again he had his little pocket notepad out and was flipping the pages here you go he said lloyd phipps and abby loran number b same building as mcafee in fact lloyd knows him enough to borrow stuff the id is rock solid okay what about them abby moved in with lloyd that night so they remember the date theyre still doing weekaversaries its kind of cute anyway there they are down in the garage moving up the last carload of her stuff and mcafee comes out says hes having trouble sleeping hes going down to buy some ovaltine youre making this up im not its what happened did they see him come back no no of course not she closed her eyes and let out a sigh so im going to have to subpoena them and mcafee too shouldnt be a big problem hunt said ive got their addresses at work i told them it might be happening didnt bother either of them of course i could have told them i was the grim reaper and it wouldnt have bothered them much either long as they could go together young love gina said wistfully you really cant knock it hunt replied its a beautiful thing gina was in her office by six oclock the next morning and worked straight through until eight thirty when she took a cab down to the hall of justice she spent the time drawing up subpoenas for her new potential witnesses from wyatt hunts travels last night whether or not he succeeded in finding kymberly today gina also wanted to have a subpoena ready for her not only to see if she could get to the critical amytriptilene and pii issues but far more prosaically in case shed need kymberly to rebut bethany robleys version of the threatening conversation while she was at it though for different reasons she also wanted to be able to call fred furth and bob mcafee if the need arose though she fully intended to spend some quality time figuratively holding stuarts hand in the cell behind the courtroom before what was likely to be a devastating and in any case upsetting day of testimony with all the lastminute preparation she never got around to it it probably wasnt technically cuttable but the tension was thick in the courtroom predictably the news outletsboth print and video had a banner opportunity with clair robleys courtroom attack of the defendant whod threatened her daughter and they werent going to let it go by the chronicles lead headline had screamed disorder in the court and some sneaky reporter had obviously gotten past the guards with his photocell phone intact and had caught a dramatic albeit uncredited photo of the cane coming down on a cowering stuart gorman probably in large part because of this the soontobeseasoned judge toynbee had ordered a secondary screening of every person who would be allowed in the courtroom for the mornings session and the line of reporters and lookieloos had stretched the length of the secondfloor hallway and down the stairs into the halls lobby it would be fair to say that none of the people in this queue seemed patient and tranquil as a matter of fact building security had to be called to break up three shoving matches of rivals fighting for their space and a sketch artist for one of the cable news stations got himself arrested at the door to the courtroom when the errant fword escaped his lips directed at the guard right at the courtroom door leading to denial of the artists access which in turn impelled him to throw a right hook at the cops face backstage it wasnt much better as soon as both abrams and gina were in their places at their respective tables toynbee called them back to his chambers and told them both that until further notice they were under a gag order pointedly he ordered abrams to stop his leaking to whomever it was and then he stunned gina by expressly forbidding her to share her opinions of the case with jeff elliott his citytalk column on elements of the pii story and how they might relate to stuart gormans hearing had appeared in the morning edition gina though chastened nevertheless felt emboldened by her new knowledge about the probable murder of kelley rusnak and tried to open a discussion with the judge concerning the relevance of pii issues to the matter at hand unfortunately for gina in his free time yesterday afternoon toynbee had reviewed the proposed testimony of bethany robley and had found it reasonably compelling clearly in spite of the incredible unlikelihood of kelleys and caryns murders being unrelated stuart still seemed very much the main suspect in caryn drydens murder in toynbees mind this was disconcerting to say the least and made gina wonder if the judge was somehow privy to information shed not been made aware of she was about to find out when she walked into the courtroom from behind the judges bench she was immediately struck by the hostility in the air it was ugly back there the gallery packed with many more people than there had been yesterday when it was merely sro abrams still had most of his usual allies jackman for the second day in a row when his presence in a courtroom was normally a newsworthy event on its own more uniforms the neighbors she recognized as witnesses bethany robley today in the front row next to an obviously angry black man who gina thought must be her father she wondered about the psychology of the mob stuart after all was the one whod been attacked and yet somehow this crowd seemed if possible more weighted against him than the one yesterday when the bailiff opened the back door and let stuart into the courtroomthis was before toynbee had taken the benchthe ominous rumble behind her in the gallery was enough to make the hairs on ginas neck stand up what was that about she wondered her client still sported the bandage from yesterdays attack and looked positively worn down and exhausted they should feel sympathy for him if for anybody at least gina thought that until she realized that most of these people undoubtedly still believed that stuart had killed his wifeafter all hed been arrested for itand on top of that that hed threatened this young sweet shy astudent witness whom the chronicle had also profiled that morning for his part stuart got to the table and paid no attention to the gallery instead leaning over and whispering to gina im so sorry about last night i didnt mean to yell at you youre the only one holding this together im just not ready to accept kym as any part of this can you understand that her jaw set gina could only nod just miss robley abrams began would it be okay if i called you bethany she answered in a small voice her voice shaky her eyes darting over to stuart out to her father back to abrams terrified that would be fine she said bethany would you tell the court what you were doing at around eleven thirty on sunday night september eleventh of this year sure but she hesitated before beginning chancing one more look at all these adults who were either tormenting or supporting her in the last couple of weeks especially since those terrible first days before she had told her mother about the threat to her that kymberly had delivered she had come to some fundamental decisions about who was on her side and who wasnt before she had always liked mr gormanenough to be comfortable calling him stuart for examplebut shed always known that when he lost his temper he could be terrifying the time that stuck in her mind the most was once when they all were skiing and this snowboarder came from out of nowhere from behind them and smashed into kymberly going pretty much full speed after stuart made sure that his daughter wasnt seriously injured he skied down to where the boarder had fallen moaning in the snow bethany would never forget not only the look in stuarts eyes but the true sense she had that he was going to stab the kid with his pole as it was he picked him upan adultsize kidand yelling and swearing at him the whole time that he ought to watch where the fuck he was going he slammed him back down onto the hardpacked snow a couple of times before he got himself back under control he had talked about it half the way home too saying he wished he had hurt the kid more hed missed his chance but at least hed intimidated the snowboarder enough to get his address and phone number in case there were complications with kymberly he told the girls he was still considering looking the guy up and hunting him down bethany thought at the time he was mostly kidding blowing off steambut even so it wasnt funny kidding she believed he really might do it now she dared a quick glance at this man who shed convinced herself had absolutely clearly told her that if she went ahead and testified against him something really bad was going to happen to her that was all the proof she needed that hed actually killed his wife watching the young womans hesitation as she assessed the danger stuart posed to her as she then turned and waited for the nods of assurance from gerry abrams and from her father gina suddenly felt a stab of panic she had studied and well knew the psychology of terrorfrom the stockholm syndrome where hostages came to admire and even love their captors to a situation such as this one ginas instinct now told her that bethany had come to the unshakeable conclusion that stuart was a dangerous man who needed to be put away and that was all there was to it in the past ten days that nascent belief had grown to a dead certainty within her the stress and responsibility placed on her her willingness and even need to please her protectors and the intense coaching shed received from gerry abrams and her parentsthere was much literature documenting that factors such as these could actually conspire to change bethanys wiring down to the level of her synapses and this in turn might affect the actual details in her memory her certainty about what she must have seen in her mind might now be indistinguishable from what she actually had seen and if that were the case they were in big big trouble gina leaned over and whispered to stuart dont look back at her and no matter what she says stay cool and now on the stand bethany brought her gaze back to the center of the courtroom getting a confident nod from her protector gerry abrams she began well i was doing homework in my room but it was getting to be about eleven thirty which is my bedtime i closed my books and was going in to brush my teeth and get ready for bed when i looked out my bedroom window and saw a car pulling up to the house across the street and then the garage door coming open did you recognize the car bethany yes id ridden in it many times it belonged to my neighbor across the street and do you see that neighbor in the courtroom today desperate to break up the rhythm of bethanys testimony gina recognized an early opportunity and stood up objection im sorry your honor vague does counsel mean the neighbor who owns the car because theres been no testimony that the witness saw the driver of the car that night obviously abrams responded the question calls for an identification of the neighbor who owned the car and id ask that ms roake be admonished not to interrupt the testimony of an alreadyuncomfortable witness with frivolous objections if nothing else the objection had succeeded in slowing things down toynbee whose earlier sunnier disposition seemed in the light of his own current intensity as though it must have been an apparition was not thrilled with the exchange all right both of you he said thats strike two ms roake your objection is overruled the question was obviously proper mr abrams when i need your advice on how to run my courtroom ill ask for it i swear to you if the two of you dont settle down somebodys going to walk out of here with a lighter pocketbook abrams went apoplectic your honor i havent done the judge glared grabbed his gavel and slammed it down shutting him up ive ruled on the objection counselor he said in a firm tone you may continue questioning your witness gina was going back to her table behind her she heard abrams ask the judge if the court recorder could read back bethanys testimony so he could take up where she had left off as shed hoped ginas objection and the argument around it had made abrams lose his place after a minute the recorder had found the spot mr abrams did you recognize the car bethany she intoned then the witness yes id ridden in it many times it belonged to my neighbor across the street abrams back in his place said and do you see that neighbor in court today the neighbor who owned the car she pointed to stuart without looking at him abrams back in his place said so you recognized the car did you not bethany yes i did could you describe it please yes its a black lexus suv is there anything else distinguishing about this car yes there is and whats that the license plate next to her stuart shifted in his chair and started to say something gina quickly put a hand over his forearm leaned into him not now she whispered harshly but in fact gina too had a very bad feeling in all the transcripts that gina had seen of bethanys testimony in her discovery shed never once mentioned the license plate or the fact that shed seen it abrams was going on what about the license plate bethany its a personalized plate it says ghoti next to her stuart said thats bullshit she couldnt have seen that gina squeezed her fingernails into his forearm shut up suck it up toynbee was glaring at the small disturbance they made his gavel poised to fall but stuart managed to calm himself gina eased the pressure on his arm toynbee lowered the gavel and again turned his attention to abrams who smiled at bethany and said are you absolutely sure bethany that these were the letters you saw on the license plate as it turned into the driveway across the street and into the garage with a last defiant glare at stuart bethany nodded to abrams and said yes sir i am in spite of ginas many objections some of them merely for the sake of disturbance abrams and bethany went on to establish that the same car had pulled out of stuarts garage at a quarter to one but the real damage had already been done the prosecution had presented firsthand eyewitness testimony from a credible person who was giving false witness although gina believed she might truly believe that she was telling the whole truth and nothing but before abrams was finished with her bethany also delivered an emotional recasting of the socalled threat from stuart that kymberly had conveyed ginas strenuous objection that there was no evidence tying whatever kym might or might not have done to stuart was for naught at trial she knew the prosecution would just drag in kym and impeach her if she had claimed it was her own idea but for now the evidence was coming in even without that necessary foundation and there didnt seem to be a damn thing she could do about it in the telling bethany came all the way to tears and toynbee had to call a short recess to let her regain her composure after that she testified that the message from kymberly contained an explicit warning from stuart that if bethany went on the stand to testify against him something very bad was going to happen to her shed had to miss two days of school pretending to be sick because she was so afraid of going out of her house and then luckily the police had arrested stuart gina had her work cut out for her she came to her position before bethany in the middle of the courtroom and gave her a warm smile which the witness did not return bethany she began when did you first give your account of the night of september eleventh to inspector juhle now ginas mission was precisely the opposite of her strategy during abrams direct this time she wanted to get bethany talking freely so that something unguarded and unrehearsed might slip out i dont know exactly i think it was the next day the day after caryn died and you told the inspector the whole truth didnt you you didnt hold anything back yes i told him the whole truth and you knew that caryn dryden was dead and how important this was so you tried to be as helpful and complete as you could isnt that right yes now during that conversation were you aware that inspector juhle had a tape recorder going yes he asked my permission before he began so the entire conversation as far as you know is on tape right right did he ask you any questions before he turned the tape recorder on or after he turned it off just whether i agreed to have the tape on but nothing else gina continued now that conversation was just a short while after caryns death and a lot has happened since then hasnt it scary things like your talk with kym and having to testify here today do you think your memory might have been a little better back then than it is today well my memory is pretty good today but if you said something on the tape and you say something different now dont you think it would be more likely that what you said on the tape was right just because of the amount of time that has passed and the things that have happened probably so and in that first discussion did you tell inspector juhle that you recognized mr gormans car yes thats what he was asking about and you identified it as you have today as a black lexus suv kind of a smaller sport utility vehicle yes did you tell him what the license plate was during that conversation yes bethany has anyone given you a copy of the tape to listen to to prepare for your testimony yes nodding gina walked swiftly over to her table and pulled some pages from the open folder shed left there bethany ive got here a transcript of that original talk and id like you to take a look at it for a minuteits not longand point out for the court where you told inspector juhle about the personalized license plate sure happy to cooperate bethany took the papers in her hands and began looking through them gina turned and stole a glance at gerry abrams who was busily arranging his own materials and didnt meet her eyes for all of her inexperience with murder proceedings gina was very familiar with most of the games attendant in criminal proceedings in general she was certain that she was dealing with one of the most common of these now since all transcriptions of testimony had to be included in discovery which the prosecution then had to give to defense counsel sometimes discussions with crucial witnesses happened as though by inadvertence off tape this meant that critical testimony such as the kind bethany had presented here could be shaped and even created out of whole cloth and remain outside of the record until it could be dropped as a surprise to maximum effect at a trial or hearing now gina turned again to face the witness bethanys brow had clouded and she was turning pages trying to find what wasnt there finally she looked up im sorry she said im afraid i dont see it here thats correct gina said encouragingly you dont gina read from her own copy of the transcript and inspector juhle asked you specifically how sure you were didnt he yes so from the transcript now inspector juhle says i guess im just asking how sure you are then you say and here again im quoting from the transcript what that it was stuart i dont know i told you i didnt see him but if he was driving his car it was him because that was his car bethany gave a small nod and inspector juhle asks how did you know that to which you answered i dont know i just knew gina lowered her pages bethany wouldnt this have been a good time to mention the license plate objection speculation sustained gina thought shed try again bethany when you gave this first interview did you remember that youd seen the license plate at that time now bethany threw a quick worried glance at abrams well yes of course you mean did i remember at the time inspector juhle asked me that first day if id recognized the license plate the night before thats right bethany thats what im asking yes and yet when inspector juhle asked how you knew this was mr gormans car you answered that you didnt know how you just knew is that right bethanys eyes were glued on abrams behind her and so without pause without turning around gina looked up at the judge your honor she said sharply would the court please instruct mr abrams not to give nonverbal cues to the witness during my crossexamination abrams nearly screamed your honor it is unprofessional and highly unethical for ms roake to make an accusation like that when she knows there is no basis for it your honor gina shot back i object to mr abrams telling me what i know or dont know toynbee pointed his glare now a constant feature and i object to the two of you treating my courtroom like a nursery school thats a hundred bucks each and it gets much worse very fast gina gladly accepted the fine it was worth it because it gave her just what she wanted the acrimony and confusion of these battling adults had dissolved any sense of security that bethany might have built up over the lunch hour now gina went back to her desk took a drink of water to calm herself down then came back at the witness you didnt know how you knew about the car bethany you just knew wouldnt you have known it was mr gormans car because you recognized the license plate i guess so yes and yet you didnt mention that to inspector juhle objection asked and answered sustained she pressed on bethany do you remember the first time you mentioned the license plate to inspector juhle specifically not exactly im not sure because ive looked through all the transcriptions of your interviews with both him and mr abrams and youve had five of them did you realize that i didnt know it was that many and i bet youve talked to your mom about this a lot too havent you yes and you never mentioned the license plate in any of those conversations did you silence when was the first time you mentioned the license plate to anyone bethany do you remember i said i didnt exactly your honor abrams again counsel is badgering the witness i dont think so toynbee said overruled so do you remember bethany the exact time was it for example after you came to believe that stuart had threatened you no i knew it before then i knew it right away then why didnt you say anything about it i dont know i guess i didnt know how important it would be gina paused to compose herself despite her best efforts she found herself enraged bethany she asked forcing a pleasant expression i read in the newspaper this morning that youve got a grade point average of four point two one of the highest in your class dont you yes perking up a bit and inspector juhle asked you specifically how you recognized the car didnt he yes and you knew it was an important question didnt you well not exactly well you knew that you recognized the car because of the license plate right yes and you were telling the whole truth right not holding anything back yes her voice smaller but bethany isnt it true that right up until today in court you never said during any of your other taped interviews that you remembered the license plate isnt that true how could a smart girl like you not recognize the importance of that information your honor abrams called out in outrage this is badgering heaped upon insult damn right it is she thought and every word on purpose but as toynbee sustained the objection gina nodded meekly ill withdraw the question your honor without kymberly gorman available as a witness to refute bethanys testimony on the alleged threat gina didnt think she could make any points revisiting the subject clearly whatever words bethany had heard shed interpreted as threatening that was her reality reinforced by her mothers acceptance of it steeled in the forge of yesterdays attack on stuart and gina couldnt really see any point in trying to change it without having accomplished much with bethany gina reluctantly dismissed the witness she very much expected abrams to call as witnesses the two neighbors whod testified about the fights at stuarts house as well as some or all four of the officers whod responded to the domestic disturbance calls all of these people were already waiting outside the courtroom as was debra dryden whom abrams presumably was going to question regarding her fiveday idyll with stuart up in the mountains but evidently bethanys unambiguous testimony that it was stuarts car at the murder scene and ginas inability to shake that had convinced abrams to quit while he was ahead certainly bethanys eyewitness identification of stuarts car seemed to put him at the house at the time of death since he denied being there the only reasonable explanation was that he had killed his wife that having been established abrams clearly decided that he wanted to save the remaining witnesses for trial so hed have something to show stuarts defense team next time around that it hadnt already seen and analyzed so much to ginas surprise when bethany had left the courtroom abrams rested the peoples case judge toynbee asked gina if she would be ready to begin calling her witnesses after lunch she told him she would and he brought down his gavel and called the recess when gina finally got home that evening it was at a little after seven oclock she walked into her bedroom and changed out of her court clothes normally she coped with enervation and mental fatigue by putting some miles on her running shoes and she reached almost automatically for her sweats but then stopped herself there was very little that was normal about the boneweariness she was experiencing now at last feeling guilty about the lazy slug she had become nevertheless she changed instead into some baggy chinos and a black tank top catching sight of herself in the mirror on the closet door she brushed a wisp of hair off her forehead and tried to smooth away the darkness under her eyes sighing she went barefoot out to the kitchen and ran hot water over a washcloth which she applied to her face then made it a few more steps onto the living room rug before she all but collapsed folding upon herself down to the floor now poleaxed from the rigors of the day she lay flat on her back awake but nearly unconscious her chest slowly rising and falling the tepid washcloth folded over her eyes the afternoon session had been grueling and frustrating which she would have gladly endured had it been effective as well but it had not been it had been a disaster shed known that she had to try to get pii somehow into the record and shed called fred furth thinking to have him elucidate caryns connection with the company her concerns over the clinical trials data her professional relationship not only with furth himself but with bill blair and kelley rusnak abrams his objections perhaps numbering close to fifty had been a bulldog in the end having never established a rhythm or even the tiniest objective relevancy to whatever had happened to caryn shed had to excuse furth without her theory gaining much traction so her assault on robert mcafee trying to establish him as another legitimate suspect had begun with her on the defensive the court had just formally warned her not to waste its time and as she began her direct she couldnt completely escape the conclusion that this was exactly what she was doing true mcafee appeared to have had a strong motive to have killed caryn true theyd been lovers once and might have been again yes he stood to gain financially and professionally from her death finally his alibi for the night of the event had just gone south but the plain fact remained that there was no hint of mcafees involvement on any level with pii or with kelley rusnak and without that gina knew in her heart that in her exhaustive attempt to implicate the doctor she was really just whistling dixie the theory was probably arguable but at best it was no less a sham than abrams attempt to portray stuarts drive down the peninsula as a flight from justice that screamed consciousness of guilt the underlying cynicism of it had worn her down as she went on until at last she couldnt even take pleasure in shattering mcafees alibi which didnt stop her from doing it so shed spent almost the entire afternoon smearing the name and reputation of a probably pretty decent guy whose only mistake had been forgetting that hed gone out one night after a day with his kids to buy some ovaltine so he could get some sleep gina no longer thought it was reasonable that bob mcafee had killed caryn she didnt even believe that implicating him would do any good for her client not as far as toynbee was concerned the fact that there might be another plausible suspect in no way removed stuart from suspicion gina wasnt proposing that mcafee had been driving stuarts car was she but shed gone ahead anyway building nothing but hammering nails all day just the same the thought of it of the damage shed done to the doctors good name made her sick she put her hands up to the washcloth and pressed the nowcool cloth down on her eyes i thought we were going to stop meeting like this gina said wyatt hunt stood in her doorway i know he said we were it just got too hard the rain had stopped he stepped out of the wet cloud that hovered at street level into ginas apartment again miracles do happen he said i dont care what they say whats the miracle i figured id get it over with so i called devin after work and mentioned your idea that he could still do some good around this case he wasnt exactly enthusiastic but luckily i happened to mention that he could even become an actual hero if he wasnt careful i happen to know hunt said modestly with a selfdeprecating smile that the guys got a bit of a hero complex and that this was the magic word anyway he had me make a call to kymberlys number and since there was a subpoena out on her anyway there wasnt even a conflict with him using his magic gps positioning and calling out some troops to run her down where was she down by the maritime museum living out of some van with her boyfriend you talked to her not a question he nodded just came from there although again i know this is starting to sound familiar and i apologize in advance but you might not be happy with what i found out tell me yosemite what about it thats where they went when the weather turned last week last thursday they stayed through sunday he spread his hands empty which means she didnt give any pills to kelley rusnak on friday night and if you need more sure kick a girl when shes down her dad might have mentioned kelleys name to her but i dont think it stuck when i mentioned her as her moms lab partner she was all like who she could have been faking it i suppose but if she was shes way way better than id give her credit for gina found herself sagging against the wall hey are you okay she tried a brave smile just tired she looked up at him i cant believe my man is going down around this its just so wrong youll get another chance her eyes found a faint flash i dont want another chance i want to get him off this time around while i still can theres something were missing i know there is its right here and i cant put my damn finger on it well i hope it goes without saying but if whatever it is comes to you im here twentyfour seven a genuine smile now youre a good guy wyatt and you do good work ill keep you in mind anytime he said and gina yeah dont kill yourself over this hes going to need you for the trial youre right she said youre right she straightened up you have a good night wyatt you too but she wasnt having a good night now it was someone had twisted a heavy wire braid around her head and tightened it down as though it were a tourniquet that same someone had thrown finegrained sand into her eyes shed long ago emptied and spread out on the coffee table the entire contents of her litigators briefcase shed already gone through almost every page of itcertainly anything that had meaningat least twice now she decided that even the marginally related stuff rated intense perusal and she was going through it all yet again in her desperation she studied the arco receipt for what seemed an eternity hoping to find something in it that could help her case maybe she should call the station and ask the clerk to check and see if perhaps the clock in their printer was off by an hour or so she hadnt ever gone out and personally verified the timingthat could have been the detail shed missed but even as she made a note to have wyatt hunt check this out she knew it wasnt here again was the transcription of stuarts first interview with juhle all the foolish admissions that delineated his motives the evident lack of grief the objection to the autopsy his suggestion about the vicodin and the alcohol and the hot tub temperature all of it understandable all of it illadvised she finished those pages and randomly picked up the next item in the pile the picture of stuart and jedd conley and their other buddy on their fishing trip to the bitterroots turned it over studied the writing on the back the date nothing who was that third guy anyway another detail she didnt know another fact shed neglected another note for hunt and what had happened to thou shalt not kill in the time stuart had been in jail he might have tried to contact stuart again on his computer back at his home he might even have confessed to killing caryn and no one would know certainly she didnt know because she hadnt thought to look sick with herself and her incompetence she sat back on her couch and looked first to her baran oban or four would be nice right nowthen to her telephone she felt she desperately needed to talk to somebody she checked the time it wasnt too late she could perhaps call hardy or farrell and just vent or talk strategy they were both guys who had been in similar situations to hers before one of them could help talk her through the despair or maybethe rogue thought sprung upon her fullblown maybe she could call jedd for a different kind of release she had his business card from the day shed met stuart his private number and theyd both be discreet no one would ever have to know god what was she thinking she wasnt that weak that needy she was not going to go to bed with a married man and that was the end of that subject shaking herself from the temptation she came forward again almost angrily grabbed the next sheaf of papers and forced herself to start again on wyatts reports and transcripts on the parnassus staff from the other day delgado pinkert thirty pages of overkill about the schedule and speech topics of a state assemblyman exciting stuff not shed never even glanced at these pages beforeand why should she have now mindlessly automatically she turned the pages one by one barely noting the individual names and places except for the immense variety of them on every page jedds life was evidently a neverending circus of appearances and events the bayshore rotary club girl scout troop the young presidents association the restaurant workers union the haight street rape crisis center whose executive director gina knew in the smallworld department was wes farrells livein girlfriend sam duncan la raza the old wops ayso san francisco the list went on and on none of it with any possible bearing on her caseuntil finally gina simply had to stop the pages in her hand dropping back onto the table she looked at the time again barely she should go to bed tomorrow would be another day and it might turn out to be worse than this one out of the corner of her eye she noticed the camping picture again and her hand reached for it as though of its own accord there was jedd still and again smiling out at the camera rugged and handsome in his element really a very attractive guy whod known what he was doing around the bedroom twentysome years ago and probably had learned a few tricks since stop it but she couldnt take her eyes off the picture the picture the picture jedd she said into the telephone its gina ive been thinking about when you were here the other night and how maybe i shouldnt have been so difficult and cold i know its a little late but i thought if you were on your way home from somewhere if you were in the mood you might want to stop by ginas hands were shaking slightly as she applied a light touch of coralshaded lipstick with greater than average care she wanted to look not just good but terrific the ropebelted chinos and tank top she already had on she knew would be good for seductionalmost pajamalike revealing her curves accentuating the muscle tone her flat abs not that jedd was likely to get all the way over here and change his mind because of how she looked but she wanted to make herself irresistible hence the subtle eye shadow to camouflage the more obvious signs of fatigue the blush to highlight her cheekbones the glossy lipstick she hadnt used since her time with david she wasnt going to think about david not now checking herself one final time in the mirror satisfied she said not bad for an old broad and left the bathroom turning out the lights behind her in the living room she put on the old classic tony bennettbill evans album the volume so low as to be nearly inaudible shed already long since packed away her case materials and her briefcase and now she crossed over to her bar area and poured two solid obans into her good crystal glasses dimming the lights to an intimate level she took a last look around everything was perfect she was ready and still the soft knock on her door nearly made her jump crossing over to the window she looked out and recognized jedds car again parked on the sidewalk across the street she let out a long breath of relief okay he was here she could stop thinking about what could go wrong and just be in the moment now it would be all right she went to open the door why gina roake the scotch in your glass is shaking i do believe youre nervous why would i be nervous i dont know why you really shouldnt be conley was sitting back smiling his hand with the drink in it resting on the couchs arm one ankle crossed onto the opposite knee were pretty much the way we were a couple of old friends just doing what comes naturally after a gap of over twenty years jedd im not exactly the same as i was back then in fact im not even close well he said anybody tells you that youre still not beautiful they need their eyes examined i hope youre not telling me that youve spent any time alone that you didnt want to be that would be criminal gina sighed with a bit of theater it may be a little harder than you think it is out there of course you with all your power and charisma and a wife whose daddy controls the purse strings and i mean all of them my darling lexi gets any idea that this kind of harmless fun is any part of my life i can kiss the socalled power and my promising career goodbye and im not kidding he took a good pull at his drink by the way the other night when i told you id be discreet i know you already realize it but just to be upfront about things thats got to be part of the rules gina put on a little artificial pout a twinkle of humor in her eye rules already and here i thought we were wild spirits running free that too but i find its better to get the ground rules settled up front it avoids a whole lot of unpleasantness down the line actually gina said im with you on that at the other end of the couch from him she lifted her glass heres to that dying breed the consenting adult hear hear conley clinked his glass against hers had another sip gina did likewise then said okay im officially not nervous anymore good me neither but you werent to begin with i was a little after the last time i thought id get here and you might change your mind well jedd i dont think thats happening not tonight she hesitated for a calculated time but i do have kind of an idea if you dont mind though it may be a little kinky kinkys not the worst thing in the world he flashed a look across at her what is it no never mind gina come on what she sighed dramatically the main thing is i dont want to scare you off i mean what i said earlier is true ive grown up a little bit since since we were together im not exactly the same in what what works i guess is the best way to say it well we want things to work yes we do jedd nodded and continued to stare at gina with open approval surprised perhaps delighted and certainly no less interested he tipped up his drink then putting the empty glass down he spoke deliberately and confidently a smile starting to form at the corners of this mouth i very much doubt if anything you suggest is going to be so kinky it scares me off what do you have in mind ill just tell you and if you dont want it wont matter we can just stay here okay as opposed to where well thats my idea stuarts house for the briefest of seconds he couldnt keep the shock from showing in his face but he recovered quickly back in the game stuart gormans house she came forward brought her knee up onto the couch under her clearly excited nobodys there jedd and ive got the key so we sneak in and go up to stuart and caryns old bedroom and do it on their bed i dont think the place is even a mile from here well sure i know where it is its just no its okay never mind youre right dumb idea i didnt say that no really its okay we can just stay here but in the guise of an explanation she kept up the pitch ive just kind of got this tradition you might say do you know about the mile high club jedd grinned sure im a member as a matter of fact why am i not surprised she put on another fetching pout not me not yet at least anyway my own private little club is kind of like that when my clients are in jail if the opportunitys there i go to their houses you have got to be kidding me conley stared at her in pure admiration youre a fucking dangerous woman roake she nodded i like to think so how many times so far how many times what have you done this this would make lucky thirteen if you go that is ive been waiting for number thirteen it had to be special getting into the idea conley asked who were the other guys ive got to know some of them dont i im sure you do so she wagged a finger at him uhuhuh discretion remember nobody knows nobody tells she threw in another chip and it doesnt have to be on the bed if you dont want and youve got stuarts keys yep where are they now my purse in the bedroom he couldnt seem to take his eyes off her and finally he nodded maybe youre going to want to go get them as he drove jedd put a hand on her thigh and gave it an affectionate squeeze she put her own hand over his and held it where it was if i guess the right guy he was saying you could just nod that way you wouldnt actually be telling me no she said anybody more than once she squeezed to hold his hand in position two twice she said riffing effortlessly but thats all im going to say any sports figures or movie stars oh thats right yes several of those each and one potentate of a small arab country she looked across at him inane though the conversation was she was thankful that they were talking apparently relaxed im just a poor country lawyer girl jedd im afraid i dont hang out much with celebrities and potentates no celebrities at all all right how about this potentates aside lets go for rank nationally known politicians a laughed escaped her no any other legislators other legislators i mean besides me well technically youre not quite on the list yet and i dont know any other legislators okay then we can rule them out see im narrowing it down how about judges jedd higher up than judges federal judges i cant say you wouldnt want me to tell anybody else about you would you i dont know as long as you kept it from lexi and her dad it might be cool if it got out in the right crowd he hesitated im guessing all men though right no women she took the opportunity to remove his hand entirely i would think that would have been obvious to you by now youd be surprised he said and dont get mad you cant really tell but im sorry no offense meant the hand went back to her thigh she put hers over it again none taken but maybe it would be better if youd just drive here we are pretty dark gina said except look up there where that top front window bethany robley the eyewitness her lights still on which means shes up and doing homework damn i forgot all about her what if she sees us youre stuarts lawyer and im his old friend no problem heyjedd squeezed her thighweve come this far you cant chicken out now well you could but it wouldnt be fair besides no guts no glory she hesitated one last time let out a heavy breath youre right she squeezed his hand are you ready i am so ready jedd said gina nodded gave him a last smile me too lets go do this bad thing jedd opened his door slid out and closed it quietly behind him gina her heart sledgehammering within her her pulse an audible sound in her ears immediately pushed the button to lock all the cars doors and reached across to jedds visor where he had attached his garage door opener she pushed on the bar of it her eyes on the gormans garage door off to her right but nothing happened god she thought what if he hadnt parked close enough sometimes she had to get right to the front of her own automatic entrance at her condo before the gate would swing open the signal on these things tended not to be too strong she should have had him park in the driveway but stupid her she hadnt figured out a way to ask without giving herself away jedd was directly behind the car now coming around there was no light in the car but when conley had opened his door gina had seen the three buttons up by the rearview mirror now she reached up found and pressed the first one on her far left okay she said open up her eyes were glued to the garage door but it didnt move the second button she pushed and held it for a long threecount please please please nothing no longer aware of where jedd had gotten to she pressed the third button come on she whispered urgently come on but nothing happened oh god dont let me be wrong i cant be wrong and then right at her ear a knock at her window jedd standing there leaning over looking in a mild questioning look on his features gina whirled back to face him made an elaborate shrugging motion as if she didnt understand exactly what was happening the cars door had locked somehow and she couldnt get them open she shrugged again he tried the outside handle he was reaching into his pocket for his keys hed open the door in seconds she turned back toward the front hitting his garage door openers bar and all three buttons again in quick succession and got the same result nothing and then suddenly at her window another sound this time much louder than the polite knock on the glass a slam conleys flat palm up against her window she looked out and up and saw his face understanding now what she must be doing and in a desperate fury his palm slammed on the window again but still maintaining some kind of control gina gina open up what are you doing his keys were out now he was trying to fit them into the lock below the doors handle gina reached to her side and covered the popup locking button with her hand as conley turned the key outside she pushed the button back down on the door he tried again and again she kept the door locked but she could not keep this up for too much longer jedd wasnt about to fight that battle either he backed up a step and pushed at his key and gina heard the distinctive clunk as all of the cars locks except the useless one she was trying to hold down popped up he was opening the passenger side back door right behind her gina goddammit the glove compartment reaching down praying that jedd wasnt one of the few paranoid souls who lived with his glove box perennially locked she found the handle and gave it a pull just as from behind her conleys hands found the back of her shoulders tried to get purchase around her throat she tried to scream but the sound to her horror was already choked off then he was coming over the center island between the seats enough of him to get his power into what he was doing now gasping with the exertion trying anything to save herself from his brute strength and determination she reached out and scratched at his face then threw an elbow that seemed to hit him in the throat and for an instant his grip lessened it was her last and only chance she fumbled blindly in the glove box as jedds left fist connected with the side of her head slamming it against the window she had her hand around something plastic and rectangularanother garage door openerand as the second blow sent pinwheels of light through her field of vision she managed to press the bar and hold it until another blow to the side of her head reduced her world to a sharp searing pain and then to darkness at juhles instructions the two uniformed officers whod helped him with the sting had delivered jedd conley up here to the tiny interrogation room on the fourth floor of the hall of justice now the state assemblyman from san francisco had been in the room handcuffed to the table and alone for most of the past hour and a half dealing with the ambulance and other issues juhle had remained at the crime scene out on greenwich street for the better part of the first hour then had come back here to his desk in the homicide detail and caught up with most of another hours worth of paperwork checking the clock on the wall seeing it was now am juhle knew that he had delayed long enough he had to start his interrogation of jedd conley before too long but he had some serious problems critically the provenance of the allimportant garage door opener was unproveable trying to get stuart off on his murder charge gina could have bought the damn thing at home depot and easily with her access to stuarts house have set it to the frequency that would open the garage door she could have carried it with her over there tonight in her purse now with conleys brutal assault on gina juhle had grounds for much more than a simple and general discussion with the assemblyman but time was running out and with all of conleys powerful connections juhle felt great trepidation that if he let him walk out of here tonight without confessing to caryn drydens murder and maybe even kelley rusnaks hed never get his hands on him again he couldnt let that happen at last he went to the control room to make sure that both the audio and video feeds were running then knocked on the door and opened it up talking as he entered sorry to have kept you he said breezily lots of stuff to take care of back at the scene i got a little hung up how you doin how am i doing what is that some kind of a joke his suspect his face scratched from fingernails and now swollen at his jawline and around his eyes held up the handcuffs im exhausted im hurt im ready to go home its intolerable that i should be kept in here like this for all this time i wont have it well juhle said im afraid some of thats out of my control at least i can take off your handcuffs the patrolmen tell me that you got picked up in the act of assaulting a woman i find that hard to believe did the officers mirandize you on the way down here what for this whole thing is ridiculous look at my face she was trying to kill me it was selfdefense juhle remained calm i figured it must be something like that but in the meanwhile youre a lawyer arent you you know the drill ive got to tell you youre under arrest and read you your rights you have the right to remain silent anything you do say can and will be used against you in a court of law do you understand this right of course you dont have to but juhle held up a hand stopping conleys objection you have the right to an attorney if you cant afford an attorney the court will appoint one for you do you understand this right jesus yes juhle continued the end of this litany could end with the words having these rights in mind do you wish to talk to me now but the courts had ruled that miranda would be deemed served without them so juhle skipped them and simply started in theres a laundry list of formal questions weve got to fill out and the sooner were done the sooner its over okay okay for the record your name jedd conley and with those simple two words the assemblyman waived his right to demand an attorney for this interrogation juhle walked him through a few perfunctory questionshis address age occupationjust to get him to keep talking then juhle said so tell me what was happening out there tonight all right it started when ginathe woman gina roake yeah i know who she is well she called me around nine and asked me to come over to her house and why would she do that you know this inspector i know who you are shes defending stuart gorman maybe you dont know hes an old friend of mine i dont practice law actively anymore so when stuart got in trouble and came to me i told him he ought to get together with gina big mistake whys that because she just wasnt any good if anything she just got him dug in deeper now her hearings going in the toilet and she wanted to ask my advice about what she should do at her house the truth i would have preferred her office he shrugged my position i cant afford even the appearance of impropriety this thing tonights going to be a bitch to spin i dont know what im going to do but beyond that my wifes got serious issues with infidelity frankly so do i plus so you knowand im laying it all out for you here as honest as i cangina and i had a spent a few nights together before i was married i didnt know she was still carrying a torch he shrugged a victim of ginas feminine wiles but i knew she needed help with stuarts defense and hes my bud and thats where she was at home so i went but when you got picked up you werent at her home he shrugged because right after i walked in the door i knew i had to get out of there why was that why do you think shed poured us both a couple of stiff shots of scotch she had on a pretty provocative top it didnt look to me like her plan was to parse the law she said she had the key to stuarts and said maybe we ought to go by there give the house another look maybe wed find something you guysthe policehad missed and howd you react to that it seemed weird to me but she was trying to get all over me by then and i thought it would be a good idea to get out of the house i didnt know what was going on but i didnt want to offend her okay so we drove over to his place and i dont know if her drink had hit her or what or if maybe shed had more alcohol before i got to her place but she was getting pretty worked up before i even pulled over she still loved me from before that kind of thing i never should have stopped seeing her she was letting herself get pretty hysterical and then what a deep sigh she tried to come over and kiss me but i wasnt going there what did you do i told her it wasnt going to work if she wanted we could see if we could find anything that might have been missed at stuarts otherwise i was going to drop her back at her place and go home i just got out of the car hoping shed calm down but she didnt juhle all in all impressed with the story conley had concocted in the lengthy time hed been stewing in the interrogation room was moderately curious to find out how conley was going to explain the fact that hed been coming out of the back passenger door when the officers had apprehended himmaybe the lovecrazed gina roake pretended that she couldnt get her seat belt off intending to ravage him sexually as he reached across her to unfasten the lock but jedd guessed what she was planning so he came in the back door to undo the seat belt from there and thats when shed finally attacked him for rejecting her over the seat juhle didnt think so and besides hed heard enough but as the officers pulled up they distinctly saw you pounding on the door trying to get into the car conley licked his lips well yes he said she had accidentally locked him out and hed become frustrated with the situation but the cops were wrong if they thought theyd seen him attack her and he had no idea where the garage door opener had come from roake must have brought itgot it from stuart perhaps well no sir juhle said im afraid that wont work either in fact the officers didnt just happen by they were watching the house and so was i the house is a murder scene i assumed it must have been under some kind of surveillance actually no though that wasnt it in fact gina roake had her investigator call me up earlier in the night he asked me to come on down to stuart gormans place and wait for you and gina to drive up in your car and stand by juhles statement seemed to shake something loose in conley who hesitated slightly his mouth open to refute a charge that juhle hadnt quite made the idea was that she could open gormans garage door from your car another small but obvious hit quick as a bird conley looked away blinked looked back why would she want to do how was she going to do that she thought youd programmed your car so you could get in and out of the gormans garage without leaving your car on the street and also of course so you wouldnt be seen coming and going or else so that people at a glance would assume it was stuart as bethany robley did whos she the neighbor across the street she saw your car open the garage on the night caryn dryden was killed well no that wasnt me it couldnt have been me i wasnt anywhere near the house that night i was at an event for greenpeace i remember she must have planted that garage door opener you remember that specific night do you among all those events you go to i happen to remember that one yes i mean after hearing about caryn the night stuck in my memory so you were never at caryns house on that sunday no of course not but you know as it turns out juhle said almost apologetically and you might not have noticed with all the excitement but gina did open their garage tonight from inside your car that was our signal to come running and she had a tape recorder in her purse so we know whose idea it was to go to the house the inspectors blood was starting to run high but it would not do to show anything helpful courteous to a fault he went on youre certain you werent there on that sunday i told you that no of course not but youd been there recently at least not even that lexi and i didnt see them socially i havent been to their house in several years sadly juhle shook his head im afraid thats not going to do sir even if it isnt your fingerprint on the one large shard of broken wineglass we foundand i think it issome of your fingerprints are going to be somewhere in the house dont you think probably in the bedroom the problem was we didnt have your fingerprints in the criminal database the last time we looked and now of course that wont be a problem same thing with the blood we found in the garage with your dna sample were going to get a match arent we god juhle said this is thirstymaking work can i get you a coke or a water or something ill be right back juhle walked out the door and crossed the homicide room to get a couple of paper cups full of water on the way back he looked in to check the video screen again the camera was camouflaged into the wall and conley though he probably suspected that he was being filmed andor recorded couldnt know for sure and that uncertainty would help to keep him offbalance his head was whipping from side to side up to down as though searching the room for a place to hide or escape juhle watched until that stopped and conley rested his head down upon his open palm coming back into the interrogation room juhle pushed the water across at his suspect i dont know if you realize it sir but at the hearing gina roake made a damn good case for the fact that caryn might not have been killed at all somebody being there at her house on sunday doesnt necessarily mean that they killed her it might very well have been an accident i can understand why you wouldnt want it to come out that you were there maybe you really werent having an affair maybe it was just a harmless business meeting but you were afraid of how it would look this is really important now i cant imagine that you would have killed her but you have to tell me what happened the lifeline thrown conley stared at it for a long moment then made a reach for itthe only move he had left all right but it was early in the day she was a wreck about her invention you know about that dont you the dryden socket she wanted my advice about what she should do same as with gina juhle noticeda woman needed his advice maybe conleys creativity was drying up under the stress so in fact you did go by on that sunday he nodded i think it was sometime around noon she was very much alive when i was with her of course changing the tone working the story to try to fit the new facts he went on i couldnt very well admit id been over there that day you understand that i mean the day she was killed but it was all business you werent anywhere near the hot tub with her no we never left the kitchen and living room look inspector i know what youre thinking i even know what it looks like but we werent having a physical relationship the plain fact is that stuart was jealous of me and i had to try to keep him from ever seeing us together she had a key to the back door of my office i only came by her place when he wasnt home but i had a great deal of business and even some personal issues with carynokay ill admit thatbut nothing more nothing inappropriate juhle slowly took his paper cup of water and lifted it to his lips putting it down he sighed hoping to convey his reluctance to vocalize what had to come next mr conley he said that shard of wineglass with the fingerprint on it that i mentioned it was under the hot tub and your car pulled into the garage at eleven thirty that night juhle knew that bethany robley had identified the car as stuarts during the hearing but hed also been at the untaped portion of her interview with gerry abrams when the assistant da had reminded her that stuarts license plate said ghoti and if it had been stuart driving his car thats what she must have seen conley sat with juhles damning words for a long time juhle could almost see him conjuring with the various escape possibilities as each new set of facts tightened the noose now conley nodded settled on his next course okay all right we we were shit intimate all right it wasnt anything i planned it just happened juhle said nothing i dont know what happened to her that day conley went on it must have been some kind of accident after i left she fell against something i know shed been drinking shed taken some pills that combination with the hot tub it can be dangerous by itself but i swear to god she was alive when i left she stayed in the hot tub she must have yes juhle had his hands linked on the table in front of him the clock on the wall told him theyd been at this for over an hour on the one hand it seemed to him as though it had been five minutes but on the other half a night and now he knew it was coming to an end mr conley sir he said the neighbor across the street saw you leave the house at twelve fortyfive caryn was already dead at twelve fortyfive which means if you do the math and i have that you either killed her or were someplace else in the house and she died maybe you fell asleep came downstairs to find her dead and panicked conleys stare was blank his bank of ready lies about played out juhle decided he had to hit him with one last good question from another direction put him down for good with a hint hed gotten from wyatt hunt earlier while theyd been waiting for conleys car to pull up to stuarts house if we look sir and were going to were going to find that youve got a standing order prescription for amytriptilene arent we a long faraway look a thousandyard stare in the dead silent room jedd conley was done juhle watched the second hand on the wall clock move from two to five then to six seven when conley finally spoke it began in a whisper i had these incredible migraines for a year he said the doctor said it was probably stress a bitter little chortle escaped yeah doc what was your first clue you try being married to lexi to the whole fucking horace tremont family youll find out about stress soon enough christ conley hung his head you know whats funny whats that you know why i recommended roake to stuart why i handpicked her whys that because she never beat me in court never not once i think we did like fifteen trials against each other and i killed her every time can you believe that first time for everything jedd squeezed his temples rubbed his fingertips over the expanse of his forehead finally he looked across at juhle i dont know what got into her who caryn all of a sudden she wanted us to get married but that had never been in the plannot for me not for her we had a deal both of us with our unhappy marriages but hell that was the price id bought in for i knew what it would take this career it would take lexi and her goddamn father and his goddamn money but that would get me what i needed what i had to have and caryn knew that too at least she always had before that was our deal but she changed her mind friday she told me she had to see me she was divorcing stuart we needed to talk so you set up the date sunday it started out okay but shed had half the bottle by the time i got there and then the more she talked the more wound up she got she knew i loved her more than i loved lexi she couldnt live anymore the way shed been doing he looked pleadingly across at juhle she was going to tell lexi she told me that up front plus i saw it in her eyes she was going to do it then id be free and we could be together so you hit her i told her no she flew into a rage came at me with the bottle it was selfdefense i swear she fell and hit her head then she got in the hot tub i left i never thought shed drown that was an accident really i didnt hurt her at all juhle didnt move let him go on i just didnt want to be with her not that way conley shook his head miserably looking in vain for some sign of understanding or forgiveness from across the table goddammit he said not that way gina opened her eyes to poor focus in an unfamiliar room highceilinged brightly lit above though here where she lay the light somehow felt muted she closed her eyes again it was better with them closed acoustic guitar music was playing somewhere barely in the range of her hearing gradually she became aware that something felt funny about her face and her scalp but for a long moment she couldnt seem to place what it might be when it came back to her all in a rush she moved her hands up to the bandages then in a small panic tried to sit up far too quickly involuntarily she moaned sinking back into the bed footsteps approaching and then she dared open her eyes again wyatt her voice was cracked and dry her mouth tasted like blood she moves no she doesnt in fact she lay flat and immobile where am i then suddenly she jerked up again oh my god the hearing oh hands back to her head she gently lowered herself down onto the pillow wyatt sat down on the side of the bed the hearings been taken care of its over what do you mean i mean jedd conley confessed jedd confessed then the garage door opened you dont remember i never saw it i remember pushing the button then lights out he really confessed enough he said so many stupid things last night theyll probably get him on kelley too devin sweated him and he broke there you go i knew the guy was good for something hey be nice i thought i was being nice giving him all those extra chances to finally get it right closing her eyes again she took a few conscious breaths against the pain so how bad am i not too all things considered youll probably live then more seriously you really dont remember the whole nights kind of in and out a pause so how bad am i the diagnosis best guess is youve got a concussion plus a few really attractive stitches by your left eye youll be glad to know that the thread color they used coordinates nicely with the black eyes color coordination the secret to adult happiness well youve got it oh and youre supposed to take it easy the next few days that wont be too hard her eyes scanned the room so where am i my place you didnt want to stay in the hospital thats because i hate hospitals that became kind of clear was i difficult only a little but they really wanted to make sure thered be somebody to keep an eye on you in case you started dying or something so i volunteered its starting to come back she labored through a few more breaths what about stuart somebodys got to tell him already done devin was going to be on it is he out of jail by now he should be could you check please thats got to happen she started to raise herself from the bed if abrams tries to keep ahold of him wyatt put a hand on her shoulder gently pushing her back down easy easy ill find out if hes not out by lunchtime ill put diz on it itll happen promise with a last token show of reluctance she settled into the pillow again okay god my head hurts im not surprised you took a few pretty good hits he took a beat gina wyatt how did you get so sure it couldnt just have been their cars being the same no that really wasnt much of it actually it just turned the key then once i got past my ego i started to put the pieces together what did your ego have to do with it the corners of ginas mouth went up a fraction of an inch but she wasnt smiling everything wyatt everything after a pause she continued this isnt easy to talk about well then let it go its all right no its not i cant just let it go its smack in the middle of how i got it she drew a long slow breath hard as it was to deal with i had to accept the fact that in the real world jedd would never have called me in to handle a highprofile murder he knows every great lawyer in town and every one of em would be happy to do him a favor and i think i always knew that even when we were together he never really respected me as a lawyer i didnt realize you two had been together at all never seriously and a long time ago but thats a different story probably not worth telling the point is once i could accept that jedd didnt pick me to win the case the ugly truth finally dawned on methat hed picked me to lose it the bastard anyway once i realized that a few other things came back as significant i remembered your list of jedds appointments for example one of them at the haight street rape crisis center at hunts vacant look she prodded him sam duncans center wess sam right so i called her and found out she told wyatt that conleys talk at the rape crisis center had been about the daterape drug rohypnol conley told the story during his visit there that although this drug was of course illegal to prove how easily laws against it could be circumvented he had some male members of his sacramento staff pose as college students at one of the local campuses and return to his office the very next day with several doses hed then of course turned over his information and the drugs to the police except gina concluded it looks like he kept some of it but jedd even being around rohypnol was pretty damn compelling to me i just needed a connection to kelley to be sure so whatd you do i called stuart at the jail and what did he know he knew that jedd had come to see him in jail last week and that theyd talked at length about kelley rusnak as it turned out she told wyatt stuart knew that jedd himself owned a good chunk of pii stockcaryn had talked him into buying it so he wasnt merely helping caryn in her negotiations with the company out of altruism beyond that evidently jedd had convinced his fatherinlaw and some of his megarich friends that the stock was a cantmiss investment and many of them had invested heavily themselves gina didnt yet have a specific motive for jedd to have killed kelley maybe as caryns lab partner shed known about her and jedds affair maybe it was to nip her whistleblowing in the budbut the previously unknown pii connection was all the symmetry gina had needed it was jedd no doubt in my mind so it followed that he had to have a way to open the garage and what were you going to do if the garage didnt open she shrugged i knew you and juhle and some other cops would be there wyatt i underestimated the danger okay but only because i didnt plan on jedd getting so physical so fast but everything else was conjecture something i knew but couldnt prove without a way to open that garage door jedd walks so what i did was the only thing i could have done i had to take the risk i hate it when it gets to that me too so wyatt asked you think you could eat something maybe later for now maybe ill just close my eyes a little longer would that be okay it would be fine mostly now he went by the name of walden stuart gormans release from jail had been big news right through the weekend and walden wanted to give the story time to cool down before he took his action it wouldnt be wise to have hordes of journalists or even simply the curious lounging around in the street in front of stuarts house keeping tabs on the celebrity but walden didnt want it to be too long afterward either so that people might have already forgotten stuart who he was exactly what he stood for there would be one perfect window of opportunity and now two weeks to the day after the friday that stuart returned to his home walden considered the timing to be ideal as far as targets went stuart had gone from adequate back when he was merely a moderately popular outdoor writer to superba highvisibility media presence if you were ever really going to get your message out there to make a longterm difference you needed a vehicle like stuart gorman now although probably for not too much longer stuart was as close to a household name as he was ever going to get stuart walden had discovered in the past week was pretty much a creature of habit every morning he seemed to wake up at or near the same time every morning he came outside and picked up his morning newspaper off his steps last night the lights had gone off when they usually did around ten thirty so he was probably on his regular schedule if he was slightly off walden could always just come by tomorrow or the day after that it was a limited window of opportunity true but a day or so one way or the other wouldnt make any difference now just short of seven oclock in the morning walden sat at the curb peering through the fog at the front door of stuart gormans house his shotgun lay halfway across the passenger seat its muzzle down on the floor of the stolen honda accord walden had already rolled the passenger window down there was very little traffic on the street and no pedestrians suddenly the light came on over the front door and walden turned the ignition key then grabbed for the shotgun at the house the door opened and stuart with a coffee mug in his hand started down the steps one two three the newspaper was on the sixth step down walden had had a little trouble seeing it making sure it was already there when hed driven up hed even brought another paper to throw onto the steps just in case but no it had been there four five walden raised the barrel of the gun six he pulled the trigger thirtyeight citytalk by jeffrey elliott the police shootout and killing yesterday at the sausalito home of san rafael high school biology instructor enos crittenden added yet another bizarre chapter to the ongoing story that began last september with the hot tub drowning of dr caryn dryden the drama connected to this series of events continued through the assassination attempt on dr drydens husband the outdoor writer stuart gorman later in the fall by a shadowy figure only tentatively identified at the time variously as walden or as an email presence who signed off with the words thou shalt not kill also connected to this extraordinary chain of events has been the decertification by the fda of the dryden hip replacement socket several dozen subsequent lawsuits against its manufacturer polymer innovations inc pii the bankruptcy filing of pii and the suicide in february of that companys chief executive officer william blair with the trial of former california assemblyman jedd conley for the murders of dr dryden and kelley rusnak her lab assistant at pii scheduled to begin next week the storys eventual ramifications may endure for years to come yesterdays developments began about a week ago when one of crittendens students hacked into a private email site linked to his regular teachers website discovering threatening letters written to several prominent public figures as well as links to other websites dedicated to environmental terrorism the student informed first his parents and then the police when authorities appeared at san rafael high to question crittenden he fled leading police on a chase back to his home where he opened fire on them he held the swat team at bay for nearly an hour before a sniper bullet to his chest ended the standoff crittenden had a lengthy history of activism on animal rights and other green issues although no criminal record in his basement police discovered a large cache of weapons and ammunition as well as several boxes of literature on various environmental issues much more threateningly they discovered over pounds of the fertilizer ammonium nitrate and several gallons of the fuel oil nitromethane ingredients that had been used in the bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city in according to homeland security spokesman marshall brice plans on crittendens website indicated that he was planning to bomb a large target in san francisco to protest the sale of meat and meat products sources close to the investigation speaking under condition of anonymity have told this reporter that the intended target was the ferry building it also appears certain from books newspaper clippings emails and other material discovered in crittendens basement that it was he identifying himself as walden who had shotgunned and critically wounded stuart gorman in the days following the outdoor writers release from jail after charges that he had drowned his wife had been dropped in favor of assemblyman conley in a chilling bit of irony mr gorman who professes himself completely recovered from the assassination attempt although he still walks with a pronounced limp will be signing copies of new paperback editions of his three books reflections on a lake the mysterious stream and healed by water at this friday night at book passage in the ferry building gina waited back among the shelves until the other customers had gone there had been close to a hundred of them stuart remained seated alone at the small writing table pulling copies of his books over from the pile on his left and signing them one by one methodically moving them to a growing pile on the right as he finished finally she came up to him hey he broke a smile hey yourself id get up and give you a hug except im still having a little trouble with the hip how are you gina im good stuart how about you getting by its been a bit of a year in case you havent noticed yeah i read about the wedding too its kind of what made me decide to come down and say hi that and jeffs article reminding me im glad you did he shrugged its weird i cant seem to avoid making the news anymore beware of what you wish for i never thought you wanted fame no i never wanted money fame was all right fame opens doors its okay and hows debra shes good he shrugged perhaps with some embarrassment were good i never thought id marry my wifes sister but there you go i never thought id get tried for murder either you never did gina said he shrugged close enough anyway the whole debra thing shes been good with kymberly i never thought id say that either im starting to think there might be hope for her maybe even me getting shot wasnt all a bad thing it made her realize she could lose me too and she finally didnt want that shes even back at school thats good im glad to hear that it is good he said for a moment a silence built and youll be glad to hear ive finished the new book so you said you were here all along tonight i mean hiding out in the back i didnt want to get in the way of your talk its a little bit of a different title for you isnt it the imposter syndrome yeah breaking out of fishing psychology and into true selfhelp its a bit of a leap but my publisher thinks its a winner its the idea that came to me in the courtroom that day you know you remember i remember you getting it not what it was though well youll have to read the book but its all about figuring out why i felt like i had to keep protecting kym instead of confronting her and trying to help her deal with her problems it was because i couldnt really do anything else except write and writings one of those thingssometimes you lose the sense that it has any real intrinsic value so if i cant do anything else and what i can do doesnt have any real quantitative worth what became important was the illusion that i was at least a good father raising a successful child is something you can point at that youve done but you are a successful writer and it sounds like youre on the way to having raised a successful child well lets hope he said maybe anyway the book takes off from there and goes off on my usual tangents i got something out of writing it and thats whats important that and keeping things together with the family suddenly remembering he squinted up at her and hows your writing going still at it actually gina couldnt keep some pride out of her voice i just finished mine too its probably no good but i least i got to the end thats the hardest part now you just go back and fix everything you dont like gina laughed thats all huh pretty much but ill bet you wont need to do too much not if you did trial scenes like you did at my hearing well thats nice of you to say but well see anyway i just had to come down and make sure you were okay and say hi im so happy for you you deserve a little peace and the only reason ive got any is because of you dont think i dont realize that gina looked down at her former client she reached out and touched his shoulder take care of yourself stuart stay out of trouble dont worry he said thats my new motto gina had started on the vigorous circle hike around the lake at a little after noon and now coming into sight of her camp the sun was just about to go down behind the mountains her critic was still sitting where shed left him three hours ago the stack of pages next to him telling her practiced eye that he was probably getting pretty close to the end no way was she going to interrupt him now so she cut off the trail and walked down to the lake she stood still for several minutes on the shoreline drinking in the beauty around her never tiring of its ability to refresh and nourish her then sitting on a boulder she undid her shoelaces and pulled off her hiking boots and socks hot and sweaty she unbuttoned her shirt and dropped it and her shorts to the ground then got rid of her underwear the first few steps into the cold water were shocking as they always were but she walked through the shallows grinning like an idiot until it was deep enough to let her dive she stayed underwater eyes open for as long as she could pushing the water behind her with strong and broad strokes skimming over the seaweed hoping to catch sight of a trout when she came back up she treaded water for a second and gloried in another eyeful of wilderness but with the water temperature under fifty degrees she couldnt stay in it too long so she went under again and pulled for shore when she got to where she knew she could stand she stopped and surfaced he was standing on the shore holding her pages its great he said you really think so she was coming toward him i want the real truth i just gave you the real truth its fantastic i couldnt put it down its really good gina i mean it she was out of the water now standing right in front of him youre not just saying it because youre hoping im going to let you kiss me are you would that work no id be able to tell you were lying but im not lying all right then wyatt hunt she said then you can kiss me acknowledgments writing and publishing a book is not so solitary an endeavor it takes a whole lot of friends advisors helpers editorial and marketing folks im very fortunate that the whole gang working and interacting in various ways on my books takes such a proprietary and committed role in the finished product this time out i had some early critical story help id like to specially acknowledge from bob zaro who gave me the initial idea that hit the starter button also right at the beginning michael w chapman md gave me some great medical insights as well as an insiders perspective on some of californias alpine lakes for other medical and business issues that turn up in the book id like to thank john chuck oliver stanton and his partner peter kolbeck mark detzer phd and his bride kathryn lescroart detzer and of course my continuing guru for medical overview and martini mixing peter s dietrich md mph even with all this help errors sometimes have their way of creeping into the text and if they do they are all entirely the fault and responsibility of the author closer to home my children justine and jack continue to inform every part of my creative process anita boone assistant extraordinaire does everything and more perfectly every time rick montgomery helps keep the passion going for writing music food and most of the other good things in life frank and gina seidl keep the party going don matheson perennial best man livens up many and many a day my great friend the brilliant writer max byrd is a constant source of inspiration wisdom and advice karen hlavacek once again did her proofreading magic with the galleys tom hedtke and vicki lorini make sure i dont forget that its okay even good to be a working writer in a competitive world tom steinstra fishing buddy television star and not so incidentally outdoor author and writer for the san francisco chronicle men love him fish fear him was a huge inspiration for this particular book obviously stuart gorman and tom are nowhere near the same person but i can honestly say that if i didnt know tom there would have been no stuart so thanks tomyour very existence helped me get it all off the ground as always al giannini is my main collaborator im not a lawyer and these books wouldnt be technically accurate if it werent for als devotion insight brains and just plain hard work additionally hes there for those pesky everyday questions without which the book simply couldnt progress my
