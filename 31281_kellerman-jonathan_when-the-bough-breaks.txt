jonathan kellerman when the bough breaks alex delaware it was shaping up as a beautiful morning the last thing i wanted to hear about was murder a cool pacific current had swept its way across the coastline for two days running propelling the pollution to pasadena my house is nestled in the foothills just north of bel air situated atop an old bridle path that snakes its way around beverly glen where opulence gives way to self conscious funk its a neighborhood of porsches and coyotes bad sewers and sequestered streams the place itself is eighteen hundred square feet of silvered redwood weathered shingles and tinted glass in the suburbs it might be a shack up here in the hills its a rural retreat nothing fancy but lots of terraces decks pleasing angles and visual surprises the house had been designed by and for a hungarian artist who went broke trying to peddle oversized poly chromatic triangles to the galleries on la cienega arts loss had been my gain by way of la probate court on a good day like today the place came with an ocean view a cerulean patch that peeked timidly above the palisades i had slept alone with the windows open burglars and neomansonites be damned and awoke at ten naked covers thrown to the floor in the midst of some forgotten dream feeling lazy and sated i propped myself on my elbows drew up the covers and stared at the caramel layers of sunlight streaming through french doors what finally got me up was the invasion of a housefly who alternated between searching my sheets for carrion and dive bombing my head i shuffled to the bathroom and began filling a tub then made my way to the kitchen to scavenge taking the fly with me i put up coffee and the fly and i shared an onion bagel ten twenty on a monday morning with nowhere to go and nothing to do oh blessed decadence it had been almost half a year since my premature retirement and i was still amazed at how easy it was to make the transition from compulsive overachiever to self indulgent bum obviously id had it in me from the beginning i returned to the bathroom sat on the rim of the tub munching and drew up a vague plan for the day a leisurely soak a cursory scan of the morning paper perhaps a jog down the canyon and back a shower a visit to the doorbell jarred me out of my reverie i tied a towel around my waist and walked to the front entry in time to see milo let himself in it was unlocked he said closing the door hard and tossing the times on the sofa he stared at me and i drew the towel tighter good morning nature boy i motioned him in you really should lock the door my friend ive got files at the station that illustrate nicely what happens to people who dont good morning milo i padded into the kitchen and poured two cups of coffee milo followed me like a lumbering shadow opened the refrigerator and took out a plate of cold pizza that i had no recollection of ever owning he tailed me back to the living room collapsed on my old leather sofa an artifact of the abandoned office on wilshire balanced the plate on his thigh and stretched out his legs i turned off the bathwater and settled opposite him on a camels king ottoman milo is a big man six two two twenty with a big mans way of going loose and dangly when he gets off his feet this morning he looked like an oversized rag doll slumped against the cushions a doll with a broad pleasant face almost boyish except for the acne pits that peppered the skin and the tired eyes the eyes were startlingly green and rimmed with red topped by shaggy dark brows and a kennedyesque shock of thick black hair his nose was large and high bridged his lips full childishly soft sideburns five years out of date trailed down the scarred cheeks as usual he wore ersatz brooks brothers olive green gabardine suit yellow button down mint and gold rep stripe tie oxblood wing tips the total effect was as preppy as w c fields in red skivvies he ignored me and concentrated on the pizza so glad you could make it for breakfast when his plate was empty he asked so how are you doing pal i was doing great what can i do for you milo who says i want you to do anything he brushed crumbs from his lap to the rug maybe this is a social call you waltzing in unannounced with that bloodhound look all over your face isnt a social call such intuitive powers he ran his hands over his face as if washing without water i need a favor he said take the car i wont be needing it until late afternoon no its not that this time i need your professional services that gave me pause youre out of my age range i said besides im out of the profession im not kidding alex ive got one of your colleagues lying on a slab at the morgue fellow by the name of morton handler i knew the name not the face handlers a psychiatrist psychiatrist psychologist minor semantic distinction at this point what he is is dead throat slashed a little bit of evisceration tossed in along with a lady friend same treatment for her but worse sexual mutilation nose sliced off the place where it happened his place was an abattoir abattoir milos masters degree in american lit asserting itself i put down my coffee cup okay milo ive lost my appetite now tell me what all of that has to do with me he went on as if he hadnt heard me i got called on it at five am ive been knee deep in blood and crud since then it stunk in there people smell bad when they die im not talking decay this is the stench that sets in before decay i thought i was used to it every so often i catch another whiff and it gets me right here he poked himself in the belly five in the morning i left an irritated lover in bed my head feels ready to implode gobs of flesh at five in the morning jesus he stood and looked out the window gazing out over the tops of pines and eucalyptus from where i sat i could see smoke rising in indolent swirls from a distant fireplace its really nice up here alex does it ever bore you being in paradise with nothing to do not a hint of ennui yeah i guess not you dont want to hear any more about handler and the girl stop playing passive aggressive milo and spit it out he turned and looked down at me the big ugly face showed new signs of fatigue im depressed alex he held out his empty cup like some overgrown slack jawed oliver twist which is why ill tolerate more of this disgusting swill i took the cup and got him a refill he gulped it audibly weve got a possible witness a kid who lives in the same building shes pretty confused not sure what she saw i took one look at her and thought of you you could talk to her maybe try a little hypnosis to enhance her memory dont you have behavioral sciences for that he reached into his coat pocket and took out a handful of polaroids look at these beauties i gave the pictures a seconds glance what i saw turned my stomach i returned them quickly for gods sake dont show me stuff like that some mess huh blood and crud he drained his cup lifting it high to catch every last drop behavioral science is cut down to one guy whos kept busy weeding weirdos out of the department next priority is counseling the weirdos who slip through if i put in an application for this kind of thing ill get a request to fill out another application form they dont want to do it on top of that they dont know anything about kids you do i dont know anything about homicide forget homicide thats my problem talk to a seven year old i hesitated he held out his hands the palms were white well scrubbed hey im not expecting a total freebie ill buy you lunch theres a fair to middling italian place with surprisingly good gnocchi not far from the not far from the abattoir i grimaced no thanks anyway i cant be bought for noodles so what can i offer you by way of a bribe youve got everything the house in the hills the fancy car the ralph lauren gear with jogging shoes to match christ youve got retirement at thirty three and a goddamn perpetual tan just talking about it is getting me pissed yes but am i happy i suspect so youre right i thought of the grisly photos and im certainly not in need of a free pass to the grand guignol you know he said ill bet underneath all of that mellow is a bored young man crap crap nothing how long has it been six months five and a half five and a half then when i met you correct that soon after i met you you were a vibrant guy high energy lots of opinions your mind was working now all i hear about is hot tubs how fast you run your goddamned mile the different kinds of sunset you can see from your deck to use your jargon its regression cutesy poo short pants roller skating water play like half the people in this city youre functioning on a six year old level i laughed and youre making me this offer to get involved in blood and crud as a form of occupational therapy alex you can break your ass trying to achieve nirvana through inertia but it wont work its like that woody alien line you mellow too much you ripen and rot i slapped my bare chest no signs of decay yet its internal comes from within breaks through when youre least expecting it thank you doctor sturgis he gave me a disgusted look went into the kitchen and returned with his mouth buried in a pear sgood youre welcome all right alex forget it ive got this dead psychiatrist and this gutierrez girl hacked up ive got a seven year old who thinks she might have seen or heard something except shes too damned scared to make any sense of it i ask you for two hours of your time and time is one thing youve got plenty of and i get bullshit hold on i didnt say i wouldnt do it you have to give me time to assimilate this i just woke up and you barge in and drop double homicide on me he shot his wrist out from under his shirt cuff and peered at his timex ten thirty seven poor baby he glared at me and chomped into the pear getting juice on his chin anyway you might recall that the last time i had anything to do with police business it was traumatic hickle was a fluke and you were a victim of sorts im not interested in getting you involved in this just an hour or two talking to a little kid like i said some hypnosis if it looks right then we eat gnocchi i return to my place and try to reclaim my amour youre free to go back to spaceout castle here finis in a week we get together for a pure social time a little sashimi down in japtown okay what did the kid actually see i asked and watched my relaxing day fly out the window shadows voices two guys maybe three but who really knows shes a little kid shes totally traumatized the mothers just as scared and she impresses me as a lady who was no nuclear physicist in the first place i didnt know how to approach her alex i tried to be nice go easy it would have been helpful to have a juvie officer there but there arent too many of those any more the department would rather keep three dozen pencil pushing deputy chiefs around he gnawed the pear down to the core shadows voices thats it youre the language specialist right you know how to communicate with the little ones if you can get her to open up great if she comes forth with anything resembling an id fantastic if not thems the breaks and at least we tried language specialist it had been a while since id used the phrase back in the aftermath of the hickle affair when id found myself suddenly spinning out of control the faces of stuart hickle and all the kids hed harmed marching through my head milo had taken me drinking at about two in the morning he had wondered out loud why the kids had let it go on for so long they didnt talk because nobody knew how to listen id said they thought it was their fault anyway yeah he looked up bleary eyed gripping his stein with both hands i hear stuff like that from the juvie gals thats the way they think when theyre little egocentric like theyre the center of the world mommy slips breaks a leg they blame themselves how long does it last in some people it never goes away for the rest of us its a gradual process by eight or nine we see things more clearly but at any age an adult can manipulate kids convince them its their fault assholes muttered milo so how do you get their heads straight you have to know how kids think at different ages developmental stages you talk their language you become a language specialist thats what you do thats what i do a few minutes later he asked you think guilt is bad not necessarily its part of what holds us together too much though can cripple he nodded yeah i like that shrinks always seem to be saying guilt is a no no your approach i can buy i tell you we could use a lot more guilt the worlds full of fucked up savages at that moment he got no argument from me we talked a bit more the alcohol tugged at our consciousness and we started to laugh then cry the bartender stopped polishing his glasses and stared it had been a low a seriously low period in my life and i remembered whod been there to help me through it i watched milo nibble at the last specks of pear with curiously small sharp teeth two hours i asked at the most give me an hour or so to get ready clear up some business having convinced me to help him didnt seem to cheer him up he nodded and exhaled wearily all right ill give a run down to the station and do my business another consultation of the timex noon fine he walked to the door opened it stepped out on the balcony and tossed the pear core over the railing and into the greenery below starting down the stairs he stopped mid landing and looked up at me the suns glare hit his ravaged face and turned it into a pale mask for a moment i was afraid he was going to get sentimental i neednt have worried listen alex as long as youre staying here can i borrow the caddy that he pointed accusingly at the ancient fiat is giving out now its the starter bull you just love my car i went into the house got the spare keys and threw them at him he fielded them like dusty baker unlocked the seville and squirmed in adjusting the seat to accommodate his long legs the engine started immediately purring with vigor looking like a sixteen year old going to his first prom in daddys wheels he cruised down the hill my life had been frantic ever since adolescence a straight a student i started college at sixteen worked my way through school free lancing as a guitarist and churned through the doctoral program in clinical psychology at ucla earning a phd at twenty four i accepted an internship up north at the langley porter institute then returned to la to complete a postdoctoral fellowship at western pediatric medical center once out of training i took a staff position at the hospital and a simultaneous professorship at the medical school affiliated with western peds i saw lots of patients and published lots of papers by twenty eight i was an associate professor of pediatrics and psychology and director of a support program for medically ill youngsters i had a title too long for my secretaries to memorize and i kept publishing constructing a paper tower within which i dwelled case studies controlled experiments surveys monographs textbook chapters and an esoteric volume of my own on the psychological effects of chronic disease in children the status was great the pay less so i began to moonlight seeing private patients in an office rented from a beverly hills analyst my patient load increased until i was putting in seventy hours a week and running between hospital and office like a deranged worker ant i entered the world of tax avoidance after discovering that without write offs and shelters id be paying out to the irs more than i used to consider a healthy yearly income i hired and fired accountants bought california real estate before the boom sold at scandalous profits bought more i became an apartment house manager another five to ten hours a week i supported a battalion of service personnel gardeners plumbers painters and electricians i received lots of calendars at christmas by the age of thirty two i had a non stop regimen of working to the point of exhaustion grabbing a few hours of fitful sleep and getting up to work some more i grew a beard to save five minutes shaving time in the morning when i remembered to eat the food came out of hospital vending machines and i stuffed my mouth while zipping down the corridors white coat flapping notepad in hand like some impassioned speed freak i was a man with a mission albeit a mindless one was successful there was little time for romance in such a life i engaged in occasional carnal liaisons frenzied and meaningless with nurses female interns graduate students and social workers not to forget the fortyish leggy blond secretary not my type at all had i taken the time to think who captivated me for twenty minutes of thrashing behind the chart stuffed shelves of the medical records room by day it was committee meetings paperwork trying to quell petty staff bickering and more paperwork by night it was facing the tide of parental complaints that the child therapist grows accustomed to and providing comfort and support to the young ones caught in the crossfire in my spare time i received tenants gripes scanned the wall street journal to measure my gains and losses and sorted through mountains of mail most of it it seemed from white collared white toothed smoothies who had ways of making me instantly rich i was nominated as an outstanding young man by an outfit hoping to sell me their hundred dollar leather bound directory of similarly honored individuals in the middle of the day there were times suddenly when i found it hard to breathe but i brushed it off too busy for introspection into this maelstrom stepped stuart hickle hickle was a quiet man a retired lab technician he looked the part of the kindly neighbor on a situation comedy tall stooped fiftyish fond of cardigans and old briar pipes his tortoise shell horn rims perched atop a thin pinched nose shielding kindly eyes the color of dishwater he had a benign smile and avuncular mannerisms he also had an unhealthy appetite for fondling little childrens privates when the police finally got him they confiscated over five hundred color photographs of hickle having his way with scores of two three four and five year olds boys and girls white black hispanic in matters of gender and race he wasnt picky only age and helplessness concerned him when i saw the photos it wasnt the graphic starkness that got to me though that was repulsive in its own right it was the look in the kids eyes a terrified yet knowing vulnerability it was a look that said know this is wrong why is this happening to me the look was in every snapshot on the face of the youngest victim it personified violation it gave me nightmares hickle had unique access to little children his wife a korean orphan whom hed met as a gi in seoul ran a successful day care center in affluent brentwood kims korner had a solid reputation as one of the best places to leave your children when you had to work or play or just be alone it had been in business for a decade when the scandal broke and despite the evidence there were plenty of people who refused to believe that the school had served as a haven for one mans pedophilic rituals the school had been a cheerful looking place occupying a large two story house on a quiet residential street not far from ucla in its last year it had cared for over forty children most of them from affluent families a large proportion of kim hickles charges had been very young because she was one of the few day care operators to accept children not yet toilet trained the house had a basement a rarity in earthquake country and the police spent a considerable amount of time in that damp cavernous room they found an old army cot a refrigerator a rusty sink and five thousand dollars worth of photographic equipment particular scrutiny was given to the cot for it served up a host of fascinating forensic details hair blood sweat and semen the media latched on to the hickle case with predictable vigor this was a juicy one that played on everyones primal fears evoking memories of the cosmic bogeyman the evening news featured kim hickle fleeing a mob of reporters hands over face she protested her ignorance there was no evidence of her complicity so they closed the school down took away her license and left it at that she filed for divorce and departed for parts unknown i had my doubts about her innocence id seen enough of these cases to know that the wives of child molesters often played a role explicit or covert in setting up the dirty deed usually these were women who found sex and physical intimacy abhorrent and in order to get out of conjugal chores they helped find substitute partners for their men it could be a cold cruel parody of a harem joke id seen one case where the father had been bedding three of his daughters on a scheduled basis with mom drawing up the schedule it was also hard to believe that kim hickle had been playing legos with the kids while downstairs stuart was molesting them nevertheless they let her go hickle himself was thrown to the wolves the tv cameras didnt miss a shot there were lots of instant mini specials filled with interviews with the more vocal of my colleagues and several editorials about the rights of children the hoopla lasted two weeks then the story lost its appeal and was replaced by reports of other atrocities foe there was no lack of nasty stories in la the city spawned ugliness like a predatory insect spewing out blood hungry larvae i was consulted on the case three weeks after the arrest it was a back page story now and someone got to thinking about the victims the victims were going through hell the children woke up screaming in the middle of the night toddlers whod been toilet trained started to wet and soil themselves formerly quiet well behaved kids began to hit kick and bite without provocation there were lots of stomach aches and ambiguous physical symptoms reported as well as the classic signs of depression loss of appetite listlessness withdrawal feelings of worthlessness the parents were racked with guilt and shame seeing or imagining the accusing glances of family and friends husbands and wives turned on each other some of them spoiled the victimized children increasing the youngsters insecurity and infuriating the siblings later several brothers and sisters were able to admit that theyd wished theyd been molested in order to be eligible for special treatment then theyd felt guilty about those thoughts entire families were coming apart much of their suffering obscured by the public blood lust for hickles head the families might have been permanently shunted to obscurity saddled with their confusion guilt and fear but for the fact that the great aunt of one of the victims was a philanthropic member of the board of western pediatric medical center she wondered out loud why the hell the hospital wasnt doing anything and where was the institutions sense of public service anyway the chairman of the board salaamed and simultaneously saw the chance to grab some good press the last story about western peds had exposed salmonella in the cafeterias cole slaw so positive pr was mighty welcome the medical director issued a press release announcing a psychological rehabilitation program for the victims of stuart hickle with me as therapist my first inkling of being appointed was reading about it in the times when i got to his office the next morning i was ushered in immediately the director a pediatric surgeon who hadnt operated in twenty years and had acquired the smugness of a well fed bureaucrat sat behind a gleaming desk the size of a hockey field and smiled whats going on henry i held up the newspaper sit down alex i was just about to call you the board decided youd be perfect pluperfect for the job some urgency was called for im flattered the board remembered the beautiful work you did with the brownings brownells yes whatever the five brownell youngsters had survived a light plane crash in the sierras that had killed their parents theyd been physically and psychologically traumatized over exposed half starved amnesiac mute id worked with them for two months and the papers had picked up on it you know alex the director was saying sometimes in the midst of trying to synthesize the high technology and heroics that comprise so much of modern medicine one loses sight of the human factor it was a great little speech i hoped hed remember it when budget time rolled around next year he went on stroking me talking about the need for the hospital to be in the forefront of humanitarian endeavors then smiled and leaned forward also i imagine thered be significant research potential in all of this at least two or three publications by june june was when i came up for full professorship the director was on the tenure committee at the medical school henry i believe youre appealing to my baser instincts perish the thought he winked slyly our main interest is helping those poor poor children he shook his head a truly repugnant affair the man should be castrated a surgeons justice i threw myself with customary monomania into designing the treatment program i received permission to run the therapy sessions in my private office after promising that western peds would get all the credit my goals were to help the families express the feelings that had been locked inside since hickles subterranean rites had been exposed and to help them share those feelings with each other in order to see that they werent alone the therapy was designed as an intensive six week program using groups the kids parents siblings and multiple families as well as individual sessions as needed eighty percent of the families signed up and no one dropped out we met at night in my suite on wilshire when the building was quiet and empty there were nights when i left the sessions physically and emotionally drained after hearing the anguish pour out like blood from a gaping wound dont let anyone ever tell you different psychotherapy is one of the most taxing endeavors known to mankind ive done all sorts of work from picking carrots in the scorching sun to sitting on national committees in paneled boardrooms and theres nothing that compares to confronting human misery hour after hour and bearing the responsibility for easing that misery using only ones mind and mouth at its best its tremendously uplifting as you watch the patient open up breathe let go of the pain at its worst its like surfing in a cesspool struggling for balance while being slapped with wave after putrid wave the treatment worked sparkle returned to the kids eyes the families reached out and helped each other gradually my role diminished to that of silent observer a few days before the last session i received a call from a reporter for national medical news a throwaway for physicians his name was bill roberts he was in town and wanted to interview me the piece would be for practicing pediatricians to alert them to the issue of child molestation it sounded like a worthy project and i agreed to meet him it was seven thirty in the evening when i nosed my car out of the hospital parking lot and headed westward traffic was light and i reached the black granite and glass tower that housed my office by eight i parked in the subterranean garage walked through double glass doors into a lobby that was silent save for muzak and rode the elevator to the sixth floor the doors slid open i made my way down the corridor turned a corner and stopped there was nobody waiting for me which was unusual because id always found reporters to be punctual i approached my office door and saw a stiletto of light slashed diagonally across the floor the door was ajar perhaps an inch i wondered if the night cleaning crew had let roberts in if so id have a talk with the building manager over that breach of security when i reached the door i knew something was wrong there were scratch marks around the knob metal filings in the rug yet as if working from a script i entered mr roberts the waiting room was empty i went into the consultation office the man on my sofa wasnt bill roberts id never met him but i knew him very well stuart hickle slumped in the soft cotton cushions his head what was left of it was propped against the wall the eyes staring vacantly at the ceiling his legs splayed out spastically one hand rested near a wet spot on his groin he had an erection the veins in his neck stood out in has relief his other hand lay limply across his chest one finger hooked around the trigger of an ugly little blue steel pistol the gun dangled butt downward the muzzle an inch from hickles open mouth there were bits of brain blood and bone on the wall behind the head a crimson splotch decorated the soft green print of the wallpaper like a childs finger painting more crimson ran out of the nose the ears and the mouth the room smelled of firecrackers and human waste i dialed the phone the coroners verdict was death by suicide the final version went something like this hickle had been profoundly depressed since his arrest and unable to bear the public humiliation of a trial hed taken the samurai way out it was he as bill roberts whod set up the appointment with me he whod picked the lock and blown his brains out when the police played me tapes of his confession the voice did sound similar to that of roberts at least similar enough to prevent my saying it wasnt a match as for why hed chosen my office for his swan song the supporting cast of shrinks had an easy answer because of my role as the victims therapist i was a symbolic father figure undoing the damage hed perpetrated his death was an equally symbolic gesture of repentance finis but even suicides especially those connected with felonies must be investigated the loose ends tied up and there began a buck passing contest between the beverly hills police department and lapd beverly hills acknowledged the suicide had taken place on their turf but claimed that it was an extension of the original crimes which had occurred in west la division territory punt west la would have liked to kick it back but the case was still in the papers and the last thing the department wanted was a dereliction of duties story so west la got stuck with it specifically homicide detective milo bernard sturgis got stuck with it i didnt start to have problems until a week after finding hickles body a normal delay because i was denying the whole thing and was more than a little numb since as a psychologist i was presumed able to handle such things no one thought to inquire after my welfare i held myself in check when facing the children and their families creating a facade that was calm knowledgeable and accepting i looked in control in therapy we talked about hickles death with an emphasis upon them upon how they were coping the last session was a party during which the families thanked me hugged me and gave me a framed print of braggs the psychologist it was a good party lots of laughter and mess on the carpet as they rejoiced at getting better and in part at the death of their tormentor i got home close to midnight and crawled between the covers feeling hollow cold and helpless like an orphaned child on an empty road the next morning the symptoms began i grew fidgety and had trouble concentrating the episodes of labored breathing increased and intensified i became unaccountably anxious had a constantly queasy feeling in my gut and suffered from premonitions of death patients began asking me if i was all right at that point i must have been noticeably troubled because it takes a lot to shift a patients focus away from himself i had enough education to know what was going on but not enough insight to make sense of it it wasnt finding the body for i was used to shocking events but the discovery of hickles corpse was a catalyst that plunged me into a full fledged crisis looking back now i can see that treating his victims had allowed me to step off the treadmill for six weeks and that the end of treatment had left me with time to engage in the dangerous pastime of self evaluation i didnt like what i learned i was alone isolated without a single real friend in the world for almost a decade the only humans id related to had been patients and patients by definition were takers not givers the feelings of loneliness grew painful i turned further inward and became profoundly depressed i called in sick to the hospital canceled my private patients and spent days in bed watching soap operas the sound and lights of the tv washed over me like some vile paralytic drug deadening but not healing i ate little and slept too much felt heavy weak and useless i kept the phone off the hook and never left the house except to shove the junk mail inside the door and retreat to solitude on the eighth day of this funereal existence milo appeared at the door wanting to ask me questions he held a notepad in his hands just like an analyst only he didnt look like an analyst a big droopy shaggy haired fellow in slept in clothes dr alex delaware he held up his badge yes he introduced himself and stared at me i was dressed in a ratty yellow bathrobe my untrimmed beard had reached rabbinic proportions and my hair looked like electrified brillo despite thirteen hours of sleep i looked and felt drowsy i hope im not disturbing you doctor your office referred me to your home number which was out of order i let him in and he sat down scanning the place foot high stacks of unopened mail littered the dining room table the house was dark drapes drawn and smelled stale days of our lives flickered on the tube he rested his notepad on one knee and told me the interview was a formality for the coroners inquest then he had me rehash the night id found the body interrupting to clarify a point scratching and jotting and staring it was tediously procedural and my mind wandered often so that he had to repeat his questions sometimes i talked so softly he asked me to repeat my answers after twenty minutes he asked doctor are you all right im fine unconvincingly oka ay he shook his head asked a few more questions then put his pencil down and laughed nervously you know i feel kind of funny asking a doctor how he feels dont worry about it he resumed questioning me and even through the haze i could see he had a curious technique hed skip from topic to topic with no apparent line of inquiry it threw me off balance and made me more alert youre an assistant professor at the medical school associate pretty young to be an associate professor arent you im thirty two i started young uh huh how many kids in the treatment program about thirty parents maybe ten eleven couples half a dozen single parents any talk about mr hickle in treatment thats confidential of course sir you ran the treatment as part of your job at he consulted his notes western pediatric hospital it was volunteer work associated with the hospital you didnt get paid for it i continued to receive my salary and the hospital relieved me of other duties there were fathers in the treatment groups too yes i thought id mentioned couples some of those guys were pretty mad at mr hickle i guess mr hickle only a policeman could be so artificially polite as to call a dead pervert sir between themselves they used other terms i supposed insufferable etiquette was a way of keeping the barrier between cop and civilian thats confidential detective he grinned as if to say cant blame a fella for trying and scribbled in his notepad why so many questions about a suicide just routine he answered automatically without looking up i like to be thorough he stared at me absently then asked did you have any help running the groups i encouraged the families to participate to help themselves i was the only professional peer counseling exactly weve got it in the department now noncommittal so they kind of took over gradually i was always there did any of them have a key to your office aha absolutely not youre thinking one of those people killed hickle and faked it to look like suicide of course he was the same suspicion had occurred to me im not drawing conclusions just investigating this guy was elusive enough to be an analyst i see abruptly he stood closed his pad and put his pencil away i rose to walk him to the door teetered and blacked out the first thing i saw when things came back into focus was his big ugly face looming over me i felt damp and cold he was holding a washcloth that dripped water on to my face you fainted how do you feel fine the last thing i felt was fine you dont look wonderful maybe i should call a doctor doctor no you sure no its nothing ive had the flu for a few days i just need to get something in my stomach he went into the kitchen and came back with a glass of orange juice i sipped slowly and started to feel stronger i sat up and held the glass myself thank you i said to protect and serve im really fine now if you dont have any more questions no nothing more at this time he got up and opened some windows the light hurt my eyes he turned off the tv want something to eat before i go what a strange motherly man ill be fine okay doctor you take care now i was eager to see him go but when the sound of his car engine was no longer audible i felt disoriented not depressed like before but agitated restless without peace i tried watching as the world turns but couldnt concentrate now the inane dialogue annoyed me i picked up a book but the words wouldnt come into focus i took a swallow of orange juice and it left a bad taste in my mouth and a stabbing pain in my throat i went out on the patio and looked up at the sky until luminescent discs danced in front of my eyes my skin itched bird songs irritated me i couldnt sit still it went on that way the entire afternoon miserable at four thirty he called dr delaware this is milo sturgis detective sturgis what can i do for you detective how are you feeling much better thank you thats good there was a silence uh doctor im kind of on shaky ground here whats on your mind you know i was in the medical corps in viet nam we used to see a lot of something called acute stress reaction i was wondering if you think thats what ive got well what was the prescribed treatment in viet nam we got them back into action as quickly as possible the more they avoided combat the worse they got do you think thats what i should do jump back into the swing of things i cant say doctor im no psychologist youll diagnose but you wont treat okay doctor just wanted to see if no wait im sorry i appreciate your calling i was confused wondering what ulterior motive he could possibly have yeah sure no problem thanks really youd make a hell of a shrink detective he laughed thats sometimes part of the job sir after he hung up i felt better than id felt in days the next morning i called him at the west la division headquarters and offered to buy him a drink we met at angelas across from the west la station on santa monica boulevard it was a coffee shop with a smoky cocktail lounge in the back populated by several groupings of large solemn men i noticed that few of them acknowledged milo which seemed unusual i had always thought cops did a lot of backslapping and good natured cussing after hours these men took their drinking seriously and quietly he had great potential as a therapist he sipped chivas sat back and let me talk no more interrogation now he listened and i spilled my guts by the end of the evening though he was talking too over the next couple of weeks milo and i found out that we had a lot in common we were about the same age he was ten months older and had been born into working class families in medium sized towns his father had been a steelworker mine an electrical assembler he too had been a good student graduating with honors from purdue and with an ma in literature from indiana u bloomington hed planned to be a teacher when he was drafted two years in viet nam had somehow turned him into a policeman not that he considered his job at odds with his intellectual pursuits homicide detectives he informed me were the intellectuals of any police department investigating murder requires little physical activity and lots of brain work veteran homicide men sometimes violate regulations and dont carry a weapon just lots of pens and pencils milo packed his but confessed that he really didnt need it its very white collar alex with lots of paperwork decision making attention to detail he liked being a cop enjoyed catching bad guys sometimes he thought he might like to try something else but exactly what that something else was wasnt clear we had other interests in common wed both done some martial arts training milo had taken a mixed bag of self defense courses while in the army id learned fencing and karate while in graduate school we were miserably out of shape but deluded ourselves that it would all come back if we needed it both of us appreciated good food good music and the virtues of solitude the rapport between us developed quickly about three weeks after wed known each other he told me he was homosexual i was taken by surprise and had nothing to say im telling you now because i dont want you to think ive been trying to put the make on you suddenly i was ashamed because that had been my initial thought exactly it was hard to accept at first his being gay despite all my supposed psychological sophistication i know all the facts that they make up to percent of virtually any human grouping that most of them look just like me and you that they could be anybody the butcher the baker the local homicide dick that most of them are reasonably well adjusted and yet the stereotypes adhere to the brain you expect them to be mincing screaming nelly fairies leather armored shaven skull demons oh so preppy mustachioed young things in izod shirts and khaki trousers or hiking booted bulldykes milo didnt look homosexual but he was and had been comfortable with it for several years he wasnt in the closet neither did he flaunt it i asked him if the department knew about it uh huh not in the sense of filing an official report its just something thats known how do they treat you disapproval from a distance cold looks but basically its live and let live theyre short staffed and im good what do they want to drag in the aclu and lose a good detective in the bargain ed davis was a homophobe hes gone and its not so bad what about the other detectives he shrugged they leave me alone we talk business we dont double date now the lack of recognition by the men at angelas made sense some of milos initial altruism his reaching out to help me was a little more understandable too he knew what it was like to be alone a gay cop was a person in limbo you could never be one of the gang back at the station no matter how well you did your job and the homosexual community was bound to be suspicious of someone who looked acted like and was a cop i figured i should tell you since we seem to be getting friendly its no big deal milo no no i wasnt really all that comfortable with it but i was damn well going to work on it a month after stuart hickle stuck a in his mouth and blasted his brains all over my wallpaper i made some major changes in my life i resigned my job at western pediatric and closed down my practice i referred all my patients to a former student a first rate therapist who was starting out in practice and needed the business i had taken very few new referrals since starting the groups for the kims korner families so there was less separation anxiety than would normally be expected i sold an apartment building in malibu forty units that id purchased seven years before for a large profit i also let go of a duplex in santa monica part of the money the portion that would eventually go to taxes i put in a high yield money market the rest went into tax free municipals it wasnt the kind of investing that would make me richer but it would provide financial stability i figured i could live off the interest for two or three years as long as i didnt get too extravagant i sold my old chevy two and bought a seville a seventy nine the last year they looked good it was forest green with a saddle colored leather interior that was cushy and quiet with the amount of driving id be doing the lousy mileage wouldnt make much difference i threw away most of my old clothes and got new stuff mostly soft fabrics knits cords rubber soled shoes cashmere sweaters robes shorts and pullovers i had the pipes cleaned out on the hot tub that id never used since i bought the house i started to buy food and drink milk i pulled my old martin out of its case and strummed it on the balcony i listened to records i read for pleasure for the first time since high school i got a tan i shaved off my beard and discovered i had a face and not a bad one at that i dated good women i met robin and things really started to get better be kind to alex time early retirement six months before my thirty third birthday it was fun while it lasted morton handlers last residence if you didnt count the morgue had been a luxury apartment complex off sunset boulevard in pacific palisades it had been built into a hillside and designed to give a honeycomb effect a loosely connected chain of individual units linked by corridors that had been placed at seemingly random locations the apartments staggered to give each one a full view of the ocean the motif was bastard spanish blindingly white textured stucco walls red tile roofs window accents of black wrought iron plantings of azalea and hibiscus filled in occasional patches of earth there were lots of potted plants sunk in large terra cotta containers coconut palms rubber plants sun ferns temporary looking as if someone planned on moving them all out in the middle of the night handlers unit was on an intermediate level the front door was sealed with an lapd sticker taped across it lots of footprints dirtied the terrazzo walkway near the entrance milo led me across a terrace filled with polished stones and succulents to a unit eater cornered from the murder scene adhesive letters spelling out the word manger were affixed to the door bad jokes about baby jesus flashed through my mind milo knocked i realized then that the place was amazingly silent there must have been at least fifty units but there wasnt a soul in sight no evidence of human habitation we waited a few minutes he raised his fist to knock again just before the door opened sorry i was washin my hair the woman could have been anywhere from twenty five to forty she had pale skin with the kind of texture that looked as if a pinch would crumble it large brown eyes topped by plucked brows thin lips a slight under bite her hair was wrapped in an orange towel and the little that peeked out was medium brown she wore a faded cotton shirt of ochre and orange print over rust colored stretch pants dark blue tennis shoes on her feet her eyes darted from milo to me she looked like someone whod been knocked around plenty and refused to believe that it wasnt going to happen again at any moment mrs quinn this is dr alex delaware hes the psychologist i told you about pleased to meet you doctor her hand was thin and cold and moist and she pulled away as quickly as she could melodys watchin tv in her room out of school with all thats been goin on i let her watch to keep her mind off it we followed her into the apartment apartment was a charitable word what it was really was a couple of oversized closets stuck together an architects postscript hey ed weve got an extra four hundred square feet of corner in back of terrace number why dont we throw a roof over it nail up some drywall and call it a managers unit get some poor soul to do scutwork for the privilege of living in pacific palisades the living room was filled with one floral sofa a masonite end table and a television a framed painting of mount rainier that looked as if it came from a savings and loan calendar and a few yellowed photographs hung on the wall the photos were of hardened unhappy looking people and appeared to date from the gold rush my grandparents she said a cubicle of a kitchen was visible and from it came the smell of frying bacon a large bag of sour cream and onion flavored potato chips and a six pack of dr pepper sat on the counter very nice they came here in from oklahoma she made it sound like an apology there was an unfinished wooden door and from behind it came the sound of sudden laughter and applause bells and buzzers a game show shes watchin back there thats just fine mrs quinn well let her be until were ready for her the woman nodded her head in assent she dont get much chance to watch the daytime shows being in school so shes watchin em now may we sit down maam oh yes yes she flitted around the room like a mayfly tugging at the towel on her head she brought in an ashtray and set it down on the end table milo and i sat on the sofa and she dragged in a tubular aluminum and naugahyde chair from the kitchen for herself despite the fact that she was thin her haunches settled and spread she took out a pack of cigarettes lit one up and sucked in the smoke until her cheeks hollowed milo spoke how old is your daughter mrs quinn bonita call me bonita melodys the girl shes just seven this past month talking about her daughter seemed to make her especially nervous she inhaled greedily on her cigarette and blew little smoke out her free hand clenched and unclenched in rapid cadence melody may be our only witness to what happened here last night milo looked at me with a disgusted frown i knew what he was thinking an apartment complex with seventy to one hundred residents and the only possible witness a child im scared for her detective sturgis if someone else finds out bonita quinn stared at the floor as if doing it long enough would reveal the mystic secret of the orient i assure you mrs quinn that no one will find out dr delaware has served as a special consultant to the police many times he lied shamelessly and glibly he understands the importance of keeping things secret besides he reached over to pat her shoulder reassuringly i thought shed go through the ceiling all psychologists demand confidentiality when working with their patients isnt that so dr delaware absolutely we wouldnt get into the whole muddy issue of childrens rights to privacy bonita quinn made a strange squeaking noise that was impossible to interpret the closest thing to it that i could remember was the noise laboratory frogs used to make in physiological psych right before we pithed them by plunging a needle down into the tops of their skulls whats all this hypnotism gonna do to her i lapsed into my shrinks voice the calm soothing tones that had become so natural over the years that they switched on automatically i explained to her that hypnosis wasnt magic simply a combination of focused concentration and deep relaxation that people tended to remember things more clearly when they were relaxed and that was why the police used it for witnesses that children were better at going into hypnosis than were adults because they were less inhibited and enjoyed fantasy that it didnt hurt and was actually pleasant for most youngsters and that you couldnt get stuck in it or do anything against your will while hypnotized all hypnosis i ended is self hypnosis my role is simply to help your daughter do something that comes natural to her she probably understood about percent of it but it seemed to calm her down you can say that again natural she daydreams all the time exactly hypnosis is like that teachers complain all the time say shes driftin off not doing her work she was talking as if she expected me to do something about it milo broke in has melody told you anything more about what she saw mrs quinn no no an emphatic shake of the head we havent been talkin about it milo pulled out his notepad and nipped through a few pages what i have on record is that melody couldnt sleep and was sitting in the living room in this room at around one in the morning mustve been i go in by eleven thirty and i got up once for a cigarette at twenty after twelve she was asleep then and i didnt hear her for the while it took me to fall off id a heard her we share the room uh huh and she saw two men here it says i saw big men the officers question was how many melody and she answered two maybe three when he asked her what did they look like all she could say was that they were dark he was talking to me now we asked her black latino nothing only dark that could mean shadows could mean anything to a seven year old i said i know which could mean two men or one guy with a shadow or dont say it or nothing at all she dont always tell the truth about everything we both turned to look at bonita quinn who had used the few seconds we had ignored her to put out her cigarette and light a new one im not sayin shes a bad kid but she dont always tell the truth i dont know why you want to depend on her i asked do you have problems with her chronically lying about things that dont make much sense or does she do it to avoid getting in trouble the second when she dont want me to paddle her and i know somethings broken its got to be her she tells me no mama not me and i paddle her double she looked to me for disapproval for not tellin the truth do you have other problems with her i asked gently shes a good girl doctor only the daydreams and the concentration problems oh i needed to understand this child if i was going to be able to do hypnosis with her the concentratin its hard for her no wonder in this tiny television saturated cell no doubt the apartments were adults only and melody quinn was required to keep a low profile theres a large segment of the population of southern california that views the sight of anyone too young or too old as offensive its as if nobody wants to be reminded from whence they came or to where they will certainly go that kind of denial coupled with face lifts and hair transplants and makeup creates a comfortable little delusion of immortality for a short while i was willing to bet that melody quinn spent most of her time indoors despite the fact that the complex boasted three swimming pools and a totally equipped gym not to mention the ocean a half mile away those playthings were meant for the grownups i took her to the doctor when the teachers kept sendin home these notes sayin she cant sit still her mind wanders he said she was overactive somethin in the brain hyperactive thats right wouldnt surprise me her dad wasnt altogether right up there she tapped her forehead used the illegal drugs and the wine until he she stopped cold looking at milo with sudden fear dont worry mrs quinn were not interested in that kind of thing we only want to find out who killed dr handler and ms gutierrez yeah the headshrinker she stopped again this time staring at me cant seem to say anythin right today she forced a weak smile i nodded reassurance smiled understandingly he was a nice guy that doctor some of my best friends are psychotherapists used to joke with me a lot and id kid him ask him if he had any shrunken heads in there she laughed a strange giggle and showed a mouthful of teeth badly in need of repair by now i had narrowed her age to middle thirties in ten years shed look truly elderly terrible about what happened to him and ms gutierrez yeah her too only her i wasnt so crazy about she was mexican you know but uppity mexican where i come from they did the stoop labor and the cleanup this one had the fancy dresses and the little sports car and her a teacher too it wasnt easy for bonita quinn brought up to think of all mexicans as beasts of burden to see that in the big city away from the lettuce fields some of them looked just like real people while she did the donkey work she was always carryin herself like she was too good for you youd say hello to her and shed be lookin off into the distance like she had no time for you she took another drag on her cigarette and smiled slyly this time im okay she said we both looked at her neither of you gents is a mex i didnt put my foot in it again she was extremely pleased with herself and i took advantage of her lifted spirits to ask her a few more questions mrs quinn is your daughter on any sort of medication for her hyperactivity oh yeah sure the doc gave me pills to give her do you have the prescription slip handy i got the bottle she got up and returned with an amber vial half full of tablets i took it and read the label ritalin methylphenidate hydrochloride a super amphetamine that speeds up adults but slows down kids its one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for american youngsters ritalin is addictive and potent and has a host of side effects one of the most common of which is insomnia which might explain why melody quinn was sitting staring out the window of a dark room at one in the morning ritalin is a sweetheart drug when it comes to controlling children it improves concentration and reduces the frequency of problem behaviors in hyperactive kids which sounds great except that the symptoms of hyperactivity are hard to differentiate from those of anxiety depression acute stress reaction or simple boredom at school ive seen kids who were too bright for their classroom look hyper ditto for little ones going through the horrors of divorce or any other significant trauma a doctor whos doing his job correctly will require comprehensive psychological and social evaluation of a child before prescribing ritalin or any other behavior modifying drug and there are plenty of good doctors but some physicians take the easy way out using the pills as the first step if its not malpractice its dangerously close i opened the vial and shook some pills onto my palm they were amber the milligram kind i examined the label one tablet three times daily sixty mg was the maximum recommended dosage strong stuff for a seven year old you give her these three times a day uh huh thats what it says dont it yes it does did your doctor start off with something smaller white or blue pills oh yeah we had her takin three of the blue ones at first worked pretty good but i still got the complaints from the school so he said it was okay to try these and this dosage works well for melody works real fine for me if its gonna be a rough day with lots of visitors comin over she dont do real good with lots of people lots of commotion i give her an extra one now we were talking overdose bonita quinn must have seen the look of surprise and disapproval that i tried unsuccessfully to conceal for she spoke up with indignation in her voice the doc says it was okay hes an important man you know this place dont allow kids and i get to stay here only on account as shes a quiet kid m and m properties they own the place told me any time theres complaints about kids thats it no doubt that did wonders for melodys social life chances are she had never had a friend over there was cruel irony to the idea of a seven year old imprisoned amidst single swingle splendor tucked away in a slum pocket on an aerie high above the high pacific and dosed up with ritalin to appease the combined wishes of the los angeles school system a dimwitted mother and m and m properties i examined the label on the vial to find out the name of the prescribing physician when i found it things began to fall into place lw towle lionel willard towle md one of the most established and respected pediatricians on the west side i had never met him but knew him by reputation he was on the senior staff of western pediatric and a half dozen other westside hospitals a big shot in the academy of pediatrics a guest speaker highly in demand at seminars on learning disabilities and behavior problems dr towle was also a paid consultant to three major pharmaceutical concerns translate pusher he had a reputation especially among the younger doctors who were generally more conservative about drugs as easy with the prescription pad no one said it too loudly because towle had been around a long time and had lots of important patients and plenty of connections but the whispered consensus was that he was a dr feel good for tots i wondered how someone like bonita quinn had ended up in his practice but there was no easy way to ask without appearing unduly nosy i handed the vial back to her and turned to milo whod been sitting through the exchange in silence let me talk to you i said just one moment maam outside the apartment i told him i cant hypnotize this kid shes drugged to the gills it would be a risk to work with her and besides theres little chance of getting anything worthwhile out of her milo digested this shit he scratched his head what if we take her off the pills for a few days thats a medical decision we get into that and were way out of bounds we need the physicians permission which blows confidentiality whos the doc i told him about towle wonderful but maybe hell agree to let her off for a few days maybe but theres no guarantee shell give us anything this kids been on stimulants for a year and what about mrs q shes scared plenty as is take her darling off the pills and first thing shell do is lock the kid inside twelve hours a day they like it quiet here the complex was still silent as a mausoleum at one forty five in the afternoon can you at least look at the kid maybe shes not that doped across the way the door to the handler apartment was open i caught a glimpse of elegance in disarray oriental rugs antiques and severe acrylic furniture broken and upended blood spattered white walls the police lab men worked silently like moles by now shes had her second dose milo shit he punched his fist into his palm just meet the kid give me your impression maybe shell be alert she wasnt her mother led her into the living room and then left with milo she stared off into the distance sucking her thumb she was a small child if i hadnt known her age i would have guessed it at five maybe five and a half she had a long grave face with oversized brown eyes her straight blond hair hung to her shoulders held in place by twin plastic barettes she wore blue jeans and a blue greenandwhite striped t shirt her feet were dirty and bare i led her to a chair and sat opposite her on the couch hello melody im dr delaware im a psychologist do you know what that is no response im the kind of doctor who doesnt give shots what i do is talk and draw and play with kids i try to help kids who are sad or angry or scared at the word scared she looked up for a second then she resumed staring past me and sucked her thumb do you know why im talking to you a shake of the head its not because youre sick or because youve done anything wrong we know youre a good girl her eyes moved around the room avoiding me im here because you may have seen something last night thats important when you couldnt sleep and were looking out the window she didnt answer i continued melody what kind of things do you like to do nothing do you like to play she nodded i like to play too and i like to skate do you skate uh uh of course not skates make noise and i like to watch movies do you watch movies she mumbled something i bent closer whats that hon on tv her voice was thin and quivering a trembling breathy sound like the breeze through dry leaves uh uh on tv i watch tv too what shows do you like to watch scoobydoo scooby doo thats a good show any other shows my mama watches the soap operas do you like the soap operas she shook her head pretty boring huh a hint of a smile around the thumb do you have toys melody in my room could you show them to me the room she shared with her mother was neither adult nor childlike in character it was no more than ten foot square low ceilinged with a solitary window set high in the wall which gave it the ambience of a dungeon melody and bonita shared one twin bed unadorned by a headboard it was half unmade the thin chenille spread folded back to reveal rumpled sheets on one side of the bed was a nightstand filled with bottles and jars of cold cream hand lotion brushes combs and a piece of cardboard onto which a score of bobby pins were clasped on the other side was a huge moth eaten stuffed walrus made of fuzzy material and colored an atrocious turquoise blue a baby picture was the sole adornment on the wall a sagging bureau made of unfinished pine and covered with a crocheted doily and the tv were the only other pieces of furniture in the room in one corner was a small pile of toys melody led me over to it hesitantly she picked up a grimy naked plastic baby doll amanda she said shes beautiful the child clutched the doll to her chest and rocked back and forth you must really take good care of her i do it was said defensively this was a child who was not used to praise i know you do i said gently i looked over to the walrus whos he fatso my daddy gave him to me hes cute she walked over to the animal which was as tall as she and stroked it purposefully mama wants me to throw him out cause hes too big but i wont let her fatsos really important to you uh huh daddy gave him to you she nodded emphatically and smiled id passed some kind of test for the next twenty five minutes we sat on the floor and played when milo and the mother returned melody and i were in fine spirits wed built and destroyed several worlds well youre sure lookin frisky said bonita were having a good time mrs quinn melodys been a very good girl thats good she went over to her daughter and placed a hand on her head thats good hon there was unexpected tenderness in her eyes then it was gone she turned to me and asked howd it go with the hypnotism she asked it the same way she might inquire hows my kid doing in arithmetic we havent done any hypnosis yet melody and i are just getting to know each other i drew her aside mrs quinn hypnosis requires trust on the part of the child i usually spend a little time with children beforehand melody was very cooperative she didnt tell you nothin she reached into the breast pocket of her shirt and pulled out another cigarette i lit it for her and the gesture surprised her nothing of importance with your permission id like to come over some time tomorrow and spend a little more time with melody she eyed me suspiciously chewed on the cigarette then shrugged youre the doctor we rejoined milo and the child he was kneeling on one leg and showing her his detectives badge her eyes were wide melody if its okay with you id like to come by tomorrow and play with you some more she looked up at her mother and began sucking her thumb again its fine with me bonita quinn said curtly now run along melody sprang for her room she stopped in the doorway and gave me a tentative look i waved she waved back and then she disappeared a second later the tv began blaring one more thing mrs quinn ill need to talk to dr towle before i do any hypnosis with melody thats okay ill need your permission to talk with dr towle about the case you realize hes professionally bound to keep this confidential just as i am thats okay i trust dr towle and i may ask him to take her off her medicine for a couple of days oh all right all right she waved her hand exasperated thank you mrs quinn we left her standing in front of her apartment smoking frantically taking the towel off her head and shaking her hair loose in the midday sun i took the wheel of the seville and drove slowly up toward sunset stop smirking milo whats that he was looking out the passenger window his hair flapping like duck wings you know youve got me hooked dont you a kid like that those big eyes like something out of a keene painting if you want to quit right now it wouldnt make me happy alex but i wouldnt stop you theres still time for gnocchi the hell with gnocchi lets talk with dr towle the seville was consuming fuel with customary gluttony i pulled into a chevron self serve at bundy while milo pumped gas i got towles number from information and dialed it i used my title and got through to the doctor in a half minute i gave him a brief explanation of why i needed to talk with him and told him we could chat now over the phone no he said ive got an office full of kids his voice was smooth and reassuring the kind of voice a parent would want to hear at two in the morning when the baby was turning blue when would be a good time to call you he didnt answer i could hear the bustle of activity in the background then muffled voices he came back on the line how about dropping by at four thirty ive got a lull around then i appreciate your time doctor no bother and he hung up i left the phone booth milo was removing the nozzle from the rear of the seville holding it at arms length to avoid getting gasoline on his suit i settled in the drivers seat and stuck my head out the window catch the windshield for me son he made a gargoyle face not much of an effort and gave me the finger then he went to work with paper towels it was two forty and we were only fifteen minutes from towles office that left over an hour to kill neither of us was in a good enough mood to want first rate food so we drove back to west la and went to angelas milo ordered something called a san francisco deluxe omelette it turned out to be a bright yellow horror stuffed with spinach tomatoes ground beef chilies onions and marinated eggplant he dug into it with relish while i contented myself with a steak sandwich and a coors in between bites he talked about the handler murder its a puzzler alex youve got all the signs of a psychotic thrill killer both of them trussed up in the bedroom like animals ready for the slaughter and stuck about five dozen times the girl looked like she ran into jack the ripper with her spare me i pointed to my food sorry i forget when im talking to a civilian you get used to it after wading in it for a few years you cant stop living so you learn to eat and drink and fart through all of it he wiped his face with his napkin and took a long deep swallow of his beer anyway despite the craziness theres no sign of forced entry the front door was open normally that would be very puzzling except in this case with the victim being a psychiatrist it might make sense his knowing the bad guy and letting him in you think it was one of his patients its a good possibility psychiatrists have been known to deal with crazies id be surprised if it turned out that way milo ten to one handler had a typical west side practice depressed middle aged women disillusioned executives and a few adolescent identity crises thrown in for good measure do i detect a note of cynicism i shrugged thats just the way it is in most cases high priced friendship not that its not valuable mind you but theres very little real mental illness in what most of us psychiatrists psychologists see in practice the real crazies the really disturbed ones are hospitalized handler worked at a hospital before he went out on his own encino oaks maybe youll dig up something there i said doubtfully i was tired of being the wet blanket so i didnt tell him that encino oaks hospital was a repository for the suicidal progeny of the rich very little sexual psychopathy there he pushed his empty plate away and motioned for the waitress bettijean a nice slab of that green apple pie please a la mode milo he patted his gut and pondered what the hell why not vanilla and you sir just coffee please when she had gone he continued thinking out loud more than talking to me anyway it appears as if dr handler let someone in to his place sometime between midnight and one and got ripped up for his efforts and the gutierrez woman your quintessential innocent bystander being in the wrong place at the wrong time she was handlers girlfriend he nodded for about six months from the little weve learned she started out as a patient and ended up going from couch to bed a not uncommon story the irony of it was that she was hacked up worse than he was handler got his throat slit and probably died relatively quickly there were a few other holes in him but nothing lethal it looks as if the killer took his time with her makes sense if its a sexual crazy i could feel my digestive process come to a halt i changed the subject whos your new love the pie came milo smiled at the waitress and attacked the pastry i noticed that the filling was indeed green a bright almost luminescent green someone in the kitchen was fooling around with food dyes i shuddered to think what they could do with something really challenging like a pizza it would probably end up looking like a mad artists palette a doctor a nice jewish doctor he looked heavenward every mothers dream what happened to larry hes gone off to find his fortunes in san francisco larry was a black stage manager with whom milo had conducted an on again off again relationship for two years their last half year had been grimly platonic hes hooked up with some show sponsored by an anonymous corporation something racy for educational television along the lines of our agricultural heritage your friend the plough hot stuff bitchy bitchy no really i do wish the boy well behind that neurotic exterior was genuine talent how did you meet your doctor he works the emergency room at cedars a surgeon no less i was following up an assault that turned into manslaughter he was commandeering the catheters and our eyes locked the rest is history i laughed so hard the coffee almost went up my nose hes been out of the closet for about two years marriage in medical school messy divorce excommunication by family the whole bit fantastic guy youll have to meet him id like to give me a few days to slog through morton handlers life history and well double its a deal it was five to four i let the los angeles police department pay for my lunch in the best tradition of policemen the world over milo left an enormous tip he patted bettijeans fanny on the way out and her laughter followed us out on to the street santa monica boulevard was beginning to choke up with traffic and the air had started to foul i closed the sevilles windows and turned on the air conditioning i slipped a tape of joe pass and stephane grappelli into the deck the sound of only a paper moon delivered hot forties style filled the car the music made me feel good milo took a cat nap snoring deeply i eased the seville into the traffic and headed back to brentwood towles office was on a side street off san vicente not far from the brentwood country mart one of the few neighborhoods where movie stars could shop without being harassed it was in a building designed during the early fifties when tan brick low slung roofs and wall inserts of glass cubes were in vogue plantings of asparagus fern and climbing bougainvillaea did something to relieve the starkness but it still looked pretty severe towle was the buildings sole occupant and his name was stenciled in gold leaf on the glass front door the parking lot was a haven for wood sided station wagons we pulled in next to a blue lincoln with a speak up for children bumper sticker that i figured belonged to the good doctor himself inside the decor was something else it was as if some interior decorator had tried to make up for the harshness of the building by cramming the waiting room full of mush the furniture was colonial maple with nubby seat cushions the walls were covered with needlepoint homilies and cutesy poo prints of little boys fishing and little girls preening themselves in front of mirrors wearing mommys hat and shoes the room was full of children and harried looking mothers magazines books and toys cluttered the floor there was an odor of dirty diapers in the air if this was towles lull i didnt want to be there during his busy period when we walked in two childless males we drew stares from the women we had agreed beforehand that towle would relate better doctor to doctor so milo found a seat sandwiched in between two five year olds and i walked to the reception window the girl on the other side was a sweet young thing with farrah fawcett hair and a face almost as pretty as that of her role model she was dressed in white and her name tag proclaimed her to be sandi hi im dr delaware ive got an appointment with dr towle i got a smile fronted by lots of nice white teeth appointments dont mean much this afternoon but come right in hell be with you in just a minute i walked through the door with several pairs of maternal eyes boring into my back some of them had probably been waiting for over an hour i wondered why towle didnt hire an associate sandi showed me into the doctors consultation office a dark paneled room about twelve by twelve its about the quinn child isnt it thats right ill pull the chart she came back with a manila folder and placed it on towles desk there was a red tag on the cover she saw me looking at it the reds are the hypers we code them yellow for chronically ill ones blue for specialty consults very efficient oh you have no idea she giggled and placed one hand on a shapely hip you know she said leaning a bit closer and letting me have a whiff of something fragrant between you and me that poor child has it rough growing up with a mother like that i know what you mean i nodded not knowing what she meant at all but hoping shed tell me people usually do when you dont seem to care i mean shes such a scatterbrain the mother everytime she comes here she forgets something or loses something one time it was her purse the other time she locked her keys in the car she really doesnt have it together i clucked sympathetically not that she hasnt had it rough growing up doing farm work and then marrying that guy who ended up in pris sandi we both turned to see a short sixtyish woman with hair cut in an iron grey helmet standing in the doorway arms folded across her bosom her eyeglasses hung suspended from a chain around her neck she too was dressed in white but on her it looked like a uniform her name tag proclaimed her to be edna i knew her right away the doctors right hand gal shed probably been working for him since he hung out his shingle and was making about the same amount of money shed started out with but no matter lucre wasnt what she was after she was secretly in love with the great man i was willing to bet a handful of blue chip stocks that she called him doctor no name after it just doctor as if he were the only one in the world there are some charts that need filing she said okay edna sandi turned to me gave a conspiratorial look that said isnt this old witch a drag and sashayed down the hall can i do anything for you edna asked me still keeping her arms crossed no thank you well then doctor will be right with you thank you kill em with courtesy her glance let me know that she didnt approve of my presence no doubt anything that upset doctors routine was viewed as an intrusion upon paradise but she finally left me alone in the office i took a look around the room the desk was mahogany and battered it was piled high with charts medical journals books mail drug samples and a jar full of paper clips the desk chair and the easy chair in which i sat were once classy items burnished leather now both aged and cracked two of the walls were covered with diplomas many of which hung askew and at odds with one another it looked like a room that had just been nudged by a minor earthquake nothing broken just shaken up a bit i casually examined the diplomas lionel w towle had amassed an impressive collection of paper over the years degrees certificates of internship and residency a walnut plaque with gavel commemorating his chairmanship of some medical task force honorary membership in this and that specialty board certification commendations for public service on the good ship hope consultant to the california senate subcommittee on child welfare and on and on the other wall displayed photographs most were of towle towle in fishermans garb knee deep in some river holding aloft a clutch of steelhead towle with a marlin the size of a buick towle with the mayor and some little squat guy with peter lorre eyes everyone smiling shaking hands there was one exception to this seeming self obsession in the center of the wall hung a color photograph of a young woman holding a small child the colors were faded and from the styles of clothing worn by the subjects the picture looked three decades old there was some of the tell tale fuzziness of an enlarged snapshot the hues were misty almost pastel the woman was pretty fresh faced with a sprinkle of freckles across her nose dark eyes and medium length brown hair with a natural wave she wore a filmy looking short sleeved dress of dotted swiss cotton and her arms were slender and graceful they wrapped around the child a boy who looked around two or younger he was beautiful rosy cheeked blond with cupids bow lips and green eyes he was dressed in a white sailor suit and sat beaming in his mothers embrace the mountains and lake in the distance looked real its a lovely picture isnt it said the voice id heard over the phone he was tall at least six three and lean with the kind of features bad novels label as chiseled he was one of the most handsome middle aged men i had ever seen his face was noble a strong chin bisected by a perfect cleft the nose of a roman senator and twinkling eyes the color of a clear sky his thick snow white hair hung down over his forehead carl sandburg style his eyebrows were twin white clouds he wore a short white coat over a blue oxford shirt burgundy print tie and dark gray trousers of a subtle check his shoes were black calfskin loafers very proper very tasteful but clothes didnt make the man he would have looked patrician in double knits dr delaware will towle alex i stood and we shook hands his grip was firm and dry the fingers that clasped mine were enormous and i was conscious of abundant strength behind them please sit he took his place behind the desk swiveled back and threw his feet up on top resting on a years back issues of the journal of pediatrics i responded to his question it is a beautiful shot somewhere in the pacific northwest washington state olympic national forest we were vacationing there in fifty one i was a resident that was my wife and son i lost them a month later in a car crash im sorry yes a distant sleepy look came on his face it was a moment before he shook himself out of it and came back into focus i know you by reputation alex so its a pleasure to get to meet you same here ive followed your work because i have a strong interest in behavioral pediatrics i was particularly interested in your work with those children whod been victimized by stuart hickle several of them were in the practice the parents spoke highly of your work thank you i felt as if i was expected to say more but that was one subject that was closed i do remember sending consent forms to you yes yes delighted to cooperate neither of us spoke then we both spoke at the same time what id like to i said what can i do for he said it came out a garbled mess we laughed good old boys at the university club i deferred to him despite the graciousness i sensed an enormous ego lurking be hind that white forelock youre here about the quinn child what can i do for you i filled him in on as few details as possible stressing the importance of melody quinn as a witness and the benign nature of the hypnotic intervention i ended by requesting that he allow her to go off ritalin for one week you really think this child will be able to give you information of substance i dont know ive asked the same question but shes all the police have got and your role in all of this i thought up a quicky title im a special consultant they call me in sometimes when there are children involved i see he played with his hands constructing ten legged spiders and killing them i dont know alex when we start to remove a patient from what has been determined to be an optimal dosage we sometimes upset the entire pattern of biochemical response you think she needs to be on medication constantly of course i do why else would i prescribe it for her he wasnt angry or defensive he smiled calmly and with great forbearance the message was clear only an idiot would doubt him thered be no way to reduce the dosage oh thats certainly possible but it creates the same type of problem i dont like to tamper with a winning combination i see i hesitated then continued she must have posed quite a problem to merit sixty mgs towle placed a pair of reading glasses low on his nose picked up the chart and flipped through it let me see ah yes hmm mother complains of severe behavioral problems after thumbing through a few more pages teachers report failure to complete school assignments difficulty in maintaining attention span for more than brief periods ah heres a later notation child struck mother during argument about keeping room clean and heres a note of mine poor peer relations few friends i was certain that the argument had something to do with giving away the giant walrus fatso the gift from daddy and as for friends it was easy to see that m and m properties wouldnt truck with that kind of nonsense that sounds pretty severe to me dont you think what i thought was that it was horse shit thered been nothing resembling a thorough psychological evaluation nothing beyond taking the mother at her word i looked at towle and saw a quack a nice looking white haired quack with lots of connections and the right pieces of paper on his wall i longed to tell him so but that would do nobody melody milo any good so i hedged i cant say youre her doc faking the comradely grin was an exercise in moral self control thats right alex i am he leaned back in his chair and placed his hands behind his head i know what youre thinking will towle is a pill pusher stimulants are just another form of child abuse i wouldnt say that he waved away my objection no no i know and i dont hold it against you your training is behavioral and you see things behaviorally we all do it settle into professional tunnel vision the surgeons want to cut everything out we prescribe and you fellows like to analyze it to death it was starting to sound like a lecture granted drugs have risks but its a matter of cost risk analysis lets consider a child like the quinn girl what does she start out with inferior genes both parents somewhat limited intellectually he made the word limited sound very cruel lousy genes and poverty and a broken marriage absent father although in some of these cases the children are better off without the kind of role models the fathers provide bad genes bad environment the childs got two strikes against her before she leaves the womb is it any wonder then that soon were seeing all the telltale signs antisocial behavior noncompliance poor school performance unsatisfactory impulse control i felt a sudden urge to defend little melody her genial doctor was describing her as some kind of total misfit i kept silent now a child like this he took off his glasses and put down the chart is going to have to do moderately well in school in order to achieve some semblance of a decent life for herself otherwise its another generation of ppp piss poor protoplasm one of the quaint expressions dreamed up by the medical profession to describe especially unfortunate patients playing straight man to towle wasnt my idea of a fun afternoon but i had a hunch it was some kind of ritual that if i held out and let him smilingly browbeat me he might give me what i came for but there is no way a child like this can achieve with her genes and her environment working against her not without help and thats where stimulant medication comes in those pills allow her to sit still long enough and pay attention long enough to be able to learn something they control her behavior to the point where she no longer alienates everyone around her i got the impression that the mother was using the medication in a haphazard way giving her an extra pill on days when there were lots of visitors at the apartment complex ill have to check that he didnt sound concerned you have to remember alex that this child does not exist in a vacuum theres a social context here if theres nowhere for her mother and her to live that isnt exactly therapeutic is it i listened certain there was more sure enough now you may ask what about psychotherapy what about behavior modification my answer is what about them there is no chance of this particular mother developing the capacity for insight to successfully benefit from psychotherapy and she lacks the ability to even comply with a stable system of rules and regulations necessary for behavior mod what she can deal with is administering three pills a day to her child pills that work and i dont mind telling you i dont feel a damn bit guilty about prescribing them because i think theyre this childs only hope it was a great ending no doubt it made a big hit at the western pediatric ladies auxiliary tea but basically it was all crap pseudoscientific gibberish mixed in with a lot of condescending fascism dope up the untermenschen to make them good citizens he had worked himself up a bit but now he was perfectly composed as handsome and in control as ever i havent convinced you have i he smiled its not a matter of that you raise some interesting points ill have to think about it thats always a good idea thinking things over he rubbed his hands together now back to what you came for and please forgive my little diatribe you really think that taking this child off stimulants will make her more susceptible to hypnosis i do despite the fact that her concentration will be poorer despite that ive got inductions that are especially suited for children with short attention spans the snowy eyebrows rose oh really ill have to find out about those you know i did some hypnosis too in the army for pain control i know it works i can send you some recent publications thank you alex he rose and it was clear that my time was up pleasure to meet you alex another handshake the pleasure is mine will this was getting sickening the unasked question hung in the air towle snagged it ill tell you what im going to do he said smiling ever faintly yes im going to think about it i see yes ill think it over call me in a couple of days ill do that will and may your hair and teeth fall out overnight you sanctimonious bastard on the way out edna glared and sandi smiled at me i ignored them both and rescued milo from the trio of munchkins that was climbing over him as if he were playground equipment we made our way through the now boiling mob of children and mothers and reached the car safely i told milo about the encounter with towle as we drove back to my place power play his forehead creased and cherry sized lumps appeared just above his jawline that and something else that i cant quite figure hes a strange guy comes across very courtly almost obsequious then you realize hes playing games whyd he have you come all the way out there for something like that i dont know it was a puzzle his taking time out from a frantic afternoon to deliver a leisurely lecture our entire conversation could have been handled in a five minute phone call maybe its his idea of recreation one upping another professional hell of a hobby for a busy man yeah but the ego comes first ive met guys like towle before obsessed with being in control with being the boss lots of them end up as department heads deans and chairmen of committees and captains and inspectors and police chiefs right you going to call him like he said he sounded defeated sure for what its worth yeah milo reclaimed his fiat and after a few moments of prayer and pumping it started up he leaned out of the window and looked at me wearily thanks alex im going to go home and crash this no sleep routine is catching up with me you want to take a nap here and then head out no thanks ill make it if this pile of junk will he slapped the dented door thanks anyway ill follow up with melody great ill call you tomorrow he drove a way until i stopped him with my shout he backed up what its probably not important but i thought id mention it the nurse in towles office told me melodys dads in prison he nodded somnambulantly sos half the county its that way when the economy goes bad thanks then he was off it was six fifteen and already dark i lay down on my bed for a few minutes and when i awoke it was after nine i got up washed my face and called robin no one answered i took a quick shave threw on a windbreaker and drove down to hakata in santa monica i drank sake and ate sushi for an hour and bantered with the chef who as it turned out had a masters degree in psychology from the university of tokyo i got home stripped naked and took a hot bath trying to erase all thoughts of morton handler melody quinn and lw towle md from my mind i used self hypnosis imagining robin and myself making love on top of a mountain in the middle of a rain forest flushed with passion i got out of the tub and called her again after ten rings she answered mumbling and confused and half asleep i apologized for waking her told her i loved her and hung up half a minute later she called back was that you alex she sounded as if she was dreaming yes honim sorry to wake you no thats okay what time is it eleven thirty oh i must have conked out how are you sweetie fine i called you around nine i was out all day buying wood theres an old violin maker out in simi valley whos retiring i spent six hours choosing tools and picking out maple and ebony im sorry i missed you she sounded exhausted im sorry too but go back to bed get some sleep and ill call you tomorrow if you want to come over you can i thought about it but i was too restless to be good company no doll you rest how about dinner tomorrow you pick the place okay darling she yawned a soft sweet sound i love you love you too it took me a while to fall asleep and when i finally did it was restless slumber punctuated by black and white dreams with lots of frantic movement in them i dont remember what they were about but the dialogue was sluggish and labored as if everyone were talking with paralyzed lips and mouths filled with wet sand in the middle of the night i got up to check that the doors and windows were locked i woke up at six the next morning filled with random energy i hadnt felt that way for over five months the tension wasnt all bad for with it came a sense of purpose but by seven it had built up some so that i paced around the house like a jaguar on the prowl at seven thirty i decided it was late enough i dialed bonita quinns number she was wide awake and she sounded as if shed been expecting my call morning doctor good morning i thought id drop by and spend a few hours with melody why not shes not doin anything you know she lowered her voice i think she liked you she talked about how you played with her thats good well do some more today ill be there in half an hour when i arrived she was all dressed and ready to go her mother had put her in a pale yellow sundress that exposed bony white shoulders and pipe stem arms her hair was tied back in a ponytail fastened by a yellow ribbon she clutched a tiny patent leather purse i had thought wed spend some time in her room and then perhaps go out for lunch but it was clear she was primed for an outing hi melody she averted her gaze and sucked her thumb you look very pretty this morning she smiled shyly i thought wed take a drive go to a park how does that sound okay the shaky voice great i peeked my head in the apartment bo nita quinn was pushing around a vacuum cleaner as if it were a wagonload of sins she wore a blue bandana on her head and a cigarette dangled from her lips the television was tuned in to a gospel show but snow obscured the picture and the choir was drowned out by the sound of the vacuum i touched her shoulder she jumped im taking her now okay i yelled over the din sure when she spoke the cigarette bobbled like a trout lure in a rushing brook she resumed her chore stooping over the roaring machine and plowing it forward i rejoined melody lets go she walked alongside me midway to the parking lot a small hand slipped into mine through a series of hilltop turns and lucky detours i connected to ocean avenue i drove south toward santa monica until we reached the park at the top of the cliff overlooking pacific coast highway it was eight thirty in the morning the sky was clear pebbled only with a handful of clouds that might have been as distant as hawaii i found a parking space on the street directly in front of the camera obscura and the senior citizens recreation center even that early in the morning the place was bustling old people packed the benches and the shuffleboard court some of them jabbered nonstop to each other or themselves other stared out at the boulevard in mute trance leggy girls in skimpy tops and satin shorts that covered a tenth of their gluteal regions skated by transforming the walkways between the palms into fleshy freeways some of them wore stereo headsets speeding spacewomen with glazed beatific expressions on their california perfect faces japanese tourists snapped pictures nudged each other pointed and laughed shabby bums loitered against the guardrail that separated the crumbling bluff from sheer space they smoked behind cupped hands and regarded the world with distrust and fear a surprising number of them were young men they all looked as if theyd crawled out of some deep dark unproductive mine there were students reading couples sprawled on the grass small boys darting between the trees and a few furtive encounters that looked suspiciously like dope deals melody and i walked along the outer rim of the park hand in hand talking little i offered to buy her a hot pretzel from a street vendor but she said she wasnt hungry i remembered that loss of appetite was another side effect of ritalin or maybe shed just had a big breakfast we came to the walkway that led to the pier have you ever been on a merry go round i asked her once we went on a school trip to magic mountain the fast rides scared me but i liked the merry go round cmon i pointed out toward the pier theres one here well take a ride in contrast to the park the pier was nearly deserted there were a few men fishing here and there mostly older blacks and asians but their expressions were pessimistic their buckets empty dried fish scales were embedded in the aged wooden planks of the walkway giving it a sequined effect in the morning sun there were cracks in several of the weathered boards and as we walked i caught glimpses of the water below slapping against the pilings and retreating with a hissed warning in the shadow of the piers underbelly the water looked greenish black there was a strong smell of creosote and salt in the air a ripe raw fragrance of loneliness and wasted hours the pool hall where i used to hide while playing hookey had been closed down in its place was an arcade full of electric video games a solitary mexican boy intently pulled the joystick on one of the garishly painted robots computer noise emerged in blips and dreeps the merry go round was housed in a cavernous barn of a building that looked as if it would collapse with the next high tide the operator was a tiny man with a potbelly the size of a cantaloupe and flaky skin around his ears he was sitting on a stool reading a racing form and trying to pretend we werent there wed like to ride the merry go round he looked up gave us the once over melody was staring at the ancient posters on the wall buffalo bill victorian love quarter a spin i handed him a couple of bills keep it going for a while sure i lifted her up onto a large white and gilded horse with a pink plume for a tail the brass rod upon which it was impaled had diagonal stripes running across it a sure bet to go up and down i stood next to her the tiny man was buried in his reading he reached out a hand pushed a button on a rusty console pulled a lever and a rheumy rendition of the blue danube waltz piped out of a dozen hidden speakers the carousel started off slowly and then it began to turn horses monkeys chariots coming to life moving in vertical counterpoint to the revolution of the machine melodys hands tightened around the neck of her steed she stared straight ahead gradually she relaxed her grip and allowed herself to look around by the twentieth revolution she was swaying with the music eyes closed mouth open in silent laughter when the music finally stopped i helped her down and she stepped dizzily onto the dirty concrete floor she was giggling and swinging her purse in joyful rhythm in time with the now dissipated waltz we left the barn and ventured to the end of the pier she was fascinated by the enormous bait tanks teeming with squirming anchovies amazed at the bin of fresh rockfish that was being brought up by a trio of muscled bearded fishermen the reddish fish lay dead in a heap the quick ascent from the bottom of the ocean had caused the air bladders on several of them to explode and extrude from their open mouths crabs the size of bees crawled in and around the motionless bodies gulls swooped down to plunder and were waved off by the horned brown hands of the fishermen one of the fishermen a boy of no more than eighteen saw her staring pretty gross huh yeah tell your daddy to take you to prettier places on his day off he laughed melody smiled she didnt try to correct him someone was deep frying shrimp i saw her nose wrinkle you hungry kind of she looked uneasy anything wrong mama told me not to be too grabby dont you worry im going to tell your mom what a good girl youve been have you had breakfast kind of whatd you have some juice a piece of donut the white powdery kind thats it uh huh she looked up at me as if expecting to be punished i softened my tone i guess you werent hungry at breakfast time uh huh so much for the big breakfast theory well im pretty hungry it was true all id had was coffee what do you say we both get something thank you doctor del she stumbled over my name call me alex thank you alex we located the source of the cooking smells at a shabby dinerette sandwiched between a souvenir shop and a bait and tackle stand the woman behind the counter was pasty white and obese steam and smoke rose in billows around her moon face creating a shimmering halo deep fryers crackled in the background i bought a large greasy bag full of goodies foil wrapped servings of shrimp and fried cod a basket of french fries the size of billy clubs plastic covered tubs of tartar sauce and ketchup fluted paper tubes of salt two cans of an off brand of cola dont forget these sir the fat woman held out a handful of napkins thanks you know kids she looked down at melody you enjoy yourself now hon we carried the food off the pier and found a quiet spot on the beach not far from the pritikin longevity center we ate our greasy fare watching middle aged men attempt to jog around the block fueled by whatever heartless menu the center was serving nowadays she ate like a trucker it was getting close to noon which meant that normally shed be ready for her second dose of amphetamine her mother hadnt offered the medication to me and i hadnt thought or wanted to ask the change in her behavior became evident halfway through lunch and grew more obvious each minute she began to move more she was more alert her face became more animated she fidgeted as if waking from a long confusing sleep she looked around newly in touch with her environment look at them she pointed to a covey of wet suited surfers riding waves in the distance they look like seals dont they she giggled could i go in the water alex take your shoes off and wade near the shoreline where the water touches the sand try not to get your dress wet i popped shrimp in my mouth leaned back and watched her run along the tide line skinny legs kicking up the water once she turned in my direction and waved i watched her play that way for twenty minutes or so and then i rolled up my pants legs took off my shoes and socks and joined her we ran together her legs worked better with every passing moment soon she was a gazelle she whooped and splashed and kept going until we were both out of breath we walked back to our picnic site and collapsed on the sand her hair was a mess so i loosened the barettes and re fastened them for her her small chest heaved her feet were crusted with grit from the ankle down when she finally caught her breath she asked me i ive been a good girl havent i youve been great she looked unsure dont you think so melody i dont know sometimes i think i am and mama gets mad or mrs brookhouse says im bad youre always a good girl even if someone thinks youve done something wrong do you understand that i guess so not sure huh i i get mixed up everyone gets mixed up kids and moms and dads and doctors dr towle too even dr towle she digested that for a while the large dark eyes darted around moving from the water to my face to the sky and back to me mama said you were going to hypnotize me she pronounced it hip motize only if you want me to do you understand why we think it might be helpful sort of to make me think better no you think just fine this i patted her head works fine we want to try hypnosis hypnotizing so that you can do us a favor so that you can remember something about when the other doctor was hurt i hesitated my habit was to be honest with children but if she hadnt been told about handler and gutierrez being dead i wasnt going to be the one to break the news not without the chance to be around to help pick up the pieces yes about that i told the policeman i didnt remember anything it was all dark and everything sometimes people remember better after being hypnotized she looked at me frightened are you scared of being hypnotized uh huh thats okay its okay to be scared of new things but there really isnt anything scary about hypnotizing its really kind of fun have you ever seen anyone hypnotized before nope never even in a cartoon she lit up yeah when the guy in the pointy hat hypnotized popeye and the waves came out his hands and popeye walked out of the window into the air and he didnt fall right ive seen that one too the guy in the pointy hat made popeye do all sorts of weird things yeah well thats great for cartoons but real hypnotizing isnt anything like that i gave her a childs version of the lecture id delivered to her mother she seemed to believe me because fascination took the place of fear can we do it now i hesitated the beach was empty there was plenty of privacy and the moment was right to hell with towle i dont see why not first lets get real comfortable i had her fix her eyes upon a smooth shiny pebble as she held it in her hand within moments she was blinking in response to suggestion her breathing slowed and became regular i told her to close her eyes and listen to the sound of the waves slapping against the shore then i instructed her to imagine herself descending a flight of stairs and passing through a beautiful door to a favorite place i dont know where it is or whats in it but its a special place for you you can tell me or keep it secret but being there makes you feel so comfortable so happy so in control a bit more of that and she was in a deep hypnotic state now you can hear the sound of my voice without having to listen just continue to enjoy your favorite place and have a real good time i let her go for five more minutes there was a peaceful angelic expression on her thin little face a soft wind rustled the loose strands of her hair she looked tiny sitting in the sand hands resting in her lap i gave her a suggestion to go back in time brought her back to the night of the murder she tensed momentarily then resumed the deep regular breathing youre still feeling totally relaxed melody so comfortable and in control but now you can watch yourself just as if you were a star on tv you see yourself getting out of bed her lips parted she ran the tip of her tongue over them and you go to the window and sit there just looking out what do you see dark the word was barely audible yes its dark and is there anything else no okay lets sit there a while longer a few minutes later can you see anything else in the dark melody uh uh dark i tried a few more times and then gave up either she had seen nothing and the talk of two or three dark men had been confabulation or she was blocking in either event i wasnt going to get anything from her i let her enjoy her favorite place gave her suggestions for mastery control and feeling refreshed and happy and brought her gently out of hypnosis she came out smiling that was fun im glad you liked it you seemed to have a real good favorite place you said i dont have to tell you thats true you dont well what if i want to she pouted then you can hmm she savored her power for a moment i want to tell you it was riding around on the merry go round going round and round faster and faster thats a great choice each time i went around i felt happier and happier can we go again some time sure now youve done it alex gotten yourself into something that wont be easy to pull out of instant daddy just add guilt back in the car she turned to me alex you said hypnotizing makes you remember better it can could i use it to remember my daddy whens the last time you saw him never he left when i was a little baby he and mama dont live together any more does he visit no he lives far away once he called me before christmas but i was sleeping so mama didnt wake me up that made me mad i can understand that i hit her you must have been really mad yeah she bit her lip sometimes he sends me stuff like fatso yeah and other stuff she dug in her purse and pulled out what looked to be a large dried pit or seed it had been carved to resemble a face a snarling face with rhinestone eyes and strands of black acrylic hair glued to the top a head a shrunken head the kind of hideous trash you can pick up at any tijuana tourist stall from the way she held it it could have been the crown jewel of kwarshiorkor very nice i handled the knobby thing and gave it back to her id like to see him but mama says she doesnt know where he is can hypnotizing help remember him it would be hard melody because you havent seen him in a long time but we could try do you have anything to remember him by any picture of him yeah she searched in her purse again and came up with a spindled and mutilated snapshot it had probably been fingered like a rosary i thought of the photograph on towles wall this was the week for celluloid memories mr eastman if you only knew how your little black box can be used to preserve the past like a stillborn fetus in a jar of formalin it was a faded color photograph of a man and woman the woman was bonita quinn in younger but not much prettier days even in her twenties she had possessed a sad mask of a face that foreshadowed a merciless future she wore a dress that exposed too much undernourished thigh her hair was long and straight and parted in the middle she and her companion were in front of what looked like a rural bar the kind of watering place you find peeking out around sudden highway curves the walls of the building were rough hewn logs there was a budweiser sign in the window her arm was around the waist of the man who had placed his arm around her shoulder he wore a t shirt jeans and wellington boots the rump of a motorcycle was visible next to him he was a strange looking bird one side of him the left sagged and there was more than a hint of atrophy running all the way down from face to foot he looked crooked like a piece of fruit that had been sliced and then put back together with less than full precision when you got past the asymmetry he wasnt bad looking tall slender with shoulder length shaggy blond hair and a thick mustache he had a wise guy expression on his face that contrasted with bonitas solemnity it was the kind of look you see on the face of the local yokels when you walk into a small town tavern in a strange place just wanting a cold drink and some solitude the kind of look you go out of your way to avoid because it means trouble and nothing else i wasnt surprised its owner had ended up behind bars here you go i handed the photo back to her and she carefully put it back in her purse want to take another run naw im kinda tired want to go home yeah during the ride back to the apartment complex she was very quiet as if shed been doped up again i had the uneasy feeling that i hadnt done right by this child that i had overstimulated her only to return her to a dreary routine was i prepared to play the rescuing good guy on a regular basis i thought of the parting lecture one of the senior professors in graduate school had given our graduating class of aspiring psychotherapists when you choose to earn your living by helping people who are in emotional pain youre also making a choice to carry them on your back for a while to hell with all that talk of taking responsibility assertiveness thats crap youre going to be coming up against helplessness every day of your lives your patients will imprint you like goslings who latch on to the first creature they see when they stick their heads out of the egg shell if you cant handle it become an accountant right now a ledger book full of numbers would have been a welcome sight i drove out to robins studio at half past seven it had been several days since id seen her and i missed her when she opened the door she was wearing a gauzy white dress that accentuated the olive tint of her skin her hair hung loose and she wore gold hoops in her ears she held out her arms to me and we embraced for a long while we walked inside still clinging together her place is an old store on pacific avenue in venice like lots of other studios nearby its unmarked the windows painted over in opaque white she led me past the front part the work area full of power tools table saw band saw drill press piles of wood instrument molds chisels gauges and templates as usual the room smelled of sawdust and glue the floor was covered with shavings she pushed open swinging double doors and we were in her living quarters sitting room kitchen sleeping loft with bath small office unlike the shop her personal space was uncluttered she had made most of the furniture herself and it was solid hardwood simple and elegant she sat me down on a soft cotton couch there was coffee and pie set out on a ceramic tray napkins plates and forks she sidled next to me i took her face in my hands and kissed her hello darling she put her arms around me i could feel the firmness of her back through the thin fabric firmness couched in yielding curving softness she worked with her hands and it always amazed me to find in her that special combination of muscles and distinctly female lushness when she moved whether manipulating a hunk of rosewood around the rapacious jaws of a band saw or simply walking it was with confidence and grace meeting her was the best thing that had ever happened to me it alone had been worth dropping out for id been browsing at mccabes the guitar shop in santa monica looking through the old sheet music trying out the instruments that hung on the walls id spied one particularly attractive guitar like my martin but even better made i admired the craftsmanship it was a handmade instrument and ran my fingers over the strings which vibrated with perfect balance and sustain taking it off the wall i played it and it sounded as good as it looked ringing like a bell like it the voice was feminine and belonged to a gorgeous creature in her mid twenties she stood close to me how long shed been there i wasnt sure id been lost in the music she had a heart shaped face topped by a luxuriant mop of auburn curls her eyes were almond shaped wide set the color of antique mahogany she was small not more than five two with slender wrists leading to delicate hands and long tapering fingers when she smiled her upper two incisors larger than the rest of her teeth flashed ivory yes i think its terrific its not that good she put her hands on her hips very definite hips she had the kind of figure small wasted busty and gently concave that couldnt be camouflaged by the overalls shed thrown on over her turtleneck oh really oh really she took the guitar from me theres a spot right here she tapped the soundboard where its been sanded too thin and the balance between headstock and box could be better she strummed a few chords all in all id give it an eight on a scale of one to ten you seem to be quite an expert on it i should be i made it she took me to her shop that afternoon and showed me the instrument she was working on this ones going to be a ten the other was one of my first you learn as you go along some weeks later she admitted it had been her way of picking me up her version of come up and see my etchings i liked the way you played such sensitivity we saw each other regularly after that i learned that she had been an only child the special daughter of a skilled cabinetmaker who had taught her everything he knew about how to transform raw wood into objects of beauty she had tried college majoring in design but the regimentation had angered her as had the fact that her dad had known more about form and function intuitively than all the teachers and books combined after he died she dropped out took the money he left her and invested in a shop in san luis obispo she got to know some local musicians who brought her their instruments to fix at first it was a sideline for she was trying to make a living designing and manufacturing custom furniture then she began to take a greater interest in the guitars banjos and mandolins that found their way to her workbench she read a few books on instrument making found she had all the requisite skills and made her first guitar it sounded great and she sold it for five hundred dollars she was hooked two weeks later she moved to la where the musicians were and set up shop when i met her she was making two instruments a month as well as handling repairs shed been written up in trade magazines and was back ordered for four months she was starting to make a living i probably loved her the first day i met her but it took me a couple of weeks to realize it after three months we started to talk about living together but it didnt happen there was no philosophical objection on either side but her place was too small for two people and my house couldnt accommodate her shop it sounds unromantic letting mundane matters like space and comfort get in the way but we were having such a good time with each other while maintaining our privacy that the incentive to make a change wasnt there often she would spend the night with me other times id collapse in her loft some evenings wed go our separate ways it wasnt a bad arrangement i sipped coffee and eyed the pie have some babe i dont want to pork out before dinner maybe we wont go out for dinner she stroked the back of my neck ooh such tension she began to knead the muscles of my upper back you havent felt this way in a long time theres a good reason for it and i told her about milos morning visit the murder melody towle when i was through she placed her hands on my shoulders alex do you really want to get into something like this do i have a choice i see that kids eyes in my sleep i was a fool for getting sucked in but now im stuck she looked at me the corners of her mouth lifted in a smile you are such a pushover and so sweet she nuzzled me under my chin i held her to me and buried my face in her hair it smelled of lemon and honey and rosewood i really love you i love you too alex we undressed each other and when we were totally naked i lifted her in my arms and carried her up the stairs to the loft not wanting to be apart from her for one second i kept my mouth fastened upon hers while i maneuvered myself on top of her she clung to me her arms and legs like tendrils we connected and i was home we slept until pm then awoke famished i went down to the kitchen and made sandwiches of italian salami and swiss cheese on rye found a jug of burgundy and toted it all back upstairs for a late supper in bed we shared garlicky kisses got crumbs in the bed hugged each other and fell back asleep we were jolted awake by the telephone robin answered it yes milo hes here no thats all right here he is she handed me the receiver and buried herself under the covers hello milo what time is it three am i sat up and rubbed my eyes through the skylight the heavens were black whats going on its the kid melody quinn shes freaked out woke up screaming bonita called towle who called me demanded you get over there he sounds pissed screw him im not his errand boy you want me to tell him that hes right here youre over there now at her place certainly neither rain nor hail nor darkness stays this trusted civil servant and all that shit were having a little party the doctor bonita me the kids sleeping towle gave her a shot of something figures the kid spilled to her mom about the hypnosis he wants you there if she wakes up again to rehypnotize or something that asshole the hypnosis didnt cause this the kids got sleep problems because of all the dope hes been shoving into her system but i was far from certain of that she had been troubled after the session on the beach im sure youre right alex i just wanted to give you the option to come down here to know what was going on if you want me to tell towle to forget it i will hold on a minute i shook my head trying to clear it did she say anything when she woke up anything coherent i just caught the tail end of it they said it was the fourth time tonight she was screaming for her daddy oh daddy daddy daddy like that but very loud it looked and sounded pretty bad alex ill be down there as soon as i can i gave the sleeping mummy next to me a kiss on the fanny got up and threw on my clothes i sped along pacific heading north the streets were empty and slick with marine mist the guide lights at the end of the pier were distant pinpoints a few trawlers sat on the horizon at this hour the sharks and other nocturnal predators would be prowling the bottom of the ocean floor i wondered how much carnage was hidden by the glossy black outer skin of the water and how many of the night hunters lurked on dry land hiding in alleys behind trash bins concealed among the leaves and twigs of suburban shrubbery wild eyed breathing hard as i drove i developed a new theory of evolution evil had its own metamorphic intelligence the sharks and the razor toothed serpents the slimy venomous things that hid in the silt hadnt given way in an orderly progression to amphibian reptile bird and mammal a single quantum leap had taken evil from water to land from shark to rapist eel to throat slasher poison slug to skull crusher with bloodlust at the core of the helix the darkness seemed to press against me insistent fetid i pushed down harder on the accelerator and forced my way through it when i got to the apartment complex milo met me at the door shes just started again i could hear it before i got to the bedroom the light was dim melody sat upright in her bed her body rigid eyes wide open but unfocused bonita sat next to her towle in sports clothes stood on the other side the child was sobbing a wounded animal sound she wailed and moaned and rocked back and forth then the moan picked up volume gradually like a siren until she was screaming her thin voice a piercing shrieking assault upon the silence daddy daddy daddy her hair was plastered against her face slick with sweat bonita tried to hold her but she flailed and struck out the mother was helpless the screaming continued for what seemed like forever then it stopped and she began moaning again oh doctor bonita pleaded shes going at it again do something towle spotted me maybe dr delaware can help his tone of voice was nasty no no i dont want him near her he caused all of this towle didnt argue with her i could have sworn he looked smug mrs quinn i began no you stay away get out her screaming set melody off and she began calling for her father again stop it bonita went for her putting her hand over the childs mouth shaking her towle and i moved at the same time we pulled her off he took her aside and said something that quieted her down i moved next to melody she was breathing hard her pupils were dilated i touched her she stiffened melody i whispered its alex youre okay youre safe as i talked she calmed down i blabbed on knowing that what i said was less important than how i said it i maintained a low rhythmic pattern of speech easy going reassuring hypnotic soon she had slipped lower in the bed i helped her lie down her hands unfolded i kept talking to her soothingly her muscles began to relax and her breathing became slow and regular i told her to close her eyes and she did i stroked her shoulder continued to talk to her to tell her everything was all right that she was safe she snuggled into a fetal position drew the covers over her and placed her thumb in her mouth turn off the light i said the room became dark lets leave her alone the three of them left now youre going to continue sleeping melody and youll have a very peaceful restful night with good dreams when you wake up in the morning youll feel very good very rested i could hear her snoring ever so slightly goodnight melody i leaned over and gave her a light kiss on the cheek she mumbled one word dada i closed the door to her room bonita was in the kitchen wringing her hands she wore a frayed mans terrycloth robe her hair had been pulled back in a bun and covered with a scarf she looked paler than i remembered as she busied herself cleaning up towle bent over his black bag he clicked it shut stood and ran his fingers through his hair seeing me he raised himself up to his full height and glared down ready to give another lecture i hope youre happy he said dont start i warned him no i told you sos you can see why i was reluctant to tamper with this childs mind nobody tampered with anything i could feel tension rising in my gut he was every hypocritical authority figure id detested he shook his head condescendingly obviously your memory needs some polishing obviously youre a sanctimonious prick the blue eyes flashed he tightened his lips what if i bring you up before the ethics committee of the state medical board you do that doctor im seriously considering it he looked like a calvinist preacher all stern and tight and self righteous you do it and well get into a little discussion on the proper use of stimulant medication with children he smiled it will take more than you to tarnish my reputation im sure it will my fists were clenched youve got legions of loyal followers like that woman in there i pointed toward the kitchen they bring their kids to you human jalopies and you tinker with them give em a quick tune up and a pill you fix them to their specifications make them nice and quiet compliant and obedient drowsy little zombies youre a goddamn hero i dont have to listen to this he moved forward no you dont hero but why dont you go in there and tell her what you really think of her piss poor protoplasm and lets see bad genes no insight he stopped in his tracks easy alex milo spoke from the corner cautiously bonita came in from the kitchen whats going on she wanted to know towle and i were facing each other like boxers after the bell he changed his manner and smiled at her charmingly nothing my dear just a professional discussion doctor delaware and i were trying to decide what was best for melody whats best is no more hypnotizing you told me that yes towle tapped his foot tried not to look uncomfortable that was my professional opinion he loved that word professional and it still is well you tell him that she pointed at me thats what we were discussing dear he must have been just a little too smooth be cause her face got tight and her voice lowered suspiciously whats to discuss i dont want him or him the second jab was at milo around here no more she turned to us you try and be a good samaritan and help the cops and you get the shaft now my babys got the seizures and shes screamin and im gonna lose my place i know im gonna lose it her face crumpled she buried it in her hands and began to cry towle moved in like a beverly hills gigolo putting his arms around her consoling her saying now now he guided her to the couch and sat her down standing over her patting her shoulder im gonna lose my place she said into her hands they dont like noise here she uncovered her face and looked wet eyed up at towle now now its going to be all right ill see to that but what about the seizures ill see to that too he gave me a sharp look full of hostility and i was sure a bit of fear she sniffled and wiped her nose on her sleeve i dont understand why she has to wake up screaming daddy daddy that bastards never been around to lift a finger or give me a cent of child support he has no love for her why does she cry for him doctor towle she looked up at him a novitiate beseeching the pope now now hes a crazy man that ronnie lee is look at this she tore the scarf from her head shook her hair loose and lowered her head exposing the top of it giving a whimper she parted the strands at the center of her crown look at this it was ugly a thick raw red scar the size of a fat worm a worm that had burrowed under her scalp and settled there the skin around it was livid and lumpy showing the results of bad surgery devoid of hair now you know why i cover it she cried he did that to me with a chainl ronnie lee quinn she spat out the name a crazy evil bastard thats the daddy daddy shes cryin out for that scum now now said towle he turned to us do you gentlemen have anything more to discuss with mrs quinn no doctor said milo and turned to leave he took hold of my arm to guide me out but i had something to say tell her doctor tell her those were not seizures they were night terrors and theyll go away by themselves if you keep her calm tell her therell be no need for phenobarbitol or dilantin or tofranil towle continued to pat her shoulder thank you for your professional opinion doctor ill manage this case as i see fit i stood there rooted come on alex milo eased me out the door the parking lot of the apartment complex was crammed full of mercedes porsches alfa romeos and datsun zs milos fiat parked in front of a hydrant looked sadly out of place like a cripple at a track meet we sat in it glum what a mess he said the bastard for a minute i thought you were going to hit him he chuckled it was tempting the bastard it looked like he was baiting you i thought you guys got along on his terms on an intellectual level we were good old boys when things fell apart he had to find a scapegoat hes an egomaniac doctor is omnipotent doctor can fix anything did you see how she worshipped him the goddamned great white father probably slit the kids wrists if he told her to youre worried about the kid arent you youre damn right i am you know exactly what hes going to do dont you more dope shell be a total space cadet in two days milo chewed on his lip after a few minutes he said well theres nothing we can do about it im sorry i pulled you into it in the first place forget it it wasnt your fault nah it was ive been lazy trying for an instant miracle on this handler mess been avoiding the old wear down the shoe leather routine question handlers associates get the list of known bad guys with razor happy fingers from the computer and plod through it go through handlers files the whole thing was iffy in the first place a seven year old kid she could have turned out to be a good witness is it ever that easy he started up the engine after three attempts sorry for ruining your night you didnt he did forget him alex assholes are like weeds a bitch to get rid of and when you do another one grows back in the same place thats what ive been doing for eight years pouring weed killer and watching them grow back faster than i can clear them away he sounded weary and looked old i got out of the car and leaned in through the window see you tomorrow what the files we have to go through handlers files ill be able to tell faster than you will which ones were dangerous youre kidding nope im carrying around a huge zeigarnik a what zeigarnik she was a russian psychologist who discovered that people develop tension for unfinished business they named it after her the zeigarnik effect like most overachievers ive got a big one he looked at me like i was talking nonsense uh huh right and this zeigarnik is big enough for you to let it intrude upon the mellow life what the hell life was getting boring i slapped him on the back suit yourself he shrugged regards to robin you give regards to your doctor if hes still there when i get back this middle of the night stuff is testing that relationship he scratched at the corner of his eye and scowled im sure hell put up with it milo oh yeah whys that if hes crazy enough to go for you in the first place hes crazy enough to stick with you thats very reassuring pal he ground the fiat into first and sped away at the time of his murder morton handler had been in practice as a psychiatrist for a little under fifteen years during that period he had consulted on or treated over two thousand patients the records of these individuals were stored in manila folders and packed one hundred and fifty to a box in cardboard cartons that were taped shut and stamped with the lapd seal milo brought these boxes to my house assisted by a slight balding black detective named delano hardy huffing and wheezing they loaded the cartons in my dining room soon it looked as if i was either moving in or moving out its not as bad as it seems milo assured me you wont have to go through all of them right del hardy lit a cigarette and nodded assent weve done some preliminary screening he said we eliminated anyone known to be deceased we figured theyd be low probability suspects the two of them laughed dark detective laughs and the coroners report he continued says handler and the girl were cut by someone with a lot of muscle the throat wound on him went clear back to the spine on the first try which means i interrupted a man could be one hell of a tough lady laughed hardy but were betting on a male there are six hundred male patients added milo those four boxes over there also said hardy we brought you a little present he gave me a small package wrapped in green and red christmas paper with a bugle and holly wreath pattern on it it was tied with red ribbon couldnt find any other paper hardy explained we hope you like it added milo i began to feel as if i were the audience for a salt and pepper comedy team a curious transformation had come over milo in the presence of another detective he had distanced himself from me and adopted the tough wiseacre banter of the veteran cop i unwrapped the box and opened it inside on a bed of cotton was a plastic coated lapd identification badge it bore a picture of me like the one on my drivers license with that strange frozen look that all official photos seem to have under the picture was my signature also from my license my name printed out my degree and the title special consultant life imitates art im touched put it on said milo make it official the badge wasnt unlike the one i had worn at western pediatric it came with a clasp i affixed it to my shirt collar very attractive said hardy that and ten cents might get you a local phone call he reached into his jacket and drew out a folded piece of paper now if youll just read and sign this he held out a pen i read it all small print this says you dont have to pay me right said hardy with mock sadness and if you get a paper cut looking over the files you cant sue the department it makes the brass happy alex said milo i shrugged and signed now said hardy youre an official consultant to the los angeles police department he folded the paper and slipped it back in his pocket just like the rooster who was jumping the bones of all the hens in the henhouse so they castrated him and turned him into a consultant thats very flattering del any friend of milo and all that milo meanwhile was opening the sealed cartons with a swiss army knife he took out files in dozens and made neat little piles that covered the dining room table these are alphabetized alex you can go through them and pull out the weird ones he finished setting things up and he and hardy got ready to go del and i will be talking to bad guys off the ncic printout weve got our work cut out for us said hardy he cracked his knuckles and looked for a place to put out his cigarette which was smoked down to the filter toss it in the sink he left to do so when we were alone milo said i really appreciate this alex dont drive yourself dont try to get it all done today ill do as many as i can before the eyes start to blur right well call you a couple of times today to see if youve got anything we can pick up while were on the road hardy came back straightening his tie he was dapper in a three piece navy worsted suit white shirt blood red tie shiny black calfskin loafers next to him milo looked more shopworn than ever in his sagging trousers and lifeless tweed sport coat you ready my man hardy asked ready onward when they were gone i put a linda ronstadt record on the turntable to the accompaniment of poor poor pitiful me i started to consult eighty percent of the male patients in the files fell into two categories affluent executive types referred by their internists due to a variety of stress related symptoms angina impotence abdominal pain chronic headaches insomnia skin rashes of unknown origins and depressed men of all ages i reviewed these and put aside the remaining percent for more detailed perusal i knew nothing about what kind of psychiatrist morton handler had been when i started but after several hours of reviewing his charts i began to build an image of him one that was far from saintly his therapy session notes were sketchy careless and so ambiguous as to be meaningless it was impossible to know from reading them what he had done during those countless forty five minute hours there was scant mention of treatment plans prognoses stress histories anything that could be considered medically or psychologically relevant this shoddiness was most evident in notes taken during the last five or six years of his life his financial records on the other hand were meticulous and detailed his fees were high his form letters to debtors strongly worded though during the last few years he had done less talking and more prescribing the rate at which he ordered medication wasnt unusual unlike towle he didnt appear to be a pusher but he wasnt much of a therapist either what really bothered me was his tendency again more common during later years to inject snide comments into the notes these which he didnt even bother to couch in jargon were nothing more than sarcastic put downs of his patients likes to alternately whimper and simper was the description of one older man with a mood disorder unlikely to be capable of anything constructive was his pronouncement on another wants therapy as camouflage for a boring meaningless life a real washout and so on by late afternoon my psychological autopsy of handler was complete he was a burnout one of the legions of worker ants who had grown to hate his chosen profession he might have cared at one time the early files were decent if not inspired but he hadnt by the end nevertheless he had kept it up day after day session after session unwilling to give up the six figure income and the perquisites of prosperity i wondered how he had occupied his time as his patients poured out their inner turmoil did he daydream engage in fantasies sexual financial sadistic plan the evenings dinner menu do mental arithmetic count sheep compute how many manic depressives could dance on the head of a pin whatever it had been it hadnt included really listening to the human beings who sat before him believing he cared it made me think of the old joke the one about the two shrinks who meet on the elevator at the end of the day one of them is young a novice and he is clearly bedraggled tie askew hair messed fraught with fatigue he turns and notices that the other a seasoned veteran is totally composed tan fit every hair in place a fresh carnation stuck jauntily in his lapel doctor beseeches the young one please tell me how you do it do what my son sit hour after hour day after day listening to peoples problems without letting it get to you who listens replies the guru funny unless you were shelling out ninety bucks a session to morton handler and getting a covert assessment as a simpering whimperer for your money had one of the subjects of his nasty prose somehow discovered the sham and murdered him it was difficult to imagine someone engaging in the kind of butchery that had been visited upon handler and his girlfriend in order to avenge a peeve of that kind but you never knew rage was a tricky thing sometimes it lay dormant for years only to be triggered by a seemingly trivial stimulus people had been ripped apart over a nudged car bumper still i found it hard to believe that the depressives and psychosomaticizers whose files i had reviewed were the stuff of which midnight skulkers were fashioned what i really didnt want to believe was that there were two thousand potential suspects to deal with it was close to five i pulled a coors out of the refrigerator took it out to the balcony and lay down on a lounge my feet propped up on the guardrail i drank and watched the sun dip beneath the tops of the trees someone in the neighborhood was playing punk rock strangely enough it didnt seem discordant at five thirty robin called hi hon you want to come over key largos on tonight sure i said should i pick up anything to eat she thought a moment how about chili dogs and beer ive got a head start on the beer three squashed coors empties sat on the kitchen counter give me time to catch up love see you around seven i hadnt heard from milo since one thirty hed called in from bellflower just about to interrogate a guy whod assaulted seven women with a screwdriver very little similarity to the handler case but you had to work with what you had i phoned west la division and left the message for him that id be out for the evening then i called bonita quinns number i waited for five rings and when nobody answered hung up humphrey and lauren were great as usual the chili dogs left us belching but satisfied we held each other and listened to tal farlow and wcs montgomery for a while then i picked up one of the guitars she had lying around the studio and played for her she listened eyes closed a faint smile on her lips then gently removed my hands from the instrument and pulled me to her i had planned to stay the night but at eleven i grew restless is anything the matter alex no just my zeigarnik tugging at me its the case isnt it i said nothing im starting to worry about you sweetie she put her head on my chest a welcome burden youve been so edgy since milo got you into all of this i never knew you before but from what you told me it sounds like the old days the old alex wasnt such a bad guy i reacted defensively she was wisely silent no i corrected myself the old alex was a bore i promise not to bring him back okay okay she kissed the tip of my chin just give me a little time to get through this all right but as i dressed she looked at me with a combination of worry hurt and confusion when i started to say something she turned away i sat down on the edge of the bed and took her in my arms i rocked her until her arms slid around my neck i love you i said give me a little time she made a warm sound and held me tighter when i left her she was sleeping her eyelids fluttering in the throes of the first dream of the night i tore into the one hundred and twenty files i had set aside working until the early morning hours most of these turned out also to be rather mundane documents ninety one of the patients were physically ill men whom handler had seen as a consultant when he was still working at cedars sinai as part of the liaison psychiatry team another twenty had been diagnosed schizophrenic but they turned out to be senile median age seventy six patients at a convalescent hospital where hed worked for a year the remaining nine men were of interest handler had diagnosed them all as psychopathic character disorders of course those diagnoses were suspect as i had little faith in his judgment nevertheless the files were worth examining more closely they were all between the ages of sixteen and thirty two most had been referred by agencies the probation department the california youth authority local churches a couple had experienced several scrapes with the law at least three were judged violent of these one had beaten up his father another had stabbed a fellow high school student and the third had used an automobile to run down someone with whom hed exchanged angry words a bunch of real sweethearts none of them had been involved in therapy for very long which was not surprising psychotherapy hasnt much to offer the person with no conscience no morals and quite often no desire to change in fact the psychopath by his very nature is an affront to modern psychology with its egalitarian and optimistic philosophical underpinnings therapists become therapists because down deep they feel that people are really good and have the capacity to change for the better the notion that there exist individuals who are simply evil bad people and that such evil cannot be explained by any existing combination of nature or nurture is an assault upon a therapists sensitivities the psychopath is to the psychologist and the psychiatrist what the terminal cancer patient is to the physician walking breathing evidence of hopelessness and failure i knew such evil people existed i had seen a mercifully small number of them mostly adolescents but some children i remember one boy in particular not yet twelve years old but possessed of a cynical hardened cruelly grinning face that would have done a san quentin lifer proud hed handed me his business card a bright rectangle of shocking pink paper with his name on it followed by the single word enterprises and an enterprising young man he had been buttressed by my assurances of confidentiality he had told me proudly of the dozens of bicycles he had stolen of the burglaries he had pulled off of the teenage girls he had seduced he was so pleased with himself he had lost his parents in a plane crash at the age of four and had been brought up by a baffled grandmother who tried to assure everyone and herself that down deep he was a good boy but he wasnt he was a bad boy when i asked him if he remembered his mother he leered and told me she looked like a real piece of ass in the pictures he had seen it wasnt defensive posturing it was really him the more time i spent with him the more discouraged i grew it was like peeling an onion and finding each inner layer more rotten than the last he was a bad boy irredeemably so most likely he would get worse and there was nothing i could do there was little doubt he would end up establishing an anti social career if society was lucky it would be limited to con games if not a lot of blood would be shed logic dictated that he should be locked up kept out of harms way incarcerated for the protection of the rest of us but democracy said otherwise and on balance i had to admit it shouldnt be any other way still there were nights when i thought of that eleven year old and wondered if id be seeing his name in the papers one day i set the nine files aside milo would have more of his work cut out for him three days of the old wear downtheshoe leather routine had worn milo down the computer was a total bust he lamented flopping down on my leather sofa all of those bastards are either back in the joint dead or alibied the coroners report has no forensic magic for us just six and a half pages of gory details telling us what we knew the first time we saw the bodies handler and gutierrez were hacked up like sausage filler i brought him a beer which he drained in two long gulps i brought him another what about handler anything on him i asked oh yeah you were definitely right in your initial impression the guy was no mr ethical but it doesnt lead anywhere what do you mean six years ago when he was doing hospital consultations there was a bit of a stink insurance fraud handler and some others were running a little scam theyd peek their heads in for a second say hello to a patient and bill it as a full visit which i take it is supposed to be forty five or fifty minutes long then theyd make a note in the chart bill for another visit talk to the nurse another visit talk to the doctor etc etc it was big bucks one guy could put in for thirty forty visits a day at seventy eighty bucks a visit figure it out no surprise its done all the time im sure anyway it blew wide open because one of the patients had a son who was a doctor and he started to get suspicious reading the chart seeing all these psychiatric visits especially cause the old man had been unconscious for three months he griped to the medical director who called handler and the others in on the carpet they kept it quiet on the condition that the crooked shrinks leave six years ago just before handlers notes had started to get slipshod and sarcastic it must have been hard going from four hundred grand a year to a measly one hundred and having to actually work for it a man could get bitter and you dont see an angle in that what revenge from whom it was insurance companies that were getting bilked thats how they kept it going so long they never billed the patients just billed insurance he took a swig of beer ive heard bad things about insurance companies pal but i cant see them sending around jack the ripper to avenge their honor i see what you mean he got up and paced the room this goddamn case sucks its been a week and ive got absolutely zilch the captain sees it as a dead end hes pulled del off and left me with the whole stinking mess tough breaks for the faggot another beer i held one out to him yeah goddammit why not drown it all in suds he wheeled around i tell you alex i should have been a schoolteacher viet nam left me with this big psychic hole you know all that death for nothing i thought becoming a cop would help me fill that hole catch bad guys make some sense out of it all jesus was i wrong he grabbed the coors out of my hand tilted it over his mouth and let some of the foam dribble down his chin the things that i see the monstrous things that we supposed humans do to each other the shit ive become inured to sometimes it makes me want to puke he drank silently for a few minutes youre a goddamn good listener alex all that training wasnt for naught one good turn my friend yeah right now that you mention it hickle was another shitty case i never convinced myself that was suicide it stunk to high heaven you never told me whats to tell ive no evidence just a gut feeling ive got lots of gut feelings some of them gnaw at me and keep me up at night to paraphrase del my gut feelings and ten cents he crushed the empty can between his thumb and forefinger with the ease of someone pulverizing a gnat hickle stunk to high heaven but i had no evidence so i wrote it off like a bad debt no one argued no one gave a shit just like no onell give a shit when we write off handler and the gutierrez girl keep the records tidy wrap it up seal it and kiss it goodbye seven more beers another half hour of ranting and punishing himself and he was stoned drunk he crashed on the leather sofa going down like a b with a bellyful of shrapnel i slipped his shoes off and placed them on the floor beside him i was about just to leave him that way when i realized it had turned dark i called his home number a deep rich male voice answered hello hello this is alex delaware milos friend yes wariness the psychologist yes milos spoken of you im rick silverman the doctor the mothers dream now had a name i just called to let you know that milo stopped by here after work to discuss a case and he got kind of intoxicated i see i felt an absurd urge to explain to the man at the other end that there was really nothing going on between milo and me that we were just good friends i suppressed it actually he got stoned had eleven beers hes sleeping it off now i just wanted you to know thats very considerate of you silverman said acidly ill wake him if youd like no thats quite all right milos a big boy hes free to do as he pleases no need to check in i wanted to tell him listen you insecure spoiled brat i just called to do you a favor to set your mind at ease dont hand me any of your delicate indignation instead i tried flattery okay just thought id call you to let you know rick i know how important you are to milo and i thought hed want me to uh thanks i really appreciate it bingo please excuse me ive just come off a twenty four hour shift myself no problem id probably woken the poor devil listen how about if we get together some time you and milo and my girlfriend and myself id like that alex sure send the big slob home when he sobers up and well work out the details will do good talking to you likewise he sighed goodnight at nine thirty milo awoke with a wretched look on his face he started to moan turning his head from side to side i mixed tomato juice a raw egg black pepper and tabasco in a tall glass propped him up and poured it down his throat he gagged sputtered and opened his eyes suddenly as if a bolt of lightning had zapped him in the taiibone forty minutes later he looked every bit as wretched but he was painfully sober i got him to the door and stuck the files of the nine psychopaths under his arm bedtime reading milo he tripped down the stairs swearing made his way to the fiat groped at its door handle and threw himself in with a single lurching movement with the aid of a rolling start he got it ignited alone at last i got into bed read the times watched tv but damned if i could tell you what i saw other than that it had lots of flat punch lines and jiggling boobs and cops who looked like male models i enjoyed the solitude for a couple of hours only pausing to think of murder and greed and twisted evil minds a few times before drifting off to sleep all right said milo we were sitting in an interrogation room at west la division the walls were pea green paint and one way mirrors a microphone hung from the ceiling the furniture consisted of a gray metal table and three metal folding chairs there was a stale odor of sweat and falsehood and fear in the air the stink of diminished human dignity he had fanned out the folders on the table and picked up the first one with a flourish heres the way your nine bad guys shape up number one rex alien camblin incarcerated at sole dad assault and battery he let the folder drop number two peter lewis jefferson working on a ranch in wyoming presence verified pity the poor cattle thats a fact he looked like a likely one number three darwin ward youll never believe this attending law school pennsylvania state university a psychopathic attorney not all that amazing really milo chuckled and picked up the next folder numero cuatro uh leonard jay helsinger working construction on the alaska pipeline location likewise confirmed by juneau pd five michael penn student at cal state northridge him we talk to he put penns file aside six lance arthur shattuck short order cook on the cunard line luxury cruiser helena verified by the coast guard to have been floating around in the middle of the aegean sea somewhere for the past six weeks seven maurice bruno sales

last but not least gerard paul mendenhall corporal united states army tyler texas presence verified beverly hills was closer than either northridge or burbank so we headed for thriftys the beverly hills branch turned out to be a brick and glass cube on canon drive just north of wilshire it shared a block with trendy boutiques and a haagen dazs ice cream parlor milo showed his badge surreptitiously to the girl behind the liquor counter and got the manager a light skinned middle aged black in seconds flat the manager got nervous and wanted to know if longstreth had done anything wrong in classic cop style milo hedged we just want to ask him a few questions i had trouble keeping a straight face through that one but the cliche seemed to satisfy the manager hes not here now he comes on at two thirty works the night shift well be back please dont tell him we were here milo gave him his card when we left he was studying it like a map to buried treasure the ride to northridge was a half hour cruise on the ventura freeway west when we got to the cal state campus we headed straight for the registrars office milo obtained a copy of michael penns class schedule armed with that and his mug shot we located him in twenty minutes walking across a wide grassy triangle accompanied by a girl mr penn yes he was a good looking fellow medium height with broad shoulders and long legs his light brown hair was cut preppy short he wore a light blue izod shirt and blue jeans penny loafers with no socks i knew from his file that he was twenty six but he looked five years younger he had a pleasant unlined face a real all american type he didnt look like the kind of guy whod try to run someone down with a pontiac firebird police again the badge wed like to talk to you for a few moments what about the hazel eyes narrowed and the mouth got tight wed prefer to talk to you in private penn looked at the girl she was young no more than nineteen short dark with a dorothy hamill wedge cut give me a minute julie he chucked her under the chin mike just a minute we left her standing there and walked to a concrete area furnished with stone tables and benches students moved by as if on a treadmill there was little standing around this was a commuter campus many of the students worked part time jobs and squeezed classes in during their spare time it was a good place to get your ba in computer science or business a teaching credential or a masters in accounting if you wanted fun or leisurely intellectual debates in the shade of an ivy encrusted oak forget it michael penn looked furious but he was working hard at concealing it what do you want whens the last time you saw dr morton handler penn threw back his head and laughed it was a disturbingly hollow sound that asshole i read about his death no loss when did you see him last penn was smirking now years ago officer he made the title sound like an insult when i was in therapy i take it you didnt think much of him handler he was a shrink as if that explained it you dont think much of psychiatrists penn held out his hands palms up hey listen that whole thing was a big mistake i lost control of my car and some paranoid idiot claimed i tried to kill him with it they busted me railroaded me and then they offered me probation if i saw a shrink gave me all those garbage tests those garbage tests included the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory and a handful of project ives though far from perfect they were reliable enough when it came to someone like penn i had read his mmpi profile and psychopathy oozed from every index you didnt like dr handler dont put words in my mouth penn lowered his voice he moved his eyes back and forth restless jumpy behind the handsome face was something dark and dangerous handler hadnt misdiagnosed this one you did like him milo played with him like a gaffed stingray i didnt like him or dislike him i had no use for him im not crazy and i didnt kill him you can account for your whereabouts the night he was murdered when was that milo gave him the date and time penn cracked his knuckles and looked through us as if zeroing in on a distant target sure that entire night i was with my girl julie penn laughed her no ive got a mature woman officer a woman of means his brow creased and his expression changed from smug to sour youre going to have to talk to her arent you milo nodded his head thatll screw things up for me gee mike thats really too bad penn threw him a hateful look then changed it to bland innocence he could play his face like a deck of cards shuffling palming from the bottom coming up with a new number every second listen officer that whole incident is behind me im holding down a job going to school im getting my degree in six months i dont want to get messed up because my names in handlers files he sounded like wally on leave it to beaver all earnest innocence gosh beave well have to verify your alibi mike okay okay do it just dont tell her too much okay keep it general keep it general so i can fabricate something you could see the gears spinning behind the high tan forehead sure mike milo took his pencil out and tapped it on his lips sonya magary she owns the puff n stuff childrens boutique in the plaza de oro in encino have you got the number handy milo asked pleasantly penn clenched his jaws and gave it to him well call her mike dont you call her first okay we treasure spontaneity milo put away his pencil and closed his notepad have a nice day now penn looked from me to milo then back to me as if seeking an ally then he got up and walked away in long muscular strides oh mike milo called penn turned around what are you getting your degree in marketing as we left the campus we could see him walking with julie her head was on his shoulder his arm around her waist he was smiling down on her and talking very fast what do you think milo asked as he settled behind the wheel i think hes innocent as far as this case goes but ill bet you hes got some kind of dirty deal going on he was really relieved when he found out what we were there for milo nodded i agree but what the hell thats someone elses headache we got back on the freeway heading east we exited in sherman oaks found a little french place on ventura near woodman and had lunch milo used the pay phone to call sonya magary he came back to the table shaking his head she loves him that dear boy that sweet boy i hope hes not in trouble he imitated a thick hungarian accent she verifies he was with her on the fateful night sounds proud of it i expected her to tell me about their sex life in technicolor he shook his head and buried his face in a plate of steamed mussels we caught up with roy longstreth as he got out of his toyota in the thriftys parking lot he was short and frail looking with watery blue eyes and an undernourished chin prematurely bald what little hair he did have was on the sides he had left it long hanging down over his ears so that the general effect was of a friar whod been meditating too long and had neglected his personal grooming a mousy brown mustache snuck across his upper lip he had none of penns bravado but there was that same jumpiness in the eyes yes what do you want he piped up in a squeaky voice after milo gave him the badge routine he looked at his watch when milo told him he looked as if he were going to cry uncharacteristic anxiety for a supposed psychopath unless the whole thing was an act you never knew the tricks those types could come up with when they had to when i read about it i just knew youd come after me the insignificant mustache trembled like a twig in a storm whys that roy because of the things he said about me he told my mother i was a psychopath told her not to trust me im probably on some whacko list right can you account for your whereabouts the night he was killed yes thats the first thing i thought of when i read about it theyre going to come and ask me questions about it i made sure i knew i even wrote it down wrote a note to myself roy you were at church that night so when they come and ask you youll know where you were he could have gone on that way for a couple of days but milo cut him off church youre a religious man roy longstreth gave a laugh that was choked with panic no no not praying the westside singles group at bel air presbyterian its the same place ronald reagan used to go to the singles group no no no the church he used to worship there before he was elected and okay ron you were at the westside singles group from when to when the sight of milo taking notes made him even more nervous he began bouncing up and down a marionette at the hands of a palsied puppeteer from nine to one thirty i stayed to the end i helped clean up i can tell you what they served it was guacamole and nachos and there was gallo jug wine and shrimp dip and of course therell be lots of people who saw you there sure he said then stopped i i didnt really mingle much i helped out tending bar i saw lots of people but i dont know if any of them will remember me his voice had quieted to a whisper that could be a problem roy unless no yes mrs heatherington shes an older woman she volunteers at church functions she was cleaning up too and serving i spent a lot of time talking to her i can even tell you what we talked about it was about collectibles she collects norman rockwells and i collect icarts icarts you know the art deco prints the works of louis icart went for high prices these days i wondered how a pharmacist could afford them mother gave me one when i was sixteen and they he searched for the right word captivated me she gives them to me on my birthday and i pick up a few myself dr handler collected them too you know that he let his words trail off oh really did he show you his collection longstreth shook his head energetically no he had one in his office i noticed it and we started talking but he used it against me later on hows that after the evaluation you know i was sent to him by the court after i was caught he looked nervously at the thriftys building shoplifting tears filled his eyes for gods sake i took a tube of rubber cement at sears and they caught me i thought mother would die from the shame and i worried the school of pharmacy would find out it was horrible how did he use the fact that you collected icarts against you asked milo patiently he kind of implied never came out and said it but phrased it so you knew what he meant but he couldnt be pinned down implied what roy that he could be bought off that if i bribed him with an icart or two he even mentioned the ones he liked he would write a favorable report did you what bribe him not on your life that would be dishonest and did he press the issue longstreth picked at his fingernails like i said not so you could pin him down he just said that i was a borderline case psychopathic personality or something less stigmatizing anxiety reaction or something like that that i could go either way in the end he told mother i was a psychopath the wan face screwed up with rage im glad hes dead there ive said it its what i thought the first time i read about it in the paper but you didnt do it of course not i couldnt i run from evil i dont embrace it well talk to mrs heatherington roy yes ask her about the nachos and the wine i believe it was gallo hearty burgundy and there was fruit punch with slices of orange floating in it too in a cut glass bowl and one of the women got sick on the floor at the end i helped mop it up thanks roy you can go now yes i will he turned around like a robot a thin figure in a short blue druggists smock and walked into thriftys hes dispensing drugs i asked incredulous if hes not in some whacko file he should be milo pocketed his notepad and we walked to the car he look like a psychopath to you not unless hes the best actor on the face of the earth schizoid withdrawn pre schizophrenic if anything dangerous who knows put him up against enough stress and he might blow but id judge him more likely to go the hermit route curl up in bed play with himself wither stay that way for a decade or two while mommy propped his pillows if that story about the icarts is true it sheds some light on our beloved victim handler a real dr schweitzer yeah said milo the kind of guy someone might want dead we got on coldwater canyon before it clogged with the cars of commuters returning to their homes in the valley and made it to burbank by half past four presto instant print was one of scores of gray concrete edifices that filled the industrial park near the burbank airport like so many oversized tombstones the air smelled toxic and the flatulent roar of jets shattered the sky at regular intervals i wondered about the life expectancy of those who spent their daylight hours here maurice bruno had come up in the world since his file had been compiled he was now a vice president in charge of sales he was also unavailable we were told by his secretary a lissome brunette with arched eyebrows and a mouth meant for saying no then give me his boss barked milo he shoved his badge under her nose we were both hot and tired and discouraged the last place we wanted to be stalled was burbank that would be mr gershman she said as if discovering some new insight then that would be who i want to talk to just one second she wiggled off and came back with her clone in a blond wig im mr gershmans secretary the clone announced it must be the poison in the air i decided it caused brain damage eroded the cerebral cortex to the point where simple facts took on an aura of profundity milo took a deep breath wed like to talk with mr gershman may i inquire what its about no you may not bring us to gershman now yes sir the two secretaries looked at each other then the brunette pushed a buzzer and the blonde led us through double glass doors into an enormous production area filled with machines that chomped stamped bit snarled and smeared a few people hung around the periphery of the rabid steel monsters dull eyed loose jawed breathing in fumes that reeked of alcohol and acetone the noise alone was enough to kill you she made a sudden left probably hoping to lose us to the maws of one of the behemoths but we hung on following the movement of her swaying butt until we came to another set of double doors these she pushed and let go forcing milo to fall forward to catch them a short corridor another set of doors and we were confronted by silence so complete as to be overwhelming the executive suite at presto instant print might have been on another planet plush plum colored carpets that you had to bargain with in order to re claim your ankles walls paneled in real walnut large doors of walnut burl with names made of brass letters tastefully centered on the wood and silence the blonde stopped at the end of the hall in front of an especially large door with especially tasteful gold letters that said arthur m gershman president she let us into a waiting room the size of an average house motioned us to sit in chairs that looked and felt like unbaked bread dough settling behind her desk a contraption of plexiglass and rosewood that afforded the world a perfect view of her legs she pushed a button on a console that belonged at nasa control center moved her lips a bit nodded and stood up again mr gershman will see you now the inner sanctum was as expected the size of a cathedral decorated like something conceived in the pages of architectural digest softly lit and comfortable but hard edged enough to keep you awake but the man behind the desk was a complete surprise he wore khaki pants and a short sleeved white shirt that needed ironing his feet were clad in hush puppies and since they were on the desk the holes in their soles were obvious he was in his mid seventies bald bespectacled with one of the sidepieces of his glasses held together with masking tape and potbellied he was talking on the phone when we came in hold the wire lenny he looked up thanks denise the blonde disappeared to us one second sit down fix something he pointed to a fully stocked bar that covered half of one wall okay lenny i got cops here gotta go yeah cops i dont know you wanna ask em ha ha yeah ill tell em that for sure you momzer ill tell em what you did in palm springs the last time we were there yeah okay the sahara job in lots of three hundred thousand with coasters and matchbooks not boxes books i got it i give you delivery in two weeks what forget

sam and shirley and my prince of a son who drives a german car nah nah a bmw with my money yeah what can you do its out of control ten days he made a masturbating motion with his free hand and beamed at us youre jerking off lenny at least close the door no one will see twelve days tops okay twelve it is right gotta go these cossacks are going to drag me away any minute goodbye the phone slammed down the man shot up like an uncoiled spring artie gershman he held out an ink stained hand milo shook it then i did it was as hard as granite and horned with callus he sat down again threw his feet back up on the desk sorry for the delay he had the joviality of someone who was surrounded by enough automatons like denise to ensure his privacy you deal with casinos they think they got a right to instant everything thats the mob you know but what the hell am i telling you that youre cops you know that right now what can i do for you officers the parking situation i know is a problem if its that bastard at chemco next door complaining all i want to say is he can go straight to hell in a handbasket because his mexican ladies park in my lot all the time you should also check how many of them are legal if he wants to get really nasty i can play that game too he paused to catch his breath its not about parking no what then we want to talk to maurice bruno morry morrys in vegas we do a lot of our business there with the casinos the motels and hotels here he opened a drawer of the desk and tossed a handful of matchbooks at us most of the big names were represented milo pocketed a few when will he be back in a few days he went on a selling trip two weeks ago first to tahoe then reno end up in vegas probably playing around a bit on company time not to mention the expense account but who cares hes a terrific salesman i thought he was a vice president vice president in charge of sales its a salesman with a fancy title a bigger salary a nicer office what do you think of this place looks like some fag fixed it up right i searched milos face for a reaction found none my wife she did this herself this place used to be nice there was papers all over the place a couple of chairs white walls normal walls so you could hear the noise from the plant know something was going on this feels like death you know thats what i get for taking a second wife a first wife leaves you alone a second one wants to make you into a new person are you sure mr brunos in las vegas why shouldnt i be sure where else would he go how long has mr bruno been working for you mr gershman hey whats this this isnt child support or something like that no we just want to talk to him about a homicide investigation were conducting homicide gershman shot out of his chair murder morry bruno you got to be kidding hes a gem of a guy a gem who had been excellent at passing rubber checks how long has he been working for you sir let me see a year and a half maybe two and youve had no problem with him problem i tell you hes a gem knew nothing about the business but i hired him on hunch hell of a salesman outsold all the other guys even the old timers by the fourth month reliable friendly never a problem you mentioned child support mr brunos divorced divorced said gershman sadly like everyone including my son they give up too easily nowadays does he have family here in los angeles nah the wife kids three of em i think they moved back east pittsburgh or cleveland some place with no ocean he missed em talked about it thats why he volunteered at the casa casa that kids place up in malibu morry used to spend his weekends there volunteering with the kids he got a certificate cmon ill show you brunos office was a quarter the size of gersh mans but decked out in the same eclectically elegant style the place was neat as a pin not surprising since bruno spent most of his time on the road gershman pointed to a framed plaque that shared wall space with a half dozen number one salesman commendations you see jawarded to maurice bruno in recognition of voluntary service to the homeless children of la casa de los nines blah blah blah i told you he was a gem the certificate was signed by the mayor as honorary witness and by the director of the childrens home a reverend augustus j mccaffrey it was all calligraphy and floral intaglio very impressive very nice said milo do you know what hotel mr bruno was staying at he used to stay at the mgm but after the fire i dont know lets go back to the office and find out back in office beautiful gershman picked up the telephone punched the intercom and barked into the receiver denise wheres morry staying in vegas do that a half minute later the intercom buzzed yeah good thanks darling he turned to us the palace caesars palace yeah you want me to call there you can talk to him if you dont mind sir well charge it to the police department nah gershman waved his hand on me denise call caesars palace get morry on the phone hes not there leave him a message to call detective sturgis west la division gershman completed the instructions youre not thinking about morry as a suspect are you he asked when he got off the phone this is a witness thing right we really cant say anything about it mr gersh man milo paid lip service to discretion i cant believe it gershman slapped his head with his hand you think morrys a murderer a guy who works with kids on the weekend a guy who never had a cross word with anybody here go ask around i give you permission you find someone who has a bad word to say about morry bruno ill eat this desk he was interrupted by the intercom buzzer yes denise whats that youre sure maybe it was a mistake check again and then call the aladdin the sands maybe he changed his mind the old mans face was solemn when he hung up hes not at the palace he said it with the sadness and fear of someone about to be torn from the comforting warmth of his preconceptions maurice bruno wasnt at the aladdin or the sands or any other major hotel in las vegas additional calls from gershmans office revealed the fact that none of the airlines had a record of him flying from la to vegas id like his home address and phone number please denise will give it to you said gershman we left him sitting alone in his big office grizzled chin resting in his hands frowning like a battered old bison whod spent too many years at the zoo bruno lived in glendale normally a ten minute drive from the presto plant but it was pm there had been an accident just west of the hollywood golden state interchange and the freeway was stagnant all the way from burbank to pasadena by the time we exited on brand it was dark and both of us were in foul moods milo turned north and headed toward the mountains brunos house was on armelita a side street half a mile from where the boulevard ended it was situated at the end of a cul de sac a small one story mock tudor fronted by a neat square lawn yew hedges and sprigs of juniper stuffed in the empty spaces two large arborvitae bushes guarded the entrance it wasnt the kind of place i would have imagined for a vegas haunting bachelor then i remembered what gershman had said about the divorce no doubt this was the homestead left behind by the fleeing wife and children milo rang the doorbell a couple of times then he knocked hard when no one answered he went to the car and called the glendale police ten minutes later a squad car pulled up and two uniformed officers got out both were tall beefy and sandy haired and wore bushy bristly mustaches under their noses they came over with that swagger unique to cops and drunks trying hard to look sober and conferred with milo then they got on their radio the street was quiet and devoid of visible human habitation it stayed that way as the three additional squad cars and the unmarked dodge drove up and parked there was a brief conference that resembled a football huddle and then guns were drawn milo rang the bell again waited a minute and then kicked the door in the assault was on i stayed outside watching waiting soon the sound of gagging and retching could be heard then cops began running out of the house spilling out on the lawn their hands to their noses an action sequence in reverse one particularly stalwart patrolman busied himself puking into the junipers when it appeared that theyd all retreated milo came to the door a handkerchief held over his nose and mouth his eyes were visible and they made contact with me they gave me a choice against my better judgment i pulled out my own handkerchief masked the lower part of my face and went in the thin cotton was scant defense against the hot stench that rose up against me as i stepped across the threshold it was as if raw sewage and swamp gas had blended into a bubbling swirling soup then vaporized and sprayed into the air my eyes watering i fought the urge to vomit and followed milos advancing silhouette into the kitchen he was sitting there at a formica table the bottom part of him the part in clothing still looked human the sky blue salesmans suit the maize colored button down shirt with blue silk foulard the dandys touches the breast pocket hankie the shoes with tiny tassles the gold bracelet that hung around a wrist teeming with maggots from the neck up he was something the pathologists threw out it looked as if hed been worked over with a crowbar the entire front part of what used to be his face was caved in but it was really impossible to know what the swollen bloody lump attached to his shoulders had been subjected to so advanced was the state of decay milo began throwing open windows and i realized that the house felt as hot as a blast furnace fueled by the hydrocarbons emitted by decomposing organic matter a quick answer to the energy crisis save kilowatts kill a friend i couldnt take any more i ran for the door gasping and flung away the handkerchief when i reached the outdoors i gulped hungrily at the cool night air my hands shook there was lots of excitement on the block now neighbors men women and children had come out of their castles pausing in the middle of the evening news interrupting their defrosted feasts to gawk at the blinking crimson lights and listen to the stuttering radio static of the squad car staring at the coroners van that had pulled up to the curb with the cold authority of a parading despot a few kids rode their bikes up and down the street mumbling voices took on the sound of ravaging locusts a dog barked welcome to suburbia i wondered where theyd all been when someone had gotten into brunos house battered him into jelly closed all the windows and left him to rot milo finally came out looking green he sat on the front steps and hung his head between his knees then he got up and called the attendants from the coroners office over they had come prepared with gas masks and rubber gloves they went in with an empty stretcher and came out carrying something wrapped in a black plastic sheath ugh gross said a teenage girl to her friend it was as eloquent a way to put it as any three mornings after we discovered the butchery of bruno milo wanted to come over to review the salesmans psychiatric file in detail i postponed it until the afternoon motivated by instincts that were unclear to me i called andre jaroslav at his studio in west hollywood and asked him if he had time to help me refresh my karate skills doctor he said the accent as thick as goulash such a long time since i see you i know andre too long ive let myself go but i hope you can help me he laughed tsk tsk i have intermediate group at eleven and private lessons at twelve then i am going to hawaii doctor to choreograph fight scenes for new television pilot girl police person who knows judo and catches rapists what do you think very original ya i get to work with the redheaded chickie this shandra layne to teach her how to throw around large men like wonder woman ya ya do you have any time before eleven for you doctor certainly we get you in shape come at nine and i give you two hours the institute of martial arts was located on santa monica at doheny next to the troubador nightclub it was an la institution predating the kung fu craze by fifteen years jaroslav was a bandy legged czech jew whod escaped during the fifties he had a high squeaky voice that he attributed to having been shot in the throat by the nazis the truth was that hed been born with the vocal register of a hysterical capon it hadnt been easy being a squeaky voiced jew in postwar prague jaroslav had developed his own way of coping starting as a boy he taught himself physical culture weight lifting and the arts of self defense by the time he was in his twenties he had total command of every martial arts doctrine from saber fencing to hopkaido and a lot of bullies received painful surprises he greeted me at the door naked from the waist up a spray of daffodils in his hand the sidewalk was filled with anorectic individuals of ambiguous gender hugging guitar cases as if they were life preservers dragging deeply on cigarettes and regarding the passing traffic with spaced out apprehension audition he squeaked pointing a finger at the door to the troubador and glancing at them scornfully the artisans of a new age doctor we went into the studio which was empty he placed the flowers in a vase the practice room was an expanse of polished oak floor bordered by whitewashed walls autographed photographs of stars and near stars hung in clusters i went into a dressing room with the set of stiff white garments he gave me and emerged looking like an extra in a bruce lee movie jaroslav was silent letting his body and his hands talk he positioned me in the center of the studio and stood facing me he smiled faintly we bowed to each other and he led me through a series of warm up exercises that made my joints creak it had been a long time when the introductory katas were through we bowed again he smiled then proceeded to wipe the floor with me at the end of one hour i felt as if id been stuffed down a garbage disposal every muscle fiber ached every synapse quivered in exquisite agony he kept it up smiling and bowing sometimes letting out a perfectly controlled high pitched scream tossing me around like a bean bag by the end of the second hour pain had ceased to be obtrusive it had become a way of life a state of consciousness but when we stopped i was starting to feel in command of my body once again i was breathing hard stretching blinking my eyes burned as the perspiration dripped into them jaroslav looked as if hed just finished reading the morning paper you take a hot bath doctor get some chickie to massage you use a little witch hazel and remember practice practice practice i will andre you call me when i get back in a week i tell you about shandra layne and check if youve been practicing he poked a finger in my gut playfully its a deal he held out his hand i reached out to take it then tensed wondering if he was going to throw me again ya good he said then he laughed and let me go the throbbing agony made me feel righteous and ascetic i had lunch at a restaurant run by one of the dozens of quasi hindu cults that seem to prefer los angeles to calcutta a vacant eyed perpetually smiling girl swaddled in white robes and burnoose took my order she had a rich kids face coupled with the mannerisms of a nun and managed to smile while she talked smile as she wrote smile as she walked away i wondered if it hurt i finished a plate heaped with chopped lettuce sprouts refried soya beans and melted goat cheese on chapati bread a sacred tost ada and washed it down with two glasses of pineapple coconut guava nectar imported from the holy desert of mojave the bill came to ten dollars and thirty nine cents that explained the smiles i made it back to the house just as milo pulled up in an unmarked bronze matador the fiat finally died he explained im having it cremated and scattering the ashes over the offshore rigs in long beach my condolences i picked up brunos file contributions to the down payment on my next lemon will be accepted in lieu of flowers get dr silverman to buy you one im working on it he let me read for a few minutes then asked so what do you think no profound insights bruno was referred to handler by the probation department after the bad check bust handler saw him a dozen times over a four month period when the probationary period was over so was the treatment one thing i did notice was that handlers notes on him are relatively benign bruno was one of the more recently acquired patients at the time he started therapy handler was at his nastiest yet there are no vicious comments about him here in the beginning handler calls him a slick con man i flipped some pages a couple of weeks later he makes a crack about brunos cheshire grin but after that nothing as if they became buddies why do you say that milo handed me a piece of paper here he said look at this it was a printout from the phone company this he pointed to a circled seven digit code is handlers number his home number not the office and this one is brunos lines had been drawn between the two like lacing on a high topped shoe thered been lots of connections over the last six months interesting huh very heres something else officially the coroner says its impossible to fix a time of death for bruno the heat inside the house screwed up the decomposition tables with the flack theyve been getting theyre not willing to go out on a limb and take the chance of being wrong but i got one of the young guys to give me an off the record guess and he came up with ten to twelve days right around the time handler and gutierrez were murdered either right before or right after but what about the differing mos who says people are consistent alex frankly there are other differences between the two cases besides mo in brunos case it looks like forced entry we found broken bushes under a rear window and chisel marks on the pane used to be a kids room glendale pd also thinks theyve got two sets of heel prints two maybe melody really saw something dark men two or three maybe but ive abandoned that line of attack the kid will never be a reliable witness in any event despite the discrepancies it looks like we might be on to something what i dont know patient and doctor concrete proof that they maintained some kind of contact after treatment was over both ripped off around the same time its too cute for coincidence he studied his notes looking scholarly i thought about handler and bruno and then it hit me milo weve been held back in our thinking by social roles what the hell are you talking about roles social roles prescribed sets of behaviors like doctor and patient psychiatrist and psychopath what are the characteristics of a psychopath lack of conscience right and an inability to relate to other people except by exploiting them the good ones have a glib smooth facade often theyre good looking usually above average intelligence sexually manipulative a predilection to engage in cons blackmail frauds milos eyes opened wide handler of course weve been thinking of him as the doctor in the case and assuming psychological normalcy hes been protected in our eyes by his role but take a closer look what do we know about him he was involved in insurance fraud he tried to blackmail roy longstreth using his power as a psychiatrist he seduced at least one patient elaine gutierrez and who knows how many more and those putdowns in the margins of his notes at first i thought they were evidence of burnout but now i dont know that was cold pretending to listen to people taking their money insulting them his notes were confidential he never expected anyone else to read them he could hang it all out show his true colors milo i tell you the guy comes across like your classic psychopath the evil doctor not exactly a rara avis is it if there can be a mengele why not scores of morton handlers what better facade for an intelligent psychopath than the title of doctor it yields instant prestige and credibility psychopathic doctor and psychopathic patient he mulled it over not buddies but partners in crime sure psychopaths dont have buddies only victims and accomplices bruno must have been handlers dream come true if he was plotting something and needed one of his own kind for help ill bet you those first sessions were incredible the two of them hungry hyenas checking each other out looking over their shoulders sniffing the ground why bruno in particular handler treated other psychopaths they were too crude short order cooks cowboys construction workers handler needed a smooth type besides how do we know how many of those guys were deliberately misdiagnosed like longstreth just to play devils advocate for one second one of those jokers was in law school i thought about it for a minute too young in handlers eyes a callow punk in a few years with degree in hand and a veneer of sophistication maybe handler needed a businessman type for what he wanted to pull off someone really slick and bruno appears to have fit that bill he fooled gershman whos no idiot milo got up and paced the room running his fingers through his hair creating a birds nest its definitely appealing shrinker and shrinkee pulling off a scam he seemed amused its not the first time milo there was a guy back east a few years ago very good credentials married into a rich family and started a clinic for juvenile delinquents back when they still called them that he used his in laws social connections to organize fund raising soirees for the clinic while the champagne flowed the jds were busy burglarizing the partygoers townhouses they finally caught him with a warehouse full of silver and crystal furs and rugs he didnt even need the stuff he was doing it for the challenge they sent him away to one of those discreet institutions in the rolling hills of southern maryland for all i know hes running the place by now it never hit the papers i found out about it through the professional grapevine convention gossip milo pulled out his pencil he started writing thinking out loud to the marble corridors of high finance bank records brokerage statements businesses filed under fictitious names see whats left in the safe deposit boxes after the irs has done its dirty work county assessor for info on property ventures insurance claims out of handlers office he stopped i hope this gets me somewhere alex this goddamn case hasnt helped my status in the department the captain is aiming for promotion and he wants to show more arrests handler and gutierrez werent ghetto types he can afford to let fade away and hes running scared that glendale will solve bruno first and make us look like shmucks you remember bianchi i nodded a small town police chief in bellingham washington had caught the hillside strangler something the lapd war machine hadnt been able to do he got up went into the kitchen and ate half of a cold chicken standing over the sink he washed it down with a quart of orange juice and came back wiping his mouth i dont know why im fighting not to laugh up to my ass in dead bodies and no apparent progress but it seems so funny handler and bruno you send a guy to a shrink to get his head straight and the doc is as fucked up as the patient and systematically puts the warp on him put that way it didnt sound funny he laughed anyway what about the girl he asked gutierrez what about her well i was thinking about those social roles weve been looking at her as the innocent bystander if handler could connive with one patient why not with two its not impossible but we know bruno was psychopathic any of that kind of evidence about her no he admitted we looked for handlers file on her and couldnt find it maybe he shredded it when their relationship changed do you guys do that i wouldnt know i never slept with my patients or their mothers dont be touchy i tried to interview her family the old plump mamacita two brothers one of em with those angry macho eyes theres no father he died ten years ago the three of them live in a tiny place in echo park when i got there they were in the middle of mourning the place was full of the girls pictures in shrines lots of candles baskets of food weeping neighbors the brothers were sullen mama barely spoke english i made a serious attempt to be sensitive culturally aware and all that i borrowed sanchez from ramparts division to translate we brought food kept a low profile i got nada hear no evil speak no evil i honestly dont think they knew much about elenas life to them west las as distant as atlantis but even if they did they sure as hell werent going to tell me even i asked if it would help find her murderer he looked at me wearily alex people like that dont think the police can help them to them la policia are the bastards who roust their cholos and insult their home girls and are never around when the low riders cruise the neighborhood at night with their lights off and pop shotgun shells through bedroom windows which reminds me i interviewed a friend of the girl her roommate also a teacher this one was outwardly hostile made it clear she wanted nothing to do with me her brother had been killed five years ago in a gang shootout and the police did nothing for her and her family then so to hell with me now he got up and padded around the room like a tired lion in summation elaine gutierrez is a cipher but theres nothing to indicate she wasnt as pure as the freshly driven snow he looked miserable plagued with self doubt its a tough case milo dont be so hard on yourself its funny you should say that thats what my mother used to tell me go easy milo bernard dont be such a profectionist that was the way she pronounced it the whole family had a tradition of low personal expectations drop out of school in tenth grade go to work at the foundry lay out a life for yourself of plastic dishes tv church picnics and steel splinters that stuck in your skin after thirty years enough pension and disability to give you a weekend in the ozarks once in a while if youre lucky my dad did it his dad and both of my brothers the sturgis game plan but not the profectionist for one the game plan worked best if you got married and id been liking boys since i was nine and second this was more important i figured i was too smart to do what the rest of those peasants were doing so i broke the mold shocked them all and the hotshot who everyone thought was going to become a lawyer or a professor or at least some kind of accountant goes and ends up as a member of la policia aint that something for a guy who wrote a goddamn thesis on transcendentalism in the poetry of walt whitman he turned away from me and stared at the wall he had worked himself into a funk i had seen it before the most therapeutic thing to say was nothing i ignored him and did some calisthenics goddamn jack la lanne he muttered it took him ten minutes to come out of it ten minutes of clenching and unclenching his big fists then came the tentative raising of the eyes the inevitable sheepish grin how much for the therapy doctor i thought a minute dinner at a good place no crap he stood up and stretched growled like a bear how about sushi im goddamn barbaric tonight ill eat those fish alive we drove to oomasa in little tokyo the restaurant was crowded mostly with japanese this was no trendy hot spot decked out in shoji screen elegance and waxed pine counters the decor was red naugahyde stiff backed chairs and plain white walls decorated only by a few nikon calendars the solitary concession to style was a large aquarium in full view of the sushi bar in which fancy goldfish struggled to propel themselves through bubbling icy clear water they gasped and bobbed mutations ill suited for survival in any but the most rarefied captivity the products of hundreds of years of careful oriental tinkering with nature lion heads with faces obscured by glossy raspberry growths bug eyed black moors celestials with eyes forced perpetually heavenward ryukins so overloaded with finn age that they could barely move we stared at them and drank chivas that girl milo said the roommate i felt she could help me that she knew something about elaines lifestyle maybe something about her and handler she was nailed tight goddamn her he finished his drink and motioned for another it came and he gulped down half a waitress skittered over on geisha feet and handed us hot towels we wiped our hands and face i felt my pores open hungry for air you should be pretty good at talking to teachers right probably did a lot of it back in the days when you were earning an honest living sometimes teachers hate psychologists milo they see us as dilettantes dropping theoretical pearls of wisdom on them while they do the dirty work hmm the rest of the scotch disappeared but no matter ill talk to her for you where can i find her same school gutierrez taught at in west la not far from you he wrote the address on a napkin and gave it to me her names raquel ochoa he spelled it his voice thickening slurring the words use your badge he slapped me on the back there was a grating sound above our heads we looked up to find the sushi chef smiling and sharpening his knives we ordered the fish was fresh the rice just slightly sweet the was abe horseradish cleared my sinuses we ate in silence against a backdrop of satnisen music and foreign chatter i awoke as stiff as if id been spray starched a full fledged charley horse had taken hold of my muscles a souvenir of my dance with jaroslav i fought it by taking a two mile run down the canyon and back then i practiced karate moves out on the rear deck to the amused comments of a pair of mockingbirds who interrupted their domestic quarrel long enough to look me over then delivered what had to be the avian equivalent of a raspberry fly down here you little bastards i grunted and ill show you whos tough they responded with hilarious screeching the day was shaping up as a lung buster grimy fingers of pollution reaching over the mountains to strangle the sky the ocean was obscured by a sulfurous sheath of airborne garbage my chest ached in harmony with the stiffness in my joints and by ten i was ready to quit i planned to time my visit to the school where raquel ochoa taught for the noon break hoping to find her free that left enough time for a long hot bath a cold shower and a carefully assembled breakfast of eggs with mushrooms sourdough toast grilled tomatoes and coffee i dressed casually in dark brown slacks tan corduroy sport coat checked shirt and brown knit tie before i left i dialed a now familiar number bonita quinn answered yes mrs quinn dr delaware i just wanted to call to find out how melodys been doing shes fine her tone would have frosted a beer mug fine before i could say more she hung up the school was in a middle class part of town but it could have been anywhere it was the old familiar layout of citadels of learning throughout the city flesh colored buildings arranged in classic penitentiary style surrounded by a desert of black asphalt and secured by ten foot high chain link fencing someone had tried to brighten it up by painting a mural of children playing along the side of one of the buildings but it was scant redemption what helped a bit more were the sight and sound of real children playing running jumping tumbling chasing each other screaming like banshees throwing balls crying out with the fervor of the truly persecuted teacher he hit me sitting in circles reaching for the sky a small group of bored looking teachers watched from the sidelines i climbed the front stairs and found the main office with little trouble the internal floor plan of schools was as predictable as the drab exterior i used to wonder why all the schools i knew were so hopelessly ugly so predictably oppressive then i dated a nurse whose father was one of the chief architects for the firm that had been building schools for the state for the past fifty years she had unresolved feelings about him and talked a lot about him a drunken melancholic man who hated his wife and despised his children more who saw the world in terms of minimally varying shades of disappointment a real frank lloyd wright the office reeked of mimeographing fluid its sole occupant was a stern black woman in her forties ensconced in a fortress of scarred golden oak i showed her my badge which didnt interest her and asked for raquel ochoa the name didnt seem to interest her either shes a teacher here fourth grade i added its lunchtime try the teachers dining room the dining room turned out to be an airless place twenty feet by fifteen into which folding tables and chairs had been crammed a dozen men and women sat hunched over sack lunches and coffee laughing smoking chewing when i entered the room all activity ceased im looking for ms ochoa you wont find her here honey said a stout woman with platinum hair several of the teachers laughed they let me stand there for a while and then a fellow with a young face and old eyes said room probably thanks i left i was halfway down the hall before they started talking again the door to was half open i went in rows of unoccupied school desks filled every square inch of space with the exception of a few feet at the front that had been cleared for the teachers desk a boxy metal rectangle behind which sat a woman busy at work if she had heard me enter she gave no indication as she continued to read make checkmarks cross out errors an unopened brown bag sat at her elbow light streamed in through dusty windows in beams that were suffused with dancing suspended particles the vermeer softness was at odds with the utilitarian severity of the room stark white walls a blackboard veneered with chalky residue a soiled american flag ms ochoa the face that looked up was out of a mural by rivera reddish brown skin stretched tightly over sharply defined but delicately constructed bones liquid lips and melting black eyes gabled by full dark brows her hair was long and sleek parted in the middle hanging down her back part aztec part spanish part unknown yes her voice was soft in volume but the timbre was defensively hard some of the hostility milo had described was immediately apparent i wondered if she was one of those people who had turned psychological vigilance into a fine art i walked over to her introduced myself and showed her the badge she inspected it phd in what psychology she looked at me with disdain the police dont get satisfaction so they send in the shrinks its not that simple spare me the details she returned her eyes to her paperwork i just want to talk to you for a few minutes about your friend i told that big detective everything i know this is just a double check how thorough she picked up her red pencil and began slashing at the paper i felt sorry for the students whose work was coming under scrutiny at this particular moment this isnt a psychological interview if thats what youre worried about its im not worried about anything i told him everything he doesnt think so she slammed the pencil down the point broke are you calling me a liar mr phd her speech was crisp and articulate but it still bore a latin tinge i shrugged labels arent important what is is finding out as much as possible about elaine gutierrez elena she snapped theres nothing to tell let the police do their job and stop sending their scientific snoopers around harassing people who are busy too busy to help find the murderer of your best friend the head shot up she brushed furiously at a loose strand of hair please leave she said between clenched jaws i have work to do yes i know you dont even eat lunch with the rest of the teachers youre very dedicated and serious thats what it took to get out of the barrio and that puts you above the laws of common courtesy she stood up all five feet of her for a moment i thought she was going to slap me as she drew her hand back but she stopped herself and stared i could feel the acid heat coming my way but i held my gaze jaroslav would have been proud im busy she finally said but there was a pleading quality to the statement as if she was trying to convince herself i dont want to take you on a cruise i just want to ask a few questions about elena she sat down what kind of psychologist are you you dont talk like one i gave her a capsulized deliberately vague history of my involvement in the case she listened and i thought i saw her soften a child psychologist we could use you around here i looked around the classroom counted forty six desks in a space meant for twenty eight i dont know what i could do help you tie them down she laughed then realized what she was doing and cut it off like a bad connection its no use talking about elena she said she only got into trouble because of being involved with that she trailed off i know handler was a creep detective sturgis the big guy knows and youre probably right she was an innocent victim but lets make sure okay you do this a lot work for the police she evaded me no im retired she looked at me with disbelief at your age post burnout that hit home she dropped her mask a notch and a bit of humanity peeked through i wish i could afford it retirement i know what you mean it must be crazy working with this kind of bureaucracy i threw out the lure of empathy administrators were the object of every teachers ire if she didnt go for it i wasnt sure what id do to gain rapport she looked at me suspiciously searching for a sign that i was patronizing her you dont work at all she asked i do some free lance investing it keeps me busy enough we chatted for a while about the vagaries of the school system she carefully avoided mention of anything personal keeping it all in the realm of pop sociology how rotten things were when parents werent willing to get emotionally and intellectually involved with their children how difficult it was to teach when half the kids came from broken homes and were so upset they could barely concentrate the frustration of dealing with administrators whod given up on life and stuck around only for their pensions anger at the fact that a teachers starting salary was less than that of a trash collector she was twenty nine and shed lost any shred of idealism that had survived the transition from east la to the world of anglo bourgeoisie she could really talk when she got going the dark eyes flashing the hands gesticulating flying through the air like two brown sparrows i sat like the teachers pet and listened giving her what everyone wants when theyre unloading empathy an understanding gesture part of it was calculated i wanted to break through to her in order to find out more about elena gutierrez but some of it was my old therapeutic persona thoroughly genuine i was starting to think id gotten through when the bell rang she became a teacher again the arbiter of right and wrong you must go now the children will be coming back i stood up and leaned on her desk can we talk later about elena she hesitated biting her lip the sound of a stampede began as a faint rumble and grew thunderous high pitched voices wailed their way closer all right im off at two thirty an offer to buy her a drink would have been a mistake keep it businesslike alex thank you ill meet you at the gate no meet me in the teachers parking lot at the south side of the building away from prying eyes her car was a dusty white vega she walked toward it carrying a stack of books and papers that reached up to her chin can i help you she gave me the load which must have weighed at least twenty pounds and took a minute to find her keys i noticed that shed put on makeup eye shadow that accentuated the depth of her orbs she looked around eighteen i havent eaten yet she said it was less an angling for an invitation than a complaint no brown bag i threw it out i make a lousy lunch on a day like today its too lousy to take theres a chop house on wilshire can i drive you she looked at the vega sure why not im low on gas anyway toss those on the front seat i put the books down and she locked the car but ill pay for my own lunch we left the school grounds i led her to the seville when she saw it her eyebrows rose you must be a good investor i get lucky from time to time she sank back in the soft leather and let out a breath i got behind the wheel and started up the engine ive changed my mind she said you pay for the lunch she ate meticulously cutting her steak into tiny pieces spearing each morsel individually and slipping it into her mouth and wiping her mouth with her napkin every third bite i was willing to bet she was a tough grader she was my best friend she said putting down her fork and picking up her water glass we grew up together in east la rafael and andy her brothers played with miguel at the mention of her dead brother her eyes misted then grew hard as obsidian she pushed her plate away shed eaten a quarter of her food when we moved to echo park the gutierrezes moved with us the boys were always getting into trouble minor mischief pranks elena and i were good girls goody goodies actually the nuns loved us she smiled we were as close as sisters and like sisters there was a lot of competition between us she was always better looking she read the doubt in my face really i was a scrawny kid i developed late elena was voluptuous soft the boys followed her around with their tongues hanging out even when she was eleven and twelve here she reached into her purse and took out a snapshot more photographic memories this is elena and me in high school two girls leaned against a graffiti filled wall they wore catholic school uniforms short sleeved white blouses gray skirts white socks and saddle shoes one was tiny thin and dark the other a head taller had curves the uniform couldnt conceal and a complexion that was surprisingly fair was she a blonde surprising isnt it some german rapist way back no doubt later she lightened it even more to be really all american she got sophisticated changed her name to elaine spent lots of money on clothes her car she realized she was criticizing the dead girl and quickly changed her tune but she was a person of substance underneath all of that she was a truly gifted teacher there arent many like that she taught eh you know educationally handicapped classes were for children who werent retarded but still had difficulties learning the category could include everything from bright kids with specific perceptual problems to youngsters whose emotional conflicts got in the way of their learning to read and write teaching eh was tough it could be constant frustration or a stimulating challenge depending on a teachers motivation energy and talent elena had a real gift for drawing them out the kids no one else could work with she had patience you wouldnt have thought it to look at her she was flashy she used lots of makeup dressed to show herself off sometimes she looked like a party girl but she wasnt afraid to get down on the floor with the children didnt mind getting her hands dirty she got into their heads she dedicated herself to them the children loved her look another photograph elena gutierrez surrounded by a group of smiling children she was kneeling and the kids were climbing on her tugging at the hem of her skirt putting their heads in her lap a tall well built young woman pretty rather than beautiful with an earthy open look the yellow hair a styled thick shag framing an oval face and contrasting dramatically with the hispanic features except for those features she was the classic california girl the kind who should have been lying face down in the malibu sand bikini top undone smooth brown back exposed to the sun a girl for cola commercials and custom van shows and running down to the market in halter and shorts for a six pack she shouldnt have ended up as savaged lifeless flesh in a refrigerated drawer downtown raquel ochoa took the picture out of my hands and i thought i saw jealousy in her face shes dead she said putting it back in her purse frowning as if id committed some kind of heresy it looked like they adored her i said they did now theyve brought in some old bag who doesnt give a damn about teaching now that elenas gone she started to cry using her napkin to shield her face from my eyes her thin shoulders shook she sank lower in the booth trying to disappear sobbing i got up moved to her side and put my arms around her she felt as frail as a cobweb no no im all right but she moved closer to me burying herself in the folds of my jacket burrowing in for the long cold winter as i held her i realized that she felt good she smelled good this was a surprisingly soft feminine person in my arms i fantasized swooping her up featherweight and vulnerable carrying her to bed where id still her painful cries with that ultimate panacea orgasm a stupid fantasy because it would take more than a fuck and a hug to solve her problems stupid because that wasnt what this encounter was all about i felt an annoying heat and tension in my groin tumescence rearing its ugly head when least appropriate still i held her until her sobbing slowed and her breathing became regular thinking of robin i finally let her go and moved back to my side she avoided my eyes took out her compact and fixed her face that was really dumb no it wasnt thats what eulogies are for she thought for a moment then managed a faint smile yes i suppose youre right she reached across the table and placed a small hand on mine thank you i miss her so much i understand do you she drew her hand away suddenly cross no i guess not ive never lost anyone to whom i was that close will you accept a serious attempt at empathy im sorry ive been rude from the moment you walked in its been so hard all of these feelings sadness and emptiness and anger at the monster who did it it had to be a monster didnt it yes will you catch him will that big detective catch him hes a very capable guy raquel in his own way quite gifted but hes got little to go on yes i suppose i should help you shouldnt i it would be nice she found a cigarette in her purse and lit it with trembling hands she took a deep drag and let it out what do you want to know for starts how about the old cliche did she have any enemies the cliched answer no she was popular well liked and besides whoever did this to her was no acquaintance we didnt know anyone like that she shuddered confronting her own vulnerability did she go out with a lot of men the same questions she sighed she dated a few guys before she met him then it was the two of them all the way when did she begin seeing him she started as a patient almost a year ago its hard to know when she began sleeping with him she didnt talk to me about that kind of thing i could imagine sexuality being a taboo topic for the two best friends with their upbringing there was bound to be lots of conflict and given what i had seen of raquel and heard about elena it was almost certain they had gone about resolving those conflicts in different ways one the party girl a mans woman the other attractive but perceiving herself in pitched battle with the world i looked across the table at the dark serious face and knew her bed would be ringed with thorns did she tell you they were having an affair an affair that sounds so light and breezy he violated his professional ethics and she fell for it she puffed on her cigarette she giggled about it for a week or so then came out and told me what a wonderful guy he was i put two and two together a month later he picked her up at our place it was out in the open what was he like like you said before a creep too welldressed velvet jackets tailored pants sunlamp tan shirt unbuttoned to show lots of chest hair curly gray chest hair he smiled a lot and got familiar with me shook my hand and held on too long lingered with a goodbye kiss nothing you could pin him on the words were almost identical to roy longstreths slick exactly slippery shed gone for that type before i couldnt understand it she was such a good person so real i figured it had something to do with losing her dad at a young age she had no good male role model does that sound plausible sure life was never as simple as the psych texts but it made people feel good to find solutions he was a bad influence on her when she started going with him was when she dyed her hair and changed her name and bought all those clothes she even went out and bought a new car one of those datsun z turbos how did she afford it the car cost more than most teachers made in a year if youre thinking he paid for it forget it she bought it on payments that was another thing about elena she had no conception of money just let it pass through her fingers she always joked how she was going to have to marry a rich guy to accommodate her tastes how often did they see each other at first once or twice a week by the end she might as well have moved in with him i rarely saw her shed drop in to pick up a few things invite me to go out with them did you she was surprised at the question are you kidding i couldnt stand to be around him and i have a life of my own i had no need to be the odd one out a life i suspected of grading papers until ten and then retiring nightgown buttoned high with a gothic novel and a cup of hot cocoa did they have friends other couples with whom they associated i have no idea im trying to tell you i kept out of it an edge crept into her voice and i retreated she started out as his patient do you have any idea why she went to a psychiatrist in the first place she said she was depressed you dont think she was its hard to tell with some people when i get depressed everyone knows about it i withdraw dont want anything to do with anybody its like i shrink crawl into myself with elena who knows its not like she had trouble eating or sleeping she would just get a little quiet but she said she was depressed not until after she told me she was seeing handler after i asked her why she said she was feeling down the work was getting to her i tried to help but she said she needed more i was never a big fan of psychiatrists and psychologists she smiled apologetically if you have friends and family you should be able to work it out if thats enough great sometimes its like she said raquel you need more she put out her cigarette well i suppose its fortunate for you that many people agree with that i suppose so there was an awkward silence i broke it did he prescribe any medication for her not as far as i know just talked to her she went to see him weekly and then twice a week after one of her students died then she was obviously depressed cried for days when was this let me see it was pretty soon after she started going to handler maybe after they were already dating i dont know about eight months ago how did it happen accident hit and run the kid was walking along a dark road at night and a car hit him it destroyed her shed been working with him for months he was one of her miracles everyone thought he was mute elena got him to talk she shook her head a miracle and then to have it all go down the drain like that so meaningless the parents must have been shattered no there were no parents he was an orphan he came from la casa la casa de los ninos in malibu canyon sure why the surprise they contract with us to provide special education to some of their kids they do it with several of the local schools its part of a state funded project or something to mainstream children without families into the community no surprise i lied it just seems so sad for something like that to happen to an orphan yes life is unfair the declaration seemed to give her satisfaction she looked at her watch anything more ive got to get back just one do you recall the name of the child who died nemeth gary or corey something like that thanks for your time youve been helpful have i i dont see how but im glad if it brings you closer to that monster she had a concrete vision of the murderer that milo would have envied we drove back to the school and i walked her to her car okay she said thanks again youre welcome if you have more questions you can come back it was as forward as she was going to get for her the equivalent of asking me over to her place it made me sad knowing there was nothing i could do for her i will she smiled and held out her hand i took it careful not to hold on for too long ive never been a big believer in coincidence i suppose its because the notion of life being governed by the random collision of molecules in space cuts at the heart of my professional identity after all why spend all those years learning how to help people change when deliberate change is just an illusion but even if i had been willing to give the fates their due it would have been hard to see as coincidence the fact that gary or corey nemeth deceased a student of elena gutierrez deceased had been a resident of the same institution where maurice bruno deceased had volunteered it was time to learn more about la casa de los ninos i went home and searched through the cardboard boxes i had stored in the garage since dropping out until i found my old office rolodex i located olivia brickermans number at the department of social services and dialed it a social worker for thirty years olivia knew more about agencies than anyone in the city a recording answered the phone and told me dpsss number had been changed i dialed the new number and another recording told me to wait a tape of barry manilow came on the line i wondered if the city paid him royalties music to wait for your caseworker by dpss mrs brickerman please one moment sir two more minutes of mani low then shes no longer with this office can you please tell me where i can locate her one moment i was informed once again who wrote the music that made the whole world sing mrs brickerman is now at the santa monica psychiatric medical group so olivia had finally left the public domain do you have that number one moment sir thanks anyway i hung up and consulted the yellow pages under mental health services the number belonged to an address on broadway where santa monica approached venice not far from robins studio i called it smpmg mrs olivia brickerman please who shall i say is calling dr delaware one moment the line was silent apparently the utility of phone hold muzak hadnt become apparent to smpmg alex how are you fine olivia and you wonderful wonderful i thought you were somewhere in the himalayas whys that isnt that where people go when they want to find themselves somewhere cold with no oxygen and a little old man with a beard sitting on top of a mountain munching on twigs and reading people magazine that was the sixties olivia in the eighties you stay home and soak in hot water ha hows al his usual extroverted self he was hunched over the board when i left this morning muttering something about the pakistani defense or some such naarishkeit her husband albert d brickerman was the chess editor for the times in the five years id known him i hadnt heard him utter a dozen words in a row it was difficult to imagine what he and olivia miss sociability of through had in common but theyd been married thirty seven years had raised four children and seemed content with each other so you finally left dpss yes can you believe it even barnacles can be dislodged what led to such an impulsive move i tell you alex i would have stayed sure the system stank what system doesnt but i was used to it like a wart i like to think i was still doing a good job though i tell you the stories got sadder and longer such misery and with cuts in funding the people would get less and less and madder and madder they took it out on the caseworkers we had a girl stabbed in the downtown office now therere armed guards in every office but what the hell i was brought up in new york then my nephew my sisters boy steve he finished medical school and decided to become a psychiatrist can you believe that another mental health person in the family his fathers a surgeon and that was the safest way for him to rebel anyway hes always been very close to me and its been a running joke that when he goes into practice he was going to rescue aunt livvy from dpss and take her into his office and would you believe he took me up on it writes me a letter tells me hes coming out to california and joining a group and they need a social worker for intakes and short term counseling would i like to do it so here i am with a view of the beach working for little stevie of course i dont call him that in front of other people thats great olivia you sound happy i am i go down to the beach for lunch read a book get tan after twenty two years i finally feel like im living in california maybe ill take up roller skating huh the image of olivia who was built somewhat like alfred hitchcock whizzing by on skates made me laugh ah you scoff now just wait she chuckled now enough autobiography what can i do for you i need some information on a place called la casa de los ninos in malibu mccaffreys place you thinking of sending someone there no its a long story listen if its that long why dont you give me a chance to dig in my files come over to the house tonight and ill give it to

beige stucco house with spanish tile roof olivias mammoth chrysler was parked in the driveway what am i doing here alex robin asked as we approached the front door do you like chess dont know how to play dont worry about it this is one house where you dont have to be concerned about what to say youll be lucky if you get a chance to talk eat brownies enjoy yourself i gave her a kiss and rang the doorbell olivia answered it she looked the same maybe a few pounds heavier her hair a hennaed frizz her face rosy cheeked and open she was wearing a shift a hawaiian print and ripples went through it as she laughed she spread her hands and hugged me to a bosom the size and consistency of a small sofa alex she released me and held me at arms length no more beard you used to resemble dh lawrence now you look like a graduate student she turned and smiled at robin i introduced them pleased to meet you youre very lucky hes a darling boy robin blushed come in the house was redolent with good sweet baking smells al brickerman a prophet with white hair and beard sat hunched over an ebony and maple chess board in the living room he was surrounded by clutter books in shelves and on the floor bricabrac photographs of children and grandchildren menorahs souvenirs overstuffed furniture an old robe and slippers al alex and his friend are here hmm he grunted and raised his hand never averting his eyes from the pieces on the board nice to see you again al hmm hes a real schizo id olivia confided to robin but hes dynamite in bed she ushered us into the kitchen the room was the same as it had been when the house had been built forty years ago yellow tile with maroon borders narrow porcelain sink window sills filled with potted plants the refrigerator and stove were vintage ken more a ceramic sign hung over the doorway leading out to the service porch how can you soar like an eagle when youre surrounded by turkeys olivia saw me looking at it my going away present when i left dpss to myself from myself she brought over a plate of brownies still warm here have some before i eat them look at this im growing obese she patted her rear more to love i told her and she pinched my cheek mmm these are great robin said a woman with taste here sit down we pulled up chairs around the kitchen table the plate set down before us olivia checked the oven and then she joined us in about ten minutes youll have strudel apples raisins and figs the latter an improvisation for albert she crooked a thumb toward the living room the system gets clogged from time to time now then you want to know about casa de los ninos not that its any of my business but could you tell me why it has to do with some work im doing for the police department the police you i told her about the case leaving out the gory details she had met milo before theyd hit it off marvelously but hadnt been aware of the extent of our friendship hes a nice boy you should find him a nice woman like you found for yourself she smiled at robin and handed her another brownie i dont think that would work olivia hes gay it didnt stop her only slowed her down so find him a nice young man hes got one good forgive me robin i tend to run off at the mouth its all those hours i spend with clients listening and nodding and saying uh huh then i get home and you can imagine the depth of conversational interplay i get with prince albert anyway alex these questions about la casa milo asked you to ask them not exactly im following my own leads she looked at robin philip marlowe here robin gave her a helpless look is this dangerous alex no i just want to look into a few things you be careful you understand she squeezed my bicep she had a grip like a bouncer make sure hes careful darling i try olivia i cant control him i know these psychologists they get so used to being in a position of authority they cant take advice let me tell you about this handsome fellow i first met him when he was an intern assigned for three weeks to dpss to teach him what life was like for people without money he started out as a wise guy but i could tell he was special he was the smartest thing on two feet and he had compassion his big problem was he was too hard on himself he drove himself he was doing twice as much work as anyone else and he thought he was doing nothing i wasnt surprised when he took off like a missile the fancy title and the books and all that but i was worried he was going to burn himself out you were right olivia i admitted i thought he went to the himalayas or something she laughed continuing to address robin to get frozen so he could come back and appreciate california have more both of you im stuffed robin touched her flat tummy youre probably right keep the figure if you have it me i started out like a barrel nothing to maintain tell me darling do you love him robin looked at me she put her arm around my neck i do fine i pronounce you husband and wife who cares what he says she got up and went to the oven peering through the glass window still a few more minutes i think the figs take longer to bake olivia about la casa de los ninos she sighed and her bosom sighed along with her okay youre obviously serious about playing policeman she sat down after you called i went into my old files and pulled out what i could find you want coffee please said robin ill have some too she came back with three steaming mugs cream and sugar on a porcelain tray upon which had been silkscreened a panorama of yellowstone park this is delicious olivia robin said sipping kona from hawaii this dress is from there too my younger son gabriel hes there hes in import export does very well olivia yes yes okay la casa de los ninos the childrens home started in by the reverend augustus mccaffrey as a place of refuge for children with no home thats right off the brochure do you have the brochure with you no its at the office you want me to mail you a copy dont bother what kind of kids stay there abused and neglected children orphans some status offenders you know runaways they used to pull them in jail or the cya but those places got too crowded with fourteen year old murderers and rapists and robbers so now they try to find foster placement for them or a place like la casa in general these institutions get the kids nobody wants the ones they cant find foster placement or adoptive homes for lots of them have physical and psychological problems spastic blind deaf retarded or theyre too old to be attractive adoptees there are also the children of women in prison mostly junkies and alcoholics we tried to place them with individual families but often nobody wanted them to sum up dear chronic wards of the dependency court hows a place like that funded alex the way the state and federal systems are set up an operator can pull in over a thousand dollars a month per child if he knows how to bill it right kids with disabilities bring in more you get paid for all the special services on top of that i hear mccaffreys terrific at bringing in private donations hes got connections the land the place is on is an example twenty acres in malibu used to belong to the government they interned the japanese there during world war ii then it was used as a labor camp for first offenders embezzlers politicians that type he got the county to give it to him on long term lease ninety nine years with token rent he must be a good talker he is a good old boy used to be a missionary down in mexico i hear he ran a similar place there whyd he move back up who knows maybe he got tired of not drinking the water maybe he longed for kentucky fried chicken although i hear theyve got it down there now what about the place is it a good one none of those places is utopia alex the ideal would be a little house in suburbia with a picket fence around it gingham curtains and a green lawn mommy and daddy and rover the dog the reality is that there are over seventeen thousand kids on the dependency court docket in la county alone seventeen thousand unwanted children and theyre piling into the system faster than they can be heres a terrible word processed thats unbelievable said robin she had a troubled look on her face weve turned into a society of child haters darling more and more abuse and neglect people have kids and then change their minds parents dont want to take responsibility for them so they shunt them over to the government hows that from an old socialist alex and abortion i hope this doesnt offend you because im for liberation as much if not more than the next woman i was screaming for equal pay before gloria steinem went through puberty but lets face it this wholesale abortion weve got is just another form of birth control another way out for people to avoid their responsibility and its killing kids at least in some sense isnt it maybe its better than having them and then trying to get rid of them i dont know she wiped the sweat from her forehead and dabbed at her upper lip with a paper napkin excuse me that was a tedious polemic she stood up and smoothed down her dress let me check the strudel she came back with a steaming platter blow on it its hot robin and i looked at each other you look so serious i ruined your appetite with my polemic didnt i no olivia i took a slab of strudel and ate a bite its delicious and i agree with you robin looked grave wed discussed the abortion issue many times never resolving anything in answer to your question is it a good place i can only say that we had no complaints when i was with dpss they offer the basics it looked clean the area is certainly nice most of those kids never saw a mountain except on tv they bus the kids to the public schools when they have special needs otherwise theyve got in house teaching i doubt if anyone helps them with their homework its certainly not father knows best over there but mccaffrey keeps the place up pushes for lots of community involvement that means public exposure why do you want to know so much about it you think that kids death was suspicious no theres no reason to suspect anything i thought about her question i guess im just fishing well dont go fishing for minnows and come up with a shark darling we nibbled at the strudel olivia called into the living room al you want some strudel with the figs there was no answer i could hear but she put some pastry on a plate nonetheless and brought it into him shes a nice lady said robin one in a million and very tough and smart you should listen to her when she says to be careful alex please leave the detecting to milo ill take care of myself dont worry i took her hand but she pulled away i was about to say something but olivia returned to the kitchen the dead man the salesman you said he volunteered at la casa yes he had a certificate in his office he was probably a member of the gentlemans brigade its something dreamed up by mccaffrey to get the business community involved with the place he gets corporations to get their executives to volunteer weekend time with the kids how much of it is voluntary on the part of the gentlemen and how much is the result of pressure from the boss i dont know mccaffrey gives them blazers and lapel pins and certificates signed by the mayor they also get brownie points with their bosses hopefully the kids get something out of it too i thought of bruno the psychopath working with homeless children is there any sort of screening the usual interviews some paper and pencil tests you know dear boy what that kind of thing is worth i nodded still like i said we never got any complaints id have to give the place a b minus alex the major problem is that its too big of an operation for the kids to get any personalized attention a good foster home would definitely be preferable to having four to five hundred kids in one place at the same time thats how many hes got aside from that la casa is as good as any thats good to hear but in some perverse way i was disappointed it would have been nice to find out that the place was a hellhole anything to connect it with the three murders of course that meant misery for four hundred children was i becoming just another member of the child hating society olivia had described suddenly the strudel tasted like sugarcoated paper and the kitchen seemed oppressively hot so is there anything else you want to know no thanks now darling she turned to robin tell about yourself and how you met this impetuous fellow we left an hour later i put my arm around robin she let it lay there but was unresponsive we walked to the car in silence as uncomfortable as a strangers shoes inside i asked her whats wrong why did you bring me here tonight i just thought it would be nice nice talking about murder and child abuse alex that was no social call i had nothing to say so i started the car and pulled away from the curb im worried sick about you she said the things you were describing in there were hideous what she said about sharks is true youre like a little boy adrift on a raft in the middle of the ocean oblivious to whats going on around you i know what im doing right she looked out the window whats wrong with my wanting to get involved in something other than hot tubs and jogging nothing but why cant it be something a little less hazardous than playing sherlock holmes something you know something about im a fast learner she ignored me we cruised through darkened empty streets a light drizzle speckled the windshield i dont enjoy hearing about people getting their faces bashed in or children run down by hit and run drivers she said thats part of whats out there i motioned toward the blackness of the night well i dont want any part of it what youre saying is youll go along for the ride as long as its pretty oh alex stop being so damned melodramatic thats right out of a soap opera its true though isnt it no its not and dont try to put me on the defensive i want the man i first met someone who was satisfied with himself and not so full of insecurity that he had to run around trying to prove himself that was what attracted me to you now youre like a a man possessed since youve gotten involved in your little intrigues you havent been there for me i talk and your mind is somewhere else its like i told you before youre going back to the bad old days there was something to that the last few mornings had found me waking up early with a taut sense of urgency in my gut the old obsessive drive to take care of business funny thing was i didnt want to let go of it i promise you i told her ill be careful she shook her head in frustration leaned forward and switched on the radio loud when we got to her door she gave me a chaste peck on the cheek can i come in she stared at me for a long moment and gave a resigned smile oh hell why not upstairs in the loft i watched her undress in the meager share of moonbeam admitted by the skylight she stood on one foot undoing her sandal and her breasts swung low a diagonal stroke of illumination turned her white then gray as she pivoted then invisible as she slipped under the covers i reached out for her aroused and pulled her hand down toward me she touched me for a second then removed her fingers moved them upward let them settle around my neck i buried myself in the sanctuary between her shoulder and the arching sweetness under her chin we fell asleep that way in the morning her side of the bed was empty i heard rumbling and grinding and knew she was downstairs in the shop i got dressed descended the narrow stairs and joined her she was wearing bib overalls and a mans work shirt her mouth was covered with a bandana her eyes goggled the air was full of wood dust ill call you later i shouted over the din of the table saw she stopped for a moment waved then resumed working i left her surrounded by her tools her machines her art i called milo at the station and gave him a full report of my interview with raquel ochoa and the casa de los ninos connection including the information given to me by olivia im impressed he said you missed your calling so what do you think shouldnt this mccaffrey be looked into what a minute friend the man takes care of four hundred kids and one of them is killed in an accident thats not evidence of major mayhem but that kid happened to be a student of elena gutierrez which means she probably discussed him with handler not long after his death bruno began volunteering at the place a coincidence probably not but you dont understand the way things work around here i am in the toilet with this case so far those bank records are showing nothing everything in both their accounts looks kosher ive got more work to do on it but singlehanded it takes time every day the captain looks me up and down with that no progress sturgis stare i feel like a kid who hasnt done his homework i expect him to pull me off the case any day and stick me on some garbage detail if things are so screwed up id expect you to jump for joy at the prospect of a new lead thats right a lead not conjecture or a string of flimsy associations they dont look that damned flimsy to me look at it this way i start snooping around about mccaffrey whos got connections from downtown all the way to malibu he places a few strategic phone calls no one can accuse him of obstructing justice because ive got no legitimate reason to be investigating him and im yanked off the case faster than you can spit all right i conceded but what about the mexican thing the guy was down there for years then all of a sudden he leaves surfaces in la and becomes a hotshot upward mobility is no felony and sometimes a cigar is a cigar dr freud shit i cant stand it when you get overly cute alex please my life is far from rosy i dont need crap from you on top of it all i seemed to be developing a talent for alienating those close to me i had yet to call robin to find out where last nights dreams had led her im sorry i guess im over involved he didnt argue youve done good work been a big help sometimes things dont fall into place just because you do a good job so what are you going to do drop it no ill look into mccaffreys background quietly especially the mexican bit im going to continue sifting through handler and brunos financial records and ill add gutierrezs to that im even going to call the malibu sheriff station and get copies of the accident report on that kid what did you say his name was nemeth fine that should be easy enough is there anything else you want from me what oh no nothing youve done a great job alex i want you to know i really mean that ill take it from here why dont you take it easy for a while okay i said without enthusiasm but keep me posted i will he promised bye the voice on the other end was female and very professional it greeted me with the sing song lilt of a detergent jingle an isnt life wonderful buoyancy that bordered on the obscene good morning la casa good morning id like to speak to someone about becoming a member of the gentlemans brigade just one moment sir in twenty seconds a male voice came on the line tim kruger can i help you id like to talk about joining the gentlemans brigade yes sir and what corporation do you represent none im inquiring as an individual oh i see the voice lost a touch of its friendliness disruption of routine did that to some people threw them off made them wary and your name please dr alexander delaware it must have been the title that did it because he shifted gears again immediately good morning doctor how are you today just fine thank you terrific and what kind of doctor are you if i might ask you might child psychologist retired excellent we dont get many mental health professionals volunteering im an mfcc myself in charge of screening and counseling at la casa id imagine most of them would consider it too much like work i said being away from the field for a while the idea of working with children again appeals to me wonderful and what led you to la casa your reputation ive heard you do good work and youre well organized well thank you doctor we do try to do well by our kids im sure you do we give group tours for prospective gentlemen the next one is scheduled a week from this friday let me check my calendar i left the phone looked out the window did a half dozen knee bends and came back im sorry mr kruger thats a bad day for me whens the next one three weeks later thats such a long way off i was hoping to get going sooner i tried to sound wistful and just a little impatient hmm well doctor if you dont mind something a bit more impromptu than the group orientation i can give you a personalized tour therell be no way to assemble the video show in time but as a psychologist you know a lot of that stuff anyway that sounds just fine in fact if youre free this afternoon i could arrange it for then reverend gus is here today he likes to meet all potential gentlemen and thats not always the case what with his travel schedule hes taping merv griffin this week then flying to new york for an am america he imparted the news of mccaffreys television activities with the solemnity of a crusader unveiling the holy grail today would be perfect excellent around three three it is do you know where we are not exactly in malibu in malibu canyon he gave me directions then added while youre there you can fill out our screening questionnaires it would be a formality in a case such as yours doctor but we do have to go through the motions though i dont imagine psychological tests would be very valid for screening a psychologist would they i dont imagine so we write em we can subvert em he laughed straining to be collegial any other questions i dont think so terrific ill see you at three malibu is as much an image as it is a place the image is beamed into the living rooms of america on tv splashed across the movie screen etched into the grooves of lps and emblazoned on the covers of trashy paperbacks the image is one of endless stretches of sand oiled naked brown bodies volleyball on the beach sun bleached hair making love under a blanket with coital cadence timed to match the in and out of the tide million dollar shacks that teeter on pilings sunken into terra that isnt a firma and in fact does the hula after a hard rain corvettes seaweed and cocaine all of that is valid but limited theres another malibu a malibu that encompasses the canyons and dirt roads that struggle through the santa monica mountain range this malibu has no ocean what little water it does possess comes in the form of streams that trickle through shaded gullies and disappear when the temperature rises there are some houses in this malibu situated near the main canyon road but there remain miles of wilderness there are still mountain lions roaming the more remote regions of this malibu and packs of coyotes that prowl at night making off with a chicken a possum a fat toad there are shady groves where the tree frogs breed so abundantly that you step into them thinking your foot is resting on soft gray earth until it moves there are lots of snakes kings garters and rattlers in this malibu and secluded ranches where people live under the illusion that the latter half of the twentieth century never occurred bridle trails punctuated by steaming mounds of horse droppings goats tarantulas there are also lots of rumors surrounding the second beach less malibu of ritual murders carried out by satanic cults of bodies that will never can never be found of people lost while hiking and never heard from again horror stories but perhaps just as valid as beach blanket bingo i turned off pacific coast highway up rambla pacifica and traversed the boundary from one malibu to the other the seville climbed the steep grade with ease i had django reinhardt on the tape deck and the music of the gypsy was in synch with the emptiness that unfolded before my windshield the serpentine ribbon of highway assaulted by the relentless pacific sun one moment and shaded by giant eucalyptus the next a dehydrated ravine to one side a sheer drop into space on the other a road that urged the weary traveler to keep going that offered promises it could never keep i had slept fitfully the night before thinking of robin and myself seeing the faces of children melody quinn the countless patients i had treated over the last ten years the remains of a boy named nemeth who had died just a few miles up this same road what had been his last vision i wondered what impulse had crossed a crucial synapse at the last possible moment before a giant machine monster roared down on him from nowhere and what had led him to walk this lonesome stretch of road in the dead of night now fatigue nursed by the monotony of the journey was tracing a slow but inexorable passage along my spine so that i had to fight to remain alert i turned the music louder and opened all the windows in the car the air smelled clean but tinged with the odor of something burning a distant bridge so occupied was i in the struggle for clarity of consciousness that i almost missed the sign the county had erected announcing the exit for la casa de los ninos in two miles the turnoff itself was easy to miss only a few hundred yards past a hairpin bend in the road the road was narrow barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass in opposite directions and heavily shadowed by trees it rose a half mile at an unrelenting incline steep enough to discourage any but the most purposeful foot traveler clearly the site had never been meant to attract the walk in trade perfect for a labor camp work farm detention center or any nexus of activity not meant for the prying eyes of strangers the access road ended at a twelve foot high barrier of chain link four foot high letters spelled out la casa de los ninos in polished aluminum a hand painted sign of two huge hands holding four children white black brown and yellow rose to the right a guardhouse was ten feet on the other side of the fence the uniformed man inside took note of me then spoke to me through a squawk box attached to the gate can i help you the voice came out steely and mechanical like human utterance pureed into bytes fed into a computer and regurgitated dr delaware here for a three oclock appointment with mr kruger the gate slid open the seville was allowed a brief roll until it was stopped by an orange and white striped mechanical arm good afternoon doctor the guard was young mustachioed solemn his uniform was dark gray matching his stare the sudden smile didnt fool me he was looking me over youll be meeting tim at the administration building thats straight up this way and take the road to the left you can park in the visitors lot thank you youre quite welcome doctor he pushed a button and the striped arm rose in salute the administration building looked like it had once served a similar purpose during the days of japanese internment it had the low slung angry look of military architecture but there was no doubt that the paint job a mural of a baby blue sky filled with cotton candy clouds was a contemporary creation the front office was paneled in cheap imitation oak and occupied by a grandmotherly type in a colorless cotton smock i announced myself and received a grandmotherly smile for my efforts tim will be right with you wont you please sit down and make yourself comfortable there was little of interest to look at the prints on the walls looked as if theyd been purloined from a motel there was a window but it afforded a view of the parking lot in the distance was a thick growth of forest eucalyptus cypress and cedar but from where i sat only the bottoms of the trees were visible an uninterrupted stretch of gray brown i tried to busy myself with a two year old copy of california highways it wasnt much of a wait a minute after id sat down the door opened and a young man came out dr delaware i stood tim kruger we shook hands he was short mid to late twenties and built like a wrestler all hard and knobby and endowed with just that extra bit of muscle in all the strategic places he had a face that was well formed but overly stolid like a ken doll that hadnt been allowed to bake sufficiently strong chin small ears prominent straight nose of a shape that foreshadowed bulbous ness in middle age an outdoorsmans tan yellowish brown eyes under heavy brows a low forehead almost totally hidden by a thick wave of sandy hair he wore wheat colored slacks a light blue short sleeved shirt and a blue and brown tie clipped to the corner of his collar was a badge that said t kruger ma mecc director counseling i was expecting someone quite a bit older doctor you told me you were retired i am i believe in taking it early when i can enjoy it he laughed heartily theres something to be said for that i trust you had no trouble finding us no your directions were excellent great we can begin the tour if youd like reverend gus is on the grounds somewhere he should be back to meet you by four he held the door for me we crossed the parking lot and stepped onto a walkway of crushed gravel la casa he began is situated on twenty seven acres if we stop right here we can get a pretty good view of the entire layout we were at the top of a rise looking down on buildings a playground spiraling trails a curtain of mountains in the background out of those twenty seven only five are actually fully developed the rest is wide open space which we believe is great for the kids many of whom come from the inner city i could make out the shapes of children walking in groups playing ball sitting alone on the grass to the north he pointed to an expanse of open fields is what we call the meadow its mostly alfalfa and weeds right now but there are plans to begin a vegetable garden this summer to the south is the grove he indicated the forest id seen from the office its protected timberland perfect for nature hikes theres a surprising abundance of wildlife out here im from the northwest myself and before i got here i used to think the wildest life in la was all on the sunset strip i smiled those buildings over there are the dorms he swiveled around and pointed to a group of ten large quonset huts like the administration building theyd been gone at with the freewheeling paint brush the corrugated iron sides festooned with rainbow hued patterns the effect bizarrely optimistic he turned again and i let my gaze follow his arm thats our olympic sized pool donated by majestic oil the pool shimmered green a hole in the earth filled with lime jello a solitary swimmer sliced through the water cutting a foamy pathway and over there are the infirmary and the school i noticed a grouping of cinder block buildings at the far end of the campus where the perimeter of the central hub met the edge of the grove he didnt say what they were lets take a look at the dorms i followed him down the hill taking in the idyllic panorama the grounds were well tended the place bustling with activity but seemingly well organized kruger walked with long muscular strides chin to the wind rattling off facts and figures describing the philosophy of the institution as one that combined structure and the reassurance of routine with a creative environment that encourages healthy development he was resolutely positive about la casa his job the reverend gus and the children the sole exception was a grave lament about the difficulties of coordinating optimal care with running the financial affairs of the institution on a day to day basis even this was followed however by a statement stressing his understanding of economic realities in the eighties and a few upbeat paeans to the free enterprise system he was well trained the interior of the bright pink quonset hut was cold flat white over a dark plank floor the dorm was empty and our footsteps echoed there was a metallic smell in the air the childrens beds were iron double bunks arranged barracks style perpendicular to the walls accompanied by foot lockers and bracket shelves bolted to the metal siding there was an attempt at decoration some of the children had hung up pictures of comic book super heroes athletes sesame street characters but the absence of family pictures or other evidence of recent intimate human connection was striking i counted sleeping space for fifty children how do you keep that many kids organized its a challenge he admitted but weve been pretty successful we use volunteer counselors from ucla northridge and other colleges they get intro psych credit we get free help wed love a full time professional staff but its fiscally impossible weve got it staffed two counselors to a dorm and we train them to use behavior mod i hope youre not opposed to that not if its used properly oh very definitely i couldnt agree with you more we minimize heavy avers ives use token economies lots of positive reinforcement it requires supervision thats where i come in you seem to have a good handle on things i try he gave an aw shucks grin i wanted to go for a doctorate but i didnt have the bucks where were you studying u of oregon i got an ma there in counseling ed before that a ba in psych from jedson college i thought everyone at jedson was rich the small college outside of seattle had a reputation as a haven for the offspring of the wealthy thats almost true he grinned the place was a country club i got in on an athletic scholarship track and baseball in my junior year i tore a ligament and suddenly i was persona non grata his eyes darkened momentarily smoldering with the memory of almost buried injustice anyway i like what im doing plenty of responsibility and decision making there was a rustling sound at the far end of the room we both turned toward it and saw movement beneath the blankets on one of the lower bunks is that you rodney kruger walked to the bunk and tapped a wriggling lump a boy sat up holding the covers up to his chin he was chubby black and looked around twelve but his exact age was impossible to gauge for his face bore the telltale stigmata of downs syndrome elongated cranium flattened features deep set eyes spaced close together sloping brow low set ears protruding tongue and an expression of bafflement so typical of the retarded hello rodney kruger spoke softly whats the matter i had followed him and the boy looked at me questioningly its all right rodney hes a friend now tell me whats the matter rodney sick the words were slurred what kind of sickness tummy hurt hmm well have to have the doctor look at you when he makes his visit no the boy screamed no docka now rodney kruger was patient if youre sick youre going to have to get a checkup no docka all right rodney all right kruger spoke soothingly he reached out and touched the boy softly on the top of the head rodney went hysterical his eyes popped out and his chin trembled he cried out and lurched backward so quickly that he hit the rear of his head on the metal bedpost he yanked the covers over his face uttering an unintelligible wail of protest kruger turned to me and sighed he waited until the boy calmed down and then spoke to him again well discuss the doctor later rodney now where are you supposed to be wheres your group right now snack arent you hungry the boy shook his head tummy hurts well you cant just lie here by yourself either come to the infirmary and well call someone to have a look at you or get up and join your group for snack no docka okay no doctor now get up the boy crawled out of bed away from us i could see now that he was older than id thought sixteen at least with the beginning of beard growth dotting his chin he stared at me eyes wide in fright this is a friend rodney mr delaware hello rodney i held out my hand he looked at it and shook his head be friendly rodney thats how we earn our goodie points remember a shake of the head come on rodney shake hands but the retarded boy was resolute when kruger took a step forward he retreated holding his hands in front of his face it went on that way for several moments a flat out contest of wills finally kruger gave in okay rodney he said softly well forget social skills for today because youre ill now run along and join your group the boy backed away from us circling the bed in a wide arc still shaking his head and holding his arms in front of him like a punchy fighter he moved away when he was close to the door he turned bolted and half ran half waddled out disappearing into the suns glare kruger turned to me and smiled weakly hes one of our more difficult ones seventeen and functioning like a three year old he seems to be really afraid of doctors hes afraid of lots of things like most downs kids hes had plenty of medical problems cardiac infections dental complications add that to the distorted thinking going on in that little head and it builds up have you had much experience with mrs some ive worked with hundreds of them and i cant remember one who didnt have serious emotional problems you know the public thinks theyre just like any other kids but slower it aint so a trace of irritation had crept into his voice i put it down to the humiliation of losing at psychic poker to the retarded boy rodneys come a long way he said when he first got here he wasnt even toilet trained after thirteen foster homes he shook his head its really pathetic some of the people the county gives kids to arent fit to raise dogs let alone children he looked ready to launch into a speech but stopped and slipped his smile back on quickly many of the kids we get are low probability adoption cases mr defective mixed race in and out of foster homes or thrown on the trash heap by their families when they come here they have no conception of socially appropriate behavior hygiene or basic day today living skills quite often were starting from ground zero but were pleased at our progress one of the students is publishing a study on our results thats a great way to collect data yes and quite frankly it helps us raise money which is often the bottom line doctor when you want to keep a great place like la casa going come on he took my arm lets see the rest of the grounds we headed toward the pool from what i hear i said reverend mccaffrey is an excellent fundraiser kruger gave me a sidelong glance evaluating the intent of my words he is hes a marvelous person and it comes across and it takes most of his time but its still difficult you know he ran another childrens home in mexico but he had to close it down there was no government support and the attitude of the private sector there was let the peasants starve we were poolside now the water reflected the forest green black dappled with streaks of emerald there was a strong odor of chlorine mixed with sweat the lone swimmer was still in the water doing laps using a butterfly stroke with a lot of muscle behind it hey jimbo kruger called the swimmer reached the far end raised his head out of the water and saw the counselors wave he glided effortlessly toward us and pulled himself waist high out of the water he was in his early forties bearded and sinewy his sun baked body was covered with wet matted hair hey tim dr delaware this is jim halstead our head coach jim dr alexander delaware actually your only coach halstead spoke in a deep voice that emerged from his abdomen id shake your hand but mines kinda clammy thats fine i smiled dr delawares a child psychologist jim hes touring la casa as a prospective gentleman great to meet you doc and i hope you join us its beautiful out here isnt it he extended a long brown arm to the malibu sky gorgeous jim used to work in the inner city said kruger at manual arts high then he got smart halstead laughed it took me too long im an easy going guy but when an ape with a knife threatened me after i asked him to do pushups that was it im sure you dont get that here i said no way he rumbled the little guys are great which reminds me jim interrupted kruger ive got to talk to you about working out a program for rodney broussard something to build up his confidence you bet check you later jim right on come back again doc the hirsute body entered the water a sleek torpedo and swam otter like along the bottom of the pool we took a quarter mile walk around the periphery of the institution kruger showed me the infirmary a spotlessly white smallish room with an examining table and a cot sparkling of chrome and reeking of antiseptic it was empty we have a half time rn who works mornings for obvious reasons we cant afford a doctor i wondered why majestic oil or some other benefactor couldnt donate a part time physicians salary but were lucky to have a roster of volunteer docs some of the finest in the community who rotate through as we walked groups of youngsters and counselors passed us kruger waved the counselors returned the greeting more often than not the children were unresponsive as olivia had predicted and kruger had confirmed most had obvious physical or mental handicaps boys seemed to outnumber girls by about three to one and the majority of the kids were black or hispanic kruger ushered me into the cafeteria which was high ceilinged stucco walled and meticulously clean unspeaking mexican women waited impassively behind a glass partition serving tongs in hand the food was typical institutional fare stew creative use of ground meat jello overcooked vegetables in thick sauce we sat down at a picnic type table and kruger went behind the food counter to a back room he emerged with a tray of danish pastries and coffee the baked goods looked high quality i hadnt seen anything like them behind the glass across the room a group of children sat at a table eating and drinking under the watchful eyes of two student counselors actually attempting to eat was more accurate even from a distance i could see that they suffered from cerebral palsy some of them spastically rigid others jerking in involuntary movements of head and limb and had to struggle to get the food from table to mouth the counselors watched and sometimes offered verbal encouragement but they didnt help physically and lots of custard and jello was ending up on the floor kruger bit with gusto into a chocolate danish i took a cinnamon roll and played with it he poured us coffee and asked me if i had any questions no everything looks very impressive great then let me tell you about the gentlemans brigade he gave me a canned history of the volunteer group stressing the wisdom of the reverend gus in enlisting the participation of local corporations the gentlemen are mature successful individuals they represent the only chance most of these kids have of being exposed to a stable male role model theyre accomplished the cream of our society and as such give the children a rare glimpse of success it teaches them that its indeed possible to be successful they spend time with the kids here at la casa and take them off campus to sporting events movies plays disneyland and to their homes for family dinners it gives the children access to a lifestyle theyve never known and its fulfilling for the men as well we ask for a six month commitment and sixty percent sign up for second and third hitches cant it be frustrating for the kids i asked to get a taste of the good life thats so far out of their grasp he was ready for that one good question doctor but we dont emphasize anything being out of our kids reach we want them to feel that the only thing limiting them is their own lack of motivation that they must take responsibility for themselves that they can reach the sky thats the name of a book written for children by reverend gus touch the sky its got cartoons games coloring pages it teaches them a positive message it was norman vincent peale spiced up with humanistic psychological jargon i looked over and saw the palsied children battling with their food no amount of exposure to the members of the privileged class was going to bring them membership in the yacht club an invitation to the blue ribbon upper crust debutante ball of san marino or a mercedes in the garage there were limits to the power of positive thinking but kruger had his script and he stuck to it he was damned good i had to admit had read all the right journals and could quote statistics like a rand corporation whiz kid it was the kind of spiel designed to get you reaching for your wallet can i get you anything else he asked after finishing a second pastry i hadnt touched my first no thanks lets head back then its almost four we passed through the rest of the place quickly there was a chicken coop where two dozen hens pecked at the bars like skinnerian pigeons a goat at the end of a long leash eating trash hamsters treading endlessly on plastic wheels and a basset hound who bayed half heartedly at the darkening sky the schoolroom had once been a barracks the gym a world war ii storage depot i was informed both had been remodeled artfully and creatively on a budget by someone with a good feel for camouflage i complimented the designer thats the work of reverend gus his mark is on every square inch of this place a remarkable man as we headed toward mccaffreys office i saw once again the cinder block buildings at the edge of the forest from up close i could see there were four structures roofed in concrete windowless and half submerged in the earth like bunkers with tunnel like ramps sloping down to iron doors kruger showed no indication of explaining what they were so i asked him he looked over his shoulder storage he said casually come on lets get back wed come full circle back to the cumulus covered administration building kruger escorted me in shook my hand told me he hoped to hear from me again and that hed be dropping off the screening materials while i talked to the reverend then he handed me over to the good graces of grandma the receptionist who tore herself away from her olivetti and bade me sweetly to wait just a few moments for the great man i picked up a copy of fortune and worked hard at building an interest in a feature on the future of microprocessors in the tool and die industry but the words blurred and turned into gelatinous gray blobs futurespeak did that to me id barely had a chance to uncross my legs when the door opened they were big on punctuality here id started to feel like a hunk of raw material what kind didnt really matter being whisked along on an assembly line trough melted molded tinkered with tightened and inspected reverend gus will see you now said grandma the time had come i supposed for the final polishing if wed been standing outdoors he would have blocked the sun he was six and a half feet tall and weighed well over three hundred pounds a pear shaped mountain of pale flesh in a fawn colored suit white shirt and black silk tie the breadth of a hotel hand towel his tan oxfords were the size of small sailboats his hands twin sandbags he filled the doorway black horn rimmed glasses perched atop a meaty nose that bisected a face as lumpy as tapioca pudding wens moles and enlarged pores trekked their way across the sagging cheeks there was a hint of africa in the flatness of his nose the full lips as dark and moist as raw liver and the tightly kinked hair the color of rusty pipes his eyes were pale almost without color id seen eyes like that before on mullet packed in ice dr delaware im augustus mccaffrey his hand devoured mine then released it his voice was strangely gentle from the size of him id expected something along the lines of a tug horn what came out was surprisingly lyrical barely baritone softened by the lazy cadence of the deep south louisiana i guessed come in wont you i followed him a hindu trailing an elephant into his office it was large and well windowed but no more elegantly turned out than the waiting room the walls were sheathed with the same false oak and were devoid of decoration save for a large wooden crucifix above the desk a formica and steel rectangle that looked like government surplus the ceiling was low perforated white squares suspended in a grid of aluminum there was a door behind the desk i sat in one of a trio of vinyl upholstered chairs he settled himself in a swivel chair that groaned in protest laced his fingers together and leaned forward across the desk which now looked like a childs miniature i trust tim has given you a comprehensive tour and has answered all of your questions he was very helpful good he drawled giving the word three syllables hes a very capable young man i handpick our staff he squinted just as i handpick all volunteers we want only the best for our children he sat back and rested his hands on his belly im extremely pleased that a man of your stature would consider joining us doctor weve never had a child psychologist in the gentlemans brigade tim tells me youre retired he gazed at me jovially it was clear i was expected to explain myself yes thats true hmm he scratched behind one ear still smiling waiting i smiled back you know he finally said when tim mentioned your visit i thought your name was familiar but i couldnt place it then it came to me just a few moments ago you ran that program for those children who were the victims of that day care scandal didnt you yes wonderful work how are they doing the children quite well you retired soon after the program was over did you yes the enormous head shook sadly tragic affair the man killed himself if i recall he did doubly tragic the little ones abused like that and a mans life wasted with no chance of salvation or he smiled to use a more secular term with no chance of rehabilitation theyre one and the same salvation and rehabilitation dont you think doctor i can see similarity in the two concepts certainly it depends upon ones perspective i confess he sighed that i find it difficult at times to divorce myself from my religious training when dealing with issues of human relations i must struggle to do so of course in view of our societys abhorrence of even a minimal liaison between church and state he wasnt protesting the broad face was suffused with calm nourished by the sweet fruit of martyrdom he looked at peace with himself as content as a hippo sunning in a mudhole do you think the man the one who killed himself could have been rehabilitated he asked me its hard to say i didnt know him the statistics on treatment of lifelong pedophiles arent encouraging statistics he played with the word letting it roll slowly off his tongue he enjoyed the sound of his own voice statistics are cold numbers arent they with no consideration for the individual and tim in forms me on a mathematical level statistics have no relevance for an individual is that correct thats true when folks quote statistics it reminds me of the joke about the okie okie jokes were fashionable before your time woman who had borne ten children with relative equanimity but who became very agitated upon learning she was pregnant with the eleventh her doctor asked her why after having gone through the travails of pregnancy labor and delivery ten times she was suddenly so distraught and she told him she had read that every eleventh child born in oklahoma was an indian and durned if she was going to raise a redskin he laughed the belly heaving the eyes black slits his glasses slid down his nose and he righted them that doctor sums up my view of statistics you know most of the children at la casa were statistics prior to their coming here doctor numbers in the dependency court files codes for the dpss caseworkers to catalogue scores on iq tests and those numbers said they were beyond hope but we take them and we work strenuously to transform those numbers into little individuals i dont care about a childs iq score i want to help him claim his birthright as a human being opportunity basic health and welfare and if youll permit a clerical lapse a soul for there is a soul in every single one of those children even the ones functioning at a vegetative level i agree that its good not to be limited by numbers his man kruger had been pretty handy with statistics when they served his purpose and i was willing to bet la casa made use of a computer or two to churn out the right numbers when the occasion called for it our work is effecting change its an alchemy of sorts which is why suicide any suicide saddens me deeply for all men are capable of salvation that man was a quitter in the ultimate sense but of course he lowered his voice the quitter has become the archetype of modern man hasnt he doctor it has become fashionable to throw up ones hands after the merest travesty of effort everyone wants quick and easy solutions including no doubt those who retired at thirty two there are miracles happening every day right on these grounds children whove been given up on gain a new sense of themselves a youngster who is incontinent learns to control his bowels he paused like a politician after an applause line so called retarded children learn to read and write small miracles perhaps when measured against a man walking on the moon or perhaps not his eyebrows arched the thick lips parted to reveal widely spaced horsey teeth of course doctor if you find the word miracle unduly sectarian we can substitute success that is a word the average american can relate to success coming from someone else it could have been a cheap throwaway oration worthy of a sunday morning jesus huckster but mccaffrey was good and his words carried the conviction of one ordained to carry out a sacred mission may i ask he inquired pleasantly why you retired i wanted a change of pace reverend time to sort out my values i understand reflection can be profoundly valuable however i trust you wont absent yourself from your profession for too long we need good people in your field he was still preaching but now mixing it with an ego massage i understood why the corporate honchos loved him in fact i have begun to miss working with children which is why i called you excellent excellent psychologys loss will be our gain you worked at western pediatric didnt you i seem to remember that from the paper there and in private practice a first rate hospital we send many of our children there when the need for medical attention arises im acquainted with several of the physicians on staff and many of them have been quite generous giving of themselves those are busy men reverend you must be quite persuasive not really however i do recognize the existence of a basic human need to give an altruistic drive if you will i know this flies in the face of the modern psychologies which limit the notion of drive to self gratification but im convinced im right altruism is as basic as hunger and thirst you for example satisfied your own altruistic need within the scope of your chosen profession but when you stopped working the hunger returned and here he spread his arms you are he opened a drawer of the desk took out a brochure and handed it to me it was glossy and well done as polished as the quarterly report of an industrial conglomerate on page six youll see a partial list of our board i found it for a partial list it was long running the height of the page in small print and impressive it included two county supervisors a member of the city council the mayor judges philanthropists entertainment biggies attorneys businessmen and plenty of mds some of whose names i recognized like l willard towle those are all busy men doctor and yet they find the time for our children because we know how to tap that inner resource that wellspring of altruism i flipped through the pages there was a letter of endorsement from the governor lots of photographs of children having fun and even more pictures of mccaffrey his looming bulk appeared pinstriped on the donahue show in tuxedo at a music center benefit in a jogging suit with a group of his young charges at the victory line of the special olympics mccaffrey with tv personalities civil rights leaders country singers and bank presidents midway through the brochure i found a shot of mccaffrey in a room i recognized as the lecture hall at western pediatric next to him white hair gleaming was towle on the other side was a small man froggy squat grim even as he smiled the guy with peter lorre eyes whose photograph id seen in towles office the caption beneath the photo identified him as the honorable edwin g hayden supervising judge of the dependency court the occasion was mccaffreys address to the medical staff on child welfare past present and future is dr towle very involved in la casa i asked he serves on our board and is one of our rotating physicians do you know him weve met casually i know him by reputation yes an authority on behavioral pediatrics we find his services invaluable im sure you do he spent the next quarter hour showing me his book a soft covered locally printed volume of saccharine cliches and first rate graphics i bought a copy for fifteen bucks after he gave me a more sophisticated version of the pitch for cash kruger had thrown my way the bargain basement ambience of the office lent credibility to the spiel besides i was oded on positive thinking and it seemed a small price to pay for respite he took the three five dollar bills folded them and placed them conspicuously in a collection box atop the desk the receptacle was papered with a drawing of a solemn looking child with eyes that rivaled melody quinns in size luminosity and the ability to project a sense of inner hurt he stood thanked me for coming and took my hand in both of his i hope we see more of you doctor soon it was my turn to smile plan on it reverend grandma was ready for me as i stepped into the waiting room with a sheaf of stapled booklets and two sharpened number two pencils you can fill these out right here doctor delaware she said sweetly i looked at my watch gee its much later than i thought ill have to take a raincheck but she became flustered how about you give them to me to take home ill fill them out and mail them back to you oh no i couldnt do that these are psychological tests she clutched the papers to her breast the rules are that you must fill them out here well then ill just have to come back i started to leave wait let me ask someone ill ask reverend gus if its he told me he was going to retire for a period of meditation i dont think he wants to be disturbed oh she was disoriented i must ask someone you wait right here doctor and ill find tim sure when she was gone i slipped out the door unnoticed the sun had almost set it was that transitional time of day when the diurnal palette is slowly scraped dry colors falling aside to reveal a wash of gray that ambiguous segment of twilight when everything looks just a little bit fuzzy around the edges i walked toward my car unsettled id spent three hours at la casa and had learned little other than that the reverend augustus mccaffrey was a shrewd old boy with overactive charisma glands hed taken the time to check me out and wanted me to know it but only a paranoiac could rightfully see anything ominous in that he was showing off displaying how well informed and prepared he was the same went for his advertising the abundance of friends in high places it was psychological muscle flexing power respected power strength gravitated to strength the more connections mccaffrey could show the more he was going to get and that was the way to big bucks that and collection boxes illustrated with sad eyed waifs i had the key in the door of the seville facing the campus of the institution it looked empty and still like a well run farm after the works all done probably dinner time with the kids in the cafeteria the counselors watching and the reverend gus delivering an eloquent benediction i felt foolish i was about to open the door when i caught a glimpse of a flurry of movement near the forest like grove several hundred feet in the distance it was hard to be certain but i thought i saw a struggle heard the sound of muffled cries i put the car keys back in my pocket and let the copy of mccaffreys book drop to the gravel there was no one else in sight except for the guard in the booth at the entrance and his attention was focused in the opposite direction i needed to get closer without being seen carefully i made my way down the hill upon which the parking lot sat staying in the shadow of buildings whenever i could the shapes in the distance were moving but slowly i pressed myself against the flamingo pink wall of the southernmost dormitory as far as i could go without abandoning cover the ground was moist and mushy the air rotten with fumes given off by a nearby trash dumpster someone had tried to write fuck in the pink paint but the corrugated metal was a hostile surface and it came out chicken scratches the sounds were clearer and louder now and they were definitely cries of distress animal cries bleating and plaintive i made out three silhouettes two large one much smaller the small one seemed to be walking on air i inched closer peering around the corner the three figures passed before me perhaps thirty feet away moving along the southern border of the institution they walked across the concrete of the pool deck and came under the illumination of a yellow anti bug light affixed to the eave of the pool house it was then that i saw them clearly flash frozen in the lemon light the small figure was rodney and hed appeared suspended because he was being carried in the firm grip of halstead the coach and tim kruger they grasped him under the arms so that his feet dangled inches from the ground they were strong men but the boy was giving them a struggle he squirmed and kicked like a ferret in a trap opened his mouth and let out a wordless moan halstead clamped a hairy hand over the mouth but the child managed to wrench free and scream again halstead stifled him once more and it went on that way as they retreated out of the light and my line of vision the alternating sounds of cries and muted grunts a crazy trumpet solo that grew faint then faded away then it was silent and i was alone back to the wall bathed in sweat clothes clammy and sticking to me i wanted to perform some heroic act to break out of the deadening inertia that had settled around my ankles like quick drying cement but i couldnt save anybody i was a man out of his element if i followed them thered be rational explanations for everything and a herd of guards to quickly turn me out taking careful note of my face so that the gates of la casa would never again open before it i couldnt afford that just yet so i stood up against the wall rooted in the ghost town stillness feeling sick and helpless i clenched my fists until they hurt and listened to the dry urgent sound of my own breathing like the scraping of boots against alley stones i forced the image of the struggling boy out of my mind when i was sure it was safe i sneaked back to my car the first time i called at am nobody answered a half hour later the university of oregon was open for business good morning education good morning this is dr gene adler calling from los angeles im with the department of psychiatry at western pediatric medical center in los angeles were currently recruiting for a counseling position one of our applicants has listed on his resume the fact that he received a masters degree in counseling education from your department as part of our routine credentials check i was wondering if you could verify that for me ill switch you to marianne in transcripts marianne had a warm friendly voice but when i repeated my story for her she told me firmly that a written request would be necessary thats fine with me i said but that will take time the job for which this individual has applied is being competitively sought by many people we were planning to make a decision within twenty four hours its just a formality verification of records but our liability insurance stipulates that we have to do it if youd like i can have the applicant call you to release the information its in his best interests well i suppose itll be all right all you want to know is if this person received a degree right nothing more personal than that thats correct whos the applicant a gentleman named timothy kruger his records list an ma four years ago one moment she was gone for ten minutes and when she returned to the phone she sounded upset well doctor your formality has turned out to be of some value there is no record of a degree being granted to a person of that name in the last ten years we do have record of a timothy jay kruger attending one semester of graduate school four years ago but his major wasnt in counseling it was in secondary teaching and he left after that single semester i see thats quite disturbing any indication of why he left none does that really matter now no i suppose not youre absolutely certain about this i wouldnt want to jeopardize mr krugers career theres no doubt whatsoever she sounded offended i checked and double checked doctor and then i asked the head of the department dr gowdy and he was positive no timothy kruger graduated from here well that settles it doesnt it and it certainly casts a new light on mr kruger could you check one more thing whats that mr kruger also listed a ba in psychology from jedson college in washington state would your records contain that kind of information as well it would be on his application to graduate school we should have transcripts but i dont see why you need to marianne im going to have to report this to the state board of behavioral science examiners because state licensure is involved i want to know all the facts i see let me check this time she was back in a moment ive got his transcript from jedson here doctor he did receive a ba but it wasnt in psychology what was it in she laughed dramatic arts acting i called the school where raquel ochoa taught and had her pulled out of class despite that she seemed pleased to hear from me hi hows the investigation going were getting closer i lied thats what i called you about did elena keep a diary or any kind of records around the apartment no neither of us were diary writers never had been no notebooks tapes anything the only tapes i saw were music she had a tape deck in her new car and some cassettes handler gave her to help her relax for sleep why i ignored the question where are her personal effects you should know that the police had them i suppose they gave them back to her mother whats going on have you found out something nothing definite nothing i can talk about were trying to fit things together i dont care how you do it just catch him and punish him the monster i dredged up a rancid lump of false confidence and smeared it all over my voice we will i know you will her faith made me uneasy raquel im away from the files do you have her mothers home address handy sure she gave it to me thanks are you planning on visiting elenas family i thought it would be helpful to talk to them in person there was silence on the other end then she spoke theyre good people but they may shut you out its happened before she laughed i think youd do better if i went with you im like a member of the family its no hassle for you no i want to help when do you want to go this afternoon fine ill get off early tell them im not feeling well pick me up at two thirty heres my address she lived in a modest west la neighborhood not far from where the santa monica and san diego freeways merged in blissful union an area of cracker box apartment buildings populated by singles who couldnt afford the marina she was visible a block away waiting by the curb dressed in a pigeon blood crepe blouse blue denim skirt and tooled western boots she got in the car crossed a pair of un stockinged brown legs and smiled hi hi thanks for doing this i told you this is something i want to do i want to feel useful i drove north toward sunset there was jazz on the radio something free form and atonal with saxophone solos that sounded like police sirens and drums like a heart in arrest change it if youd like she pushed some buttons fiddled with the dial and found a mellow rock station someone was singing about lost love and old movies and tying it all together what do you want to know from them she asked settling back if elena told them anything about her work specifically the child who died anything about handler there were lots of questions in her eyes but she kept them there talking about handler will be especially touchy the family didnt like the idea of her going out with a man who was so much older and she hesitated an anglo to boot in situations like that the tendency is to deny the whole thing not even to acknowledge it its cultural to some extent its human to some extent maybe we hispanics do it more part of it is catholicism the rest is our indian blood how can you survive in some of the desolate regions weve lived in without denying reality you smile and pretend its lush and fertile and theres plenty of water and food and the desert doesnt seem so bad any suggestions how i might get around the denial i dont know she sat with her hands folded in her lap a proper schoolgirl i think id better start the talking cruz elenas mom always liked me maybe i can get through but dont expect miracles she had little to worry about on that account echo park is a chunk of latin america transported to the dusty hilly streets that buttressed by crumbling concrete embankments on either side of sunset boulevard rise between hollywood and downtown the streets have names like macbeth and macduff bonnybrae and laguna but are anything but poetic they climb to the south and dip down into the union district ghetto to the north they climb feeding into the tiny lake centered park that gives the area its name continue through arid trails get lost in an incongruous wilderness that looks down upon dodger stadium and elysian park home of the los angeles police academy sunset changes when it leaves hollywood and enters echo park the porno theaters and by the hour motels yield to botdnicas and bode gas outlets for discos latinos an infinite array of food stands taco joints peruvian seafood parlors fast food franchises and first rate latino restaurants beauty shops with windows guarded by styrofoam skulls wearing blond dynel wigs cuban bakeries storefront medical and legal clinics bars and social clubs like many poor areas the echo park part of sunset is continually clogged with foot traffic the seville cut a slow swath through the afternoon mob there was a mood on the boulevard as urgent and sizzling as the molten lard spitting forth from the fryers of the food stands there were home boys sporting homemade tattoos fifteen year old mothers wheeling fat babies in rickety strollers that threatened to fall apart at every curb rummies pushers starched collared immigration lawyers cleaning women on shore leave grandmothers flower vendors a never ending stream of brown eyed children its very weird said raquel coming back here in a fancy car how long have you been gone a thousand years she didnt seem to want to say more so i dropped it at fairbanks place she told me to turn left the gutierrez home was at the end of an alley sized twister that peaked then turned into a dirt road just above the foothills a quarter mile further and wed have been the only humans in the world id noticed that she had a habit of biting herself lips fingers knuckles when she was nervous and she was gnawing at her thumb right now i wondered what kind of hunger it satisfied i drove cautiously there was scarcely room for a single vehicle passing young men in t shirts working on old cars with the dedication of priests before a shrine children sucking candy coated fingers long ago the street had been planted with elms that had grown huge their roots buckled the sidewalk and weeds grew in the cracks branches scraped the roof of the car an old woman with inflamed legs wrapped in rags pushed a shopping cart full of memories up an incline worthy of san francisco graffiti scarred every free inch of space proclaiming the immortality of little willie chacon the echo parque skulls los conquistadores the lemoyne boys and the tongue of maria paula bonilla there she pointed to a cottage like frame house painted light green and roofed with brown tarpaper the front yard was dry and brown but rimmed with hopeful beds of red geraniums and clusters of orange and yellow poppies that looked like all day suckers there was rock trim at the base of the house and a portico over the entry that shadowed a sagging wooden porch upon which a man sat thats rafael the older brother on the porch i found a parking space next to a chevy on blocks i turned the wheels to the curb and locked them in place we got out of the car dust spiraling at our heels rafael she called and waved the man on the porch took a moment to lift his gaze then he raised his hand feebly it seemed i used to live right around the corner she said making it sound like a confession she led me up a dozen steps and through an open iron gate the man on the porch hadnt risen he stared at us with apprehension and curiosity and something else that i couldnt identify he was pale and thin to the point of being gaunt with the same curious mixture of hispanic features and fair coloring as his dead sister his lips were bloodless his eyes heavily lidded he looked like the victim of some systemic disease he wore a long sleeved white shirt with the sleeves rolled up just below the elbows it bloused out around his waist several sizes too large his trousers were black and looked as if theyd once belonged to a fat mans suit his shoes were bubble toed oxfords cracked at the tips worn unlaced with the tongues protruding and revealing thick white socks his hair was short and combed straight back he was in his mid twenties but he had an old mans face a weary wary mask raquel went to him and kissed him lightly on the top of his head he looked up at her but was unmoved hlo rocky rafael how are you ok he nodded his head and it looked for a moment as if it would roll off his neck he let his eyes settle on me he was having trouble focusing raquel bit her lip we came by to see you and andy and your mom this is alex delaware he works with the police hes involved in investigating elenas case his face registered alarm his hands tightened around the arm of the chair then as if responding to a stage direction to relax he grinned at me slumped lower winked yeah he said i held out my hand he looked at it puzzled recognized it as a long lost friend and extended his own thin claw his arm was pitifully undernourished a bundle of sticks held together by a sallow paper wrapper as our fingers touched his sleeve rode up and i saw the track marks there were lots of them most looked old lumpy charcoal smudges but a few were freshly pink one in particular was no antique sporting a pinpoint of blood at its center his handshake was moist and tenuous i let go and the arm fell limply to his side hey man he said barely audible good to meetja he turned away lost in his own timeless dream hell for the first time i heard the oldies music coming from a cheap transistor radio on the floor beside his chair the puny plastic box crackled with static the sound reproduction was atrocious the music had the chalky quality of notes filtered through a mile of mud rafael had his head thrown back enraptured to him it was the celestial choir transmitting directly to his temporal lobes rafael she smiled he looked at her smiled nodded off and was gone she stared at him tears in her eyes i moved toward her and she turned away in shame and rage goddammit how long has he been shooting up years but i thought hed quit the last id heard hed quit she raised her hand to her mouth swayed as if ready to fall i got in position to catch her but she righted herself he got hooked in viet nam came home with a heavy habit elena spent lots of time and money trying to help him get off a dozen times he tried and each time he slipped back but hed been off it for over a year elena was so happy about it he got a job as a box boy at the luckys on alvarado she faced me nostrils flaring eyes floating like black lilies in a salty pond lips quivering like harp strings everything is falling apart she grasped the newel post on the porch rail for support i came behind her im sorry he was always the sensitive one quiet never dating no friends he got beat up a lot when their dad died he tried to take over to be the man of the house tradition says the oldest son should do that but it didnt work nobody took him seriously they laughed we all did so he gave up as if hed failed some final test he dropped out of school stayed home and read comic books and watched tv all day just stared at the screen when the army said they wanted him he seemed glad cruz cried to see him go but he was happy i looked at him sitting so low he was almost parallel with the ground swallowed up by junkie slumber his mouth was open and he snored loudly the radio played daddys home raquel hazarded another look at him men whipped her head away disgusted she wore an expression of noble suffering an aztec virgin steeling herself for the ultimate sacrifice i put my hands on her shoulders and she leaned back in my arms she stayed there tense and unyielding allowing herself a misers ration of tears this is a hell of a start she said inhaling deeply she let out her breath in a breeze of wintergreen she wiped her eyes and turned around you must think all i do is weep come on lets go inside she pulled the screen door open and it slapped sharply against the wood siding of the house we stepped into a small front room furnished with old but cared for relics it was warm and dark the windows shut tight and masked by yellowing parchment shades a room unaccustomed to visitors faded lace curtains were tied back from the window frames and matching lace coverlets shielded the arms of the chairs a sofa and love seat set upholstered in dark green crushed velvet the worn spots shiny and the color of jungle parrots two wicker rockers a painting of the two dead kennedy brothers in black velvet hung over the mantel carvings in wood and mexican onyx sat atop lace covered end tables there were two floor lamps with beaded shades a plaster jesus in agony hanging on the whitewashed wall next to a still life of a straw basket of oranges family portraits in ornate frames covered another wall and there was a large graduation picture of elena suspended high above those a spider crawled in the space where wall met ceiling a door to the right revealed a sliver of white tile raquel walked to the sliver and peeked in senora cruz the doorway widened and a small heavy woman appeared dishtowel in hand she wore a blue print dress un belted and her gray black hair was tied back in a bun held in place by a mock tortoiseshell comb silver earrings dangled from her ears and salmon spots of rouge punctuated her cheekbones her skin had the delicate baby soft look common in old women who had once been beautiful raquelita she put her towel down came out and the two women embraced for a long moment when she saw me over raquels shoulder she smiled but her face closed up as tight as a pawnbrokers safe she pulled away and gave a small bow senor she said with too much deference and looked at raquel arching one eyebrow senora gutierrez raquel spoke to her in rapid spanish i caught the words elena policia and doctor she ended it with a question the older woman listened politely then shook her head no some things are the same in any language raquel turned to me she says she knows nothing more than what she told the police the first time can you ask her about the nemeth boy they didnt ask her about that she turned to speak then stopped why dont we take it slowly it would help if we ate let her be a hostess let her give to us i was genuinely hungry and told her so she relayed the message to mrs gutierrez who nodded and returned to her kitchen lets sit down raquel said i took the love seat she tucked herself into a corner of the sofa the senora came back with cookies and fruit and hot coffee she asked raquel something shed like to know if this is substantial enough to would you like some homemade cfconzo please tell her this is wonderful however if you think my accepting chorizo would help things along ill oblige raquel spoke again a few moments later i was facing a platter of the spicy sausage rice refried beans and salad with lemon oil dressing much as gracias senora i dug in i couldnt understand much of what they were saying but it sounded and looked like small talk the two women touched each other a lot patting hands stroking cheeks they smiled and seemed to forget my presence then suddenly the wind shifted and the laughter turned to tears mrs gutierrez ran out of the room seeking the refuge of her kitchen raquel shook her head we were talking about the old times when elena and i were little girls how we used to play secretary in the bushes pretend we had typewriters and desks out there it became difficult for her i pushed my plate aside do you think we should go i asked lets wait a while she poured me more coffee and filled a cup for herself it would be more respectful through the screen door i could see the top of rafaels fair head above the rim of the chair his arm had fallen so that the fingernails scraped the ground he was beyond pleasure or pain did she talk about him i asked no as i told you its easier to deny but how can he sit there shooting up right in front of her with no pretense she used to cry a lot about it after a while you accept the fact that things arent going to turn out the way you want them to shes had plenty of training in it believe me if you asked her about him shed say he was sick just as if he had a cold or the measles its just a matter of finding the right cure have you heard of the curanderost the folk doctors yes lots of the hispanic patients at the hospital used them along with conventional medicine do you know how they operate by caring in our culture the cold distant professional is regarded as someone who simply doesnt care who is just as likely to deliver the mal ojo the evil eye as he is to cure the curandero on the other hand has little training or technology at his disposal a few snake powders maybe but he cares he lives in the community he is warm and familiar has tremendous rapport in a way hes a folk psychologist more than a folk doctor thats why i suggested you eat to establish a personal link i told her you were a caring person otherwise shed say nothing shed be polite ladylike cruz is from the old school but shed shut you out just the same she sipped at her coffee thats why the police learned nothing when they came here why they seldom do in echo park or east la or san fernando theyre too professional no matter how well meaning they may be we see them as anglo robots you do care alex dont you i do she touched my knee cruz took rafael to a curandero years ago when he first started dropping out the man looked into his eyes and said they were empty he told her it was an illness of the soul not of the body that the boy should be given to the church as a priest or monk so that he could find a useful role for himself not bad advice she sipped her coffee no some of them are very sophisticated they live by their wits maybe it would have prevented the addiction if shed followed through who knows but she couldnt give him up i wouldnt be surprised if she blames herself for what hes become for everything the door to the kitchen opened mrs gutierrez came out wearing a black band around her arm and a new face that was more than just fresh makeup a face hardened to withstand the acid bath of interrogation she sat down next to raquel and whispered to her in spanish she says you may ask any questions youd like i nodded with what i hoped was obvious gratitude please tell the senora that i express my sorrow at her tragic loss and also let her knew that i greatly appreciate her taking the time during her period of grief to talk to me the older woman listened to the translation and acknowledged me with a quick movement of her head ask her raquel if elena ever talked about her work especially during the last year as raquel spoke a nostalgic smile spread across the older womans face she says only to complain that teachers did not get paid enough that the hours were long and the children could get difficult any particular children a whispered conference no child in particular the senora reminds you that elena was a special kind of teacher who helped children with problems in learning all the children had difficulties i wondered to myself if thered been a connection between growing up with a brother like rafael and the dead girls choice of specialty did she speak at all about the child who was killed the nemeth boy upon hearing the question mrs gutierrez nodded sadly then spoke she mentioned it once or twice she said she was very sad about it that it was a tragedy raquel translated nothing else it would be rude to pursue it alex okay try this did elena seem to have more money than usual recently did she buy expensive gifts for anyone in the family no she says elena always complained about not having enough money she was a girl who liked to have good things pretty things one minute she listened to the older woman nodding affirmation this wasnt always possible as the family was never rich even when her husband was alive but elena worked very hard she bought herself things sometimes on credit but she always made her payments nothing was repossessed she was a girl to make a mother proud i prepared myself for more tears but there were none the grieving mother looked at me with a cold dark expression of challenge i dare you she was saying to besmirch the memory of my little girl i looked away do you think i can ask her about handler now before raquel could answer mrs gutierrez spit she gesticulated with both hands raised her voice and uttered what had to be a string of curses she ended the diatribe by spitting again need i translate asked raquel dont bother i made a mental search for a new line of questioning normally my approach would have been to start off with small talk casual banter and subtly switch to direct questions i was dissatisfied with the crude way i was handling this interview but working with a translator was like doing surgery wearing garden gloves ask her if there is anything else she can tell me that might help us find the man who you phrase it the old woman listened and answered vehemently she says there is nothing that the world has become a crazy place full of demons that a demon must have done this to elena much as gracias senora ask her if i might have a look at elenas personal effects raquel asked her and the mother deliberated she looked me over from head to toe sighed and got up venga she said and led me to the rear of the house the flotsam and jetsam of elena gutierrezs twenty eight years had been stored in cardboard boxes and stuck in a corner of what passed in the tiny house as a service porch there was a windowed door with a view of the backyard an apricot tree grew there gnarled and deformed spreading its fruit laden branches across the rotting roof of a single car garage across the hall was a small bedroom with two beds the domicile of the brothers from where i knelt i could see a maple dresser and shelves constructed of unfinished planks resting on cinder blocks the shelves held a cheap stereo and a modest record collection a carton of marlboros and a pile of paperbacks shared the top of the dresser one of the beds was neatly made the other a jumble of tangled sheets between them was a single pine end table holding a lamp with a plastic base an ashtray and a copy of a spanish girlie magazine feeling like a peeping tom i pulled the first box close and began my excursion in pop archaeology by the time id gone through three boxes id succumbed to an indigo mood my hands were filthy with dust my mind filled with images of the dead girl thered been nothing of substance just the broken shards that surface at any prolonged dig clothing smelling of girl half empty bottles of cosmetics reminders that someone had once tried to make her eyelashes look thick and lush to give her hair that clairol shine to cover her blemishes and gloss her lips and smell good in all the right places scraps of paper with reminders to pick up eggs at vons and wine at vendome and other crypto grams laundry receipts gasoline credit card stubs books lots of them mostly biographies and poetry souvenirs a miniature ukulele from hawaii an ashtray from a hotel in palm springs ski boots an almost full disc of birth control pills old lesson plans memos from the principal childrens drawings none by a boy named nemeth it was too much like grave robbing for my taste i understood more than ever why milo drank too much there were two boxes to go i went at them working faster and was almost done when the roar of a motorcycle filled the air then died the back door opened footsteps sounded in the foyer what the fuck he was nineteen or twenty short and powerfully built wearing a sweat soaked brown tank top that showed every muscle grease stained khaki pants and work boots coated with grime his hair was thick and shaggy it hung to his shoulders and was held in place by a thonged leather headband he had fine almost delicate features that hed tried to camouflage by growing a mustache and beard the mustache was black and luxuriant it dropped over his lips and glistened like sable fur the beard was a skimpy triangle of down on his chin he looked like a kid playing pancho villa in the school play there was a ring of keys hanging from his belt and the keys jingled when he came toward me his hands were balled up into grimy fists and he smelled of motor oil i showed him my lapd badge he swore but stopped listen man you guys were here last week we told you we had nothin he stopped and looked down at the contents of the cardboard box strewn on the floor shit you went through all that stuff already i just packed it up man getting it ready for the goodwill just a recheck i said amiably yeah man why dont you dudes learn to get it right in the first fuckin place okay ill be through in a moment youre through now man out i stood give me a few minutes to wrap it up out man he crooked his thumb toward the back door im trying to investigate the death of your sister andy it wouldnt hurt you to cooperate he took a step closer there were grease smudges on his forehead and under his eyes dont andy me dude this is my place and its mr gutierrez and dont give me that shit about investigating you guys arent never gonna catch the dude who did it to elena cause you dont really give a fuck come bustin into a home and going through personal stuff and treatin us like peasants man you go out on the street and find the dude man this was beverly hills hed already a been caught he do this to some rich guys daughter his voice broke and he shut up to hide it mr gutierrez i said softly cooperation from family can be very helpful in these hey man i told you this family dont know nothing about this you think we know what kind of crazy asshole do something like that you think people around here act like that man he squinted at my badge reading it with effort moving his lips he mouthed the word consultant a couple of times before getting it aw man i dont believe it youre not even a real cop fucking consultant they send around here whats phd man doctorate in psychology you a shrink man fuckin headshrinker they send aroun here think someones crazy here you think someone in this family is crazy man do you he was breathing on me now his eyes were soft and brown long lashed and dreamy as a girls eyes like that could make you doubt yourself could lead a guy to get into some heavy macho posturing i thought the family had plenty of problems but i didnt answer his question what the fuck you doin here psychin us out man he sprayed me with spittle as he spoke a balloon of anger expanded in my gut automatically my body assumed a defensive karate stance its not like that i can explain or are you determined to be pigheaded i regretted the words even as they left my mouth pig goddammit man youre the pig his voice rose an octave and he grabbed the lapel of my jacket i was ready but i didnt move hes in mourning i kept telling myself hes not responsible i met his gaze and he backed off both of us would have welcomed an excuse to duke it out so much for civilization get out man now antonio mrs gutierrez had come into the hallway raquel was visible behind her seeing her i felt suddenly ashamed id done a great job of screwing up a sensitive situation the brilliant psychologist mom did you let this dude in mrs gutierrez apologized to me with her eyes and spoke to her son in spanish he seemed to wilt under mamas wagging finger and dark looks mom i told you before they dont give a she stopped continued in spanish it sounded like he was defending himself the machismo slowly rendered impotent they were back and forth for a while then he started in on raquel she gave it right back to him the man is trying to help you andy why dont you help him instead of chasing him away i dont need nobodys help were gonna take care of ourselves the way we always did she sighed shit he went into his room came out with a pack of marlboros and made a big deal out of lighting one and jamming it into his mouth he disappeared momentarily behind a blue cloud then the eyes flashed once again moving from me to his mother to raquel and back to me he pulled his key ring from his belt and held the keys sandwiched between his fingers impromptu brass knuckles im leaving now dude but when i get back you fucking well better be gone he kicked the door open and jogged out we heard the thunder of the motorcycle starting and the diminishing scream of the machine as it sped away mrs gutierrez hung her head and said something to raquel she asks your forgiveness for andys rudeness hes been very upset since elenas death hes working two jobs and under a lot of pressure i held a hand up to stop the apology theres no need to explain i only hope i havent caused the senora needless troubles translation was superfluous the look on the mothers face was eloquent i rummaged through the last two boxes with little enthusiasm and came up with no new insights the sour taste of the confrontation with andy lingered i experienced the kind of shame you feel upon digging too deep seeing and hearing more than you need or want to like a child walking in on his parents lovemaking or a hiker kicking aside a rock only to catch a glimpse of something slimy on the underside id seen families like the gutierrezes before id known scores of rafaels and andys it was a pattern the slob and the super kid playing out their roles with depressing predictability one unable to cope the other trying to take charge of everything the slob getting others to take care of him shirking his responsibilities coasting through life but feeling like a slob the super kid competent compulsive working two jobs even three when the situation called for it making up for the slobs lack of accomplishment earning the admiration of the family refusing to stoop under the weight of his burden keeping his rage under wraps but not always i wondered what role elena had played when she was alive had she been the peacemaker the go between getting caught in the crossfire between slob and super kid could be hazardous to ones health i repacked her things as neatly as i could when we stepped onto the porch rafael was still stuporous the sound of the seville starting up jolted him awake and he blinked rapidly as if coming out of a bad dream stood with effort and wiped his nose with his sleeve he looked in our direction puzzled raquel turned away from him a tourist avoiding a leprous beggar as i pulled away i saw a spark of recognition brighten his doped up countenance then more bewilderment the approaching darkness had dimmed the activity level on sunset but there was still plenty of life on the streets car horns honked raucous laughter rose above the exhaust fumes and mariachi music blared from the open doors of the bars traces of neon appeared and lights flickered in the foothills i really blew it i said no you cant blame yourself in the mood she was in boosting me took effort i appreciated that effort and told her so i mean it alex you were very sensitive with cruz i can see why you were a successful psychologist she liked you it obviously doesnt run in the family she was silent for a few blocks andys a nice boy he never joined the gangs took lots of punishment because of it he expects a lot out of himself everythings on his shoulders now with all that weight why add a two ton chip youre right he makes more problems for himself dont we all hes only eighteen maybe hell grow up i keep wondering if there was some way i could have handled it better i recounted the details of my exchange with the boy the pigheaded crack didnt help things but it didnt make a difference he came in ready to fight when latin men get that way theres little you can do add alcohol to that and you can see why we pack the emergency rooms with knifing victims every saturday night i thought of elena gutierrez and morton handler theyd never made it to the emergency room i allowed myself a short ride on that train of thought then skidded to a stop and dumped the thoughts in a dark depot somewhere in the south of my subconscious i looked over at raquel she sat stiffly in the soft leather refusing to give herself over to comfort her body was still but her hands played nervously with the fabric of her skirt are you hungry i asked when in doubt stick to basics no if you want you can stop for yourself i can still taste the chorizo you can take me home then when i got to her apartment it was dark and the streets were empty thanks for coming with me i hope it was helpful without you it would have been disastrous thank you she smiled and leaned over it started out as a kiss on the cheek but one or both of us moved and it turned into a kiss on the lips then a tentative nibble nurtured with heat and want that matured quickly into a gasping ravenous adult bite we moved closer simultaneously her arms easing around my neck my hands in her hair on her face at the small of her back our mouths opened and our tongues danced a slow waltz we breathed heavily squirming struggling to get closer we necked like two teenagers for endless minutes i undid a button of her blouse she made a throaty sound caught my lower lip between her teeth licked my ear my hand slithered around to the hot silk of her back working with a mind of its own undoing the clasp of her brassiere cupping around her breast the nipple pebble hard and moist nestled against my palm she lowered one hand slender fingers tugging at my fly i was the one who stopped it whats the matter theres nothing you can say in a situation like that that doesnt sound like a cliche or totally idiotic or both i opted for both im sorry dont take it personally she threw herself upright busied herself with buttoning fastening smoothing her hair how else should i take it youre very desirable very im attracted to you dammit id love to make love to you what is it then a commitment youre not married are you you dont act married there are other commitments besides marriage i see she gathered up her purse and put her hand on the door handle the person youre committed to it would matter to her yes more important it would matter to me she burst out laughing verging on hysteria im sorry she said catching her breath its so damned ironic you think i do this often this is the first time ive been interested in a guy in a long time the nun cuts loose and comes face to face with a saint she giggled it sounded feverish fragile made me uneasy i was weary of being on the receiving end of someones anyones frustration but i supposed she was entitled to her moment of cathartic stardom im no saint believe me she touched my cheek with her fingers it was like being raked with hot coals no youre just a nice guy delaware i dont feel like that either im going to kiss you again she said but its going to stay chaste this time the way it should have been in the first place and she did there were two surprises waiting for me when i got home the first was robin in my ratty yellow bathrobe stretched out on the leather sofa drinking hot tea a fire burned in the hearth and the stereo played the eagles desperado she was wearing a magazine photograph of lassie around her neck like a miniature sandwich sign hello darling she said i threw my jacket over a chair hi whats with the dog just my way of letting you know that ive been a bitch and im sorry you have nothing to be sorry for i removed the sign i sat beside her and took her hands in mine i was rotten to you this morning alex letting you leave like that the moment the door closed i started missing you you know how it is when you let your mind wander around what if something happens to him what if i never see him again you go crazy i couldnt work couldnt be around machines in that state the day was blown i called you but i couldnt get through so here i am virtue has its rewards i muttered under my breath whats that sweetie nothing any recounting of my minor league indiscretion would suffer in the retelling emerging as either a boorish bathroom scribble yeah i copped a fast feel from another broad honey or worse a confession i lay down beside her we held each other said nice things talked baby talk stroked each other i was pumped up from the waist down some of it a residue of the curbside session with raquel most of it belonging to the moment there are two giant porterhouses in the refrigerator and a caesar salad and burgundy and sourdough she whispered tickling my nose with her pinkie youre a very oral person i laughed is that neurotic doctor no its wonderful how about this and this the robe fell open she kneeled above me letting it slide down her shoulders backlit by the glow of the fire she looked like a piece of glorious golden statuary come on sweetie she coaxed get out of those clothes and she took the matter into her own hands i do love you she said later even if you are catatonic i refused to budge and lay spreadeagled on the floor im cold she covered me stood and stretched and laughed with pleasure how can you jump around afterwards i groaned women are stronger than men she said gaily and proceeded to dance around the room humming stretching more so that the muscles of her calves ascended in the slender columns of her legs like bubbles rising in a carpenters level her eyes reflected orange halloween light when she moved a shudder went through me keep jiggling like that and ill show you whos stronger later big boy she teased me with her foot and leaped away from my grabbing paws with fluid agility by the time the steaks were ready mrs gutierrezs cuisine was a vague memory and i ate with gusto we sat side by side in the breakfast nook looking out through leaded glass as lights went on in the hills like the beacons of a distant search party she rested her head on my shoulder my arm went around her my fingertips blindly traced the contours of her face we took turns drinking from a single glass of wine i love you i said i love you too she kissed the underside of my chin after several more sips you were investigating those murders today werent you yes she fortified herself with a large swallow and refilled the glass dont worry she said im not going to hassle you about it i cant pretend i like it but i wont try to control you i hugged her by way of thanks i mean i wouldnt want you treating me that way so i wont do it to you she was giving liberation the old school try but worry remained suspended in her voice like a fly in amber im watching out for myself i know you are she said too quickly youre a bright man you can take care of yourself she handed me the wine if you want to talk about it alex ill listen i hesitated tell me i want to know whats going on i gave her a rehash of the last two days ending it with the confrontation with andy gutierrez leaving out the ten turbulent minutes with raquel she listened troubled and attentive digested it and told me i can see why you cant drop it so many suspicious things no connecting thread she was right it was reverse gestalt the whole so much less than the sum of its parts a random assortment of musicians sawing blowing thumping yearning for a conductor but who the hell was i to play ormandy when are you going to tell milo im not i spoke to him this morning and he basically told me to mind my own business stay out of it but its his job alex hell know what to do honey milo will get bent out of shape if i tell him i visited la casa but that poor child the retarded one isnt there something he could do about it i shook my head its not enough thered be an explanation for it miles got his suspicions ill bet theyre stronger than he let on to me but hes hemmed in by rules and procedures and youre not she said softly dont worry dont worry yourself im not going to try to stop you i meant what i said i drank more wine my throat had constricted and the cool liquid was astringently soothing she got up and stood behind me putting her arms over my shoulders it was a gesture of support not dissimilar from the one id offered raquel just a few hours earlier she reached down and played with the ridge of hair that vertically bisected my abdomen im here for you alex if you need me i always need you but not to get involved in crap like this whatever you need me for im here i rose out of the chair and drew her to me kissing her neck her ears her eyes she threw back her head and put my lips on the warm pulse at the base of her throat lets get into bed and snuggle she said i turned on the radio and tuned it to kkgo sonny rollins was extracting a liquid sonata from his horn i switched on a dim light and drew back the covers the second surprise of the evening lay there a plain white envelope business size unmarked and partially covered by the pillow was this here when you arrived shed taken off her robe now she held it to her breasts seeking cover as if the envelope were a living breathing intruder could have been i didnt go in the bedroom i slit it open with my thumbnail and took out the single sheet of white paper folded inside the page was devoid of date address or any distinguishing logo just a white rectangle filled with lines of handwriting that slanted pessimistically downward the penmanship cramped and spidery was familiar i sat down on the edge of the bed and read dear doctor heres hoping you sleep in your own bed in the near future so you have the opportunity to read this i took the liberty of jimmying your rear door to get in and deliver this you should get a better lock by the way this afternoon i was relieved of my duties in the h g case el capitan feels the case would benefit by the infusion of fresh blood the tasteless choice of words was his not mine i have my doubts about his motivation but i havent exactly set any new detection records so i was in no position to debate it with him i must have looked pretty shattered by it cause he got suddenly empathetic and suggested i take some r and r in fact he was very well versed in the details of my personnel file knew that id accrued lots of vacation time and strongly urged me to use some of it at first i wasnt overjoyed at the idea but ive since come to view it as an excellent one ive found my place in the sun a quaint little watering hole named ahuacatlan just north of guadalajara some preliminary checking via long distance reveals that said burg is extremely well suited for someone of my recreational interests hunting and fishing in particular i expect to be gone for two or three days phone contact is tenuous and undesirable the natives cherish privacy will call when i get back regards to stradivarius stadivariette and stay out of trouble all the best milo i gave it to robin to read she finished it and handed it back whats he saying that he was kicked off the case yes probably because of outside pressure but hes going to mexico to look into mccaffreys background apparently when he called down there he got enough over the phone to make him want to pursue it hes going behind his captains back he must feel its worth it milo was a brave man but no martyr he wanted his pension as much as the next guy you were right then about la casa she got under the covers and drew them up to her chin she shivered not from the cold yes never had being right seemed of such meager solace the music from the radio peeked around corners and took an unexpected pirouette a drummer had joined rollins and he slapped out a tropical tattoo on his tom toms i could think only of cannibals and snake encrusted vines shrunken heads hold me i got in beside her and kissed her and held her and tried to act calm but all the while my mind was elsewhere lost on some frozen piece of tundra floating out to sea the entrance lobby of western pediatric medical center was walled with marble slabs engraved with the names of long dead benefactors inside the lobby was filled with the injured the ill and the doomed all simmering in the endless wait that is as much a part of hospitals as are intravenous needles and bad food mothers clutched bundles to their breasts wails escaping from within the layers of the blanket fathers chewed their nails grappled with insurance forms and tried not to think about the loss of masculinity resulting from encounters with bureaucracy toddlers raced about placing their hands on the marble withdrawing them quickly at the cold and leaving behind grimy mementoes a loudspeaker called out names and the chosen plodded to the admissions desk a blue haired lady in the green and white striped uniform of a hospital volunteer sat behind the information counter as baffled as those she was mandated to assist in a far corner of the lobby children and grownups sat on plastic chairs and watched television the tv was tuned to a serial that took place in a hospital the doctors and nurses on the screen wore spotless white had coiffed hair perfect faces and teeth that radiated a mucoid sparkle as they conversed in slow low earnest tones about love hate anguish and death the doctors and nurses who elbowed their way through the throng in the lobby were altogether more human rumpled harried sleepy eyed those entering rushed responding to beepers and emergency phone calls those exiting did so with the alacrity of escaping prisoners fearing last minute calls back to the wards i wore my white coat and hospital badge and carried my briefcase as the automatic doors allowed me through and the sixtyish red nosed guard nodded as i passed morning doctor i rode the elevator to the basement along with a despondent black couple in their thirties and their son a withered gray skinned nine year old in a wheelchair at the mezzanine we were joined by a lab tech a fat girl carrying a basket of syringes needles rubber tubing and glass cylinders full of the ruby syrup of life the parents of the boy in the wheelchair looked longingly at the blood the child turned his head to the wall the ride ended with a bump we were disgorged into a dingy yellow corridor the other passengers turned right toward the lab i went the other way came to a door marked medical records opened it and went in nothing had changed since id left i had to turn sideways to get through the narrow aisle carved into the floor to ceiling stacks of charts no computer here no high tech attempt at organizing the tens of thousands of dog eared manila files into a coherent system hospitals are conservative institutions and western pediatric was the most stodgy of hospitals welcoming progress the way a dog welcomes the mange at the end of the aisle was an unadorned gray wall just in front of it sat a sleepy looking filipino girl reading a glamor magazine may i help you yes im dr delaware i need to get hold of a chart of a patient of mine you could have your secretary call us doctor and wed send it to you sure in two weeks i appreciate that but i need to look at it right now and my secretarys not here yet whats the patients name adams brian adams the room was divided alphabetically i picked a name that would take her to the far end of the a k section if youll just fill out this form ill get it right for you i filled out the form falsifying with ease she didnt bother to look at it and dropped it into a metal file box when she was gone hidden between the stacks i went to the l z side of the room searched among the us and found what i was looking for i slipped it into my briefcase and returned she came back minutes later ive got three brian adamses here doctor which one is it i scanned the three and picked one at random this is it if you sign this she held out a second form i can let you have it on twenty four hour loan therell be no need for that ill just examine it here i made a show of looking scholarly leafed through the medical history of brian adams age eleven admitted for a routine tonsillectomy five years previously clucked my tongue shook my head jotted down some meaningless notes and gave it back to her thanks youve been most helpful she didnt answer having already returned to the world of cosmetic camouflage and clothing designed for the sado intellectual set i found an empty conference room down the hall next to the morgue locked the door from the inside and sat down to examine the final chronicles of gary nemeth the boy had spent the last twenty two hours of his life in the intensive care unit at western pediatric not a second of it in a conscious state from a medical point of view it was open and shut hopeless the admitting intern had kept his notes factual and objective labeling it auto versus pedestrian in the quaint lexicon of medicine that makes tragedy sound like a sporting event hed been brought in by ambulance battered crushed skull shredded all but his most rudimentary bodily functions gone yet thousands of dollars had been spent delaying the inevitable and enough pages had been filled to create a medical chart the size of a textbook i leafed through them nursing notes with their compulsive accounting of intake and output the child reduced to cubic centimeters of fluid and plumbing icu graphs progress notes that was a cruel joke consultations from neuro surgeons neurologists nephrologists radiologists cardiologists blood tests x rays scans shunts sutures intravenous feedings parenteral nutritional supplements respiratory therapy and finally the autopsy stapled to the back inside cover was the sheriffs report another example of jargonistic reductionism in this equally precious dialect carey nemeth was v for victim v had been hit from behind while walking down malibu canyon road just before midnight hed been barefoot wearing pajamas yellow the report was careful to note there were no skid marks leading the reporting deputy to conclude that hed been hit at full force from the distance the body traveled the estimated speed of the vehicle was between forty and fifty miles per hour the rest was paperwork a cardboard snack for some downtown computer it was a depressing document nothing in it surprised me not even the fact that gary nemeths private pediatrician of record the physician whod actually signed the death report was lionel willard towle md i left the chart stuck under a stack of x ray plates and walked toward the elevator two eleven year olds had escaped from the ward and were waging a wheelchair drag race they whooped by iv tubing looping like lariats and i had to swerve to avoid them i reached for the elevator button and heard my name called hlo alex it was the medical director chatting with a pair of interns he dismissed them and walked my way hello henry hed put on a few pounds since id last seen him jowls fighting the confines of his shirt collar his complexion was unhealthily florid three cigars stuck out of his breast pocket what a coincidence he said giving me a soft hand i was just about to call you really what about lets talk in the office he closed the door and scurried behind his desk howve you been son just fine dad good good he took a cigar out of his pocket and made masturbatory motions up and down the cellophane wrapper im not going to beat around the bush alex you know thats not my way always come right out and say whats on your mind is my philosophy let people know where you stand please do yes hmm ill come out and say it he leaned forward either about to retch or preparing to impart some grave confidence ive weve received a complaint about your professional conduct he sat back pleasurably expectant a boy waiting for a firecracker to explode will towle his eyebrows shot skyward there were no fireworks up there so they came back down again you know call it a good guess yes well youre correct hes up in arms about some hypnotizing youve done or some such nonsense hes full of shit henry his fingers fumbled with the cellophane i wondered how long it had been since hed done surgery i understand your point however will towle is an important man not to be taken lightly hes demanding an investigation some kind of witch hunt youre not making this any easier young man im not beholden to towle or anyone else im retired henry or have you forgotten that check the last time i received my salary thats not the point the point is henry if towle has a gripe against me let him bring it up before the state board im prepared to swap accusations i guarantee it will be an educational experience for all concerned he smiled unctuously i like you alex im telling you this to warn you warn me of what will towles family has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to this hospital they may very well have paid for the chair youre sitting on i stood up thanks for the warning his little eyes hardened the cigar snapped between his fingers showering the desk with shreds of tobacco he looked down at his lost pacifier and for a moment i thought hed break into tears hed be great fun on the analysts couch youre not as independent as you think you are theres the matter of your staff privileges are you telling me that because will towle complained about me im in danger of losing my right to practice here im saying dont make waves call will make amends hes not a bad fellow in fact the two of you should have a lot in common hes an expert in behavioral pediatrics i know henry ive heard his tune and we dont play in the same band remember this alex the status of psychologists on the medical staff has always been tenuous an old speech came to mind something about the importance of the human factor and how it interfaced with modern medicine i considered throwing it back in his face then i looked at his face and decided nothing could help it is that it he had nothing to say his type seldom does when the conversation gets beyond platitudes entendres or threats good day doctor delaware he said i left quietly closing the door behind me i was down in the lobby which had cleared of patients and was now filled with a group of visitors from some ladies volunteer group the ladies had old money and good breeding written all over their handsome faces sorority girls grown up they listened raptly as an administration lackey gave them a prefabricated spiel about how the hospital was in the forefront of medical and humanitarian progress for children nodding their heads trying not to show their anxiety the lackey prattled on about children being the resources of the future all that came to my mind was young bones ground up as grist for someones mill i turned and walked back to the elevator the third floor of the hospital housed the bulk of the administrative offices which were shaped in an inverted t paneled in dark wood and carpeted in something the color and consistency of moss the medical staff office was situated at the bottom of the stem of the t in a glass walled suite with a view of the hollywood hills the elegant blonde behind the desk was someone i hadnt counted upon seeing but i straightened my tie and went in she looked up contemplated not recognizing me then thought better of it and gave me a regal smile she extended her hand with the imperious manner of someone whod been at the same job long enough to harbor illusions of irreplaceability good morning alex her nails were long and thickly coated with mother of pearl polish as if shed plundered the depths of the ocean for the sake of vanity i took the hand and handled it with the care it cried out for cora how nice to see you again its been a long time yes it has are you returning to us id heard you resigned no im not and yes i did enjoying your freedom she favored me with another smile her hair looked blonder coarser her figure fuller but still first rate packed into a chartreuse knit that would have intimidated someone of less heroic proportions i am and you doing the same old thing she sighed and doing it well im sure for a moment i thought the flattery was a mistake her face hardened and grew a few new wrinkles we know i went on who really keeps things together around here oh go on she flexed her hand like an abalone tipped fan it sure aint the doctors i resisted calling her of buddy aint that the truth amazing what twenty years of education wont give you in the way of common sense im just a wage slave but i know which end is up im sure you could never be anyones slave cora well i dont know lashes as thick and dark as raven feathers lowered conquettishly she was in her early forties and under the merciless fluorescent lighting of the office every year showed but she was well put together with good features one of those women who retain the form of youth but not the texture once centuries ago shed seemed girlish hearty and athletic as wed thrashed around the floor of the medical records office it had been a one shot deal followed by mutual boycott now she was flirting her memory cleansed by the passage of time have they been treating you okay i asked as well as can be expected you know how doctors are i grinned im a fixture she said if they ever move the office theyll pick me up with the furniture i looked up and down her body i dont think anyone could mistake you for furniture she laughed nervously and touched her hair selfconsciously thanks self scrutiny became too unsettling and she put me in the spotlight what brings you down here tying up loose ends a few unfinished charts paperwork ive been careless about answering my mail i thought i received a notice about overdue staff dues i dont remember sending you one but it could have been one of the other girls i was out for a month had surgery im sorry to hear that cora is everything all right female troubles she smiled they say im fine her expression said that she thought they were abject liars im glad we locked gazes for just a moment she looked twenty innocent and hopeful she turned her back to me as if wanting to preserve that image in my mind let me check your file she got up and slid open the drawer of a black lacquered file cabinet and came up with a blue folder no she said youre all paid up youll be getting a notice for next year in a couple of months thanks dont mention it she returned the folder how about a cup of coffee i asked casually she looked at me then at her watch im not due for a break until ten but what the hell live it up huh right let me go to the little girls room and freshen up she fluffed her hair picked up her purse and left the office to go into the lavatory across the hall when i saw the door shut after her i walked to the file cabinet the drawer shed opened was labeled staff a g two drawers down i found what i wanted into the old briefcase it went i was waiting by the door when she came out flushed pink and pretty and smelling of patchouli i extended my arm and she took it over hospital coffee i listened to her talk about her divorce a seven year old wound that wouldnt heal the teenage daughter who was driving her crazy by doing exactly what shed done as an adolescent car troubles the insensitivity of her superiors the unfairness of life it was bizarre getting to know for the first time a woman whose body id entered in the scrambled word game of contemporary mating rituals there was greater intimacy in her tales of woe than there had been in the opening of her thighs we parted friends come by again alex i will i walked to the parking lot marveling at the ease with which i was able to slip on the cloak of duplicity id always flattered myself with a self assessment of integrity but in the last three days id grown proficient at sneak thievery concealment of the truth bald faced lying and emotional whoring it must be the company id been keeping i drove to a cozy italian place in west hollywood the restaurant had just opened and i was alone in my rear corner booth i ordered veal in wine sauce a side order of linguini with oil and garlic and a coors a shuffling waiter brought the beer while i waited for the food i opened the briefcase and examined my plunder towles medical staff file was over forty pages long most of it consisted of xeroxes of his diplomas certificates and awards his curriculum vitae was twenty pages of puffery markedly devoid of scholarly publications hed co authored one brief report while an intern and nothing since and filled with television and radio interviews speeches to lay groups volunteer service to la casa and similar organizations yet he was a full clinical professor at the medical school so much for academic rigor the waiter brought a salad and a basket of rolls i picked up my napkin with one hand started to return the file to the briefcase with the other when something on the front page of the resume caught my eye under college or university attended hed listed jedson college bellevue washington i got home called the la times and asked for ned biondi at the metro desk biondi was a senior writer for the paper a short nervous character right out of the front page id treated his teenager daughter for anorexia nervosa several years back biondi hadnt been able to come up with the money for treatment on a journalists salary compounded with a penchant for playing the wrong horse at santa anita but the girl had been in trouble and id let it go it had taken him a year and a half to clear his debt his daughter had gotten straightened out after months of my chipping away at layers of self hatred that were surprisingly ossified in someone seventeen years old i remembered her clearly a tall dark youngster who wore jogging shorts and t shirts that accentuated the skeletal condition of her body a girl ashen faced and spindly legged who alternated between deep dark spells of brooding silence and flights of hyperactivity during which she was ready to enter every category of olympic competition on three hundred calories a day id gotten her admitted to western pediatric where shed stayed for three weeks that followed by months of psychotherapy had finally gotten through to her and allowed her to deal with the mother who was too beautiful the brother who was too athletic and the father who was too witty biondi ned this is alex delaware it took a second for my name minus title to register doctor how are you im fine hows anne marie very well shes finishing up her second year at wheaton in boston shes got as and a few bs but the bs didnt panic her shes still too rough on herself but she seems to be adjusting well to the peaks and troughs of life as you called them her weight is stable at a hundred and two excellent give my regards when you speak to her i certainly will its nice of you to call well actually theres more to this than professional followup oh a foxy edge the conditioned vigilance of one who pried open locked boxes for a living came into his voice i need a favor name it im flying up north to seattle tonight i need to get into some transcripts at a small college near there jedson hey thats not what i expected i thought you wanted a blurb about a book in the sunday edition or something this sounds serious it is jedson i know it anne marie was going to apply there we figured a small place would be less pressure for her but it was fifty percent more expensive than wheaton reed and oberlin and theyre no giveaways themselves what do you want with their transcripts i cant say doctor he laughed pardon the expression but youre prick teasing im a professional snoop dangle something weird in front of me i get a hard on what makes you think anythings weird doctors running around trying to get into files is weird usually its the shrinks who get broken into if my memory serves me correctly i cant go into it now ned im good with a secret doc no not yet trust me you did before below the belt doc i know and i wouldnt gut punch you if it wasnt important i need your help i may be onto something maybe not if i am youll be the first to hear about it something big i thought about it for a moment could be okay he sighed what do you want me to do im giving your name as a reference if anyone calls you back up my story whats the story he listened it seems harmless enough of course he added cheerfully if you get found out ill probably be out of a job ill be careful yeah what the hell im getting ready for the gold watch anyway there was a pause as if he were fantasizing life after retirement apparently he didnt like what he saw because when he came back on the line there was verve in his voice and he offered a reporters priapic lament im gonna go nuts wondering about this you sure you dont want to give me a hint about what youre up to i cant ned okay okay go spin your yarn and keep me in mind if you knit a sweater i will thanks oh hell dont thank me i still feel crummy about taking all that time to pay you i look at my baby now and i see a pink checked smiling young lady a beauty shes still a little too thin for my taste but shes not a walking corpse like before shes normal at least as far as i can tell she can smile now i owe you doctor stay well ned you too i hung up biondis words of gratitude made me entertain a moments doubt about my own retirement then i thought of bloody bodies and doubt got up and took a seat in the rear of the hearse it took several false starts and stops to reach the right person at jedson college public relations ms dopplemeier ms dopplemeier this is alex delaware im a writer with the los angeles times what can i do for you mr delaware im doing a feature on the small colleges of the west concentrating on institutions that are not well known but academically excellent nonetheless claremont occidental reed etcetera wed like to include jedson in the piece oh really she sounded surprised as if it was the first time anyone had labeled jedson academically excellent that would be very nice mr delaware id be happy to talk to you right now and answer any questions you might have that wasnt exactly what i had in mind im aiming for a more personal approach my editor is less interested in statistics than in color the tenor of the story is that small colleges offer a degree of personal contact and intimacy that is missing from the larger universities how true im actually visiting the campuses chatting with staff and students its an impression piece i understand exactly what you mean you want to come across with a voice thats human exactly thats a marvelous way of putting it i did two years at a trade paper in new jersey before coming to jedson within the soul of every flack there lurks a journalistic homunculus chafing to be released to proclaim scoop to the ears of the world ah a kindred soul well ive left it but i do think of going back from time to time its not way to get rich but it does keep me hopping ms dopplemeier margaret margaret im planning to fly up tonight and wondered if i might come by tomorrow and pay you a visit let me check i heard paper rustling how about at eleven fine is there anything youd like me to do by way of preparation one thing were looking at is what happens to graduates of small colleges id be interested in hearing about some of your notable alumni doctors lawyers that sort of thing i havent had a chance to thoroughly acquaint myself with the alumni roster ive only been here for a few months but ill ask around and find out who can help you id appreciate that where can i reach you if i need to ill be in transit most of the time you can leave any message with my colleague at the times edward biondi i gave her neds number very good its all set for tomorrow at eleven the college is in bellevue just outside of seattle do you know where that is on the east shore of lake washington years back id been a guest lecturer at the university of washington and had visited my hosts home in bellevue i remembered it as an upper middle class bedroom community of aggressively contemporary homes straight edge lawns and low rise shopping centers occupied by gourmet shops antique galleries and high priced haberdasheries thats correct if youre coming from downtown take to which turns into the evergreen point floating bridge drive all the way across the bridge to the east shore turn south at fairweather and continue along the coastline jedson is on meydenbauer bay right next to the yacht club im on the first floor of crespi hall will you be staying for lunch i cant say for sure it depends upon how my time is running and what i find ill have something prepared for you just in case thats very kind of you margaret anything for a fellow journalist alex my next call was to robin it took her nine rings to answer hi she was out of breath i had the big saw going didnt hear you whats up im going out of town for a couple of days tahiti without me nothing quite so romantic seattle oh detective work call it biographical research i told her about towles having attended jedson youre really going after this guy hes going after me when i was at wp this morning henry bork grabbed me in the hall trundled me off to his office and delivered a not so subtle version of the old arm twist seems towles been questioning my ethics in public he keeps cropping up like toadstools after a flood he and kruger share an alma mater and it makes me want to know more about the ivy covered halls of jedson let me come up with you no its going to be all business ill take you on a real vacation after this is all over the thought of you going up there all alone depresses me its dreary this time of year ill be fine you just take care of yourself and get some work done ill call you when i get settled youre sure you dont want me to come along you know i love your company but therell be no time for sightseeing youd be miserable all right she said reluctantly ill miss you ill miss you too i love you take care the same goes for you love you sweetie bye bye bye i took a pm flight out of lax and landed at sea tac airport at i picked up a rented nova at a hertz desk it was no seville but it did have an em radio that someone had left on a classical station a bach organ fugue in a minor key unraveled out of the dash speaker and i didnt cut it off the music matched my mood i confirmed my reservation at the westin drove away from the airport connected to the interstate highway and headed north toward downtown seattle the sky was as cold and hard as a handgun minutes after i hit the blacktop the gun proved to be loaded it fired a blast of thunder and the water started coming down soon it was one of those angry northwest torrents that transforms a highway into miles of drive thru car wash welcome to the pacific northwest i said out loud pine spruce and fir grew in opaque stands on both sides of the road starlit billboards advertised rustic motels and diners offering loggers breakfasts except for semis groaning under loads of timber i was the roads sole traveler i thought to myself how nice it would be to be heading for a mountain cabin robin at my side with a trunk load of fishing gear and provisions i felt a sudden pang of loneliness and longed for human contact i reached downtown shortly after midnight the westin rose like a giant steel and glass test tube amid the darkened laboratory of the city my seventh floor room was decent with a view of puget sound and the harbor to the west lake washington and the islands to the east i kicked off my shoes and stretched out on the bed tired but too jumpy for sleep i caught the sign off edition of the news on a local station the anchor man was wooden jawed and shifty eyed and reported the days events impersonally he lent identical emphasis to an account of mass murder in ohio and the hockey scores i cut him off in mid sentence turned off the lights stripped down in darkness and stared at the harbor lights until i fell asleep a thousand yards of rain forest shielded the jedson campus from the coastal road the forest yielded to twin stone columns engraved with roman numerals that marked the origin of a cobbled drive running through the center of the college the drive terminated in a circular turn around punctuated by a pockmarked sundial under a towering pine at fist glance jedson resembled one of those small colleges back east that specialize in looking like dwarf harvards the buildings were fashioned of weathered brick and embellished with stone and marble cornices slate and copper roofing designed in an era when labor was cheap and intricate moldings expansive arches gargoyles and goddesses the order of the day even the ivy looked authentic tumbling from slate peaks sucking the brick trimmed topiary fashion to bypass recessed leaded windows the campus was small perhaps half a square mile and filled with tree shaded knolls imposing stands of oak pine willow elm and paper birch and clearings inlaid with marble and bordered by stone benches and bronze monuments all very traditional until you looked to the west and saw manicured lawns dipping down to the dock and the private harbor beyond the slips were occupied by streamlined teak decked cruisers fifty foot craft and larger topped with sonar and radar screens and clutches of antennae clearly twentieth century obviously west coast the rain had lifted and a triangle of light peeked out from under the charcoal folds of the sky a few knots out of the harbor an armada of sailboats sliced through water that looked like tin foil the boats were rehearsing some type of ceremony for they each rounded the same buoy marker and unfurled outrageously colored spinnakers oranges purples scar lets and greens like the tail feathers of a covey of tropical birds there was a lucite encased map on a stand and i consulted it to locate crespi hall the students passing by seemed a quiet lot for the most part they were apple cheeked and flaxen haired their eye color traversing the spectrum from light blue to dark blue their hairstyles were expensively executed but seemed to date from the eisenhower age trousers were cuffed pennies shined prettily from the tops of loafers and there were enough alligators on shirts to choke the everglades a eugenicist would have been proud to observe the straight backs robust physiques and stiff lipped self assurance of those to the manor born i felt as if id died and gone to aryan heaven crespi was a three story rhomboid fronted by ionic columns of varicose veined white marble the public relations office was hidden behind a mahogany door labeled in gold stencil when i opened it the door creaked margaret dopplemeier was one of those tall rawboned women predestined for spinsterhood shed tried to couch an ungainly body in a tentlike suit of brown tweed but the angles and corners showed through she had a big jawed face uncompromising lips and reddish brown hair cut in an incongruously girlish bob her office was hardly larger than the interior of my car public relations was obviously not a prime concern for the elders of jedson and she had to squeeze between the edge of her desk and the wall to get up to greet me it was a maneuver that would have looked clumsy performed by pavlova and margaret dopplemeier turned it into a lurching stumble i felt sorry for her but made sure not to show it she was in her midthirties and by that age women like her have learned to cherish self reliance its as good a way as any of coping with solitude hello you must be alex i am pleased to meet you margaret her hand was thick hard and chafed from too much wringing or too much washing i couldnt be sure please sit down i took a slat backed chair and sat in it uncomfortably coffee please with cream there was a table with a hot plate in back of her desk she poured coffee into a mug and gave it to me have you decided about lunch the prospect of looking across the table at her for an extra hour didnt thrill me it wasnt her plainness nor her stern face she looked ready to tell me her life story and i was in no mood to fill my head with extraneous material i declined how about a snack then she brought forth a tray of cheese and crackers looking uncomfortable in the role of hostess i wondered why shed gravitated toward pr library science would have seemed more fitting then the thought occurred to me that public relations at jedson was probably akin to library work a desk job involving lots of clipping and mailing and very little face to face contact thank you i was hungry and the cheese was good well she looked around her desk found a pair of eyeglasses and put them on behind the glass her eyes grew larger and somehow softer you want to get a feel for jedson thats right the flavor of the place its quite a unique place im from wisconsin myself went to school at madison with forty thousand students there are only two thousand here everyone knows everyone else kind of like one big family i took out a pen and notepad yes at the word family her mouth pursed you might say that she shuffled some papers and began reciting jedson college was founded by josiah t jedson a scottish immigrant who made his fortune in mining and railroads in thats three years before the university of washington was founded so were really the old school in town jedsons intention was to endow an institution of higher learning where traditional values coexisted side by side with education in the basic arts and sciences to this day primary funding for the college comes from an annuity from the jedson foundation although other sources of income are existent ive heard tuition is rather high tuition she frowned is twelve thousand dollars a year plus housing registration and miscellaneous fees i whistled do you give scholarships a small number of scholarships for deserving students are given each year but there is no extensive program of financial aid then theres no interest in attracting students from a wide socio economic range not particularly no she took off her glasses put her prepared material aside and stared at me myopically i would hope we dont get into that particular line of questioning why is that margaret she moved her lips trying on several unspoken words for size rejecting them all finally she said i thought this was going to be an impression piece something positive it will be i was simply curious i had touched a nerve not that it did me any good for upsetting my source of information was the last thing i needed but something about the upper class smugness of the place was irritating me and bringing out the bad boy i see she put her glasses back on and picked up her papers scanned them and pursed her lips alex she said can i speak to you off the record one writer to another sure i closed the notepad and put the pen in my jacket pocket i dont know how to put this she played with one tweed lapel twisting the coarse cloth then smoothing it this story your visit neither are particularly welcomed by the administration as you may be able to tell from the grandeur of our surroundings public relations is not avidly sought by jedson college after i spoke to you yesterday i told my superiors about your coming thinking theyd be more than pleased in fact just the opposite was true i wasnt exactly given a pat on the back she pouted as if recalling a particularly painful spanking i didnt intend to get you in trouble margaret there was no way to know as i told you im new here they do things differently its another way of life quiet conservative theres a timeless quality to the place how i asked does a college attract enrollment without attracting attention she chewed her lip i really dont want to get into it margaret its off the record dont stonewall me its not important she insisted but her bosom heaved and conflict showed in the flat magnified eyes i played on that conflict then whats the fuss we writers need to be open with one another there are enough censors out there she thought about that for a long time the tug of war was evident on her face and i couldnt help but feel rotten i dont want to leave here she finally said i have a nice apartment with a view of the lake my cats and my books i dont want to lose everything i dont want to have to pack up and move back to the midwest to miles of flatland with no mountains no way of establishing ones perspective do you understand her manner and tone were brittle i knew that manner for id seen it in countless therapy patients just before the defenses came tumbling down she wanted to let go and i was going to help her manipulative bastard that i was do you understand what im saying she was asking and i heard myself answer so smooth so sweet of course i do anything i tell you has to be confidential not for print i promise im a feature writer i have no aspirations of becoming woodward or bernstein a faint smile appeared on the large bland features you dont i did once upon a time after four years on the madison student paper i thought i was going to turn journalism on its ear i went for one solid year with no writing job i did waitressing i hated it then i worked for a dog magazine writing cutesypoo press releases on poodles and schnauzers they brought the little beasts into the office for photographs and they fouled the carpet it stunk when that folded i spent two years covering union meetings and polka parties in new jersey and that finally squeezed all the illusion out of me now all i want is peace again the glasses came off she closed her eyes and massaged her temples when you get down to it thats what all of us want i said she opened her eyes and squinted in my direction from the way she strained i must have been a blur i tried to look like a trustworthy blur she popped two pieces of cheese into her mouth and ground them to dust with lantern jaws i dont know that any of it is relevant to your story she said especially if its a puff piece youre after i forced a laugh now that youve got me interested dont leave me dangling she smiled one writer to another one writer to another oh she sighed i suppose its no biggie in the first place she told me between mouthfuls of cheese no jedson college is not interested in attracting outsiders period its a college but in name and formal status only what jedson college really is functionally is a holding pen a place for the privileged class to stash their children for four years before the boys enter daddys business and the girls marry the boys and turn into suzy homemaker and join the junior league the boys major in business or economics the girls in art history and home economics the gentlemans c is the common goal being too smart is frowned upon some of the brighter ones do go on to law school or medical school but when they finish their training they return to the fold she sounded bitter a wallflower describing last years prom the average household income of the families that send their kids here is over a hundred thousand dollars a year think of that alex everyone is rich did you see the harbor i nodded those floating toys belong to students she paused as if she still couldnt believe it the parking lot looks like the monte carlo grand prix these kids wear cashmere and suede for horsing around one of her raw coarse hands found the other and caressed it she looked from wall to wall of the tiny room as if searching for hidden listening devices i wondered what she was so nervous about so jedson was a school for rich kids stanford had started out that way too and might have ended up similarly stagnant if someone hadnt figured out that not letting in smart jews and asians and other people with funny names and high iqs would lead to eventual academic entropy theres no crime in being rich i said its not just that its the utter mindlessness that goes along with it i was at madison during the sixties there was a sense of social awareness activism we were working to end the war now its the anti nukes movement the university can be a greenhouse for the conscience here nothing grows i envisioned her fifteen years back dressed in khakis and sweatshirt marching and mouthing slogans radicalism had fought a losing battle with survival eroded by too much of nothing but she could still take an occasional hit of nostalgia its especially hard on the faculty she was saying not the old guard the young turks they actually call themselves that they come here because of the job crunch with their typical academic idealism and liberal views and last two maybe three years its intellectually stultifying not to mention the frustration of earning fifteen thousand dollars a year when the students wardrobes cost more than that you sound as if you have firsthand knowledge i do there was a man a good friend of mine he came here to teach philosophy he was brilliant a princeton graduate a genuine scholar it ate him up he talked to me about it told me what it was like to stand up in front of a class and lecture on kierkegaard and sartre and see thirty pairs of vacant blue eyes staring back ubermensch v he called it he left last year she looked pained i changed the subject you mentioned the old guard who are they jedson graduates who actually develop an interest in something other than making money they go on to earn advanced degrees in humanities something totally useless like history or sociology or literature and then come crawling back here to teach jedson takes care of its own id imagine they find it easier to relate to the students coming from the same background they must they stay on most of them are older there havent been too many returning scholars lately the old guard may be shrinking some are quite decent really i get the feeling they were always outcasts the misfits even the privileged castes have those i suppose the look on her face bespoke firsthand experience with the pain of social rejection she may have sensed she was in danger of crossing the boundary from social commentary to psychological striptease for she drew back put on her glasses and smiled sourly hows that for public relations for someone new youre certainly got a handle on the place some of it ive seen for myself some i learned from your friend the scholar yes she stopped and picked up an oversized imitation leather handbag it didnt take her long to find what she was looking for this is lee she said and handed me a snapshot of herself and a man several inches shorter than she the man was balding with tufts of thick dark curling hair over each ear a bushy dark mustache and rimless round spectacles he wore a faded blue work shirt and jeans and high laced hiking boots margaret dopplemeier was dressed in a scrape that accentuated her size baggy cords and flat sandals she had her arm around him and looked maternal and childishly dependent at the same time hes in new mexico now working on his book in solitude he says i gave her back the photo writers often need that yes weve gone round and round about that she put her keepsake back made a move toward the cheese and then retracted her hand as if shed suddenly lost her appetite i let a silent moment pass then performed a lateral arabesque away from her personal life what youre saying is fascinating margaret jedson is set up with all the enrollment it needs its a self perpetuating system the word system can be a psychological catalyst for anyone whos flirted with the left it got her going again absolutely the percentage of students whose parents are also jedson graduates is unbelievably high ill bet that the two thousand students come from no more than five to seven hundred families the same surnames keep cropping up when i compile lists thats why when you called it a family before i was taken aback i wondered how much you knew nothing until i came here yes ive said too much havent i in a closed system i persisted publicity is the last thing the establishment wants of course jedson is an anachronism it survives the twentieth century by staying small and keeping out of the headlines my instructions were to wine you dine you see that you took a nice little stroll around the campus then escort you off the grounds with little or nothing to write about the trustees of jedson dont want exposure in the los angeles times they dont want issues like affirmative action or equal opportunity enrollment to rear their ugly heads i appreciate your honesty margaret for a moment i thought she was going to cry dont make it sound as if im some kind of saint im not and i know it my talking to you was spineless deceitful the people here arent evil i have no right to expose them theyve been good to me but i get so weary of putting up a front of attending quaint little teas with women who can talk all day about china patterns and place settings they give a class here in place settings do you believe that she looked at her hands as if unable to envision them holding anything as delicate as china my job is pretense alex im a glorified mailing service but ill not leave she insisted debating an unseen adversary not yet not at this point in my life i wake up and see the lake i have my books and a good stereo i can pick fresh blackberries not far from ere i eat them in the morning with cream i said nothing will you betray me she asked of course not margaret then go forget about including jedson in your story theres nothing here for an outsider i cant she sat straight in her chair why not there was terror and anger in her voice something decidedly menacing in her eyes i could understand her lovers flight to solitude i was certain the mental deadness of jedsons student body wasnt the only thing hed been escaping i had nothing to offer her that would keep our lines of communication open other than the truth and the chance to be a coconspirator i took a deep breath and told her the real reason for my visit when i was through she wore the same possessive dependent look id seen in her photograph i wanted to back away but my chair was inches from the door its funny she said i should feel exploited used but i dont you have an honest face even your lies sound righteous im no more righteous than you are i simply want to get some facts help me i was a member of sds you know the police were pigs to me in those days these arent those days im not a policeman and were not talking about abstract theory and the polemics of revolution this is triple murder margaret child abuse maybe more not political assassinations innocent people hacked into bloody gobbets mashed into human garbage children run down on lonely canyon roads she shuddered turned away ran an unpolished fingernail along the top of a tooth then faced me again and you think one of them a jedsonite was responsible for all of that the very idea was delicious to her i think two of them had some involvement in it why are you doing this you say youre a psychiatrist psychologist whatever whats in it for you nothing nothing youd believe try me i want to see justice done its been eating at me i believe you she said softly she was gone for twenty minutes and when she returned it was with an armful of oversized volumes bound in dark blue morocco leather these are the yearbooks if your estimates of their ages are correct im going to leave you with them and search for the alumni files lock yourself in when im gone and dont answer the door ill knock three times then twice that will be our signal roger ha she laughed and for the first time looked almost attractive timothy kruger had lied about being a poor boy at jedson his family had donated a couple of buildings and even a casual reading of the book made it obvious the krugers were very important the part about his athletic prowess though was true hed lettered in track baseball and greco roman wrestling in his yearbook pictures he resembled the man id spoken to days before there were shots of him jumping hurdles throwing the javelin and later on in asection on drama in the roles of hamlet and petruchio the impression i got was that of a big man on campus i wondered how hed ended up at la casa de los ninos operating under a phony credential l willard towles photo showed him to have been a tab hunter type blond in his youth notations under his name mentioned presidency of the premed club and the biology honor society as well as captain of the crew team there was also an asterisk that led to a footnote advising the reader to turn to the last page of the book i obeyed the instructions and came to a black bordered photograph the same picture id seen in towles office of his wife and son against a backdrop of lake and mountains there was an inscription beneath the photo in memoriam lilah hutchison towle lionel willard towle jr under the inscription were four lines of verse how swiftly doth the night move to dash our hopes and dim our dreams but even in the darkest night the ray of peace yet beams it was signed s i was rereading the poem when margaret dopplemeiers coded knock sounded on the door i slid open the latch and she came in holding a manila envelope she locked the door went behind her desk opened the packet and shook out two three by five index cards these are straight out of the sacred alumni file she glanced at one and handed it to me heres your doctor towles name was at the top written out in elegant script there were several entries under it in different hands and different colors of ink most of them took the form of abbreviations and numeric codes can you explain it to me she came around and sat down next to me took the card and studied it theres nothing mysterious about any of it the abbreviations are meant to save space the five digits after the name are the alumnus code for mailing filing that kind of thing after that youve got the number which means hes the third member of his family to attend jedson the med is self explanatory its an occupation code and the fmed means medicine is also the familys primary business if it were shipping it would say slip banking bnk and so on b is the year he received his bachelors degree m indicates that he married another jedson student and her alumnus code is cross referenced heres something interesting theres a small d in parentheses after the wifes code which means shes deceased and the date of death is she died when he was still a student here did you know that i did would there be any way of finding out more about that she thought for a mgment we could check the local papers for that week for an obituary or funeral notice what about the student paper the spartan is a rag she said scornfully but i suppose it would cover something like that back issues are stored in the library on the other side of campus we can go there later do you think its relevant she was flushed girlish given over totally to our little intrigue it just could be margaret i want to know everything i can about these people van der graaf she said whats that professor van der graaf from the history department hes the oldest of the old guard been around jedson longer than anyone i know of on top of that hes a great gossip i sat next to him at a garden party and the sweet old thing told me all sorts of tidbits who was sleeping with whom faculty dirt and the like they let him get away with it hes close to ninety rolling in family money un married with no heirs theyre just waiting for him to croak and leave it all to their college hes been emeritus from way back keeps an office on campus sequesters himself there pretending to write books i wouldnt be surprised if he sleeps there he knows more about jedson than anybody do you think hed talk to me if he was in the right mood in fact i thought of him when you told me over the phone that you wanted to find out about illustrious alumni but i figured it was too risky leaving him alone with a reporter you never know what hes going to do or say she giggled enjoying the old mans ability to rebel from a position of power of course now that i know what you want she continued hed be perfect youd need some kind of story about why you wanted to talk about towle but i dont imagine that would be very difficult for someone as artful as you how about this im a reporter for medical world news call me bill roberts dr towles been elected president of the academy of pediatrics and im doing a background story on him sounds good ill call him now she reached for the phone and i took another look at towles alumnus card the only information she hadnt covered was a column of dated entries under the heading donations to jedson i assumed they averaged ten thousand dollars a year towle was a faithful son professor van der graaf she was saying this is margaret dopplemeier from public relations ive been fine thank you and yourself very good oh im sure we can work that out professor she covered the receiver with her hand and winked at me mouthing the words good mood i didnt know you liked pizza professor no no i dont like anchovies either yes i do like duesenbergs i know you do yes i know the rain was coming down in sheets professor yes i would yes when the weather clears up with the top down ill bring the pizza she flirted with van der graaf for five more minutes and finally broached the subject of my visit she listened gave me the okay sign with thumb and forefinger and went back to flirting i picked up krugers card he was the fifth member of his family to attend jedson and his degree was listed as having been granted five years previously there was no mention of current position the family was recorded as being active in stl slip and rl est no mention of matrimony was present nor had he donated money to the school there was however an interesting cross reference under rel f it said towle finally the three letters dlt were written in large block characters at the bottom of the card margaret got off the phone hell see you as long as i come along and quote give me a brisk massage young lady youll be prolonging the years of a living fossil unquote the old lecher she added affectionately i asked her about towles name on krugers card rel f related family apparently your two subjects are cousins of some sort why isnt that listed on towles card as well the heading was probably added after he graduated rather than go back and mark each card they simply used it on the new ones dlt though is more interesting hes been deleted from the file whys that i dont know it doesnt say it never would some transgression with his family background it had to be something big something that made the school want to wash its hands of him she looked up at me this is getting interesting isnt it very she put the cards back in the envelope and locked it in her desk ill take you to van der graaf now a gilded cage of an elevator took us to the fifth floor of a domed building on the west side of the campus it relaxed its jaws and let us out into a silent rotunda wainscoted in marble and veneered with dust the ceiling was concave plaster upon which a now faded mural of cherubs blowing bugles had been painted we were inside the shell of the dome the walls were stone and gave off an odor of rotting paper a stationary diamond paned window separated two oak doors one was labeled map room and looked as if it hadnt been opened in generations the other was blank margaret knocked on the unadorned door and when no answer was forthcoming pushed it open the room it revealed was highceilinged and spacious with cathedral windows that afforded a view of the harbor every free inch of wall space was taken up by bookshelves crammed haphazardly with ragged volumes those books that hadnt found a resting place in the shelves sat in precariously balanced stacks on the floor in the center of the room was a trestle table piled high with manuscripts and still more books a globe on a wheeled stand and an ancient claw footed desk were pushed in a corner a mcdonalds take out box and a couple of crumpled greasy napkins sat atop the desk professor said margaret to me i wonder where hes gone peek a boo the sound came from somewhere behind the trestle table margaret jumped and her purse flew out of her hands the contents spilled on the floor a gnarled head peeked around the curled edges of a pile of yellowed paper sorry to startle you dear the head came into view thrown back in silent laughter professor said margaret shame on you she bent to retrieve the scattered debris he came out from behind the table looking sheepish until that point id thought he was sitting but when the head didnt rise in my sight i realized hed been standing all along he was four feet and a few inches tall his body was of conventional size but it was bent at the waist the spine twisted in an s the deformed back burdened with a hump the size of a tightly packed knapsack his head seemed too large for his frame a wrinkled egg topped by a fringe of wispy white hair when he moved he resembled a drowsy scorpion he wore an expression of mock contrition but the twinkle in the rheumy blue eyes said far more than did the downturned lipless mouth can i help you dear his voice was dry and cultured margaret gathered the last personal effects from the floor and put them in her purse no thank you professor ive got it all she caught her breath and tried to look composed will you still come with me on our pizza picnic only if you behave yourself he put his hands together as if in prayer i promise dear he said all right professor this is bill roberts the journalist i spoke to you about bill professor garth van der graaf hello professor he looked up at me from under sleepy lids you dont look like clark kent he said i beg your pardon arent newspaper reporters supposed to look like clark kent i wasnt aware of that specific union regulation i was interviewed by a reporter after the war the big one number two pardon the scatological entendre he wanted to know what place the war would have in history he looked like clark kent he ran one hand over his liver spotted scalp dont you have a pair of glasses or something young man im sorry but my eyes are quite healthy he turned his back to me and walked to one of the bookshelves there was queer reptilian grace to his movements the stunted body seeming to travel sideways while actually moving forward he climbed slowly up a footstool reached up and grabbed a leather bound volume climbed down and returned look he said opening the book which i now saw was a looseleaf binder containing a collection of comic books this is who i mean a shaky finger pointed to a picture of the daily planets star reporter entering a phone booth clark kent thats a reporter im sure mr roberts knows who clark kent is professor then let him come back when he looks more like him and ill talk to him the old man snapped margaret and i exchanged helpless looks she started to say something and van der graaf threw back his head and let out an arid crackle april fool he laughed lustily at his own wit the merriment dissolving into a phlegmy fit of coughing oh professor margaret scolded they went at each other again verbally jousting i began to suspect that their relationship was well established i stood on the sidelines feeling like an unwilling spectator at a freak show admit it dear he was saying i had you fooled he stamped his foot with glee you thought id gone totally senile youre no more senile than i she replied youre simply a naughty boy my hopes of getting reliable information from the shrunken hunchback were diminishing by the moment i cleared my throat they stopped and stared at me a bubble of saliva had collected in the corner of van der graafs puckered mouth his hands vibrated with a faint palsy margaret towered over him legs akimbo now i want you to cooperate with mr roberts she said sternly van der graaf gave me a dirty look oh all right he whined but only if you drive me around the lake in my doosie i said i would i have a thirty seven duesenberg he explained to me magnificent chariot four hundred snorting stallions under a gleaming ruby bonnet chromium pipes consumes petroleum with ravenous abandon i can no longer drive it maggie here is a large wench under my tutelage she could handle it but she refuses professor van der graaf there was a good reason why i turned you down it was raining and i didnt want to get behind the wheel of a car worth two hundred thousand dollars in hazardous weather pshaw i took that baby from here to sonoma in forty four it thrives on meteorological adversity all right ill drive you tomorrow if i get a good report on your behavior from mr roberts im the professor i do the grading she ignored him i have to go to the library mr roberts can you find your way back to my office certainly ill see you when youre through then goodbye professor tomorrow at one rain or shine he called after her when the door had closed he invited me to sit ill stand myself cant find a chair that fits me when i was a boy father called in carpenters and woodcarvers trying to come up with some way to seat me comfortably to no avail they did produce some fascinating abstract sculpture however he laughed and held on to the trestle table for support ive stood most of my life in the end it probably was beneficial ive got legs like pig iron my circulations as good as that of a man half my age i sat in a leather armchair we were at eye level that maggie he said such a sad girl i flirt with her try to cheer her up she seems so lonely most of the time he rummaged among the papers and pulled out a flask irish whiskey youll find two glasses in the top right drawer of the desk kindly retrieve them and give them to me i found the glasses which looked none too clean van der graaf filled them each with an inch of whiskey without spilling a drop here i watched him sip his drink and followed suit do you think she could be a virgin is such a thing possible in this day and age he approached the question as if it were an epistemological puzzle i really couldnt say professor i only just met her an hour ago i cant conceive of it virginity in a woman her age yet the notion of those milkmaids thighs wrapped around a pair of rutting buttocks is equally preposterous he drank more whiskey contemplated margaret dopplemeiers sex life in silence and stared off into space finally he said youre a patient young man a rare quality i nodded i figure youll come around when youre ready professor yes i do confess to a fair amount of childish behavior its a perquisite of my age and station do you know how long its been since i taught a class or wrote a scholarly paper quite a while i imagine over two decades since then ive been up here engaged in long solitary stretches of allegedly deep thought actually i loaf and yet im an honored professor emeritus dont you think its an absurd system that tolerates such nonsense perhaps theres a feeling that youve earned the right to retirement with honor bah he waved his hand that sounds too much like death retirement with honor and maggots gnawing at ones toes ill confess to you young man that i never earned anything i wrote sixty seven papers in learned journals all but five utter garbage i co edited three books that no one ever read and in general pursued a life of a spoiled wastrel its been wonderful he finished his whiskey and put the glass down on the table with a thump they keep me around here because ive got millions of dollars in a tax free trust fund set up for me by father and they hope ill bequeath it all to them he smiled crookedly i may or may not perhaps i should will it all to some negro organization or something equally outrageous a group fighting for the rights of lesbians perhaps is there such a cabal im sure there must be yes in california no doubt speaking of which you want to know about willie towle from los angeles do you i repeated the story about medical world news all right he sighed if you insist ill try to help you god knows why anyone would be interested in willie towle for a duller boy never set foot on this campus when i found out he became a physician i was amazed i never thought him intellectually capable of anything quite that advanced of course the family is firmly rooted in medicine one of the towles was grants personal surgeon during the civil war theres a morsel for your article and i imagine getting willie admitted to medical school was no particular challenge hes turned out to be quite a successful doctor that doesnt surprise me there are different types of success one requires a combination of personality traits that willie did indeed possess perseverance lack of imagination innate conservatism of course a good straight body and a conventionally attractive face dont hurt either ill wager he hasnt climbed the ranks by virtue of being a profound scientific thinker or innovative researcher his strengths are of a more mundane nature are they not he has a reputation as a fine doctor i insisted his patients have only good things to say about him tells them exactly what they want to hear no doubt willie was always good at that very popular president of this and that he was my student in a course on european civilization and he was a charmer yes professor no professor always there to hold out my chair for me lord how i detested that not to mention the fact that i rarely sat he grimaced at the recollection yes there was a certain banal charm there people like that in their doctors i believe its called bedside manner of course his essay exams were most telling revealing his true substance predictable accurate but not illuminating grammatical without being literate he paused this isnt the kind of information you were expecting is it i smiled not exactly you cant print this can you he seemed disappointed no im afraid the article is meant to be laudatory hale and hearty blah blah stuff in the vernacular bullshit eh how boring doesnt it bore you to have to write such drivel at times it pays the bills yes how arrogant of me not to take that into consideration ive never had to pay bills my bankers do that for me ive always had far more money than i know what to do with it leads one to incredible ignorance its a common fault of the indolent rich were unbelievably ignorant and inbred it brings about psychological as well as physical aberrations he smiled reached around with one arm and tapped his hunch this entire campus is a haven for the offspring of the indolent ignorant inbred rich including your doctor willie towle he descends from one of the most rarefied environments you will ever find did you know that being a doctors son no no he dismissed me as if i were an especially stupid pupil hes one of the two hundred you havent heard of them no go into the bottom drawer of my desk and pull out the old map of seattle i did what i was told the map was folded under several back issues of playboy give it to me he said impatiently he opened it and spread it on the table look here i stood over him his finger pointed to a spot at the north end of the south to a tiny island shaped like a diamond brindamoor island three square miles of innately unappealing terrain upon which are situated two hundred mansions and estates to rival any found in the united states josiah jedson built his first home there a gothic monstrosity it was and others of his ilk mimicked him i have cousins who reside there most of us are related in one way or the other though father built our home on the mainland in win demere its barely noticeable the island was a speck in the pacific and meant to be that way my boy in many of the older maps the island isnt even labeled of course theres no land access the ferry makes one roundtrip from the harbor when the weather and tides permit its not unusual for a week or two to elapse without the trip being completed some of the residents own private airplanes and have landing strips on their properties most are content to remain in splendid isolation and dr towle grew up there he most certainly did i believe the ancestral digs have been sold he was an only son and when he moved to california there seemed no reason to hold on to it most of the homes are far larger than homes have a right to be architectural dinosaurs frightfully expensive to maintain even the two hundred have to budget nowadays not all had ancestors as clever as father he patted his midriff in self congratulation do you feel growing up in that kind of isolation had any effect on dr towle now you sound like a psychologist young man i smiled in answer to your question most certainly the children of the two hundred were an insufferably snobbish lot and to merit that designation at jedson college requires extraordinary chauvinism they were clannish self centered spoiled and not overly bright many had deformed siblings with chronic physical or mental problems my remark about inbreeding was meant in all seriousness and seemed to have been left callous and indifferent by the experience rather than the opposite youre using the past tense dont they exist today there are amazingly few young ones left they get a taste of the outside world and are reluctant to return to brindamoor it really is quite bleak despite the indoor tennis courts and one pathetic excuse for a country club to stay in character i had to defend towle professor i dont know doctor towle well but hes very well spoken of ive met him and he seems to be a forceful man of strong character isnt it possible that growing up in the type of environment you describe brindamoor to be could increase ones individuality the old man looked at me with contempt rubbish i understand you have to pretty up his image but youll get nothing but the truth from me there wasnt an individual in the bunch from brindamoor young man solitude is the nectar of individuality our willie towle had no taste for it why do you say that i cannot recall ever seeing him alone he palled around with two other dullards from the island the three of them pranced around like little dictators the three heads of state they were called behind their backs pretentious puffed up boys willie stu and eddy stu and eddy yes yes thats what i said stuart hickle and edwin hayden at the mention of those names i gave an involuntary start i struggled to neutralize my expression hoping the old man hadnt noticed the reaction happily he appeared oblivious as he lectured in that parched voice and hickle was a sickly pimple faced rotter with a spooky disposition not a word out of him that wasnt censored by the other two hayden was a mean spirited little sneak i caught him cheating on an exam and he attempted to bribe me out of failing him by offering to procure for me an indian prostitute of supposedly exotic talents can you imagine such gall as if i were unable to fend for myself in affairs of lust of course i failed him and wrote a sharp letter to his parents got no reply no doubt they never read it off on some european jaunt do you know what became of him he ended rhetorically no i lied hes now a judge in los angeles in fact i believe all three of them the glorious heads moved to los angeles hickles some kind of chemist wanted to be a doctor just like willie and i believe he actually did begin medical school but he was too stupid to pull through a judge he repeated what does that say about our judicial system the information was pouring in fast and like a pauper suddenly discovering a sizeable inheritance i wasnt sure how to deal with it i wanted to shed my cover and wring every last bit of information out of the old man but there was the case and my promises to margaret to think about im a nasty old bugger am i not crackled van der graaf you seem very perceptive professor oh do i he smiled craftily any other tidbits i can toss your way i know dr towle lost his wife and child several years back what can you tell me about that he stared at me then refilled his glass and sipped all part of your story all part of fleshing out the portrait i said it sounded feeble ah yes fleshing it out of course well it was a tragedy no two ways about it and your doctor was rather young to be dealing with it he was married during his sophomore year to a lovely girl from a good portland family lovely but outside his circle the two hundred tended to marry each other the engagement came as a bit of surprise six months later the girl gave birth to a son and that mystery was cleared up for a while the trio seemed to be breaking up hickle and hayden slinked off by themselves as willie attended to the duties of a married man then the wife and child were killed and the heads were reunited i suppose its natural that a man will seek the comfort of friends in the wake of such a loss how did it happen he peered into his glass and downed the last few drops the girl the mother was taking the child to the hospital hed woken up with the croup or some such ailment the nearest emergency facility was at the childrens orthopedic hospital at the university it was in the early morning hours still dark her car went over the evergreen bridge and plunged into the lake it was daybreak before it was found where was dr towle studying burning the midnight oil of course this caused him to be guilt stricken absolutely wretched no doubt he blamed himself for not having been there and been drowned himself you know the type of self flagellation embraced by the bereaved a tragic affair oh yes she was a lovely girl dr towle keeps her picture in his office a sentimentalist is he i suppose i drank some whiskey after the tragedy he began seeing more of his friends yes though as i hear you use the term i realize something in my concept of friendship there is implied a bond of affection some degree of mutual admiration those three always looked so grim when they were together they didnt seem to enjoy each others company i never knew what the link between them was but it did exist willie went away to medical school and stuart tagged along edwin hayden attended law school at the same university they settled in the same city no doubt youll be contacting the other two in order to obtain laudatory quotes for your article if there is an article i struggled to remain calm what do you mean oh i think you know what i mean my boy im not going to ask you to present identification confirming youre who you say you are it wouldnt prove a thing anyway because you seem like a pleasant intelligent young man and how many visitors to whom i can blab do you think i receive enough said i appreciate that professor and well you should i trust you have your reasons for wanting to ask me about willie undoubtedly theyre boring and ive no wish to know them have i been helpful youve been more than helpful i filled our glasses and we shared another drink no conversation passing between us would you be willing to be a bit more helpful i asked that depends dr towle has a nephew timothy kruger i wonder if theres anything you could tell me about him van der graaf raised his drink to his lips with trembling hands his face clouded kruger he said the name as if it were an epithet yes cousin distant cousin not nephew cousin then kruger an old family prussians every one of them power brokers a powerful family his melliflu ousness was gone and he spat out the words with mechanical intonation prussians he took a few steps the arachnid stagger ceased abruptly and he let his hands drop to his sides this must be a police matter he said why do you say that his face blackened with anger and he raised one fist in the air a prophet of doom dont trifle with me young man if it has something to do with timothy kruger theres little else it could be it is part of a criminal investigation i cant go into details oh cant you ive wagged my tongue at you without demanding to know your true intentions a moment ago i judged them to be boring now ive changed my mind what is it about the kruger name that scares you so much professor evil he said evil frightens me you say your questions are part of a criminal investigation how do i know what side youre on im working with the police but im not a policeman i wont tolerate riddles either be truthful or be gone i considered the choice margaret dopplemeier i said i dont want her to lose her job because of anything i tell you maggie he snorted dont worry about her ive no intention of letting on the fact that she led you to me shes a sad girl needs intrigue to spice up her life ive spoken enough to her to know that she clings longingly to the conspiracy theory of life dangle one before her shell go for it like a trout for a lure kennedy assassinations unidentified flying objects cancer tooth decay all the result of a grand collusion of anonymous demons no doubt you recognized that and exploited it he made it sound machiavellian i didnt dispute it no he said ive no interest in crushing maggie shes been a friend apart from that my loyalties to this institution are far from blind i detest certain aspects of this place my true home if you will such as the krugers such as the environment that allows krugers and their ilk to flourish he tottered the too large head lolling on its misshapen base the choice is yours young man put up or shut up i put up nothing in your story surprises me he said i didnt know of stuart hickles death nor of his sexual proclivities but neither are shocking he was a bad poet dr delaware very bad and nothing is beyond a bad poet i recalled the verse at the bottom of lilah towles yearbook obituary it was clear who s was when you mentioned timothy i became alarmed because i didnt know if you were in the employ of the krugers the badge you showed me is well and fine but such trinkets are easily counterfeited call detective delano hardy at west lost angeles police division hell tell you what side im on i hoped he wouldnt take me up on it who knew how hardy would react he looked at me thoughtfully no that wont be necessary youre a dreadful liar i believe i can intuitively tell when youre telling the truth thank you youre welcome a compliment was intended tell me about timothy kruger i said he stood blinking gnome like a concoction of a hollywood special effects lab the first thing id like to emphasize is that the evil of the krugers has nothing to do with wealth they would be evil paupers i imagine they were at one time if that sounds defensive it is i understand the very wealthy are not evil bolshevist propaganda to the contrary they are a harmless lot overly sheltered reticent destined for extinction he took a step backward as if retreating from his own prediction i waited timothy kruger he finally said is a murderer plain and simple the fact that he was never arrested tried or convicted does nothing to diminish his guilt in my eyes the story goes back seven no eight years there was a student here a farm boy from idaho sharp as a tack built like adonis his name was saxon jeffrey saxon he came here to study the first of his family to finish high school dreaming of becoming a writer he was accepted on an athletic scholarship crew baseball football wrestling and managed to excel in all of those while maintaining an a average he majored in history and i was his faculty advisor though by that time i wasnt teaching any more we had many chats up here in this room the boy was a pleasure to converse with he had an enthusiasm for life a thirst for knowledge a tear collected in the corner of one drooping blue eye excuse me the old man pulled out a linen handkerchief and dabbed his cheek dusty in here must get the custodial staff to clean he sipped his whiskey and when he spoke his voice was enfeebled by memories jeffrey saxon had the curious searching nature of a true scholar dr delaware i recall the first time he came up here and saw all the books like a child let loose in a toy store i lent him my finest antiquarian volumes everything from the london edition of josephus chronicles to anthropologic treatises he devoured them for gods sake professor hed say it would take several lifetimes to learn even a fraction of what there is to know thats the mark of an intellectual in my view becoming cognizant of ones own insignificance in relation to the accumulated mass of human knowledge the others of course thought him a rube a hick they made fun of his clothes his manner his lack of sophistication he spoke to me about it id become a kind of surrogate grandfather i suppose and i reassured him that he was meant for more noble company than what jedson had to offer in fact id encouraged him to put in for a transfer to an eastern school yale princeton where he could achieve significant intellectual growth with his grades and a letter from me he might have made it but he never got a chance he became attached to a young lady one of the two hundred pretty enough but vapid this in itself was no error as the heart and the gonads must be satisfied the mistake was in choosing a female already coveted by another by tim kruger van der graaf nodded painfully this is difficult for me doctor it brings back so much if its too difficult for you professor i can leave now and come back some other time no no that would serve no purpose he took a deep breath it comes down to a smarmy soap opera of a tale jeffrey and kruger were interested in the same girl they had words in public tempers flared but it seemed to pass jeffrey visited me and vented his spleen i played amateur psychologist professors so often are required to provide emotional support to their students and i confess i did a fine job of it i urged him to forget the girl knowing her type understanding full well that jeffrey would be the loser in any battle of wills the young of jedson are homing pigeons as predictable as their ancestors reverting to type the girl was meant to mate with one of her own there were better things finer things awaiting jeffrey an entire lifetime of opportunity and adventure he wouldnt listen he was like a knight of old imbued with the nobility of his mission conquer the black jouster rescue the fair maiden total rubbish but he was an innocent an innocent van der graaf paused out of breath his face had turned a sickly greenish shade of pale and i feared for his health perhaps we should stop for the moment i suggested i can return tomorrow absolutely not ill not be left here in solitary confinement with a poisonous lump lodged in my craw he cleared his throat ill be on with it you sit there and pay close attention all right professor now then where was i ah jeffrey as a white knight foolish boy the enmity between him and timothy kruger continued and festered jeffrey was ostracized by all the others kruger was a campus luminary socially established i became jeffreys sole source of support our conversations changed no longer were they cerebral exchanges now i was conducting psychotherapy on a full time basis an activity with which i was most uncomfortable but i felt i couldnt abandon the boy i was all he had it culminated in a wrestling match both the boys were greco roman wrestlers they agreed to meet late at night in the empty gymnasium just the two of them for a grudge match im no wrestler myself for obvious reasons but i do know that the sport is highly structured replete with regulations the criteria for victory clearly drawn jeffrey liked it for that reason he was highly self disciplined for one so young he walked into that gym alive and left on a stretcher neck and spine snapped alive in only the most vegetative sense of the word three days later he died and his death was ruled an accident i said softly that was the official story kruger said the two of them had gotten involved in a complicated series of holds and in the ensuing tangle of torsos arms and legs jeffrey had been injured and who could dispute it accidents do occur in wrestling matches at worst it seemed a case of two immature men behaving in an irresponsible manner but to those of us who knew timothy who understood the depth of the rivalry between them that was far from a satisfactory explanation the college was eager to hush it up the police all too happy to oblige why go up against the kruger millions when there are hundreds of poor people committing crimes i attended jeffreys funeral flew to idaho before i left i ran into timothy on campus looking back i see he must have sought me out van der graafs mouth tightened the wrinkles deepening as if controlled by some internal drawstring he approached me near the founders statue i hear youre traveling professor he said yes i replied im flying to boise tonight to attend the last rites for your young charge he asked there was a look of utter innocence on his face feigned innocence he was an actor for gods sake he could manipulate his features at will whats it to you i replied he bent to the ground picked up a dry oak twig and sporting an arrogant smirk the same smirk one can see in photographs of nazi concentration camp guards tormenting their victims snapped the twig between his fingers and let it drop to the ground then he laughed ive never in my life been so close to commiting murder doctor delaware had i been younger stronger properly armed i would have done it as it was i simply stood there for once in my life at a loss for words have a nice trip he said and still smirking backed away my heart pounded so i was assaulted with a spell of dizziness but fought to maintain my equilibrium when he was out of eyesight i broke down and sobbed a long moment passed between us when he appeared sufficiently composed i asked him does margaret know about this about kruger he nodded ive spoken of it to her shes my friend so the awkward publicist was more spider than fly after all the insight cheered me for some reason one more thing the girl the one they were fighting over what became of her what do you expect he sneered some of the old vitriol returning to his voice she shunned kruger most of the others did they were afraid of him she attended jedson for three more undistinguished years married an investment banker and moved to spokane no doubt shes a proper hausfrau shuttling the kiddies to school branching at the club boffing the delivery boy the spoils of battle i said he shook his head such a waste i looked at my watch id been up in the dome for a little over an hour but it seemed longer van der graaf had unloaded a truckful of sewage during that time but he was a historian and thats what theyre trained to do i felt tired and tense and i longed for fresh air professor i said i dont know how to thank you putting the information to good use would be a step in the right direction the blue eyes shone like twin gaslights snap some twigs of your own ill do my best i got up i trust you can see yourself out i did when i was halfway across the rotunda i heard him cry out remind maggie of our pizza picnic his words echoed against the smooth cold stone among certain primitive tribes there exists the belief that when one vanquishes an enemy it is not enough to destroy all evidence of corporeal life the soul must be vanquished as well that belief is at the root of the various forms of cannibalism that have been known to exist and still exist in many regions of the world you are what you eat devour your victims heart and you encompass his very being grind his penis to dust and swallow the dust and youve co opted his manhood i thought of timothy kruger of the boy hed killed and how hed assumed the identity of a struggling scholarship student when describing himself to me and visions of lip smacking bone crunching savagery intruded upon the idyllic verdancy of the jedson campus i was still struggling to erase those visions when i climbed the marble steps of crespi hall margaret dopplemeier responded to my coded knock with a wait one second and an open door she let me in and locked the door did you find van der graaf helpful she asked airily he told me everything about jeffrey saxon and tim kruger and the fact that you were his confidante she blushed you cant expect me to feel guilty for deceiving you when you did the same to me she said i dont i assured her i just wanted you to know that he trusted me and told me everything i know you couldnt until he did im glad you understand she said primly thank you for leading me to him it was my pleasure alex just put the information to good use it was the second time in ten minutes that id received that mandate add to that a similar order from raquel ochoa and it made for a heavy load i will do you have the clipping here she handed me the photocopy the death of lilah towle and little willie had made the front page sharing space with a report on fraternity hijinks and a reprint of an associated press report on the dangers of mariwuana reefers i started to read but the copy was blurred and barely legible margaret saw me straining the original was rubbed out its okay i skimmed the article long enough to see that it was consistent with van der graafs recollection heres another story several days later about the funeral this ones better i took it from her and examined it by now the towle affair was on page six a social register item the account of the ceremony was maudlin and full of dropped names a photograph at the bottom caught my eye towle led the mourners procession haggard and grim hands folded in front of him to one side was a younger still toadlike edwin hayden to the other slightly to the rear was a towering figure there was no mistaking the identity of the mourner the kinky hair was black the face bloated and shiny the heavy framed eyeglasses id seen a few days before were replaced by gold rimmed round spectacles resting low on the meaty nose it was the reverend augustus mccaffrey in younger days i folded both papers and slipped them into my jacket pocket call van der graaf i said hes an old man dont you think youve questioned him enough just call him i cut her off if you dont ill run back there myself she winced at my abruptness but dialed the phone when the connection was made she said sorry to bother you professor its him again she listened shot me an unhappy look and handed me the receiver holding it at arms length thank you i said sweetly into the phone professor i need to ask you about another student its important go on ive only miss november of occupying my attention who is it augustus mccaffrey was he a friend of towle too there was silence on the other end of the line and then the sound of laughter oh dear me thats a laugh gus mccaffrey a jedson student and him touched by the tar brush he laughed some more and it was a while before he caught his breath mary mother of god no man he was no student here ive got a photograph in front of me showing him at the towle funeral be that as it may he was no student gus mccaffrey was i believe they call themselves maintenance engineers today gus was a janitor he swept the dormitories took out the trash that kind of thing what was he doing at the funeral it looks like hes right behind towle ready to catch him if he falls no surprise he was originally an employee of the hickle family they had one of the largest homes on brindamoor family retainers can grow quite close to their masters i believe stuart brought him over to jedson when he began college here he did eventually attain some kind of rank within the custodial staff supervisory janitor or something similar leaving brindamoor may very well have been an excellent opportunity for him whats big gus doing today hes a minister the head of that childrens home i told you about i see taking out the lords trash so to speak so to speak can you tell me anything about him i honestly cant im afraid i had no contact with the nonacademic employees theres a tendency to pretend theyre invisible thats acquired over time he was a big brute of a fellow that i do recall slovenly seemed quite strong may very well have been bright your information certainly points in that direction and im no social darwinist with a need to dispute it but that is really all i can tell you im sorry dont be one last thing where can i get a map of brindamoor island theres none that i know of outside the county hall of records wait a student of mine did an undergraduate thesis on the history of the place complete with residential map i dont have a copy but i believe it would be stored in the library in the thesis section the students name was let me think church no it was something else of a clerical nature chaplain gretchen chaplain look under c you should find it thanks again professor goodbye goodbye margaret dopplemeier sat at her desk glaring at me im sorry for being rude i said it was important all right she said i just thought you could have been a little more polite in view of what ive done for you the possessive look slithered into her eyes like a python into a lagoon youre right i should have i wont trouble you further i stood up thanks so much for everything i held out my hand and when she reluctantly extended hers i took it youve really made a big difference thats good to know how long will you be staying gently i broke the handclasp not long i backed away smiled at her finally got my hand on the knob and pushed all the best margaret enjoy your blackberries she started to say something then thought better of it i left her standing behind her desk a circle of pink tongue tip visible in the corner of her unattractive mouth searching for a taste of something the library was properly austere and very respectably stocked with books and journals for a college the size of jedson the main room was a marble cathedral draped in heavy red velvet and lit by oversized windows placed ten feet apart it was filled with oak reading tables green shaded lamps leather chairs all that was missing were people to read the august volumes that papered the walls the librarian was an effete young man with close cropped hair and a pencil mustache his shirt was red plaid his tie a yellow knit he sat behind his reference table reading a recent copy of artforum when i asked him where the thesis section was he looked up with the astonished expression of a hermit observing the penetration of his lair there he said languidly and pointed to a spot at the south end of the room there was an oak card catalog and i found gretchen chaplains thesis listed in it the title of her magnum opus had been brindamoor island its history and geography theses by frederick chalmers and o winston chastain were present but gretchens rightful place between them was unfilled i checked and double checked the library of congress number but that was a fruitless ritual the brindamoor study was gone i went back to plaid shirt and had to clear my throat twice before he tore himself away from a piece on billy al bengston yes im looking for a specific thesis and cant seem to find it have you checked the card file to make sure its listed the cards there but the thesis isnt how unfortunate i would guess its been checked out could you check for me please he sighed and took too long to raise himself out of his chair whats the authors name i gave him all the necessary information and he went behind the checkout counter with an injured look i followed him brindamoor island dreary place why would you want to know about that im a visiting professor from ucla and its part of my research i didnt know an explanation was necessary oh its not he said quickly and buried his nose in a stack of cards he lifted out a portion of the cards and shuffled them like a vegas pro here he said that thesis was checked out six months ago my its overdue isnt it i took the card scant attention had been paid to gretchens masterpiece prior to its last withdrawal a half year ago the last time it had been checked out was in by gretchen herself probably wanted to show it to her kids mummy was once quite a scholar little ones sometimes we get behind on checking on overdue notices ill get right on this professor who checked it out last i looked at the signature and told him as the name left my mouth my brain processed the information by the time the two words had dissolved i knew my mission wouldnt be complete with a trip to the island the ferry to brindamoor island made its morning trip at seven thirty when the wake up call from the desk came in at six it found me showered shaved and tensely bright eyed the rain had started again shortly after midnight pounding the glass walls of the suite it had roused me for a dreamlike instant during which i was certain id heard the sound of cavalry hooves stampeding down the corridor and had gone back to sleep anyway now it continued to come down the city below awash and out of focus as if viewed from inside a dirty aquarium i dressed in heavy slacks leather jacket wool turtleneck and took along the only raincoat i had an unlined poplin doublebreasted affair that was fine for southern california but of uncertain utility in the present surroundings i caught a quick breakfast of smoked salmon bagels juice and coffee and made it to the docks at ten after seven i was among the first to queue up at the entrance to the auto bay the line moved and i drove down a ramp into the womb of the ferry behind a vw bus with save the whale stickers on the rear bumper i obeyed the gesticulations of a crewman dressed in dayglo orange overalls and parked two inches from the slick white wall of the bay an ascent of two flights brought me on deck i walked past a gift shop tobacconist and snack bar all closed and a blackened room furnished wall to wall with video games a waiter played pac man in solitude devouring dots with brow furrowing concentration i found a seat with a view at the stern folded my raincoat across my lap and settled back for the one hour ride the ship was virtually empty my few fellow passengers were young and dressed for work hired help from the mainland commuting to their assigned posts at the manors of brindamoor the return trip no doubt would be filled with commuters of another class lawyers bankers other financial types on their way to downtown offices and paneled boardrooms the ocean pitched and rolled frothing in response to the surface winds that drag raced along its surface there were smaller craft at sea mostly fishing boats tugs and scows and they danced in command curtsying and dipping for all the ferry moved it might have been a toy model on a shelf a group of six young men in their late teens came aboard and sat down ten feet away blond bearded in varying degrees of shagginess dressed in rumpled khakis and dirt grayed jeans they passed around a thermos full of something that wasnt coffee joked smoked put their feet up on chairs and emitted a collective guffaw that sounded like a beery laugh track one of them noticed me and held up the thermos swig my man he offered i smiled and shook my head he shrugged turned away and the party started up again the ferrys horn sounded the rumble of its engines reverberating through the floorboards and we started to move halfway through the trip i walked over to where the six young drinkers sat now slumped three of them slept snoring open mouthed one was reading an obscene comic book and two including the one whod offered me the drink sat smoking hypnotized by the glowing ends of their cigarettes excuse me the two smokers looked up the reader paid no attention yeah the generous one smiled he was missing half of his front teeth bad oral hygiene or a quick temper sorry man we got no more campbells soup he picked up the thermos and shook it aint that right dougie his companion a fat boy with drooping mustaches and mutton chop sideburns laughed and nodded his head yeah no more soup chicken noodle ninety proof from where i was standing the whole bunch of them smelled like a distillery thats all right i appreciate the offer i was just

construction muscle remember harmon lundquist im in the book i will ten minutes before the boat reached shore the island emerged from behind a dressing screen of rain and fog an oblong squat gray chunk of rock except for the coiffure of trees that covered most of its outer edges it could have been alcatraz i went down to the auto bay got behind the wheel of the nova and was ready when the man in orange waved us down the ramp the scene outside might have been lifted off the streets of london there were enough black topcoats black umbrellas and black hats to fill piccadilly pink hands held briefcases and the mornings wall street journal eyes stared straight ahead lips set grimly when the gate at the foot of the gangway opened they moved in procession each man in his place every shiny black shoe rising and falling in response to an unseen drummer a squadron of perfect gentlemen a gentlemans brigade just beyond brindamoor harbor was a small town square built around an enormous towering elm and rimmed with shops a bank with smoked glass windows a brokerage house three or four expensive looking clothiers with conservatively dressed faceless mannequins in their windows a grocer a butcher a dry cleaners that also housed the local post office a book store two restaurants one french the other italian a gift shop and a jewelers all the stores were closed the streets empty and except for a flock of pigeons convening under the elm devoid of life i followed harms directions and found charlemagne lane with no trouble a thousand yards out of the square the road narrowed and darkened shadowed by walls of fern devil ivy and shrub maple the green was broken by an occasional gate wrought iron or redwood the former usually backed by steel plating there were no mailboxes on the road no public display of names the estates seemed to be spaced several acres apart a few times i caught a glimpse of the properties behind the gates lots of rolling lawns sloping drives paved with brick and stone the houses imposing and grand tudor regency colonial the driveways stabling rolls royces mercedes and cadillac limousines as well as their more utilitarian four wheeled cousins station wagons paneled with phony wood volvos compacts once or twice i saw gardeners laboring in the rain their power mowers sputtering and belching the road continued for another half mile the properties growing larger the houses set back further from the gates it came to an abrupt halt at a thicket of cypress there was no gate no visible means of entry just the forest like growth of thirty foot trees and for a moment i thought id been misled i put on my raincoat pulled up the collar and got out the ground was thick with pine needles and wet leaves i walked to the thicket and peered through the branches twenty feet ahead almost totally hidden by the overgrowth of tangled limbs and dripping vegetation was a short stone pathway leading to a wooden gate the trees had been planted to block the entry from the size of them they were at least twenty years old discounting the possibility that someone had taken the trouble to transplant a score of full grown cypress to the site i decided it had been a long time since the normal human business of living had taken place here i pushed my way to the gate and tried it nailed shut i took a good look at it two slabs of tongued and grooved redwood hinged to brick posts the posts connected to chain link fencing piled high with thorny spirals no sign of electricity or barbed wire i found a foothold on a wet rock slipped a couple of times and finally managed to scale the gate i landed on another world acres of wasteland spread before me what had once been a formal lawn was now a swamp of weeds dead grass and broken rock the ground had sunk in several places creating pools of water that stagnated and provided oases for the mosquitoes and gnats that hovered overhead once noble trees had been reduced to jagged stumps and felled rotten hulls crawling with fungus rusted auto parts old tires and discarded cans and bottles were scattered throughout what was now a sodden trash dump rain fell on metal and made a hollow clanging sound i walked up a pathway paved in herringbone brick choked with weeds and covered by slimy moss in the places where the roots had pushed through the bricks stuck out of the ground like loose teeth in a broken jaw i kicked aside a drowned field mouse and slogged toward the former residence of the hickle clan the house was massive a three story structure of hand hewn stone that had blackened with age i couldnt imagine it as ever being beautiful but doubtless it had once been grand a brooding slate roofed mansion trimmed with gingerbread festooned with eaves and gables and girdled by wide stone porches there was rusted wrought iron furniture on the front porch a nine foot high cathedral door and a weather vane at the highest peak in the shape of a witch riding a broomstick the old crone twirled in the wind safely above the desolation i climbed the stairs to the front entry weeds had grown clear up to the door which was nailed shut the windows were similarly boarded and bolted tight in spite of its size perhaps because of it the house seemed pathetic a forgotten dowager abandoned to the point where she no longer cared how she looked and sentenced to a fate of decaying in silence i forced my way through a makeshift barrier of rotting boards that had been stacked in front of the porte cochere the house was at least a hundred and fifty feet long and it took me a while to check each window on the ground floor all were sealed the rear property was another three acres of swamp a four car garage designed as a miniature of the house was inaccessible nailed and fastened a fifty foot swimming pool was empty save for several inches of muddy water in which floated a host of organic debris the remains of a grape arbor and trellised rose garden were evident only as a jumble of peeling wood and cracked stone supporting a birds nest of lifeless twigs stone benches and statues slanted and pitched on broken bases pompeii in the wake of vesuvius the rain began to come down harder and colder i put my hands in the pocket of my raincoat by now soaked through and looked for shelter it would take tools hammer and crowbar to get into the house or the garage and there were no large trees that could be trusted not to topple at any moment i was out in the open like a bum caught in a blitz i saw a flash of light and braced myself for an electric storm none came and the light flashed again the heavy downpour made it difficult to see but the third time the light appeared i was able to draw a bead on it and walk in its direction several squishy footsteps later i could see it had come from a glass greenhouse at the rear of the estate just beyond the bombed out arbor the panes were opaque with dirt some of which ran in brown trickles but they appeared intact i ran toward it following the light that flickered danced disappeared then flickered again the door to the greenhouse was closed but it opened silently to the prompting of my hand inside it was warm steamy and sour with the aroma of decomposition waist high wooden tables ran along both sides of the glass room between them was a walkway floored with wood chips peat mulch and topsoil a collection of tools pitchforks rakes spades hoes stood in one corner upon the tables were pots of gorgeously flowering plants orchids bromeliads blue hydrangea begonias of every hue scarlet and white impatiens all in full bloom and spilling abundantly from their terra cotta houses a wooden beam into which metal hooks had been embedded was suspended above the tables hanging from the hooks were fuchsias dripping purple ferns spider plants creeping char lies more begonias it was the garden of eden in the great void the room was dim and it reverberated with the sound of the rain assaulting the glass roof the light that had drawn me appeared again brighter and closer i made out a shape at the other end of the greenhouse a figure in yellow slicker and hood holding a flashlight the figure shone the flashlight on plants picking up a leaf here a flower there examining the soil pinching off a dry branch setting aside a ripe blossom hello i said the figure whirled and the flashlight beam washed over my face i squinted in the glare and brought my hand up to shield my eyes the figure came closer who are you demanded a voice high and scared alex delaware the beam lowered i started to take a step stay right there i put my foot down the hood was pulled back the face it revealed was round pale flat utterly asian female but not feminine the eyes were two razor cuts in the parchment skin the mouth an unsmiling hyphen hello mrs hickle how do you know me what do you want there was toughness diluted by fear in the voice the toughness of the successful fugitive who knows vigilance must never cease i just thought id pay you a visit i dont want visitors i dont know you dont you alex delaware doesnt the name mean anything to you she didnt bother to lie just said nothing it was my office darling stuart chose for his last big scene or maybe it was chosen for him i dont know what youre talking about i dont want your company her english was clipped and slightly accented why dont you call the butler and have me ejected her jaws worked white fingers tightened around the flashlight you refuse to leave its wet and cold outside id appreciate the chance to dry off then youll go then i stay and we talk awhile about your late husband and some of his good buddies stuarts dead theres nothing to talk about i think theres plenty lots of questions she put down the flashlight and folded her arms in front of her there was defiance in the gesture any trace of fear had faded and her demeanor was one of irritation at being disturbed it puzzled me she was a lone woman accosted by a stranger in a deserted place but there was no panic last chance she said im not interested in blowing your cover just let me she clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth a large shadow materialized into something living and breathing i saw what it was and my bowels went weak this is otto he doesnt like strangers he was the largest dog id ever seen a great dane the size of a healthy pony colored like a dalmatian white dappled with gray black splotches one ear was partially shredded his maws were black and wet with saliva hanging loose in that half smile half snarl so characteristic of attack dogs revealing pearly white fangs and a tongue the size of a hot water bag his eyes were piggy and too small for his head they reflected orange pinpoints of light as they scanned me i must have moved because his ears perked he panted and looked up at his mistress she cooed at him he panted faster and gave her hand a fast swipe with the pink slab of tongue hi there big fella i said the words came out strangled his jaws opened wider in a growling yawn i backed away and the dog arched his neck forward he was a muscular beast from head to quivering haunch now maybe i dont want you to go said kim hickle i backed away further otto exhaled and made a sound that came from deep in his belly i told you i wont give you away so you say i took two more steps backward baby steps playing a deranged version of simon says the dog moved closer i just wanted to be alone she said nobody to bother me me and otto she looked lovingly at the great brute you found out you bother me how did you find me you left your name in a library file at jedson college she frowned bothered by her carelessness so you hunted me no it was an accident finding the card its not you im after she clicked her tongue again and otto came a few feet closer his malevolent leer loomed larger i could smell him rank and eager first you now others will follow asking questions blaming me saying im bad im not bad im a good woman good for children i was a good wife to a sick man not a sick woman i know i soothed it wasnt your fault another click the dog moved within springing distance she had him controlled like a radio operated toy start otto stop otto kill otto no not my fault i stepped back otto followed me stalking one paw scraping the ground the short hairs rising ill go i said we dont have to talk its not that important you deserve your privacy i was rambling stalling for time my eyes on the tools in the corner mentally i measured the distance to the pitchfork covertly rehearsing the move i might have to make i gave you a chance you didnt take it now its too late she clocked twice and the dog sprang coming at me in a blur of snarling darkness i saw the forepaws raised in the air the wet hungry gnashing mouth the orange eyes zeroed on their target all in a fraction of a second still within that second i feinted to the right sank to my knees and lunged for the pitchfork my fingers closed around wood and i snatched it and jabbed upward he came down on me a ton of coiled monster crushing the breath from my chest the paws and teeth scraping and snapping something went through cloth then leather then skin pain took hold of my arm from elbow to shoulder piercing and sickening the handle of the pitchfork slipped from my grasp i shielded my face with one sleeve as otto nuzzled at me with his wet nose trying to get those buzz saw jaws around my neck i twisted away reached out blindly for the pitchfork got hold of it lost it and found it again i landed a knuckle punch on the crown of his skull it was like pummeling armor plate he reared up on his hind legs roaring with rage and bore down i turned the pitchfork prong upwards he lunged throwing his full weight down on me my legs bent and my back hit the dirt the air went out of me and i fought for consciousness swallowed up in churning fur and struggling to keep the fork between us then he whinnied shrilly at the same time i felt the pitchfork hit bone scrape and slide as i twisted the handle full of hate the prongs went into him like warm knife into butter we embraced the dogs tongue on my ear his mouth slavering open in agony an inch from carving out a chunk of my face i put all of my strength behind the pitchfork pushing and twisting vaguely aware of the sound of a woman screaming he cried out like a puppy the prongs went in a final inch and then could sink no deeper his eyes opened wide with injured pride blinked spasmodically then closed the huge body shuddered convulsively atop me a tide of blood shot out of his mouth splashing across my nose lips and chin i gagged on the warm salty muck life passed out of him and i struggled to roll free the whole thing had taken less than half a minute kim hickle looked at the dead dog then at me and made a run for the door i pulled myself to standing position yanked the pitchfork out of the barrel chest and blocked her away get back i gasped i moved the pitchfork and droplets of gore flew through the air she froze the greenhouse was silent the rain had stopped the silence was broken by a low rumbling noise bubbles of gas escaping from the big dogs corpse a mound of feces followed running down the limp legs and mingling with the mulch she watched it and started to cry then she went limp and sat on the floor with the hopeless stuporous look of a refugee i jammed the pitchfork into the ground and used it to lean on it took me a full minute to catch my breath another two or three to check for damages the raincoat was ruined torn and blood soaked with some effort i got it off and let it fall to the ground one arm of the leather jacket was shredded i slipped out of it too and rolled up the sleeve of the turtleneck i inspected my bicep the layers of clothing had prevented it from being worse but it wasnt pretty three puncture wounds that had already begun to swell surrounded by a maze of abrasions the arm felt stiff and sore i bent it and nothing felt broken the same went for my ribs and my other limbs although my entire body floated just above agony i stretched carefully using a limbering routine id learned from jaroslav it made me feel a little better did otto have his shots i asked she didnt answer i repeated the question punctuating it with a grasp of the pitchfork handle yes i have the papers i want to see them its true you can believe me you just tried to get that monster to rip out my throat right now your credibility isnt high she looked at the dead animal and went into a meditative sway she seemed to be one who was used to waiting i was in no mood for a battle of endurance youve got two choices mrs hickle one cooperate and ill leave you to your little walden or you can make it hard for me and ill see that your story makes page one of the la times metro section think of it molesters widow finds refuge in abandoned homesite poetic isnt it ten to one the wire services pick it up what do you want from me answers to questions ive no reason or desire to hurt you youre really the one whose office stuart died in yes who else were you expecting no one she said too quickly towle hayden mccaffrey at the mention of each name her face registered pain sequentially as if her bones were being broken in stages im not with them but i want to know more about them she raised herself to a squat stood and picked up the bloodied raincoat carefully she placed it over the dogs still form ill talk to you she said there was an entrance to the four car garage that had eluded me at ground level hidden behind an untrimmed blue spruce was a window covered with chicken coop wire mesh she kneeled played with a couple of strategic strands and the mesh came loose a push a wriggle and she was inside i followed i was much larger and it wasnt easy my injured arm brushed against the pane and i had to hold my breath to stop from crying out as i squeezed through a half jump brought me to a narrow room that had originally been a root cellar it was damp and dark the walls lined with shallow wooden shelving the floor of poured concrete painted red there was a wooden shutter above the window held in place by an eye and hook she unfastened it and it slammed shut there was a second of darkness during which i braced myself for something devious instead came the pleasing pungence of kerosene reminiscent of teenage love by the light of the campfire and smoky illumination she tilted the slats of the shutter so that additional light came in but visibility from the outside was obscured my eyes adjusted to the light and the details came into focus a thin pallet and bedroll lay on the floor the kerosene lamp a hot plate a can of sterno and a packet of plastic utensils shared space on a rickety wooden table that had been painted and repainted so many times it looked like soft sculpture there was a utility sink in one corner and above it a rack holding an empty jam jar a toothbrush toothpowder safety razor and a bar of laundry soap most of the remaining floor space was taken up by wooden milk cartons of a type i hadnt seen since childhood the boxes had tube shaped hand holes on two sides and bore the imprint of farmer dels dairy tacoma wash our butter is best put it to the test below the slogan was a picture of a bored looking heifer and a phone number with a two letter prefix shed stacked the cartons three high in places the contents of some of them were visible packets of freeze dried food canned goods paper towels folded clothing three pairs of shoes all rubber soled and sturdy were lined up neatly against the wall there were metal hooks hammered into a raw wood support beam she hung her slicker on one of them and sat down on a straight backed chair of unfinished pine i settled myself on an overturned milk carton we looked at each other in the absence of competing stimuli the pain in my arm took over i winced and she saw it she got up soaked a paper towel in warm water came over and swabbed the wound she poked around in one of the boxes and found sterile gauze adhesive tape and hydrogen peroxide tending to me like florence nightingale she bandaged the arm the craziness of the situation wasnt lost on me minutes ago shed tried to kill me now she clucked maternally and smoothed down the tape i stayed karate wary expecting her to revert at any moment to murderous rage to dig her fingers into the inflamed flesh and take advantage of the blinding pain to jab me in the eye but when she was finished she returned to her seat the papers i reminded her more poking around but quick she knew exactly where everything was a sheaf of papers bound with a thick rubber band found its way into my hand there were veterinarians bills rabies vaccination records kennel club registration the dogs full name had been otto klaus von schulderheis out of stuttgartmunsch and sigourn daffodil quaint there were also diplomas from two obedience schools in la and a certificate stating that otto had been trained as an attack dog for defensive purposes only i handed the papers back to her thank you she said we sat across from one another pleasant as school chums i took a good look at her and tried to work up some genuine animosity what i saw was a sad looking oriental woman in her forties her hair chopped china doll short sallow frail homely in baggy work clothes and shabby as a church mouse she sat hands in lap docile the hatred wouldnt come how long have you been living here six months since stuarts death why live like this why not open up the house i thought this would be better for hiding all i want is to be alone she didnt make much of a garbo hiding from whom she looked at the floor come on i wont hurt you the others the other sick ones names the ones you mentioned and others she spit out a half dozen other names i didnt recognize lets be specific by sick you mean child molesters all those men are child molesters yes yes i didnt know it stuart told me later when he was in prison they volunteered at a childrens home took the kids to their houses did sick things with them and at your school too no that was only stuart the others never came to the school only at the childrens home la casa de los ninos your husband was a member of the gentlemans brigade yes he told me he was doing it to help children his friends recruited him he said the judge the doctor the others i thought it was so nice of him we didnt have children of our own i was proud of him i never knew what he was really doing just like i didnt know about what he did at the school i said nothing i know what youre thinking what they all thought that i knew all along how could i not know what my own husband was doing in my own house you blame me as much as you blame stuart i tell you i didnt know her arms went out beseechingly the hands saffron talons i noticed that the nails had been gnawed to the quick there was a desperate feral look on her face i did not know she repeated turning it into a self punishing mantra i did not know he was my husband but i did not know she was in need of absolution but i didnt feel like a father confessor i stayed tight lipped and observed her with forced detachment you must understand the kind of marriage stuart and i had to see how he could have been doing all of those things without my knowledge my silence said convince me she bowed her head and began we met in seoul she said shortly after the war my father had been a professor of linguistics our family was prosperous but we had ties to the socialists and the kcia killed them all they went on rampages after the war murdering intellectuals anyone who wasnt a blind slave to the regime everything we owned was confiscated or destroyed i was hidden given to friends the day before kcia thugs broke into the house and slit the throats of everyone family servants even the animals things got worse the government clamped down harder the family that took me in grew frightened and i was turned out to the street i was fifteen years old but very small very skinny looking twelve i begged ate scraps i i sold myself i had to to survive she stopped looked past me gathered her strength and continued when stuart found me i was feverish infested with lice and venereal disease covered with sores it was at night i was huddled under newspapers in an alley at the back of a cafe where the gis went to eat and drink and find bar girls i knew it was good to wait in such places because americans threw away enough food to feed entire families i was so sick i could barely move but i waited for hours forcing myself to stay awake so the cats wouldnt get my dinner first the restaurant closed shortly after midnight the soldiers came out loud drunk staggering through the alley then stuart by himself sober later i found out he never drank alcohol i tried to keep quiet but my pain made me cry out he heard came over so big a giant in uniform bending over me saying dont worry little girl he picked me up in his arms and took me to his apartment he had lots of money enough to rent his own place off base the gis were on r and r celebrating making lots of unwanted babies stuart had nothing to do with those kinds of things he used his place to write poetry to fiddle with his cameras to be alone she seemed to lose track of time and space and stared absently at the dark wooden walls he took you to his place i prompted for five weeks he nursed me he brought doctors bought medicine fed me bathed me sat at my bedside reading comic books i loved american comic books because my father had always brought them home to me from his travels little orphan annie terry and the pirates dagwood blondie he read them all to me in a soft gentle voice he was different from any man id ever met thin quiet like a teacher with those eyeglasses that made his eyes look so big like a big bird by the sixth week i was well he came into bed and made love to me i know now it was part of the sickness he must have thought i was a child that must have excited him but i felt like a woman over the years as i became a woman when i was clearly no longer a child he lost interest in me he used to like to dress me up in little girls things im small i could fit into them but when i grew up saw the world outside i would have nothing to do with that i asserted myself and he withdrew maybe that was when he started to act out his sickness maybe she said in a wounded voice it was my fault for not satisfying him no he was a troubled man you dont have to bear that responsibility i said not with total sincerity i didnt want it all to deteriorate into a wet session of self recrimination i dont know even now it seems so unreal the papers the stories about him about us he was such a kind man gentle quiet id heard similar pictures painted of other child molesters often they were exceptionally mild mannered men with a natural ability to gain rapport with their young victims but of course it had to be that way kids wont flock to an unshaven ogre in a soiled trenchcoat they will be drawn to uncle wally whos so much nicer than mean old mom and dad and all the other grownups who dont understand to uncle wally with his magic tricks and neat collection of baseball cards and really terrific toys at his house and mopeds and video recorders and cameras and neat weird books you must understand how much i loved him she was saying he saved my life he was american he was rich he said he loved me too my little geisha he called me id laugh and tell him no im korean you silly the japanese are pigs hed smile and call me his little geisha again we lived together in seoul for four months i waited for him to get off base on leave cooked for him cleaned brought him his slippers was his wife when his discharge papers came he told me he was taking me back to the states i was in heaven of course his family there was only a mother and some elderly aunts would have nothing to do with me stuart didnt care he had money of his own trust funds from his father we traveled together to los angeles he said hed gone to school there he did go to medical school but flunked out he took a job as a medical technician he didnt need to work it was a job that didnt pay much but he liked it said it kept him busy he liked the machines the meters and the test tubes he was always a tinkerer gave me his entire paycheck as if it was petty cash told me to spend it on myself we lived together that way for three years i wanted marriage but couldnt ask it took me a while to get used to american ways to women not being just property to having rights i pushed it when i wanted children stuart was indifferent to the idea but he went along with it we married i tried to get pregnant but couldnt i saw doctors at ucla stanford mayo they all said there was too much scarring id been so sick in korea it shouldnt have surprised me but i didnt want to believe it looking back now i know it was a good thing we did not have any little ones at the time after i finally accepted it i became depressed very withdrawn not eating eventually stuart couldnt ignore it any longer he suggested i go to school if i loved children i could work with them become a teacher he may have had his own motives but he seemed concerned for me whenever i was sick or low he was at his best i enrolled in junior college then college and learned so much i was a good student she recalled smiling very motivated for the first time i was out in the world with other people until then id been stuarts little geisha now i began to think for myself at the same time he drifted away from me there was no anger no resentment that he put into words he simply spent more time with his camera and his bird books he used to like to read books and magazines on nature though he never hiked or walked an armchair bird lover an armchair man we became two distant cousins living in the same house neither of us cared we were busy i studied every spare moment by now i knew i wanted to go beyond the bachelors and get a credential in early childhood we went our own ways there were weeks when we never saw each other there was no communication no marriage but no divorce either what would have been the point there were no fights it was live and let live my new friends my college friends told me i was liberated i should be happy to have a husband who didnt bother me when i became lonely i went deeper into my studies i finished the credential and they gave me field placements at local preschools i liked working with the little ones but i thought i could run a better school than those i had seen i told stuart he said sure anything to keep me happy out of his way we bought a big house in brentwood there always seemed to be money for anything and i started kims korner it was a wonderful place a wonderful time i finally stopped mourning not having children of my own then he she stopped covered her face with her hands and rocked back and forth i got up and put a hand on her shoulder please dont do that its not right i tried to have otto kill you she lifted her face dry and unlined do you understand that i wanted him to kill you now you are being kind and understanding it makes me feel worse i removed the hand and sat back down why the need for otto why the fear i thought you were sent by the ones who killed stuart the official verdict was that he killed himself she shook her head no he didnt commit suicide they said he was depressed it was a lie of course when he was first arrested he was very low humiliated and guilty but he bounced out of it that was stuarts way he could block out reality as easily as exposing a roll of film poof and the image is gone the day before he was arraigned we spoke on the phone he was in high spirits to hear him talk the arrest was the best thing that ever happened to him to us hed been til now he would get help wed start all over again as soon as he got out of the hospital i could even get another school in another city he suggested seattle and talked of our reclaiming the family mansion that was how i got the idea to come here i knew it would never happen by then id decided to leave him but i went along with the fantasies saying yes dear certainly stuart later we had other conversations and it was the same thing life was going to be better than ever he was not talking like a man about to blow his brains out its not that simple people often kill themselves right after an upswing in mood the suicide season is spring you know perhaps but i know stuart and i know he didnt kill himself he was too shallow to let something like the arrest bother him for a long time he could deny anything he denied me for all those years denied our marriage thats why he could do those things without my knowing about them we were strangers but you know him well enough to be sure he didnt commit suicide yes she insisted that story about the false phone call to you the picked locks that kind of scheming isnt wasnt stuart for all his sickness he was naive almost simple he wasnt a planner it took planning to get those children down in the cellar you dont have to believe me i dont care hes done his damage now hes dead and im in a cellar of my own her smile was pitiful the lamp sputtered she got up to adjust the wick and add more kerosene when she sat back down i asked her who killed him and why the others his so called friends so he wouldnt expose them and he would have during our last visits hed hint around say things like im not the only sick one kimmy or things arent what they seem with the gentlemen i knew he wanted me to ask him to help him spill it out but i didnt i was still in shock over losing the school wrapped in my own shame i didnt want to hear about more perversions i cut him off changed the subject but after he died it came back to me and i put it all together did he mention anyone by name as being sick no but what else could he have meant theyd come to pick him up parking their big soft cars in the driveway dressed in those sport jackets with the casa insignia when hed leave with them hed be excited his hands trembling hed come back in the early hours of the morning exhausted or the next day isnt it obvious what they were doing you havent told anyone of your suspicions who would believe me those men are powerful doctors lawyers executives that horrid little judge hayden i wouldnt stand a chance the wife of a molester to the public im as guilty as stuart and theres no evidence look what they did to him to shut him up i had to run did stuart ever mention knowing mccaffrey from washington no did he yes what about a child named gary nemeth did his name come up no elena gutierrez morton handler doctor mor ton handler no maurice bruno she shook her head no who are these people victims violated like the others the ultimate violation dead murdered oh my god she put her hands to her face telling her story had made her sweat strands of black hair stuck to her forehead so it continues she said mournfully thats why im here to put an end to it what else can you tell me that would help nothing ive told you everything they killed him theyre evil men hiding their ugly secret under a cloak of respectability i ran to escape them i looked around the dingy room how long can you continue this way forever if no one gives me away the island is secluded this property is hidden when i have to go to the mainland to shop i dress like a cleaning maid no one notices me i stockpile as much as possible to avoid making too many trips the last one was over a month ago i live simply the flowers are my one extravagance i planted them from seed packets and bulbs they occupy my time with watering feeding pruning re potting the days go by quickly how safe can you be towle and hayden have roots here i know but their families havent lived here for a generation i checked i even went by their old homes there are new faces new names theres no reason for them to look for me here not unless you give them one i wont on my next trip ill buy a gun ill be prepared for them if they come ill escape and go somewhere else im used to it the memory of seoul returns in my dreams it keeps me watchful im sorry to hear about the other murders but i dont want to know about them theres nothing that i can do i got up and she helped me on with my jacket the funny thing is she said this estate probably belongs to me as does the brentwood property and the rest of the hickle fortune im stuarts sole heir we wrote our wills several years ago he never discussed finances with me so i dont know how much he left but it has to be considerable there were bearer bonds other pieces of real estate all up and down the coast in theory im a rich woman do i look it theres no way to get in touch with the executors of his will the executor is a partner in edwin haydens law firm for all i know hes one of them i can do without wealth when all it means is a fancy funeral she used her chair to climb out of the window i followed her we walked in the direction of the big black house you worked with the children from my school how are they doing very well the prognosis is good theyre amazingly resilient thats good a few steps later and the parents did they hate me some others were surprisingly loyal and defended you it created a schism in the group they worked it out im glad i think about them often she accompanied me to the edge of the swamp that fronted the mansion ill let you go the rest of the way by yourself how does the arm feel stiff but nothing serious ill survive i held out my hand and she took it good luck she said same to you i walked through weeds and mud chilled and tired when i turned around to look she was gone i stayed in the ferrys dining room drinking coffee for much of the return trip to the mainland going over what id learned when i got back to the hotel i called milo at the station was told he wasnt there and tried his home number rick silverman answered hi alex theres static is this long distance it is seattle is milo back yet no i expect him tomorrow he went to mexico on a supposed vacation but it sounds like work to me it is hes looking into the background of a guy named mccaffrey i know the minister with the childrens home he said you turned him on to it i may have sparked his interest but when i spoke to him about it he brushed me off did he mention what led him to make the trip let me see i recall his saying he phoned the police down there its some small town i forget the name and they jerked him around they implied they had something juicy for him but that hed have to come up with some bucks to get it it surprised me i thought cops cooperated with each other but he said thats the way they always are thats it thats it he invited me to come along but it didnt work out well with my schedule i had a twenty four hour shift coming up and it would have required too much trading with the other guys have you heard from him since he left just a postcard from the airport at guadalajara an old peasant pulling a burro next to a saguaro cactus that looked plastic very classy stuff he wrote wish you were here on it i laughed if he does call tell him to give me a ring ive got some more information for him will do anything specific no just have him call okay thanks look forward to meeting you some day rick likewise maybe when he gets back and wraps things up sounds good i got out of my clothes and examined the arm there was some oozing but nothing bad kim hickle had done a good patch up job i did a half hour of limbering exercise and a bit of karate then soaked in a hot bath for forty five minutes while reading the throwaway guide to seattle the hotel had furnished i called robin got no answer dressed and went for dinner i remembered a place from my previous visit a cedar paneled room overlooking lake union where they barbecued salmon over alder wood i found it using my memory and a map arrived early enough to get a table with a view and proceeded to put away a large salad with roquefort a beautiful coral colored chinook filet potatoes beans a basket of hot cornbread and two coors i topped it off with homemade blackberry ice cream and coffee and with a full belly watched the sun go down over the lake i browsed a couple of bookstores in the university district found nothing exciting or uplifting and drove back to the hotel there was an oriental imports shop in the lobby still open i went in bought a green coloisonne necklace for robin and rode the elevator back up to my room at nine i called her again this time she answered alex i was hoping it was you how are you doll i called you a couple of hours ago i went out for dinner by my lonesome ate an omelette in a corner of the cafe pelican all by myself isnt that a pathetic image i supped alone too my lady how sad come home soon alex i miss you i miss you too was the trip productive very i filled her in on the details careful to exclude my encounter with otto youre really on to something dont you feel strange uncovering all those secrets not really but im not looking at it from the outside i am and believe me its freaky alex ill just be glad when milo gets back and he can take over yes how are things going with you nothing nearly as exciting one thing new this morning i got a call from the head of a new feminist group its a kind of a womens chamber of commerce i fixed this womans banjo she came down to pick it up and we got to talking this was a couple of months ago anyway she called and invited me to give a lecture to their group next week the topics something like the female artisan in contemporary society subtitle creativity meets the business world thats fantastic ill be sure to be there listening if they let me in dont you dare im scared enough as it is alex ive never given a speech before im absolutely petrified dont worry you know what youre talking about youre bright and articulate theyll love you so you say so i say listen if youre really nervous ill do a little hypnosis with you to help you relax itll be a piece of cake you think hypnosis will help sure with your imagination and creativity youll be a terrific subject ive heard you talk about it how you used to do it with patients but i never thought of asking you to do it with me usually darling we find other ways to occupy our time together hypnosis she said now ive got something else to worry about dont worry its harmless totally yes totally in your case the only time you run into a problem is when the subject has major emotional conflicts or deep seated problems in those cases hypnosis can dredge up primal memories you get a stress reaction some terror but even that can be helpful the trained psychotherapist uses the anxiety constructively to help the patient work it through and that couldnt happen to me certainly not i guarantee it youre the most normal person ive ever met ha youve been retired too long i challenge you to come up with one single symptom of psychopathology how about extreme horniness hearing your voice and wanting to be able to touch you and grab you and put you in me hmmm sounds serious then come on back and do something about it doctor ill be back tomorrow treatment will commence immediately what time the plane lands at ten a half hour after that damn i forgot i have to go to santa barbara tomorrow morning my aunts sick in the icu at cottage hospital its a family thing i have to be there if you came in earlier we could have breakfast before i leave im taking the earliest flight honi suppose i could postpone it show up later visit your aunt well have dinner it might be a late dinner drive straight to my place and well take it from there all right ill try to make it by eight thats great speedy recovery to your aunt i love you love you too take care something bothered me the next morning the troubled feeling persisted during the ride to sea tac and up the ramp to the plane i couldnt get a handle on what is was that lurked in a bottom drawer of my mind that lingered through the serving of the plastic food the forced smiles of the flight attendants the copilots bad jokes the harder i tried to bring it to the forefront of my consciousness the further back it sank i felt the impatience and frustration of a child encountering a chinese finger puzzle for the first time so i decided to just ride with it sit back and wait and see if it came to me on its own it wasnt until shortly before landing that it did what had stuck in my head was last nights conversation with robin shed asked me about the dangers of hypnosis and id given her a speech about it being harmless unless the experience stirred up latent conflicts dredged up primal memories had been my exact words dredge up primal memories and the reaction is often terror i was stuffed with tension as the landing wheels touched down once free i jogged through and out of the airport picked up the seville in the overnight lot paid a considerable ransom to get it out the gate and headed east on century boulevard caltrans in its in finite wisdom had chosen to set up construction in the middle of the road during the morning rush in and out of lax and caught in a jam i cooked in the cadillac for the mile to the san diego freeway on ramp i took the freeway north connected to santa monica west and exited just before pacific coast highway a drive down ocean and a few turns brought me to the palisades and the place where morton handler and elena gutierrez had lost their lives the door to bonita quinns apartment was open i heard cursing from within and entered a man was standing in the front room kicking the floral sofa and muttering under his breath he was in his forties curly haired flabby and putty colored with discouraged eyes and a steel wool goatee separating his first chin from his second he wore black slacks and a light blue nylon shirt that clung to every tuck and roll of his gelatinous torso one hand held a cigarette and flicked ashes onto the carpet the other groped for treasure behind a meaty ear he kicked the couch again looked up saw me and waved the smoking hand around the tiny room okay you can get to work doing what loading this shit outta here arent you the mover he looked at me again this time with sharpened eyes no you dont look like a mover excuse me he threw back his shoulders what can i do for you im looking for bonita quinn and her daughter you and me both shes gone three friggin days with who knows how many rent checks ive got tenants complaining their calls werent answered repairs that havent been done i call her no answer so i come down here myself and find shes been gone for three days left all this junk hightailed it i never had a good feeling about her you do someone a favor you get shafted happens every time he inhaled his cigarette coughed and sucked again there was yellow around the irises of his eyes gray unhealthy flesh pouched the wary orbs he looked like a man recuperating from a coronary or just about to have one what are you collection agency im one of her daughters doctors oh yeah dont tell me about doctors its one of you that got me into this in the first place towle his eyebrows rose yeah you from his office cause if you are i got plenty no i just know him then you know hes a nag gets into stuff he has no business getting into my wife hears me say this shell kill me she loves the guy says hes terrific with the kids so who am i to argue right what kind of doctor are you anyway psychologist the kid had problems huh wouldnt surprise me she looked a little iffy if you know what i mean he held out his hand tilted it like the wing of a glider you said dr towle got you into the mess with bonita quinn thats right i met the guy once or twice maybe i dont know him from adam one day he calls me out of the clear blue and asks me if i could give a job to a patient of his he heard there was an opening for a manager in this place and could i help this lady out i say does this person have experience were talking multiple units here not some duplex he says no but she can learn shes got a kid needs the money i say listen doc this particular building is singles oriented the jobs not right for someone with a kid the managers place is too small he looked at me scowling would you stick a kid in a hole like this no me neither you dont have to be a doctor to see its not fit i tell towle this i explain it to him i say doc this job is meant for a single person usually i get a student from ucla to do it they dont need a lot of space ive got other buildings i tell him in van nuys a couple in canoga park more family oriented let me call my man in the valley have him check it out ill see if i can help this person towle says no it has to be this building the kids already enrolled in school in this neighborhood to move her would be traumatic hes a doctor he knows this to be a fact i say but doc you cant have kids making noise in a place like this the tenants are mostly singles

make sense i try to put him off but he presses me hes a nag my wife loves him shell kill me if i get him pissed off so i say okay he makes an appointment for me to meet this lady shows up with the quinn broad and the kid i was surprised i gave it a little thought the night before figured he was humping this broad thats why the albert schweitzer routine i expected something classy with curves one of those aspiring actress types you know what i mean hes older but hes a classy looking guy right so in he walks with her and the kid and they look like a pair outta the dust bowl real hicks the mother is scared outta her skull shes smoking more than me which is a feat the kids like i told you a little iffy just stares into space though ill grant you shes quiet didnt make a sound i had my doubts she could handle the job but what could i do i already committed myself i hired her she did okay she was a hard worker but she learned very slowly no complaints about the kid though anyway she stays for a few months then she flies the coop leaving me with this junk and shes probably got five grand worth of rent checks i have to go back and trace em and have the tenants put stops on em and write new ones i gotta clean this place hire someone new let me tell you no more mister nice guy for marty for doctors or anyone else he folded his arms over his chest you have no idea where she went i asked i did would i be standing here jawing with you he went into the bedroom it was as bleak as i remembered it look at this how can people raise kids like this i got three each has his own room they got tvs bookshelves pac mans all that stuff how can a kids mind grow in a place like this if you hear from her or find out where she is would you please call me i took out an old business card crossed out the number and wrote my home phone number on it he glanced at it and put it in his pocket running one finger along the top of the dresser he came up with a digit cloaked with dust kittys he flung the dust away yecch i hate dirt i like things to be clean know what i mean my apartments are always clean i pay extra for the best cleaning service its important tenants should feel healthy in a place youll call me sure sure you do the same for me too okay i wouldnt mind finding miss bonita get my checks back give her a piece of my mind he fished in his pocket pulled out an alligator billfold and from it produced a pearl gray business card that said m and m properties commercial and residential marduk i minassian president followed by a century city address thanks mr minassian marty he continued probing and inspecting opening drawers and shaking his head bending to look under the bed bonita quinn had shared with her daughter he found something under there stood up looked at it and tossed it in a metal wastebasket where it landed with a clang what a mess i looked in the basket saw what he had discarded and pulled it out it was the shrunken head melody had shown me the day wed spent together at the beach i held it in my palm and the rhinestone eyes glared back glossy and evil most of the synthetic hair had come loose but a few black strands stuck out of the top of the snarling face thats junk said minassian its dirty throw it away i closed my hand over the childs keepsake more sure than ever that the hypothesis id developed on the plane was right and that i had to move fast i put the shrunken head in my pocket smiled at minassian and left hey he called after me and then he muttered something that sounded like crazy doctors i retraced my route got back on the freeway and headed east driving like a demon and hoping the highway patrol wouldnt spot me i had my lapd consultant badge in my pocket but i doubted it would help even police consultants arent supposed to weave in and out of traffic going eighty miles an hour i was lucky traffic was light the guardians of the asphalt were nowhere to be seen and i made it to the silver lake exit just before one five minutes later i was walking up the steps to the gutierrez home the orange and yellow poppies drooped thirsty the porch was empty it creaked as i stepped onto it i knocked on the door cruz gutierrez answered knitting needles and bright pink yarn in her hands she didnt seem surprised to see me si senor i need your help senora no hablo ingles please i know you understand enough to help the dark round face was impassive senora the life of a child is at stake that was optimism speaking una nina seven years old siete anos shes in danger she could be killed muerta like elena i let that sink in liver spotted hands tightened around the blue needles she looked away like the other child the nemeth boy elenas student he didnt die in an accident did he elena knew that she died because of that knowledge she put her hand on the door and started to close it i blocked it with the heel of my palm i feel for your loss senora but if elenas death is to take on meaning it can be through preventing more killing through stopping the deaths of others please her hands started shaking the needles rattled like chopsticks in the grasp of a spastic she dropped them and the ball of yarn i bent and retrieved them here she took them held them to her bosom come in please she said in english that was barely accented i was too edgy to want to sit but when she motioned me to the green velvet sofa i settled in it she sat across from me as if awaiting sentence first i said you must understand that darkening elenas memory is the last thing i want to do if other lives were not at stake i wouldnt be here at all i understand she said the money is it here she nodded got up left the room and came back minutes later with a cigar box take she gave me the box as if it held something alive and dangerous the bills were in large denominations twenties fifties hundreds neatly rolled and held together by thick rubber bands i made a cursory count there was at least fifty thousand dollars in the box probably a good deal more take it i said no no i dont want black money just keep it here until i come back for it does anyone else know about it either of your sons no she shook her head adamantly rafael know he take it and buy the dope no only me how long have you had it here elena she bring it over the day before she was killed the mothers eyes filled with tears i say what is this where you get this she say cant tell you mama jus keep it for me i come back for it she never come back she pulled a lace trimmed handkerchief from up her sleeve and dabbed at her eyes please take it back hide it again only a little while senor okay black money bad eye mal ojo ill come back for it if thats what you want she took the box disappeared again and returned shortly youre sure rafael didnt know i sure he know it would all be gone that made sense junkies werent known for being able to hold on to their nickels and dimes let alone a small fortune another question senora raquel told me that elena had in her possession certain tapes recorded tapes of music and of relaxation exercises given to her by dr handler when i went through her things i found no such tapes do you know anything about that i don know this is the truth has anyone been through those boxes before i got here no only rafael an antonio they look for books things to read the policia take boxes first nothin else where are your sons now she stood up suddenly agitated don hurt they good boys they don know nothin i wont i just want to talk to them she looked to one side at the wall covered with family portraits at her three children young innocent and smiling the boys with short hair slicked and parted and open necked white shirts the girl in a frilly blouse between them at the graduation picture elena in mortarboard and gown wearing a look of eagerness and confidence ready to take on the world with her brains and her charm and her looks at the somber tinted photo of her long dead husband stiff and solemn in starched collar and gray serge suit a workingman unaccustomed to the fuss and fiddling that went with having ones countenance recorded for posterity she looked at the pictures and her lips moved almost imperceptibly like a general surveying a smoldering battlefield she conducted a silent body count andy working she said and gave me the address of a garage on figueroa v and rafael rafael i don know he say he go look for work she and i both knew where he was but id opened enough wounds for one day so i kept my mouth shut except to thank her i found him after a half hours cruising up and down sunset and in and out of several side streets he was walking south on alvarado if you could call the stumbling self absorbed lurch that propelled him headfirst feet following a walk he stayed close to buildings veering toward the street when people or objects got in his way quickly returning to the shadow of awnings it was close to eighty but he wore a long sleeved flannel shirt hanging loose over khakis and buttoned to the neck on his feet were high topped sneakers the laces on one of them had come loose he looked even thinner than i remembered i drove slowly staying in the right lane out of his field of vision and keeping pace with him once he passed a group of middle aged men merchants they pointed at him behind his back shook their heads and frowned he was oblivious to them cut off from the external world he pointed with his face like a setter homing in on a scent his nose ran continuously and he wiped it with his sleeve his eyes shifted from side to side as his body kept moving he ran his tongue over his lips slapped his thin thighs in a steady tattoo pursed his lips as if in song bobbed his head up and down he was making a concentrated effort at looking cool but he fooled no one like a drunk working hard at coming across sober his mannerisms were exaggerated unnatural and lacking spontaneity they produced the opposite effect he appeared to be a hungry jackal on the prowl desperate gnawed upon from within and hurting all over his skin was glossy with sweat pale and ghostly people got out of his way as he boogied toward them i sped up and down two blocks before pulling to the curb and parking near an alley behind a three story building that housed a latin grocery on the ground floor and apartments on the upper two a quick look shot backward confirmed that he was still coming i got out of the car and ducked into the alley which stunk of rotting produce and urine empty and broken wine bottles littered the pavement a hundred feet away was a loading dock unattended its steel doors closed and bolted a dozen vehicles were illegally parked on both sides exit from the alley was blocked by a half ton pickup left perpendicular to the walls somewhere off in the distance a mariachi band played cielito lindo a cat screeched horns honked out on the boulevard a baby cried i peeked my head out and retracted it he was half a block away i got ready for him when he began crossing the alley i said in a stage whisper hey man i got what you need that stopped him he looked at me with great love thinking hed found salvation it threw him off when i grabbed him by his scrawny arm and pulled him into the alley i dragged him several feet until wed found cover behind an old chevy with peeling paint and two flat tires i slammed him against the wall his hands went up protectively i pushed them down and pinioned both of them with one of my own he struggled but he had no strength it was like tussling with a toddler whadyou want man answers rafael remember me i visited you a few days ago with raquel hey yeah sure he said but there was only confusion in the watery hazel eyes snot ran down one nostril and into his mouth he let it sit there

arms length then let go he looked at me unbelievingly slithered against the wall found a space between the chevy and a rusted dodge van staring at me he wiped his nose passed between the two cars and made a run for freedom i drove to a gas station at virgil and sunset filled up and used the pay phone to call la casa de los nifios the receptionist with the upbeat voice answered slipping into a drawl i asked her for kruger mr kruger isnt in today sir hell be in tomorrow oh yeah thats right he told me hed be off the day i got in would you care to leave a message sir heck no im an old friend

helpful and you have a nice voice thank you sir you free tonight im sorry sir no fellows gotta try right yes sir good bye sir id been driving north for a good five minutes before i heard the buzzing i realized then that the sound had been with me since id pulled out of the gas station the rearview mirror revealed a motorcycle several lengths back bouncing in the distance like a fly on a hot windshield the driver twisted the handle accelerator and the fly grew like a monster in a japanese horror flick he was two lengths behind and gaining as he approached i got a look at him jeans boots black leather jacket black helmet with full face tinted sun visor that completely masked his features he rode my tail for several blocks i changed lanes instead of passing he hung back allowing a ford full of nuns to come between us a half mile past lexington the nuns turned off i steered sharply toward the curb and came to a sudden stop in front of a pup n taco the motorcycle sped by i waited until hed disappeared told myself i was being paranoid and got out of the seville i looked for him didnt see him bought a coke got behind the wheel and reentered the boulevard id turned east on temple headed for the hollywood freeway when i heard him again verifying his presence in the mirror caused me to miss the onramp and i stayed on temple dipping under the bridge created by the overpass the motorcycle stayed with me i gave the seville gas and ran a red light he maintained his position buzzing and spitting the next intersection was filled with pedestrians and i had to stop i kept a watch on him through the side mirror he rolled toward me three feet away now two approaching on the drivers side one hand went inside the leather jacket a young mother wheeled a small child in a stroller passing directly in front of my bumper the child wailed the mother chewed gum heavy legged moving oh so slowly something metallic came into the hand in the mirror the motorcycle was just behind me almost flush with the drivers window i saw the gun now an ugly little snub nosed affair easy to conceal in a large palm i raced my engine the gum chewing young matron wasnt impressed she seemed to move in slow motion indolently working her jaws the child now screaming at the top of his lungs the light remained red but its cater cornered cousin had turned amber the longest light in the history of traffic engineering how long could an amber light last the snout of the revolver pressed against the glass directly in line with my left temple a black hole miles long wrapped in a concentric halo of silver the mother still dragged her heavy body lazily across the intersection her heel in line with my right front tire unaware that the man in the green cadillac was going to be blown away any second the finger on the trigger blanched the mother stepped clear by an inch i twisted the steering wheel to the left pressed down hard on the accelerator and shot diagonally across the intersection into the path of the ongoing traffic i gunned the engine laid a long patch of rubber heard a delphic chorus of curses shouts honking horns and squealing brakes and shot up the first side street narrowly missing a head on collision with a water and power van coming from the opposite direction the street was narrow and winding and pocked with potholes the seville was no sports car and i had to fight its slack steering system to maintain speed and control around the turns i climbed bounced down hard and swooped steeply down a hill a boulevard stop at the bottom was clear i sped through three blocks of level turf at seventy miles an hour and the buzz was back growing louder the motorcycle so much easier to maneuver was catching up fast the road came to an end at a cracked masonry wall left or right decisions decisions with the adrenaline shooting through every corpuscle the buzz now a roar my hands sweaty slipping off the wheel i looked in the mirror saw one hand come off the bars and aim the gun at my tires i chose left and floored the seville putting my body into it the road rose scaling empty streets higher spiraling into the smog a roller coaster of a street planned by a berserk engineer the motorcyclist kept riding up on my rear raking his gun hand off the bars whenever he could striving for steady aim i swerved continuously dancing out of his sights but the narrowness of the street gave me little leeway i knew i had to avoid slipping unconsciously into a regular rhythm back and forth back and forth a gasoline fueled metronome for to do so would be to offer an easy target i drove erratically crazily jerking the wheel slowing down speeding up careening against the curb losing a hubcap that spun off like a chromium frisbee it was a direct assault on my axle and i didnt know how long it could last we continued to climb a view of sunset below appeared around a corner we were back in echo park on the south side of the boulevard the road hit its peak a shot whizzed by so close that the sevilles windows vibrated i swerved and a second shot went far afield the terrain changed as the altitude rose thinning from residential blocks of frame houses to progressively emptier stretches of dusty lots with here and there a decrepit shack no more telephone poles no cars no signs of human habitation perfect for an afternoon killing we began to race downhill and i saw with horror that i was heading full speed into a dead end mere yards from slamming into a pile of dirt at the mouth of an empty construction site there was no escape the road terminated at the site and was additionally blocked by piles of cinder block stacks of drywall lumber and more mounds of excavated dirt a goddam box canyon if the impact of smashing nose first into the dirt didnt kill me id be imbedded tires spinning hopelessly as immobile as parsley in aspic a perfect passive target the man on the motorcycle must have harbored similar thoughts in that same instant for he engaged in a quick series of confident actions he removed his gun hand from the bars slowed and came around to the left ready to be at my side when my escape came to an end i made the only move left for me i jammed on the brakes the seville convulsed skidded violently spun and rocked on its bearings threatening to capsize i needed the skid to continue so i steered away from it the car spun like a rotor blade then a sudden impact threw me across the seat my front end had gone out of control and collided with the cycle as it came out of a spin with full torque behind it the lighter vehicle bounced off the car caromed and sailed through the air in a wide arc over the hill of earth i watched as man and machine parted ways the cycle climbing stunt like falling its rider thrown loose flying higher a scarecrow cut free from its stake then falling too landing unseen the seville stopped spinning and its engine died i pulled myself up my sore arm had been knocked against the passenger door panel and it hummed with pain no sign of movement came from the site i got out quietly crouched behind the car and waited there as my head cleared and my breathing slowed still nothing i spied a two by four several feet away snatched it hefted it like a stave and circled the mound of dirt staying low to the ground creeping onto the site i saw that a partial foundation had been laid a right angle of concrete from which corrugated steel rods protruded like flowerless stalks the remains of the motorcycle were visible immediately a rubbish heap of seared metal and shattered windshield it took several more minutes of poking amid the rubble to find the body it had landed in a ditch at the junction of the two cement arms a spot where the earth was etched with caterpillar tread marks next to a broken fiberglass shower stall and half concealed by molding sheets of insulation the opaque helmet was still in place but it had offered no protection from the steel rod that stuck out through a large jagged hole in the riders throat the shaft extended just below the adams apple it had created a good sized exit wound coming through blood seeped from the hole turning muddy in the dirt the trachea was visible still pink but deflated leaking fluid a fleck of gore tipped the rod i knelt and undid the helmet strap and tried to pull off the headpiece the neck had bent unnaturally upon being pierced and it proved a difficult task as i struggled i felt steel scrape against vertebrae cartilage and gristle my belly quaked with nausea i heaved and turned away to vomit in the dirt with a bitter taste in my mouth and eyes brimming with tears breathing hard and loud i returned to the grisly chore the helmet finally came loose and the bare skull flopped to the ground i stared down into the lifeless bearded face of jim halstead the coach at la casa de los ninos his lips were drawn back in death cast in a permanent sneer the force of landing after his final free fall had snapped his jaws down upon his tongue and the severed tip rested on the hairy chin like some fleshy parasitic grub his eyes were open and rolled backward the whites flooded with blood he cried crimson tears i looked away from him and saw the sun hit something shiny several feet to the right i walked to it found the gun and examined it a chrome plated i took it and tucked it in the waistband of my trousers the ground at my feet radiated heat and the stench of something burning congealed tar toxic waste bio un degradable garbage polyvinyl vegetation a bluejay had landed on halsteads face it pecked at his eyes i found a dusty drop cloth peppered with specks of dried cement the bird fled at my approach i covered the body with the cloth weighted down the corners with large stones and left him that way the address the receptionist had given me for tim kruger matched the oversized steel numbers on the face of a bone white highrise on ocean just a mile or so from where the handler gutierrez murders had taken place the entry hall was a crypt of marble floors and mirrors furnished with a single white cotton sofa and two rubber plants in wicker canisters the upper half of one wall was given over to rows of alphabetically arranged brass mailboxes it didnt take long to locate krugers apartment on the twelfth floor i took a short silent ride on an elevator padded with gray batting and exited into a corridor floored in royal blue plush and papered with grasscloth krugers place was located in the northwest corner of the building i knocked on the royal blue door he opened it dressed in jogging shorts and a casa de los ninos t shirt shiny with perspiration and smelling as if hed been exercising he saw me stifled his surprise and said hello doctor in a stagey voice then he noticed the gun in my hand and the stolid face turned ugly what the just get in i said he backed into the apartment and i followed it was a small place low ceilings sprayed with plaster cottage cheese and starred with glitter the walls and carpet were beige there was little furniture and what there was looked rented a wall of glass offering a panoramic view of santa monica bay saved it from being a cell there was no artwork on the walls except for a single framed wrestling poster from hungary a tiny convenience kitchen was off on one side a foyer to the other athletic equipment filled a good portion of the living room snow skis and boots a pair of waxed wooden oars several sets of tennis rackets running shoes a mountaineers backpack a football a basketball a bow and quiver of arrows a beige painted brick mantel was topped by a dozen trophies youre an active boy tim what the hell do you want the yellow brown eyes moved around like pachinko balls wheres the little girl melody quinn i dont know what youre talking about put that thing away you know damn well where she is you and your fellow murderers abducted her three days ago because shes a witness to your dirty work have you killed her too im no killer i dont know any kid named quinn youre crazy no killer jeffrey saxon might not agree his mouth dropped open then shut abruptly you left a trail tim pretty arrogant to think no one would find it who the hell are you anyway im who i said i was a better question is who are you a rich boy who cant seem to stay out of trouble a guy who enjoys snapping twigs at hunchbacks and waiting for the tears or just an amateur actor whose best bit is an impression of jack the ripper dont try to pin that on me he rolled his hands into fists hands up i waved the gun he obeyed very slowly straightening his thick brown arms and lifting them above his head it drew my attention upward and away from his feet that enabled him to make his move the kick came at me like a boomerang catching the underside of my wrist and numbing the fingers the gun flew from my grasp and landed on the carpet with a thud we both leaped for it and ended in a tangle on the floor punching kicking gouging i was oblivious to pain and seething with fury i wanted to destroy him he was an iron man it was like fighting an outboard motor i clawed at his abdomen but couldnt find an inch of extra flesh i elbowed him in the ribs it knocked him backward but he rebounded as if on springs and landed a punch to the jaw that threw me off balance long enough for him to get me in a headlock then hold me skillfully at bay so that my arms were ineffective he grunted and increased the pressure my head felt ready to burst my vision blurred i struck at him helplessly with a strange kind of delicacy he danced out of reach squeezing me tighter then he started pulling my head back a little more and i knew my neck would snap i experienced a sudden kinship with jeffrey saxon drew upon a reserve of strength and brought my heel down hard on his instep he cried out and reflexively let go then tried to renew the lock but it was too late i landed a kick that snapped his head to the side and followed it with a series of rapid straight arm punches to the lower belly when he doubled over i chopped down on the place where his head joined his neck he sank to his knees but i didnt take any chances he was strong and skilled another kick to the face now he was down i placed one foot under the bridge of his nose one quick forward motion and splinters of bone would lobotomize him it turned out to be an unnecessary precaution he was out i found a coil of thick nylon rope in the mountaineers pack and trussed him as he lay on his abdomen feet drawn up behind him bound and secured to another piece of rope that similarly raised his arms i checked the knots drew them tight and dragged him clear of any weapon i retrieved the kept it in one hand went into his kitchen and soaked a towel in cold water when several minutes of slapping him with the towel elicited no more than a half conscious groan i made another trip to the kitchen pulled a dutch oven out of a dish drainer filled it with water and dumped the contents on his head that brought him around oh jesus he moaned he tried those first struggles that all prisoners attempt gnashed his teeth finally realized his predicament and sank back down gasping i prodded the back of one leg with the muzzle of the you like sports tim thats fortunate because theyll let you exercise in prison without exercise the time can go very slowly but im going to ask you questions and if you dont give me satisfactory answers im going to maim you bit by bit first ill shoot you right here i pressed cold steel into warm flesh after that your leg might be good for getting you on the john then ill do the same to the other leg from there to fingers wrists elbows youll do your time as a vegetable tim i listened to myself talk hearing a stranger to this day i dont know if i would have followed through on the threat i never had to find out what do you want his speech came out in spurts constricted with fear and hampered by the uncomfortable position wheres melody quinn at la casa where at la casa the storage rooms near the forest those cinder block buildings the ones you avoided discussing when you gave me the tour uh huh yes which one there were four the last one furthest from the front a spreading stain darkened the carpet at my feet hed wet himself jesus he said lets keep going tim youre doing fine he nodded seemingly eager for praise is she still alive yes as far as i know cousin will doctor towle wanted to keep her alive gus and the judge agreed i dont know for how long what about her mother he closed his eyes and said nothing talk tim or your leg goes shes dead the guy they sent to get the kid and her did it they buried her in the meadow i remembered the stretch of field at the north side of la casa were planning to plant a vegetable garden this summer hed told me who is he some crazy guy a gimp kind of paralyzed on one side gus called him earl it wasnt the name i expected but the description was right whyd he do it leave as few loose ends as possible on mccaffreys orders he was silent i exerted pressure on the gun his thigh quivered yeah on his orders earl doesnt operate on his own where is this earl character now more hesitation without thinking i flicked the tip of the over his kneecap his eyes widened with surprise and hurt tears ran out of them oh god dont get religious just talk hes gone dead gus had halstead rip him off after they buried the woman he was filling the grave and halstead hit him with the shovel pushed him in with her and covered them both with dirt he and gus were laughing about it later halstead said when he hit earl on the head it gave off a hollow sound they used to talk like that behind the guys back call him the gimp damaged goods mean guy that halstead yeah he is krugers visage brightened eager to please hes after you too you were snooping around gus didnt know how much the kid told you im tipping you off man watch your thanks pal but halsteads no threat anymore to anyone he looked up at me i answered the unspoken question with a quick nod jesus he said broken i didnt give him time to reflect whyd you kill handler and gutierrez i told you i didnt that was halstead and earl gus told em to make it look like a sex thing halstead told me later earl was a natural for the job carved em up like he enjoyed it really went to town on the teacher halstead held her and earl used the knife two men maybe three melody had said you were there too tim no yeah i i drove them there with the headlights out it was a dark night no moon no stars i circled the parking lot then figured i might get noticed so i drove around in the palisades and came back they still werent through i remember wondering what was taking them so long i left again drove around some more came back and they were just coming out they wore black like demons i could see the blood even against the black they smelled of blood it was all them dark like the clothing but a different texture you know shiny wet dark men two maybe three he stopped thats not the end of the story tim thats it they undressed in the car stuffed the knife in a duffel bag we burned it in one of the canyons the clothes bag everything dumped whatever was left off the malibu pier he paused again out of breath i didnt kill anybody did they say anything in the car halstead was stone silent it bothered me how freaked out he looked because hes a mean one that story about getting a knife pulled on him by a kid is bullshit he was kicked out of manual arts for beating up a couple of students pretty badly before that he was booted out of the marines he loved violence but whatever happened in that apartment got to him he was silent man how about earl earl was different like he dug it you know he was licking his lips and rocking back and forth like an autistic kid jabbering saying sonofabitch over and over weird crazy finally halstead told him to shut the fuck up and he yelled something back in spanish the guy spoke a lot in spanish halstead yelled back and i thought the two of them were going to tear each other up right there it was like driving around with two caged beasts i calmed them down used guss name that always worked for earl i couldnt wait to get away from them that night prototypical psychopaths both of them save the scholarly stuff and tell me how you killed bruno he looked at me with renewed fear you know everything dont you what i dont youre going to fill in i waved the gun in the air bruno we they did that the night after doing the doctor and the teacher halstead didnt want earl along but gus insisted said two men on the job was better i had the feeling he played them off against each other i wasnt there at all halstead drove and did the killing he used a baseball bat from the athletic supplies bin i was there when he came back and told gus about it they found the salesman eating dinner beat him to death right there at the table earl ate the rest of the meal two murders pinned on two dead men very neat it stunk and i told him so thats the way it was im not saying im totally innocent i knew what they were going to do when i drove them to the shrinks place i gave them the key but i didnt do any of the killing howd you get the key cousin will gave it to me i dont know where he got it all right weve talked about who now tell me why all the butchery i assumed you knew dont assume a goddam thing okay okay its the brigade its a cover for child molesters the shrink and the girl found out and they were blackmailing him stupid of them to think they could get away with it i remembered the pictures milod shown me that first day theyd paid far too high a price for their stupidity i chased the bloody images from my mind and returned to kruger are all the gentlemen perverts no only a quarter the rest are straight arrows it makes it easier to conceal sneaking the perverts in among them and the kids never talk not until we pick the ones that the per vs take home with care mostly those who cant talk back retarded or they dont know english severely cp gus likes orphans because they dont have family ties no one looks out for them was rodney one of the chosen ones uh huh did his fear of the doctor have something to do with that yeah one of the weirdos got a little rough with him a surgeon gus warns them to go easy he doesnt want the kids actually hurt spoiled merchandise isnt worth as much but it doesnt always work out those guys arent normal you know i know anger and disgust made it hard to see straight kicking his head in would have been prim ally satisfying but it was a pleasure i was going to have to deny myself im not one of them he was insisting sounding almost as if hed convinced himself i think its disgusting actually i bent down and grabbed him by the throat you went along with it asshole his face purpled the butterscotch eyes bulging i let go of his head it dropped to the floor he landed on his nose and it started to bleed he writhed in confinement dont say it you were just following orders you dont understand he sobbed real tears mixed with the mustache of blood on his upper lip creating a momentary illusion of harelip but for his degree in drama i might have been impressed gus took me in when the rest of them my so called friends and family everyone blackballed me for the saxon thing you can think what you want but that wasnt murder it was an accident saxon was no innocent victim he wanted to kill me thats the truth hes in no position to state his case shit not one believed me except gus he knew what it could be like at that place they all thought i was a washout shame of the family and all that crap he gave me responsibility and i lived up to his expectations i showed my stuff showed you dont need a degree everything was perfect i ran la casa as smooth as youre a terrific storm trooper tim right now i want answers ask he said weakly how long has the brigade been a cover for child molesters from the beginning just like in mexico just like down there to hear him tell it the police knew all about it all he had to do was grease a few palms they let him bring in rich businessmen from acapulco japanese lots of arabs to play with the kids the place was called father augustines christian home whatever that is in spanish it went good for a long time until a new police commissioner some religious nut took over and didnt like it gus claims the guy ripped him off for thousands in payoff then double crossed him and shut the place down anyway he moved up here and set up camp brought crazy earl with him earl was his boy in mexico yup i figure he did the shit work followed gus like a lap dog the guy spoke spanish like a beaner i mean the accent was fine but what he said was gibberish were talking brain damage man a robot with the screws loose mccaffrey had him killed anyway kruger gave the closest approximation to a shrug the ropes would allow you have to know gus hes cold loves power get in his way and youre done those suckers didnt have a chance how did he get set up so fast in la connections cousin willie he hesitated i prodded him with the him judge hayden some others one seemed to lead to another each one knew at least one other closet sicko amazing how many of those guys there are cousin will was a surprise to me cause i knew him really well always seemed such a priss holier than thou my folks held him up as an example to follow fine upstanding cousin doctor he laughed hoarsely and the guys a kiddy boffer more laughter though i cant say i actually saw him take a kid home i set up the schedules and i never set him up with anything all i know he did was patch injured kids up whenever we called still he must be as sick as the rest why else would he be kissing up to gus i ignored the question and asked one of my own how long was the blackmail going on a few months like i told you we screened the kids to make sure they wouldnt talk one time we blew it there was this one boy an orphan just perfect everyone thought he was mute jesus he never talked to us we had speech and hearing tests the government pays for all of that and everything came back no speech we were sure and we were wrong the kid talked all right he told the teacher plenty she freaked out and reported it to cousin will he was the kids pediatrician she didnt know he was involved in it himself he told gus and gus had him killed gary nemeth then what i do we have to talk about it we goddamn as hell do how did it happen they ran him down with a truck they took him out of bed in the middle of the night must have been close to midnight nothings out there at that hour put him on the road walking in his pajamas i remember the pajamas yellow with baseballs and mitts all over i i could have tried to stop it but it wouldnt have made a difference the kid knew he had to go simple as that they would have done it later and probably me too it was wrong to do that to a little kid coldblooded i started to say something gus squeezed my arm told me to shut up i wanted to scream the kid was walking on the road all alone half asleep like he was dreaming i kept quiet halstead got into the truck drove it a ways down the road i could hear him revving it up from around the bend he came back speeding headlights on high beam hit the kid from behind he never knew what happened he was half asleep he stopped talking panting and closed his eyes gus talked about doing the teacher right then and there but he decided to wait see if shed told anyone else he had halstead follow her he staked out her place she wasnt there just her roommate halstead wanted to kidnap her beat it out of her see if she knew anything then he saw the teacher come back with some guy it was handler to pick up her stuff like she was moving in with him halstead reported it back to gus now it was getting complicated they kept watching the two of them and finally saw them meet with bruno we knew bruno hed volunteered at la casa seemed like a great guy very outgoing the kids loved him it was clear at that point that hed been a spy now it was three mouths that had to be closed the calls came a few days later it was bruno disguising his voice but we knew it was him saying he had tapes of the nemeth kid telling all he even played a few seconds over the phone they were amateurs they didnt know gus had them from day one right in the crosshairs it was pathetic pathetic was the word for the scenario take one nice girl elena gutierrez up from the barrio attractive vibrant a little materialistic but warm hearted a gifted teacher depressed about her job burned out she seeks help enters therapy with morton handler md psychopath cum psychiatrist ends up going to bed with handler but continues to tell him her problems one major one being the kid who never talked before whos suddenly opening up and telling her terrible things about strange men doing bad things to him he opens up to miss gutierrez because shes warm and understanding a real talent for drawing them out raquel ochoa had said a talent for working with the ones who didnt respond to anyone else a talent that cost elena her life because what was human tragedy to her smelled profitable to morton handler nasty things in high places what could be juicier of course handler thinks these things but he keeps them to himself after all maybe the kid is making it all up maybe elena is overreacting you know women especially latin women so he tells her to keep listening emphasizes what a good job shes doing what a source of support she is for the child bides his time shouldnt i report this to someone she asks him wait dear be cautious until you know more but the child is crying out for help the bad men are still coming for him elena takes it upon herself to call garys doctor and thus signs his death warrant when elena hears of the child death she suspects the awful truth she falls apart handler shoves tranquilizers down her throat calms her down all the while his psychopathic mind is going click click click because now he knows theres money to be made enter maurice bruno fellow psychopath former patient new buddy a real smoothie handler recruits him and offers him a cut of the yield if he infiltrates the gentlemans brigade and finds out as much as he can names places dates elena wants to call the police handler quiets her down with more pills and more talk the police are ineffectual my darling they wont do anything about it i know from experience slowly gradually he gets her to go along with the blackmail scheme this is the real way to punish them he assures her hit them where it hurts she listens so unsure so confused something seems so wrong about profiting from the death of a helpless little boy but then again nothing will bring him back and morton seems to know what hes talking about hes very persuasive and besides theres that datsun zx shes always wanted and those outfits she saw last week at neiman marcus she could never afford them on what the damned school pays her and who the hell ever did anything for her anyway look out for number one morton always says and maybe hes got a point there earl and halstead looked for the tapes kruger was saying after they tied them up they tortured them to get them to tell where they kept them but neither of them talked halstead complained to gus that he could have gotten it out of them but earl went to work too fast with the knife handler passed out when he cut his throat the girl freaked out totally screaming they had to jam something in her mouth she choked then earl finished her played with her but you finally found the tapes didnt you timmy yes shed kept them at her mothers i got them from her junkie brother used smack as a bribe tell me more thats it they tried to put the squeeze on gus he paid them once or twice big amounts cause i saw large rolls of bills but it was just to give them false confidence they never had a chance from the start we never got the money back but i dont think it mattered it was a drop in the bucket besides money doesnt seem to turn gus on he lives simply eats cheap theres big bucks rolling in every day from the government state and federal private donations not to mention the thousands the per vs pay him for their jollies he stashes some away but ive never seen him do anything extravagant its power hes after not bread where are the tapes i gave them to gus come on i gave them to him he sent me on an errand and i delivered thats a strong looking knee pity to

cooperating can buy me out youre not getting out accept it but at least i added you wont end up fertilizing mccaffreys vegetable patch he considered that it must have been hard to count his blessings with the ropes biting into his wrists and ankles listen he said ive helped you help me make a deal ill cooperate i didnt kill anyone the power he attributed to me was fictitious i used it anyway ill

there i dont give her more than a day will put gus off but it wont be for long shell have an accident theyll never find the body its just a matter of time gus is sure she saw too much tell me what i need to get her out of there safely he looked away i lied about where she is its not the furthest building its the one just before it with the blue door metal door theres a key in the pocket of my tan pants hanging in the closet in my room i left him fished it out and came back dangling the key youre batting a thousand tim im being straight with you just help me is anyone with her no theres no need

theres a single skylight window they keep open close it anyone inside suffocates in forty eight hours could will towle get into la casa without arousing suspicion sure like i told you hes on twenty four hour call for when the gentlemen get too rough on the kids most of the time its nothing serious scrapes lacerations sometimes the kids freak out he gives them valium or mellaril or a quick dose of thorazine yeah he could show up any time good youre going to call him tim youre going to tell him he needs to make just such an emergency call i want him entering la casa a half hour after dark lets say seven thirty make sure hes on time and alone make it sound convincing i could be more convincing if i could move around a little bit work with what youve got i have faith in you use your dramatic training you were pretty good as bill roberts howd you kn i didnt now i do it was an educated guess youre a trained actor you were a natural for the part did your role include killing hickle too ancient history he said yeah i made the call setting it up in your office was haydens idea of a joke hes a mean little mother sick sense of humor but like i told you before i didnt kill anybody for the hickle thing i wasnt even there that was all hayden and cousin will they and gus decided to shut him up same old story i guess hickle was a member of the brigade one of the originals but he free lanced with the kids at his wifes school i remember after he got busted the three of them were talking about it gus was ranting damned stupid shithead he was yelling i furnish that fool with enough hairless pussy to keep him smiling for the rest of his life and he goes and does a dumbshit thing like this the way i figured it hickled always been regarded as weak and stupid easily influenced they bet that once he started confessing the school stuff hed open his yap and bring it all down around them they had to put him away the way they did it was for hayden to call him and tell him he had good news hickled asked hayden to pull strings downtown with the da which just goes to show you how stupid he was i mean at that time hickle was page one just knowing him was the kiss of death but he called hayden asked him anyway hayden faked it like he was going to try to help couple days later he called him said yeah there was good news he could help they met at haydens house very hush hush no one around from what i gather will slipped something in his tea the guy didnt drink booze something you could time precisely and that wore off so traces were hard to find unless you were looking for something specifically will fixed the dosage hes good at that when hickle was out they moved him to your place hayden picked the lock hes good with his hands does magic shows for the kids at la casa dresses up like a clown blimbo the clown and does magic tricks forget magic go on about hickle thats it they got him up there faked the suicide i dont know who pulled the trigger i wasnt there the only reason i know anything about it is i did the bill roberts bit and a few days later gus told me what it was all about he was in one of those dark moods when he talks like a megalomaniac dont think your cousin the doctor is all that noble my boy he was saying i can fry his ass and the asses of lots of noble men with one phone call he gets that way anti rich after he thinks back to how he was poor and all us rich folk mistreated him that night after they killed hickle we were sitting in his office he was drinking gin and he started to reminisce about how he used to work for mr hickle hickles father from the time he was a little kid he was an orphan and some agency basically sold him to the hickles like a slave he said old hickle had been a monster vicious temper liked to kick the help around he told me how he took it kept his eyes open learned all the nasty family secrets like stuarts kinks other stuff saved it all up and used it to get off brindamoor to get the job at jedson i remember him smiling at me half drunk looking crazy i learned early he said that knowledge is power then he talked about earl how the guy was damaged goods but would do anything for him hed eat my shit and call it caviar he said thats power kruger had arched his back picking his head up stiff necked as he talked now exhausted he sank back down i guess he said hes getting back at all of us he lay in the ochre stain of dried urine pitiful anything else you want to tell me tim i cant think of anything you ask ill tell i saw a tension travel up and down his bound limbs like a handcar on a twisted track and kept my distance there was a phone on the floor several feet away i brought it near stayed away from his arms and laid the speaker near his mouth holding the gun to his brow i punched in towles office number and stepped back make it good he did i would have been convinced i hoped towle was he signaled me the conversation was through by moving his eyes back and forth i hung up and had him make a second call to the security desk at la casa to set up the doctors visit how was that he asked when he was through rave review oddly enough that seemed to please him tell me tim how are your sinuses the question didnt throw him great he blurted out im never sick he said it with the bravado of the habitual athlete who believes exercise and firm muscles are guarantees of immortality good then this shouldnt bother you i crammed a towel into his mouth while he made enraged muffled noises through the terrycloth carefully i dragged him to the bedroom emptied the closet of anything that resembled a tool or weapon and shoved him inside molding him to the confines of the tiny space if i get out of la casa with the kid and myself in good shape ill tell the police where to find you if i dont youll probably suffocate anything else you want to tell me a shake of the head beseeching eyes i closed the door and moved a heavy dresser in front of it i replaced the gun in my waistband closed all the windows in the apartment drew the bedroom curtains and shut the bedroom door blocking it with two chairs stood on end i cut his phone line with a kitchen knife drew the drapes so that the view of the ocean was erased and gave the place a final once over satisfied i walked out the door slamming it tight the seville was running but shakily as a result of the grand prix with halstead it was also too conspicuous for my purposes i left it in a lot in westwood village walked two blocks to a budget rent a car and picked up a dark brown japanese compact one of those square little boxes of molded plastic papered with an allegedly metal shell it took fifteen minutes to putt putt through the traffic from one end of the village to the other i pulled into the bullocks garage locked the gun in the glove compartment locked the car and went shopping i bought a pair of jeans thick socks crepe soled shoes navy blue turtleneck and a windbreaker of the same dark hue everything in the store was tagged with plastic alarm clips and it took the salesgirl several minutes to liberate the garments after shed taken my money wonderful world i murmured you think this is bad we have the expensive stuff leather furs under lock and key otherwise they just waltz right out with it we shared righteous sighs and after being informed i was likely to be under surveillance i decided not to change in the stores dressing room it was just past six and dark by the time i was back on the street time enough to grab a steak sandwich greek salad vanilla ice cream and lots of black coffee and watch the starless sky from the vantage point of a front table in a mom and pop eatery on west pico at six thirty i paid the tab and went into the restaurants mens room to change while slipping into my new duds i noticed a piece of folded paper on the floor i picked it up it was the copy of the lilah towle accident story given to me by margaret dopplemeier i tried to read it again with not much greater success i was able to make out something about the coast guard and high tides but that was it i put it back in the jacket pocket straightened up and got ready to head for malibu there was a pay phone at the back of the cafe and i used it to call the west la station i thought of leaving a convoluted message for milo then thought better of it and asked for delano hardy after being kept waiting for five minutes i was finally told he was out on a call i left the convoluted message for him paid the check and headed for malibu it was slow going but id constructed my schedule with that in mind i reached rambla pacifica just before seven and the county sign announcing la casa de los ninos at ten after the sky was empty and dark like a drop down an endless well a coyote howled from a distant gully nightbirds and bats flittered and squeaked i switched off my headlights and navigated the next mile and a half by sense of touch it wasnt all that difficult but the little car resonated at every crack and bump in the road and transmitted the shock waves directly through my skeletal system i came to a stop a half mile before the la casa turnoff it was seven fifteen there were no other vehicles on the road praying it stayed that way i swung the car perpendicular to the road and blocked both lanes rear wheels facing the ravine that bordered the highway front tires nosing the thick brush to the west i sat in the darkened compartment gun in hand waiting at twenty three after seven i heard the sound of an approaching engine a minute later the lincolns square headlights came into view a quarter mile up the road i jumped out of the car ran for cover in the brush and crouched holding my breath he saw the empty car late and had to screech to a stop he left his motor running the lights on and walked into the beam cursing the white hair gleamed silver he wore a charcoal double breasted blazer over a white open necked shirt along with black flannel pants and black and white golf shoes with tassels not a crease not a wrinkle he ran a hand alongside the flank of the little car touched the hood grunted and leaned through the open drivers door it was then that i sprang silently on crepe and put the gun in the small of his back as a matter of taste and principle i hate firearms my father loved them collected them first there were the lugers he brought home as world war ii mementos then the deer rifles the shotguns automatic pistols picked up in pawn shops an old rusted colt nasty looking italian pistols with long snouts and engraved butts blue steel s lovingly polished and displayed in the den behind the glass of a cherrywood case most of them loaded the old man toying with them while watching tv calling me over to show off the details of construction the niceties of ornamentation talk of chamber velocity core bore muzzle grip the smell of machine oil the odor of burnt matches that permeated his hands as a small child id have nightmares of the guns leaving their perches like pets slipping out of their cages taking on instincts of their own barking and snarling one time he had a fight with my mother a loud and nasty one in anger he went to the case and snatched at the first thing he put his hands on a luger teutonically efficient he pointed it at her i could see it now she screaming harry he realizing what he was doing horrified dropping the gun as if it were a venomous sea creature reaching out to her stuttering apologies he never did it again but the memory changed him them and me five years old standing blanket in hand half hidden by the door watching since then ive hated guns but at that moment i loved the feel of the as it dented towles blazer get in the car i whispered sit behind the wheel and dont move or ill blow your guts out he obeyed quickly i ran to the passenger side and in beside him you he said start the engine i put the gun in his side rougher than i had to be the little car coughed to life pull it to the side of the road so that the drivers door is right up against that rock then turn off the engine and throw the key out the window he did as he was told the noble profile steady i got out and ordered him to do likewise the way id had him park the exit from the drivers side was blocked by forty feet of granite he slid out the passengers side and stood motionless and stoic at the edge of the empty road hands up he gave me a superior look and complied this is outrageous he said use one hand to remove your car keys toss them gently on the ground over there i pointed to a spot fifteen feet away keeping the gun trained on him i scooped them up walk to your car get in on the drivers side put both hands on the wheel where i can see them i followed him to the lincoln i got in the back right behind him and placed the tip of the gun in the hollow at the base of his skull you know your anatomy i said softly one bullet to the medulla oblongata and the lights go out forever he said nothing youve done a find job of mucking up your life and the lives of plenty of others now its coming down on you what im offering you is a chance for partial redemption save a life for once instead of destroying it ive saved many lived in my day im a physician i know youre a saintly healer where were you when it came to saving gary nemeth a dry croaking sound came from deep inside of him but he maintained his composure you know everything i suppose just about cousin tim can be talkative when the circumstances are right i gave him a few examples of what i knew he was unmoved stoic hands melded to the wheel a white haired mannikin set up for display you knew my name before we met i said from the hickle thing when i called you invited me to the office to see how much melody had told me it didnt make sense to me then a busy pediatrician taking the time to sit and chat face to face anything we spoke about could have been discussed over the phone you wanted to sound me out then you tried to block me you had a reputation as a persistent young man he said things were piling up things dont you mean bodies theres no need to be melodramatic he talked like a disneyland android flat without inflection devoid of self doubt im not trying to be its just that multiple murder still gets to me the nemeth boy handler elena gutierrez morry bruno now bonita quinn and good old ronnie lee at the mention of the last name he gave a small but noticeable start ronnie lees death bother you in particular im not familiar with that name thats all ronnie lee quinn bonitas ex melodys father rl a blond fellow tall crazy looking with a bad left side hemiparesis with mccaffreys southern accent it may have sounded like he was calling him earl ah he said pleased that things made sense once again earl disgusting fellow unwashed i remember meeting him once or twice piss poor protoplasm right if you will he was one of mccaffreys bad guys from mexico brought back to do a dirty job or two probably wanted to see his kid so mccaffrey found her and bonita for him then it dawned on him how she could fit in she was a bright one bonita wasnt she probably thought you were santa claus when you got her the job managing minassians building she was appreciative said towle you were doing her a big favor you set her up so you could have access to handlers apartment shes the manager she gets a master key then the next time shes in the office for melodys checkup she loses her purse its easy to do the ladys a scatterbrain she didnt have it together thats what your office girl told me always losing things meanwhile you lift the key and mccaffreys monsters can get in whenever they want look for tapes do a little smashing and hacking no sweat off poor bonitas back except when she becomes expendable and ends up as food for next seasons zucchini crop a dull woman more piss poor protoplasm it wasnt supposed to happen that way that wasnt in the plan you know how it is the best laid plans and all that youre a sarcastic young man i hope you arent that way with your patients ronnie lee finishes off bonita he may have done it because mccaffrey told him to or perhaps it was just settling an old score but now mccaffrey has to get rid of ronnie lee too because fiend that he is even he may balk at watching his own daughter die youre very bright alex he said but the sarcasm really is an unattractive trait thanks for the advice i know youre an expert on bedside manner as a matter of fact i am i pride myself on it obtain early rapport with the child and family no matter how disparate your background may be from theirs thats the first step in delivering good care its what i instruct the first year students when i proctor the pediatric section of introduction to clinical medicine fascinating the students give me excellent ratings on my teaching im an excellent teacher i exerted forward pressure with the his silver hair parted but he didnt flinch i smelled his hair tonic cloves and lime start the car and pull it to the side of the road just behind that giant eucalyptus the lincoln rumbled and rolled then stopped turn off the engine dont be rude he said theres no need to try to intimidate me turn it off will doctor towle doctor towle is it necessary to keep that thing at the back of my head ill ask the questions it seems needless superfluous this isnt some cheap western movie its worse the blood is real and nobody gets up and walks away when the smoke clears more melodrama mellow drama strange phrase stop playing around i said angrily playing are we playing i thought only children played jump rope hopscotch his voice rose in pitch grownups play too i said nasty games games games help the child maintain ego integrity i read that somewhere erikson piaget either kruger wasnt the only actor in the family or something was happening that i hadnt been prepared for anna freud i whispered yes anna fine woman would have loved to meet her but both of us so busy pity the ego must maintain integrity at all costs he was silent for a minute then these seats need cleaning i see spots on the leather they make a good leather cleaner now i saw it at the car wash melody quinn i said trying to reel him back in we need to save her melody pretty girl a pretty girl is like a melody pretty little child almost familiar i talked to him but he kept fading away minute by minute he regressed the rambling growing progressively more incoherent and out of context so that at his worst he was emitting word salad he seemed to be suffering the aristocratic face crowded with pain every few minutes he repeated the phrase the ego must maintain integrity as if it was a catechism i needed him to get into la casa but in his present state he was useless i started to panic his hands remained on the steering wheel but they trembled pills he said where pocket go ahead i said not without suspicion reach in and get them the pills and nothing else dont take too many no two pills recommended dosage never more nevermore quoth the raven nevermore get them i kept the gun trained on him he lowered one hand and drew out a vial not unlike the one that had held melodys ritalin carefully he shook out two white tablets closed the vial and put it down water he asked childlike take them dry i shall nuisance he swallowed the pills kruger had been right he was good at adjusting dosages within twelve minutes on my watch he was looking and sounding much better i thought of the strain he underwent each day maintaining himself in the public eye no doubt talking about the murders had hastened the deterioration silly of me to miss the afternoon dose never forget i observed him with morbid fascination watching the changes in his speech and behavior as the psychoactive chemicals took hold of his central nervous system making note of the gradually increasing attention span the diminishing non sequiturs the restoration of adult conversational patterns it was like peering into a microscope and watching a primitive organism mitose into something far more complex when the drug was still in its initial stage he said ive done many bad things gus had me do bad things very wrong for a man of my stature for someone of my breeding i let it pass eventually he was lucid alert seemingly undamaged what is it thorazine i asked him a variant ive managed my own pharmacologic care for some time now tried a number of the phenothiazines thorizine was good but it made me too drowsy couldnt have that while conducting physicals wouldnt want to drop a baby no nothing like that dreadful drop an infant this is a new agent far superior to the others experimental sent to me by the manufacturer just write away for samples use md after the name no need to justify or explain theyre more than happy to oblige i have a healthy supply must take the afternoon dose though or everything gets confused thats what happened isnt it yes how long does it take to kick in in a man my size twenty to twenty five minutes remarkable isnt it pop down the hatch wait and the picture tube regains clarity life is so much more bearable things hurt so much less even now i feel it working like muddy waters turning crystalline where were we we were talking about the nasty games mccaffreys perverts play with little children im not one of those he said quickly i know but you helped those perverts molest hundreds of children gave time and money to mccaffrey set up handler and gutierrez and hickle you overdosed melody quinn to keep her mouth shut why its all over isnt it he asked sounding relieved yes theyll take away my license to practice medicine definitely dont you think thats best i suppose so he said reluctantly i still feel theres plenty left in me plenty of good work to be done youll have your chance i reassured him realizing that the pills were less than perfect theyll send you some place for the rest of your life where youll experience little in the way of stress no paperwork no billing none of the hassles of medical practice no gus mccaffrey telling you what to do how to run your life just you and youll look and feel fine because theyll let you continue to take your pills and help other people people in need of help youre a healer youll be able to help them ill be able to help he repeated absolutely one human being to another unencumbered yes i have a good bedside manner when im well when im not well things gets confused and things hurt even ideas hurt thoughts can be painful im not at my best when that happens but when im functioning well i cant be beat for helping people i know that doctor i know your reputation mccaffrey had spoken to me of an innate drive toward altruism i knew whose buttons hed been pushing with that one im beholden to gus he said not due to any unusual sexual proclivity thats his link with the others with stuart and eddy since wed been boys id known of their strange ways we all grew up in an isolated place a strange place we were cultivated like orchids private lessons for this and that having to look appropriate act appropriately sometimes i wonder if that refined atmosphere didnt do us more harm than good look how we turned out i with my spells i know there are labels for it these days but i prefer to avoid them stuart and eddy with their strange sexual habits they started fooling with each other one summer when we were nine or ten then with other children smaller children much smaller i didnt think much of it except to know that i wasnt interested in it the way we were raised right or wrong didnt seem as relevant as appropriate and inappropriate thats not appropriate willie father would say i imagine had stuart or eddys fathers caught them with the little ones that would have been their description of the entire affair inappropriate like using the wrong fork at dinner his description of coming of age on brindamoor was strikingly like the one van der graaf had given me at that moment he seemed akin to the fancy goldfish in the tank at oomasa beautiful showy cultivated by mutation and centuries of inbreeding raised in a protected environment but ultimately stunted and un adaptable to the realities of life in that sense the sexual one he said i was quite normal i married fathered a child a son i performed quite adequately stuart and eddy continued as my chums going about their perverted ways it was live and let live they never mentioned my spells i let them be stuart was really a fine fellow not overly bright but well meaning it was a pity he had to except for that one kink he was a good boy eddy was is different a sense of humor but a mean one a nasty streak runs through him he is habitually caustic and sarcastic thats why im sensitive to that type of thing perhaps its because of his size your tie to mccaffrey i prompted small men often get that way youre i cant see you now but i recall you as being medium sized is that correct im five eleven i said wearily thats medium sized ive always been large father was large its just as mendel predicted long peas short peas fascinating field genetics isnt it doctor ive wondered about the genetic impact on many traits intellect for example the liberal dogma would have us believe that environment makes the largest contribution to intelligence its an egalitarian premise but reality doesnt bear it out long peas short peas smart parents smart children stupid parents stupid children i myself am a heterozygote father was brilliant mother was an irish beauty but very simple she lived in a world where that combination served to create the perfect hostess fathers showpiece your tie to mccaffrey i said sharply my tie oh nothing more serious than life and death he laughed it was the first time id heard his laugh and i hoped it would be the last it was a vacant discordant note a blatant musical error screaming out in the middle of a symphony i lived with lilah and willie junior on the third floor of the jedson dormitory stuart and eddy shared a room on the first as a married student i was given larger quarters really a nice little apartment when you got down to it two bedrooms bath living room small kitchen but no library no study so i did my reading at the kitchen table lilah had made it a cheerful place bunting trim curtains womanly types of things willie junior was a little over two at the time i remember it was my senior year id been having trouble with some of the premedical courses physics organic chemistry ive never been a brilliant person however if i apply myself and keep my attention span steady i can do quite well i desperately wanted to get into medical school on my own merits my father and his father before him were doctors all had been brilliant students the joke behind my back was that id inherited my mothers brains as well as her looks they didnt think i heard but i did i wanted so much to show them that i could succeed on my own merits not because i was adolf towles son the night it happened willie junior had been feeling poorly unable to sleep hed been screaming and crying out lilah was frazzled i ignored her requests for help plunging myself into my studies trying to shut out everything else i had to bring my science grades up it was imperative the more anxious i got the less able i was to pay attention i tried to deal with it by embracing a kind of tunnel vision lilah had always been patient with me but that night she became furious started to come unglued i looked up saw her coming at me her hands she had tiny hands a delicate woman rolled up into fists mouth open i suppose she was screaming eyes full of hatred she seemed to me a bird of prey about to swoop down and pick at my bones i pushed her away with my arm she fell tumbling back hit her head on the corner of a bureau a hideous piece an antique her mother had given her and lay there simply lay there i can see the whole thing clearly now as if it had just happened yesterday lilah lies there motionless i rise out of my chair dreamlike everything is swaying everything is confusing a small shape coming at me from the right like a mouse a rat i swat it away but its not a rat no no its willie junior coming back at me crying for his mother hitting me only dimly aware of his presence i strike out at him again catch him on the side of his head too hard he falls lands lies still unmoving a large bruise masks the side of his face my wife my child dead at my hands i prepare to find my razor cut my wrists be done with it then guss voice is at my back he stands in the doorway huge obese sweaty in work clothes broom in hand the janitor cleaning the dormitories at night i smell him ammonia body odor cleaning fluids hes heard the noise and has come to check he looks at me a long hard look then at the bodies he kneels over them feels for a pulse theyre dead he tells me in a flat voice for a second i think hes smiling and im ready to pounce on him to attempt a third murder then the smile becomes a frown hes thinking sit down he commands me im not used to being or dared around by one of his class but im weak and sick with grief my knees are buckling everythings unraveling i turn away from lilah and willie junior sit put my face in my hands start to cry i begin to grow more confused a spell is coming on everything is starting to hurt i have no pills not like ill have years later when im a doctor now im merely a premedical student powerless hurting gus makes a telephone call minutes later my friends stuart and eddy appear in the room like characters walking onstage in the midst of a dreadful play the three of them talk among themselves sometimes looking at me muttering stuart comes to me first he places a hand on my shoulder we know it was an accident will he says we know it wasnt your fault i start to argue with him but the words stick in my throat the spells make it so hard to talk so painful i shake my head stuart comforts me tells me everything will be all right they will take care of everything he rejoins gus and eddy they wrap the bodies in a blanket tell me not to leave the room at the last moment they decide stuart should stay with me gus and eddy leave with the bodies stuart gives me coffee i cry i cry myself to sleep later that evening they return and tell me the story im to report to the police they rehearse me such good friends i do a fine job they tell me so i feel some sense of relief at that at least there is something im good at play acting thats what a bedside manner is after all give the audience what it clamors for my first audience is made up of the police then an officer of the coast guard a family friend theyve found lilahs car her body is macerated and bloated i neednt identify it if its too much of an ordeal scraps of willie juniors clothing have been found clinging to her hands his body has drifted away the tides explains the officer theyll continue to search i break down and ready myself for the next show the well wishers the press the tides i thought the coast guard something there several months later im accepted at the medical school towle was saying i move to los angeles stuart comes with me though we both know hell never be able to finish eddy goes to law school in los angeles the heads are reunited thats what they called us the three heads of state we go about our new lives there is never a mention of the favor theyve done for me of that night however they are far more open than ever before about their sexual perversions leaving nasty photographs where i can see them not bothering to hide or conceal anything they know im powerless to say a thing even should i find a ten year old in my bed a rotten mutual interdependence now binds us gus has disappeared years later when im a doctor on my way to prominence the bedside manner fully developed he appears at my office after the patients have all gone home further fattened welldressed no longer a janitor now he jokes hes a man of god he shows me the mail order divinity degree and hes come to ask a few favors from me to cash in some old lous is the way he puts it i paid him that evening and ive been paying him in one way or another ever since its time to stop paying i said lets not sacrifice melody quinn to him the child is doomed as things stand i urged gus to put it off her accident told him it was by no means evident that shed seen or heard anything but he wont be delayed much longer whats one more life to a man like that he paused does she really pose a danger to him not really she sat at the window and saw shadows of men one of whom shed recognized as her father she didnt know him but she had a picture on the day i hypnotized her right after the session she went into a spontaneous discussion of him she showed me the picture and a trinket hed given her when she had the night terrors i should have figured it out i thought the hypnosis hadnt evoked anything in her it had it had brought back memories of her father of seeing him lurking outside her window entering handlers place she knew something bad had happened in the apartment she knew her daddy had done something terrible she suppressed it and it came back in her sleep it had started coming together for me when id seen the clue shed left behind when ronnie lee had come by and abducted her and her mother a shrunken head precious until now a symbol of daddy for her to have abandoned it meant shed kissed him off had come to grips with the fact that daddy was a bad man come back not to visit but to hurt perhaps shed watched him manhandle bonita or maybe it was the rough uncaring way hed spoken to her whatever it had been the child had known looking back it seemed so logical but at the time the associations had been remote its ironic towle was saying i prescribed ritalin to control her behavior and it was that same prescription that caused her insomnia that led her to be awake at the wrong time ironic i said now lets go in there and get her out youre going to help me when its over ill see to it that youre cared for properly he didnt say anything simply sat straight in the seat working hard at looking noble are you requesting my help i am doctor request granted i lay on the floor of the lincoln covered by a blanket my gun is pointed at your spine i told him i dont expect any trouble but we havent known each other long enough for trust to be worth much i understand he said im not offended he drove to the la casa access road turned left and steered smoothly and slowly to the chain link barrier he identified himself to the voice on the squawk box and was let in a brief stop at the guardhouse an exchange of pleasantries plenty of doctor sirs from the guard and we were in he drove to the far end of the parking lot park away from the light i whispered the car came to a halt its clear now he said i crawled from under the blanket got out of the car and motioned him to follow we walked up the path side by side counselors passed us in pairs greeted him with deference and moved on i tried to look like his associate la casa was peaceful at night camp songs filtered through the trees a hundred bottles of beer oh susanna childrens voices an off key guitar microphoned adult commands mosquitoes and moths vied for space around mushroom lights imbedded in the foliage at our feet the sweet smell of jasmine and oleander in the air an occasional whiff of brine from the ocean so close but unseen to the right the open gray green expanse of the meadow a pleasant enough graveyard the grove dark as fudge a piney refuge we passed the pool taking care not to slip on the wet cement towle moved like an old warrior heading into his last battle chin up arms at his side marching i kept the within easy reach we made it to the bunkers unnoticed that one i said with the blue door down the ramp a hard twist of the key and we were in the building was divided into two rooms the one in the front was empty except for a single folding chair pushed under an aluminum bridge table the walls were of unpainted block and smelled of mildew the floors were cold slab concrete as was the ceiling a square black wound of skylight marked the ceilings center the only light came from a single unadorned bulb she was in the back on an army cot covered with a coarse olive drab blanket and restrained with leather straps across her ankles and chest her arms were pinioned under the blanket she breathed slowly mouth open sleeping head to one side her pale tear streaked skin translucent in the semidarkness wisps of hair hung loosely around her face tiny vulnerable lost at the foot of the cot was a plastic tray holding an uneaten congealed fried egg limp french fries shriveled brown tipped lettuce and an open wax container of milk untie her i pointed the gun towle bent over her working in the dimness to unfasten the straps what do you have her on valium high dose thorazine on top of that dr towles magic elixir he got the restraints loose and peeled back the blanket she was wearing dirty jeans and a red and white striped t shirt with snoopy on the front he lifted the shirt and palpated her abdomen took her pulse felt her forehead played doctor she looks thin but otherwise healthy he pronounced wrap her back up can you carry her certainly he replied miffed that i could doubt his strength all right then lets go he gathered her up in his arms looking for all the world like the great white father the child let out a sigh a shudder and clung to him keep her totally covered once we get outside i began a half turn a soft musical voice at my back drawled dont move doctor delaware or youll lose your fucking head i stood still put the young one down will take his gun towle looked at me blankly i shrugged he placed melody on the cot gently and covered her i handed him the against the wall with your hands up doctor search him will towle patted me down turn around mccaffrey stood there grinning filling the opening between the two rooms a magnum in one hand a polaroid camera in the other he wore an iridescent lime green jumpsuit decorated with a score of snap pockets and buckles and matching lime patent leather shoes in the dim light his complexion reflected greenly as well tsk tsk willie what mischief are we up to tonight the great physician hung his head and shuffled nervously not feeling loquacious tonight willie thats all right well talk later the colorless eyes narrowed right now theres business to attend to is this your idea of altruism i looked at melodys limp form shut up he snapped to towle remove the childs clothing gus i why just do as i say willie no more gus towle pleaded weve done enough no you idiot we havent done enough at all this smartass here has the potential to cause us you and me lots of trouble i made plans to eliminate him but apparently ill have to do the job myself plans i sneered halsteads rotting in a vacant lot with a spike in his throat he was a humbler like all of your slaves mccaffrey pursed his thick lips im warning you he said thats your specialty isnt it i continued playing for time i saw his massive silhouette shift as he tried to keep me in his sights but the darkness made it difficult as did towles body which had gotten between us as he fidgeted under his masters glare you have a knack for finding bumblers and losers emotional cripples misfits the same knack flies have for locating shit you zero in on their open wounds sink your fangs into them suck them dry how literary he replied in a lilting voice obviously fighting to maintain control we were in close quarters and impulsiveness could prove hazardous her clothes will he said take them all off gus do it you sniveling piece of turd towle raised his arm in front of his face like a child warding off a blow when none was forthcoming he moved toward the child youre a doctor i said a respected physician dont listen to him fast faster than i thought possible mccaffrey stepped forward in the clearing towle had created he slashed with one elephantine sleeve and raked the side of my head with his gun i fell to the floor my face exploding with pain hands protecting myself from further assault blood running between my fingers now you stay there sir and keep your fucking mouth shut towle removed melodys t shirt her chest was concave and white the ribs twin grilles of gray blue shadow now the pants the panties everything why are we doing this gus towle wanted to know to my ears which were far from perfect one being ripped and bloody the other filled with watery echoes his speech sounded slurred i wondered if stress could break through the biochemical barrier hed erected around his damaged mind why mccaffrey laughed youre not used to seeing this type of thing firsthand are you willie youve had a sanitized role up until now enjoying the luxury of distance well no matter ill explain it to you he raised an eyebrow at towle contemptuously looked down at me and laughed again the sound reverberated painfully in my injured skull the blood continued to run down my face my head felt mushy loose on its stalk i began to grow nauseated and dizzy and the floor rose up at me terror gripped me as i wondered if hed hit me hard enough to cause brain damage i knew what a subdural hematoma could do to the fragile gray jelly that made life worth living crazily fighting for strength and clarity i pictured my brain in an anatomists tray pinioned and splayed and tried to localize the site of the injury the gun had smashed against my left side the dominant hemisphere for i am right handed that was bad the dominant side controlled logical processes reasoning analysis deduction the stuff to which id grown addicted over thirty three years i thought about losing all of that of fading into dimness and confusion then remembered two year old willie junior struck down in much the same way hed lost it all which might have been merciful for had he survived the damage would have been great left side right side the tides were going to put on a little stage play willie mccaffrey lectured ill be the producer and director youll be my assistant helping me with the props he swung the camera in an arc the stars of the show will be little melody and our friend doctor alex delaware the name of the play will be death of a shrink subtitled caught in the act a morality play gus the plot is as follows doctor delaware our erstwhile villain is well known as a caring sensitive child psychologist however unbeknownst to his colleagues and his patients his choice of profession did not arise out of any great sense of altruism no doctor delaware has chosen to become a kiddy shrink to be closer to the kiddies to be able to fondle and abuse their genitals in sort a deviate an opportunist the lowest of the low an evil and gravely sick man he paused to look down on me chuckling breathing hard despite the chill he was sweating his glasses sliding low on his nose the top of his kinky head was a halo of moisture i looked at the in towles hand and measured the distance between it and the spot where i lay mccaffrey saw me shook his head and mouthed the word no showing me his teeth with these same depraved motivations in mind doctor delaware applies for membership in the gentlemans brigade he visits la casa we show him around we screen him and our tests reveal him to be unsuitable for inclusion into our honorable fraternity we reject him furious and frustrated at being denied a lifetime supply of hairless pussy and tiny little pricks he simmers he stopped the narration and made loud slurping noises melody stirred in her sleep he simmers he repeated stews in his own juices finally at the height of his sick rage he breaks into la casa one night and roams the grounds until he finds a victim a poor orphan girl defenseless alone in her dormitory because she is sick in bed with the flu the madman loses control rapes her virtually tears her apart the autopsy will show uncommon savagery will takes pictures of the ghastly deed a hideous crime as the child cries out screaming for her life we you and me will happen to be passing by we rush to her aid but it is too late the child has succumbed we take in the carnage before us with horror and disgust delaware discovered rises up against us gun in hand heroically we wrestle him to the ground struggle for the weapon and in the process the murderer is fatally wounded the good guys win and there is peace in the valley amen i said he ignored me not bad eh will gus it wont work towle stepped between us again he knows everything the teacher and the nemeth boy quiet it will work the past is the best predictor of the future we have succeeded before we will continue to triumph gus silence im not asking you im telling you strip her i propped myself on my elbows and spoke through aching swollen jaws struggling to make sense out of what i was saying even as i told it how about another script this ones called the big lie its about a man who thinks hes murdered his wife and child and sells out his entire life to a blackmailer shut up mccaffrey advanced on me towle blocked his way aiming the at the half acre of green clad fat it was a mexican standoff i want to hear what he has to say gus things are confusing me things hurt i want him to explain think i said talking as fast as the pain allowed did you ever check willie juniors body for signs of life no he did he told you your boy was dead that youd killed him but was the body ever found did you ever actually see the body towles face tightened with concentration he was slipping losing his grip on reality digging his nails in fighting to hold on i i dont know willie was dead they told me the tides maybe but think it was a golden opportunity lilahs death wouldnt have brought a charge greater than involuntary manslaughter domestic violence wasnt even taken seriously in those days with the lawyers your family would have hired you might have gotten off with probation but two deaths especially with one a child would have been impossible to brush off he needed you to believe junior was dead to be able to hook you will said mccaffrey threateningly i dont know such a long time think did you hit him hard enough to kill him maybe not use your brain its a good one you remembered before i used to have a good brain he muttered you still do remember you hit little willie on the side of the head what side dont know will its all lies hes trying to poison your mind mccaffrey looked for a way to silence me but towles gun rose and nudged the spot where a normal person would have had a heart what side doctor i demanded im right handed he answered as if discovering the fact for the first time i use my right hand i hit him with my right hand i see it hes coming at me from his bedroom crying for mommy coming from the right throwing himself at me i hit him on his right side the right side the pain in my head turned the act of talking into torture but i bore down yes exactly think what if mccaffrey hoaxed you you didnt kill willie you injured him but he survived what kind of damage what kind of symptoms could be caused by trauma to the right hemisphere in a developing child right hemisphere cerebral damage the right brain controls the left side he recited right brain damage causes left side dysfunction perfect i urged him on a severe blow to the right brain could bring about left side hemiparesis a bad left side earl yes the body was never found because the child never died mccaffrey felt his pulse found one saw you in shock over what youd done and exploited your guilt he wrapped up both bodies with a little help from your buddies lilah was put behind the wheel of the car and dumped off the evergreen bridge mccaffrey took the child probably got him some kind of medical help but not the best because a reputable doctor would have had to report the incident to the police after the funeral he disappeared those were your words he disappeared because he had to he had the child with him he took him to mexico who knows where renamed him changed him from your son into the kind of person someone raised by a monster would turn out to be he made him his robot earl willie junior towles brows knitted ridiculous out of the way will i order it its the truth i said through the pounding in my head tonight before you took your pills you said melody looked vaguely familiar turn carefully dont let him out of your sight and take a good look at her tell me why towle backed away kept the gun on mccaffrey took a short look at melody and then a longer one she looks he said softly like lilah her grandmother i couldnt know of course he couldnt the quinns were poor illiterate the dregs of society piss poor protoplasm his views on the genetic superiority of the upper class would have prevented him from even fantasizing a connection between them and his bloodline now his defenses were down and the insights were hitting his consciousness like drops of acid each point of contact raising psychic wounds his son a murderer a man conditioned to be a night hunting beast dead his daughter in law intellectually limited a helpless pathetic creature dead his granddaughter the child on whom hed plied his trade and medicated into stupor alive but not for long he wants to murder her to tear her apart you heard him the autopsy will show uncommon savagery towle turned on the man in green gus he sobbed now now will said mccaffrey soothingly then he blew towle away with the the bullet entered his abdomen and exited through his back in a fine spray of blood skin and cashmere he slammed backward landing at the side of the cot the report of the big gun echoed through the concrete room a thunderstorm the child awoke and began screaming mccaffrey pointed the gun at her reflexively i threw myself at him and kicked his wrist knocking the gun loose it sailed backward into the front room he howled rabid i kicked him again in the shin his leg felt like a side of beef he backed into the front room wanting the gun i went after him he lunged his bulk rolling i used both hands to hit him in the lower back my fists sank into his softness he barely budged his hand was inches from the magnum i kicked it away then used my foot to smash his ribs with little effect he was too damned big and too damned tall to be able to get a facial punch in i went for his legs and thighs and tripped him he came crashing down a felled redwood taking me with him snarling cursing drooling he rolled on top of me and got his hands around my throat he panted his sour breath on me the lumpy face crimson the fish eyes swallowed by fleshy folds squeezing i fought to get out from under him but couldnt move i experienced the panic of the sudden paralytic he squeezed tighter i pushed up helplessly his face darkened with effort i thought crimson to maroon to red black then a splash of color the kinky hair exploding the blood bright and fresh pouring out of his nose his ears his mouth the eyes opening wide blinking furiously a look of great insult on the grotesque face gargling noises from the jowl wrapped gullet needles and triangles of broken glass raining down upon us his inert carcass a shield from the rain the skylight was an open wound now a face peered down black serious delano hardy something else black the nose of a rifle hold on consultant he said were coming to get you your face looks uglier than mine milo said when hed pulled mccaffrey off of me yeah i said struggling to articulate through a mouth that felt as if id sucked on razor blades but mine will look better in a couple of days he grinned the kid seems okay said hardy from the back room he came out with melody in his arms she was shivering scared but unharmed as the papers say milo helped me to my feet i walked to her and stroked her hair its going to be all right sweetheart funny how cliches seem to find their niche during rough times alex she said she smiled you look funny i squeezed her hand and she closed her eyes sweet dreams in the ambulance milo kicked his shoes off and sat yoga style by the side of my stretcher my hero i said it came out mmm mirrow this ones going to be good for a long time pal free use of the caddy on demand cash loans with no interest gratis therapy in other words i fought to enunciate through swollen jaws business as usual he laughed patted my arm and told me to shut up the ambulance attendant agreed the man may need wires he said he shouldnt talk i started to protest shh said the attendant a half mile later milo looked at me and shook his head you are one lucky turkey friend i got into town an hour and a half ago and got ricks

anything to happen to the kid please shut up sir said the attendant shush said milo gently you did a great job thanks okay dont do it again turkey the ambulance came to a halt at santa monica hospitals emergency room i knew the place because id given a series of lectures to the staff on the psychological aspects of trauma in children thered be no lecture tonight you okay milo asked um hmm okay ill let the white coats take over gotta go and arrest a judge robin took one look at me jaws wired shut eyes blackened and burst into tears she hugged me fussed over me and sat by my side feeding me soup and soda that lasted for a day then she got in touch with her anger and let me have it for being so crazy to put my life on the line i was in no position to defend myself she tried not speaking to me for six hours then relented and things started to get back to normal when i could talk i called raquel ochoa hi she said you sound funny i told her the story keeping it brief because of the pain she said nothing for a moment then softly there were monsters yes the silence between us was uncomfortable youre a man of principle she said finally thank you alex that evening us i dont regret it it got me thinking made me realize i have to go out and find something someone for myself dont settle for less than the best i thanks take care of yourself mend fast ill work on it goodbye goodbye my next call was to ned biondi who rushed over that afternoon and interviewed me until the nurses kicked him out i read his stories for days he had it all down mccaffreys mexico days the hickle murder the gentlemans brigade the suicide of edwin hayden the night he was arrested the judge had shot himself in the mouth while dressing to go the station with milo it seemed fitting in light of what hed done to hickle and biondi didnt miss the chance to wax philosophical i phoned olivia brickerman and asked her to take care of melody two days later she found an older childless couple up in bakersfield people she knew and trusted with lots of patience and five acres for running nearby was a gifted child psychologist a woman id known from graduate school with experience in stress and bereavement to them would be entrusted the task of helping the little girl piece her life together six weeks after the fall of la casa de los ninos robin and i met milo and rick silverman for dinner at a quiet elegant seafood place in bel air my friends amour turned out to be a guy who could have walked out of a cigarette ad six feet tall broad shouldered narrow hipped masculine handsome face overlaid with just a touch of crag head of tight bronze curls matching bristle mustache he wore a tailored black silk suit black and white striped shirt and a black knit tie lucky milo robin whispered as they joined our table next to him milo looked baggier than ever though hed tried to spruce himself up his hair slicked down like that of a kid in church milo made the introductions we ordered drinks and got acquainted rick was quiet and reserved with nervous surgical hands that had to be holding some thing a glass a fork a stirrer he and milo exchanged loving glances once i saw them touch hands for just a second as the evening progressed he opened up and talked about his work about what he liked and didnt like about being a doctor the food came the others had lobster and steak i had to content myself with souffle we chatted the evening went well after the dishes had been cleared away before the pastry cart and the brandy ricks beeper went off he excused himself and went to the phone if you gentlemen dont mind ill make a stop in the ladies room robin patted her mouth with her napkin and rose i followed her sway until she disappeared milo and i looked at each other he picked a piece of fish off his tie hello friend i said hello hes a nice guy rick i like him i want this one to last its hard the way we live you look happy we are different in lots of ways but we also have a lot in common hes getting a porsche he said with a laugh congratulations youre a good lifer now all comes to be who waits i motioned the waiter over and we ordered fresh drinks when they came i said milo theres something ive been wanting to talk to you about about the case he took a long swallow of scotch what about hayden his face grew grave youre my shrink so that this conversation is confidential better than that im your friend okay he sighed ask what i know youre going to ask the suicide it doesnt make sense on two grounds first the kind of guy he was i got the same picture from everyone an arrogant nasty sarcastic little bastard loved himself not a trace of self doubt that kind dont kill themselves they search for ways to shift the blame to others they weasel out of things second youre a pro how could you get so sloppy as to let him do it the story i told internal affairs was that he was a judge i treated him with deference i let him get dressed in his study they bought it tell me about it please he looked around the restaurant the tables nearby were empty rick and robin were still gone he gulped down the rest of his drink i went for him right after i left you must have been after ten by then he lived in one of those huge english tudor palaces in hancock park old money big lawn bentley in the driveway topiary a doorbell out of a karloff flick he answered the door a little wimp of a guy maybe five four strange eyes spooky he was wearing a silk dressing gown holding a brandy in one hand i told him what id come for it didnt faze him he was very proper distant as if what i was there for had nothing to do with him i followed him inside the house lots of family portraits moldings around the ceilings chandeliers i want you to get the flavor of this lord of the manor led me to his study in the back the requisite oak panels wall to wall leather covered books the kind people collect but never read a fireplace with two porcelain greyhounds carved desk blah blah blah i pat him down find a take it its for protection at night officer he tells me you never know wholl come knocking at your door hes laughing alex i swear i couldnt believe it the guys life is crashing down around him hes going to hit the front page as a kiddy diddler and hes laughing i read him his rights go into the spiel he looks bored sits down at his desk like im there for a favor then he starts talking to me laughing in my face how amusing he says that they send you the faggot cop after me in a case like this you of all people should understand he goes on like that for a while smirking implying then coming right out and saying it that were birds of a feather partners in crime perverts im standing there listening to this and getting hotter and hotter he laughs some more and i see thats what he wants to stay in control of the situation so i cool down smile back whistle he starts telling me the things they did to the kids like its supposed to arouse me like were buddies at a stag party my stomach is turning and hes putting us in the same boat as he talks he comes into focus psychological focus its like i can see behind the spooky eyes into his brain and all i see is dark and bad nothing good in there nothing good can come from this guy hes a washout im judging the judge im prophesying meanwhile hes going on about the parties they used to have with the kids how much hes going to miss them he stopped and cleared his throat took my drink and finished it im still looking through him into his future and i know whats going to happen i look around that big room i know the kind of money behind this guy hell get a not guilty by reason theyll cart him off to some country club eventually hell buy his way out and start all over again so i make a decision right there on the spot i walk around behind him grab his scrawny little head and tilt it back i take out the and jam it in his mouth hes struggling but hes an old wimp its like holding down an insect a goddamn bug i position him ive seen enough forensic reports to know what it should look like i say nighty night your honor and pull the trigger the rest you know okay okay now how about another drink im thirsty as hell
