jonathan kellerman twisted the second book in the petra connor series to faye acknowledgments special thanks to john ahouse rick albee pi det miguel porras terri porras and susan wilcox chapter may brought azure skies and california optimism to hollywood petra connor worked nights and slept through the blue she had her own reason to be cheerful solving two whodunit murders the first was a dead body at a wedding the itopark wedding main ballroom of the roosevelt hotel japaneseamerican bride koreanamerican groom a couple of law students whod met at the u her father a glendaleborn surgeon his an immigrant appliance dealer barely able to speak english petra wondered about culture clash the body was one of the brides cousins a thirtytwoyearold cpa named baldwin yoshimura found midway through the reception in an unlocked stall of the hotel mens room his neck twisted so hard he looked like something out of the exorcist it took strong hands to do that the coroner pronounced but that was where the medical wisdom terminated petra working with no partner once again talked to every friend and relative and finally unearthed the fact that baldwin yoshimura had been a serious lothario whod made no distinction between married and unmarried conquests as she continued to probe she encountered nervous glances on the brides side finally a third cousin named wendy sakura blurted out the truth baldwin had been fooling with his brother darwins wife the slut darwin a relative black sheep for this highly educated clan was a martial arts instructor who worked at a studio in woodland hills petra forced herself to wake up during daylight dropped in at the dojo watched him put an advanced judo class through its paces stocky little guy shaved head pleasant demeanor when the class was over he approached petra arms extended for cuffing saying i did it arrest me back at the station he refused a lawyer couldnt wait to spill suspicious for some time hed followed his wife and his brother as they left the wedding and entered an unused banquet room after passing behind a partition said wife gave said sib enthusiastic head darwin allowed her to finish waited until baldwin went to the john confronted his brother did the deed what about your wife said petra what about her you didnt hurt her shes a woman said darwin yoshimura shes weak baldwin shouldve known better the second whodunit started off as bloodstains in los feliz and ended up with db out in angeles crest national forest this victim was a grocer named bedros kashigian the blood was found in the parking lot behind his market on edgemont kashigian and his fiveyearold cadillac were missing two days later forest rangers found the caddy pulled to the side of the road in the forest kashigians body slumped behind the wheel dried blood had streamed out of his left ear run onto his face and shirt but no obvious wounds maggot analysis said hed been dead the entire two days or close to it meaning instead of driving home from work hed made his way thirty miles east or had been taken there as far as petra could tell the grocer was a solid citizen married three kids nice house no outstanding debts but a solid week of investigating kashigians activities gave rise to the fact that hed been involved in a brawl two days before his disappearance barroom melee at a place on alvarado latino clientele but kashigian had a thing for one of the salvadoran waitresses and went there frequently to nurse beerandshots before retiring to her room above the saloon the fracas got going when two drunks started pounding each other kashigian got caught in the middle and ended up being punched in the head only once according to the bartender an errant bare fist and kashigian had left the bar on his feet kashigians widow dealing with her loss as well as the new insight that bedros had been cheating on her said hubby had complained of a headache attributing it to banging his head against a bread rack couple of aspirins hed seemed fine petra phoned the coroner an unconscionably cheerful guy named rosenberg and asked if a single bareknuckle blow to the head could be fatal two days after the fact rosenberg said he doubted it a scan of bedros kashigians insurance records showed hefty whole life and firsttodie policies as well as medical claims paid five years ago when the grocer had been involved in a ninecar pileup on the north that had shattered his skull and caused intracranial bleeding brought into the er unconscious kashigian had been wheeled into surgery where a halfdollarsized piece of skull had been sawed off so his brain could be cleaned up that section labeled a roundel by rosenberg had been reattached using sutures and screws after hearing about the accident rosenberg had changed his mind the roundel was anchored by scar tissue he told petra and the darn thing grew back thinner than the rest of the skull unfortunately for your guy thats exactly where he took the punch the rest of his head could have withstood the impact but the thin spot couldnt it shattered drove bone slivers into his brain caused a slow bleed and finally boom boom said petra there you go again blinding me with jargon the coroner laughed petra laughed neither of them wanting to think about bedros kashigians monumental bad luck a single punch she said boom said rosenberg tell me this doctor r could he have driven to the forest out of confusion let me think about that with shards of bone slicing into his gray matter a slow bleed yeah he couldve been hazy disoriented which didnt explain why angeles crest specifically she asked captain schoelkopf if she should pursue homicide charges against the guy whod landed the punch who is he dont know yet a bar fight schoelkopf flashed her the areyouretarded look write it up as an accidental death lacking the will or the desire to argue she complied then went to inform the widow who told her angeles crest was where she and bedros used to go to make out when they were teenagers at least he left me some good insurance said the woman the main thing is my kids stay in private school within days after closing both files the loneliness set in petra had made the mistake of getting intimate with a partner and now she was working and living solo the object of her affections was a strange taciturn detective named eric stahl with a military background as an army special services officer and a history that had unfurled slowly the first time petra had seen his black suit pale skin and flat dark eyes shed thought undertaker shed disliked him instinctively and the feeling appeared mutual somehow things had changed theyd started working together on the cold heart homicides coordinating with milo sturgis in west la to put away a scumbag psychopath who got off on dispatching creative types closing that one hadnt come easy eric had nearly died of stab wounds sitting waiting in the er waiting room petra had met his parents learned why he didnt talk or emote or act remotely human hed once had a family wife and two kids but had lost everything heather danny and dawn taken from him cruelly hed resigned his military commission spent a year doped up on antidepressants then applied to the lapd where connections got him a detective i appointment hollywood division where schoelkopf had foisted him on petra whatever schoelkopf knew hed kept to himself uninformed petra tried to get along but faced with a partner with all the warmth of ceramic tile she soon gave up the two of them ended up splitting chores minimizing the time they spent together long cold silent stakeouts then came a night full of terror even now petra wondered if eric had been trying to commit suicide by perp shed never brought it up had no reason to she had not been the only woman in his life during the cold heart investigation hed met an exotic dancer a bubbleheaded blonde with a perfect body named kyra montego aka kathy magary kyra was there in the waiting room too stuffed into toosmall duds sniffling into her hankie examining her nails unable to read the dumbest magazine out of anxiety or what petra suspected was attention span disorder petra outlasted the bimbo and when eric woke up it was her hand holding his her eyes locking with his bruised brown irises during the months of recuperation kyra kept dropping in at erics rented bungalow in studio city bearing takeout soup and plastic utensils offering plastic boobs and batting eyelashes and lord knew what else petra dealt with that by cooking for eric growing up with five brothers and a widowed father in arizona shed learned to be pretty handy around the kitchen during the brief time her marriage lasted shed played at gourmet now a nighthawk divorcée she rarely bothered to switch on the oven but healing eric with homecooked goodies had seemed terribly urgent in the end the bimbo was out of the picture and petra was squarely in it she and eric went from awkwardness to reluctant selfdisclosure to friendship to closeness when they finally made love he went at it with the fervor of a deprived animal when they finally settled into regular sex she found him the best lover shed ever encountered tender when she needed him to be accommodatingly athletic when that was the daily special they split up as partners and continued as lovers living apart eric in the bungalow petra in her flat on detroit off sixth near museum row then september hit and erics special forces background made the department look at him in a new way transferred out of homicide to the newly formed homeland security squad he was sent overseas for antiterrorist training this month it was israel learning about suicide bombers and profiling and things he couldnt tell her about he called when he could emailed her sporadically but couldnt receive electronic messages shed last heard from him a week ago jerusalem was a beautiful city the israelis were tough and tactless and reasonably competent he planned to be back in two weeks a postcard picturing the citadel of david had arrived two days ago erics neat forwardslanting script p thinking of you alls ok e working solo suited her just fine but she knew it was only a matter of time before some new transfer was foisted on her after closing yoshimura and kashigian she took a couple of days off figuring on a little downtime instead she got a bloodbath and isaac gomez chapter it happened the day she started painting again forcing herself to get up by ten and using the daylight to copy a georgia okeeffe shed always loved not flowers or skulls a gray vertical new york city scene from okeeffes early days pure genius no way could she hope to capture it but the struggle would be good it had been months since shed lifted a brush and starting out was rough but by two pm she was in the groove doing pretty well she thought at six she sat down to appraise her work and fell asleep on the living room couch a call from the station woke her up at onefifteen am multiple one eightysevens at the paradiso club sunset near western all hands on deck said the dispatcher its probably on tv already petra flicked on the tube as she headed for the shower the first network she tried was running the story a bunch of kids shot outside the paradiso some sort of hiphop concert an altercation in the parking lot gunbarrel poking out of a car window four bodies by the time petra got there the area had been cordoned and the victims were covered with coroners tarp a quartet of bundles lying at random angles under a blueblack hollywood sky the corner of one of the tarps had blown loose revealing a sneakered foot pink sneaker smallish highintensity lights turned the parking lot glossy what looked to be over a hundred kids some of whom were way too young to be out this late had been divided into several groups shunted off to the side and guarded by uniformed officers five groups all potential witnesses the paradiso a movie theaterturnedevangelical churchturnedconcert venue could seat over a thousand these kids were the chosen few petra looked for other detectives spotted abrams montoya dilbeck and haas now that she was here five ds for five groups macdonald dilbeck was a diii with over thirty years experience and hed be the boss on this one she headed over to him when she was ten yards away he waved mac was a sixtyoneyearold exmarine with silver brylcreemed hair and a gray sharkskin suit just as glossy skinny rounded lapels marked the garment as a vintage collectible but she knew hed bought it new a fiveeight fireplug mac wore aqua velva a fauxruby high school ring and an lapd tiebar he lived in simi valley and his civilian ride was an old caddy on weekends he rode horses and harleys married for forty years semper fi tattoo on his biceps petra judged him smarter than most doctors and lawyers shed met he said sorry for screwing up your vacation his eyes were tired but his posture was perfect looks like we need all the help we can get macs mouth turned down it was a massacre four children he drew her away from the bodies toward the doublewidth driveway that led out to western avenue they faced thin earlymorning traffic the concert ended at eleventhirty but kids hung around in the parking lot smoking drinking the typical shenanigans cars were leaving but one reversed direction and backed up toward the crowd slowly so no one noticed then an arm stuck out and started shooting security guard was too far to see it but he heard a dozen shots four hits all fatal looks like a nine millimeter petra glanced at the nearest group of kids they dont look hardcore what kind of concert was it your basic lightweight hiphop dance remixes some latin stuff nothing gangsta despite the horror petra felt a smile coming on nothing gangsta dilbeck shrugged grandkids from what were hearing it was a wellbehaved crowd couple of ejections for alcohol but nothing serious who got ejected three boys from the valley white harmless their parents picked them up this wasnt about that petra but what it was about who knows including our potential witnesses nothing said petra dilbeck covered his eyes with one hand used the other to blanket his mouth these are the kids unlucky enough to be sticking around when the blackandwhites arrived all weve got out of them is a relatively consistent description of the shooters car small black or dark blue or dark gray most likely a honda or a toyota with chrome rims not a single digit of license plate when the shooting started everyone dropped or ducked or ran but all these kids hung around uniforms arrived within two minutes code three said dilbeck didnt let anyone leave who called it in at least eight people the official informants a bouncer he frowned the vics are two boys and two girls how old we idd three fifteen fifteen and seventeen the fourth one of the girls had no paper on her nothing at all dilbeck shook his head some poor parents are going to worry a lot and then hear the bad news it stinks doesnt it maybe i should fold my tent hed been talking retirement for as long as petra had known him she said ill fold before you will probably he admitted id like a look at the bodies before they get taken away look to your hearts content and then have a go at that nearest group the one over there petra learned what she could about the victims paul allan montalvo two weeks from his sixteenth birthday chubby roundfaced plaid shirt black sweatpants smooth olive skin where it wasnt distorted by a gunshot under his right eye two other holes in his legs wanda leticia duarte seventeen gorgeous pale with long black hair rings on eight of her fingers five earpierces three chest shots left side bingo kennerly scott dalkin fifteen looked closer to twelve fairskinned freckled shaved head the color of putty black leather jacket and skull pendant hanging from a leather thong around the neck that had been pierced by a bullet his getup and scuffed doc martens said hed been aiming for tough hadnt even come close in his wallet was a card proclaiming him to be a member of the honor society at birmingham high the unidentified girl was probably hispanic short busty with shoulderlength curly hair dyed rust at the tips tight white top tight black jeans kmart house brand pink sneakers the shoes petra had spied not much larger than a size five another head shot the puckered black hole just in front of her right ear four others in her torso the pockets of her jeans had been turned inside out petra inspected her cheap leatherette purse chewing gum tissues twenty bucks cash two packets of condoms safe sex petra kneeled by the girls side then she got up to do her job eighteen knownothings she addressed them as a group tried coming on gently being a pal stressing the importance of cooperation to prevent something like this from happening again her reward was eighteen blank stares pressing the group elicited a few slow head shakes maybe some of it was shock but petra sensed she was boring them nothing you can tell me she asked a slim redheaded boy he scrunched his lips and shook his head she had them form a line took down names and addresses and phone numbers acted casual as she checked out their nonverbal behavior two nervous ones stood out a serious handwringer and a nonstop foottapper both girls she held them back let the others go bonnie ramirez and sandra leon both sixteen they dressed similarly tight tops low riders and highheeled boots but didnt know each other bonnies top was black some sort of cheap crepelike fabric and shed caked her face with makeup to cover up gritty acne her hair was brown frizzy tied up in a complicated do that had probably taken hours to construct but managed to look careless still wringing her hands as petra reiterated the importance of being open and honest i am honest she said fluent english that musical east la tincture that stretches final words what about the car bonnie i told you i didnt see it not at all nothing i gotta go i really gotta go wring wring wring whats the rush bonnie georges only babysitting till one and its way after that youve got a kid two years old said bonnie ramirez with a mixture of pride and amazement boy or girl boy whats his name rocky got a picture bonnie reached for her sequined handbag then stopped herself what do you care george said if i dont get home on time hell like just leave and rocky sometimes gets up like in the night i dont wanna him to be all like scared whos george the father said the girl rockys a george too jorge junior i call him rocky to make him different from george cause i dont like how george acts how does george act he doesnt give me nothing sandra leons blouse was skinhugging champagne satin off one shoulder smooth bare shoulder stippled by goose bumps shed stopped tapping her foot switched to hugging herself tightly bunching soft unfettered breasts to the center of her narrow chest dark skin clashed with a huge mass of platinum blond hair deep red lipstick an appliqué mole above her lip she wore cheap fakeo gold jewelry lots of it her shoes were rhinestone mules parody of sexy sixteen going on thirty before petra could ask she said i dont know nothing allowing her eyes to drift to the victims to pink sneakers petra said wonder where she got those shoes sandra leon looked everywhere but at petra why would i know biting her lip you okay said petra the girl forced herself to meet petras gaze her eyes were dull why wouldnt i be petra didnt answer can i go now youre sure theres nothing you want to tell me the dull eyes narrowed sudden hostility it seemed misplaced i dont even have to talk to you says who the law you have experience with the law said petra nope but you know the law my brothers in jail where lompoc for what stealing a car your brothers your legal expert said petra look where he is sandra shrugged the platinum hair shifted a wig that made petra take a closer look at her notice something else about the girls eyes dull because they were yellow around the edges you okay i will be when you let me go sandra leon righted her hairpiece slipped a finger under the front and smiled leukemia said the girl they gave me chemo at western peds i used to have real nice hair they say itll grow back but maybe theyre lying tears filled her eyes can i go now sure the girl walked away chapter over the next week five detectives worked the paradiso shootings interviewing family members of the dead teens recontacting potential witnesses none of the victims had gang affiliations all were praised as good kids no relatives had criminal histories no one had anything of value to say the girl in the pink sneakers remained unidentified a personal failure for petra shed volunteered to do the trace worked at it came up empty one interesting fact from the coroner the girl had undergone an abortion within the last few months petra asked mac dilbeck if she could go to the media and he said sure three stations ran sketchy renderings of the girls face on the evening news a few calls came in nothing serious she worked the shoes figuring maybe an item like that was unusual anything but kmart special made in macao shipped to the states in huge lots for over a year she even found them for resale on ebay she tried to recontact sandra leon because sandra had given off an uneasy vibe though maybe it was just tension about being sick resolving to go gently with the poor kid lord knew what shed been through with her leukemia the phone rang but no one answered ten days after the mass murder the team still hadnt developed any leads and at the next sitdown mac dilbeck informed them theyd been cut from five ds to three hed remain as the principal and luc montoya and petra would do backup after the meeting petra asked him what does that mean mac collected his papers and didnt look up what does what mean backup im open to ideas the unidentified girl said petra im wondering if shes the key no ones reported her missing funny isnt it said mac maybe someone wanted her really gone mac smoothed his glossy hair you want to try to chase her down some more i can try yeah its a good idea he frowned what he touched the front of his flat seamed brow i got a big fat whatif floating around in here as in what if there was no motive just a bunch of bad guys out to kill some people wouldnt that be lovely said petra it could be though it sure could two days of working the anonymous girl proved maddening petra was at her desk eating a hot dog when the sound of a throat clearing made her look up isaac gomez again he stood off to the side wearing his usual blue buttondown shirt pressed khakis and penny loafers black hair parted and plastered down like a choir boys smooth brown face all freshly scrubbed he held a stack of old murder books to his chest and said i hope im not bothering you detective connor of course he was of course she smiled up at him every time she saw isaac petra thought of a diego rivera kid grown up the hair straight as brushbristle the nutmeg skin the huge liquid almond eyes the clear hints of indian blood in the elevated cheekbones and finely boned nose isaac was fiveten maybe onefifty with square shoulders bony wrists and a deliberate but awkward way of moving chronologically he was twentytwo twentytwo and a year from his phd lord only knew how old he was intellectually but when conversation veered away from facts and figures he could end up mired in awshucks adolescence petra was sure he was a virgin whats up isaac she expected a smile the embarrassed smile she seemed to elicit from him nothing about happiness everything about the jitters more than once when they were together shed spotted a tenting of khaki in his crotch area the flush around the ears the quick coverup using a textbook or his laptop when that happened she pretended not to notice no smile this evening he looked tense eightfourteen pm the detectives room was nearly empty reasonable people had gone home shed been playing with the computer logging on to missing kids databases still trying to trace the girl in the pink shoes youre sure im not intruding im sure what are you doing here at this hour isaac shrugged i got involved started with one thing and ended with another he hefted the pile of blue notebooks his eyes looked hot why dont you put those down said petra pull up a chair im sorry if this is disruptive detective connor i know youre working paradiso and under normal circumstances i wouldnt intrude flicker of smile i guess thats not true ive intruded quite a bit havent i not at all petra lied the truth was babysitting brain boy could be a buttaching disruption when things got busy she motioned to a side chair and he sat whats up isaac played with a collar button i was working on my multiple regression analysis plugging in new variables he shook his head hard as if emptying it of extraneous information you dont need to hear all that the essential point is i was searching for additional ways to organize my data and serendipitously i came across something i thought you should see he stopped took a breath she said what isaac its going to sound on the surface it may look like nothing some kind of coincidence but ive done statistical tests several tests each one covering the mathematical weaknesses of the others and its obvious to me that its not just factitious not just a quirk as far as i can tell this is real detective connor unblemished brown cheeks were suddenly slick with sweat petra sat there its totally weird he went on suddenly sounding like a kid but im sure its real he began flipping open murder books started off talking softly at a near whisper ended up shooting out words like an automatic weapon assaultbrain petra listened brilliant or not the kid was an amateur this had to be nonsense as if reading her mind he said i promise you its genuine she said why dont you tell me about those statistical tests of yours chapter irma gomez had been working for the lattimores for nine years before she said anything about the problem with isaac doctors seth and marilyn lattimore lived in a nineteenroom tudor on hudson avenue in hancock park both lattimores were surgeons in their sixties he a thoracic man she an ophthalmologist both were nononsense perfectionists but pleasant and generous when not weighed down by professional concerns they cared deeply for one another had raised three children all presently in various stages of medical training thursdays they played golf together because thursday was coed day at the country club in january they traveled for one week to cabo san lucas and every may they flew to paris on air france first class where they stayed at the same suite at the hôtel le bristol and made the rounds of michelin threestar restaurants back in california every third weekend was spent at their condo in palm desert where they slept in and read trashy novels and wore copious amounts of sunblock six days a week for ten years irma gomez had taken the bus from her threeroom apartment in the union district and showed up at eight am at the lattimore mansion where she let herself in through the kitchen door and disarmed the security system she began by cleaning the entire house the prettyingup chores the surface work detailed tasks polishing scrubbing serious behindthedavenport dusting were divided up per dr marilyns suggestion because the house could be overwhelming monday through wednesday the downstairs thursday through saturday the upstairs that way dr marilyn assured her you can end the week on an easier note what with the childrens rooms being closed off the children were twentyfour twentysix and thirty and theyd been out of the house for years irma nodded assent as it turned out dr marilyn was right but even if she hadnt been irma wouldnt have argued she was a quiet woman made quieter by her failure to learn english better during the eleven years shed lived in the united states she and her husband isaiah had three kids of their own and by the time irma began working for the lattimores little isaiah was four isaac two and baby joel a rambunctious infant active as a monkey at age twentythree irma flores made her way from the village of san francisco guajoyo in el salvador up through mexico and across the border into the united states just east of san diego prodded along in the darkness by a vicious coyote named paz who attempted to blackmail her for more money than theyd agreed upon then reacted to her refusal with an attempted rape irma managed to free herself and somehow found her way to downtown la to the door of the pentecostal church where sanctuary had been promised the pastor was a kind man a janitor when he wasnt preaching he found her nightwork cleaning downtown office buildings church was her solace and it was in church that she met isaiah gomez his quiet demeanor and shabby clothes brought out something soft in her his job was dying sheets of fabric in an east la plant leaning over steaming vats inhaling toxic fumes trudging home pale and weary in the earlymorning hours they married and when irma became pregnant with little isaiah she knew nightwork would no longer do acquiring false papers she registered with an agency on larchmont avenue her first boss a film director living in the hollywood hills terrified her with his rages and his drinking and his cocaine and she quit after a week god was good to her the second time delivering her to the lattimores midway through the ninth year of irmas employment dr marilyn lattimore came down with an uncharacteristic cold and was home for two days perhaps thats why she noticed the expression of irmas face for the most part irma labored in solitude humming and singing and setting off echoes in big vaulted rooms it was in the breakfast room that the conversation took place dr marilyn sat reading the paper and sipping tea and dabbing at her red drippy nose irma was in the adjoining kitchen had removed the covers of the stoveburners and was scrubbing them singlemindedly do you believe this irma a week of surgeries and i come down with this arrogant little virus dr marilyns voice normally husky now bordered on masculine back in medical school irma when i rotated through pediatrics i caught every virus known to mankind and later of course when i had the children but its been years since ive been sick and i find this positively insulting im sure some patient gave it to me id just like to know who so i could thank them personally dr marilyn was a pretty woman small with honeycolored hair who looked much younger than her age she walked two miles every morning at six am followed that with half an hour on an elliptical machine lifted free weights ate sparely except when she was in paris irma said you strong you get better soon i certainly hope so thank you for that bit of optimism irma would you be a dear and get me some of the fig preserve for my toast irma fetched the jar and brought it over thank you dear something else doctor em no thank you dear are you all right irma irma forced a smile yes youre sure sure yes doctor em hmm dont spare me because of my cold if theres something on your mind get it out irma started to head back to the kitchen dear dr marilyn called after her i know you well and its obvious somethings on your mind you wore that exact same look until we had your papers taken care of then you did it again worrying about whether or not the amnesty would take effect somethings definitely on your mind i fine doctor em turn around and look me in the eye and tell me that irma complied dr marilyn stared at her she had sharp brown eyes and a determined mouth very well two minutes later after finishing her toast please irma stop sulking and get it off your chest after all how often do you have anyone to talk to what with dr ess and me always gone this is such an isolating job isnt it is that whats bothering you no no i love the job doctor then what is it nada nothing now youre being stubborn young lady i is nothing irma i worry about isaac alarm brightened the sharp brown eyes turned them vulpine vaguely frightening isaac is he all right yes he very good very smart irma broke down in tears hes smart and youre crying said dr marilyn am i missing something they had tea and fig jam on thin toast and irma told dr marilyn all of it how isaac kept coming home from school crying with frustration and boredom how hed finished all of his sixthgrade work in two months taken it upon himself to borrow seventh and eighth and even some ninthgrade books and had sped through them as well finally he was caught reading a prealgebra workbook slipped out of a supply room and was sent to the principals office for unauthorized study and irregular behavior irma visited the school tried to handle it on her own the principal had nothing but disdain for irmas simple clothes and thick accent her firm suggestion was that isaac stop being precocious and concentrate on conforming to class standards when irma tried to point out that the boy was well ahead of class standards the principal cut her off and informed her that isaac was just going to have to be content repeating everything thats outrageous said dr marilyn absolutely outrageous there there dry your eyes three years ahead on his own two some three my eldest john was somewhat like that not quite as smart as your isaac seems to be but school was always tedious for him because he moved too fast oh dear we had some dustups with him now johns the chief resident in psychiatry at stanford dr marilyn brightened perhaps your isaac could be a physician wouldnt that be fabulous irma irma nodded half listening as dr marilyn prattled a child that bright irma theres no limit give me that principals number and ill have a little chat with her she sneezed coughed wiped her nose laughed with this baritone ill sound positively authoritative irma didnt speak whats the number dear silence irma i don wan no trouble dr em youve already got trouble irma now we have to find a solution irma looked down at the floor what said dr marilyn sharply ah youre worried about repercussions about someone taking this out on you and your family well dear dont be concerned about that youre legal when we arranged your papers we were extremely careful about buttoning up every detail i don understand said irma dr marilyn sighed when we hired that attorney the abogado no that said irma i don understand where isaac come from i not smart isaiah not smart the other two not smart dr marilyn pondered that nibbled toast and put it aside youre smart enough dear nah like isaac he always fast isaac walk fast talk fast ocho eight month he talk say papa mama pan vaca the other two was fourteen fifteen eight months said dr marilyn oh dear thats astonishing even john didnt utter a word until a year she sat back and thought leaned over and took irmas hands in hers do you realize what a gift youve been given what someone like isaac could do irma shrugged dr marilyn stood coughed trudged to the kitchen wallphone im going to call that fool of a principal one way or another well get to the bottom of this mess dr marilyn confronted public school bureaucracy and fared no better than irma astonishing she exclaimed these people are mindless cretins she conferred with dr seth and the two of them took it upon themselves to confer with melvyn pogue edd headmaster of the burton academy where john bradley and elizabeth lattimore had earned nearly straight as the timing was perfect burton had come under fire from some of its progressive alumni for being lilywhite and elitist and though plans had been drawn up to increase diversity no steps had been taken this boy said dr pogue sounds perfect hes extremely clever said dr seth nice religious little fellow to boot but perfections a bit overreaching we dont want to pressure the lad yes yes of course dr lattimore in pogues top desk drawer was a freshly signed lattimore check full tuition for an entire year with money left over for gymnasium refurbishment clever is good religious is good um are we talking catholic isaac arrived at the burton campus on third near mccadden just a brief walk from the lattimore mansion freshly barbered and wearing his best church clothes a school psychologist ran him through a battery of tests and pronounced him off the scale an appointment was made for irma and isaiah gomez and the boy to meet dr melvyn pogue pogues assistant ralph gottfried the chairman of the faculty committee and mona hornsby the chief administrator smiling people whitepink invariably large they spoke rapidly and when his parents seemed confused isaac translated a week later hed transferred to burton as a seventh grader in addition he received individual enrichment mostly reading by himself in melvyn pogues booklined office his brothers happy and recalcitrant in public school thought the whole deal was weird the burton uniform with its silly blue pleated pants white shirt powderblue jacket and striped tie taking the bus to work with mama hanging with anglos all day playing sports theyd never heard of field hockey water polo squash and one they knew about but believed unattainable tennis when they asked isaac about it he said its okay but he was careful not to display too much emotion no reason to make them feel deprived in reality it was better than okay it was fabulous for the first time in his life he felt as if his mind was being allowed to go where it wanted despite the fact that most of the other burton students regarded him as a little darkskinned curiosity and he was often left alone he loved being alone the leatherandpaper smell of melvyn pogues office was imbedded in his consciousness as fragrant as mothers milk he read chewed up books took notes that no one read stayed in school well past dismissal time waiting with a bag full of books for irma to come by to pick him up and the two of them embarked on the long bus journey back to the union district sometimes mama asked him what he was learning usually she dozed on the bus as isaac read he was learning about wondrous strange things other worlds other universes at age eleven he saw the world as infinite by the time he was twelve hed made a few casual friends kids who invited him to their glorious homes though he was unable to reciprocate his apartment was clean but small and the union district was grimy urban a highcrime neighborhood even without asking he knew that no way would burton parents allow their progeny that far east of van ness he accustomed himself to a double life burtons beauxarts buildings and emerald playing fields by day by night the burp of gunfire and screams and staticscratchy salsa outside the window of the closetsized bedroom he shared with his brothers at night he thought a lot about the differences among people rich and poor light and dark crime why people did bad things was there a fairness to life did god take a personal interest in everyones life sometimes he wondered about his mother was hers a double life too maybe one day theyd talk about it by age fourteen he smiled and spoke like a burton student and had zipped through burtons high school math curriculum all of sophomore biology and two years of advanced placement history four years of high school were compressed to two at fifteen he graduated with full honors and was accepted as a special circumstances student at the university of southern california it was in college that he decided to become a doctor and he earned a as a bio major with a minor in math usc wanted to hold on to him and by the time he graduated summa cum laude phi beta kappa at barely nineteen hed been accepted to the keck school of medicine his parents celebrated but isaac wasnt sure four more years of lectures with no respite in between everything had moved so fast deep down he knew he wasnt mature enough for the responsibility of tending to other human beings he requested and received a deferral needing a break something leisurely less structured for isaac that meant a phd in epidemiology and biostatistics by age twentyone hed fulfilled all his course requirements earned a masters degree and began work on his doctoral dissertation discriminating and predictive patterns of solved and unsolved homicides in los angeles between and as he sat and composed his hypothesis hunched in a remote corner of the doheny library subbasement memories of gunshots and screams and salsa filled his head though care had been taken by the university to shield its boywonder from publicity news of isaacs triumphs reached the desk of city councilman gilbert reyes who promptly issued a press release in which he took credit for everything the young man had accomplished upon the strong advice of his faculty adviser isaac attended a luncheon where he sat next to reyes shook the hands of big loud people contradicted nothing the councilman said photo opportunities were reyess meat pictures appeared in the spanish language mailings his campaign distributed prior to the next election isaac looking like a shellshocked boy scout was labeled el prodigio the experience left him vaguely unsettled but when the time came to request access to lapd files for his research isaac knew who to call within two days he had an authorized longterm visitors badge a jerrybuilt internship guaranteed access to inactive homicide files and anything else he came across in the basement archives his desk would be at hollywood division because gilbert reyes was a serious buddy of deputy chief randy diaz the new hollywood division overboss isaac showed up at hollywood bright and early on an april monday and met with an unpleasant police captain named schoelkopf who looked like stalin schoelkopf regarded isaac as if he were a suspect didnt even pretend to pay attention as isaac rattled off his hypotheses nor did he listen as isaac offered profound thanks for the desk instead his eyes focused on a distant place and he chewed his big black mustache as if it was lunch when isaac stopped talking a cold smile stretched the facial pelt yeah fine said the captain ask for connor shell take real good care of you chapter it was nothing petra would have ever noticed even if it had stared her in the face isaacs neatly typed sheet lay flat on her desk he sat in the metal chair by the side of her desk drummed his fingers stopped pretended to be nonchalant she read the heading again boldface june homicides an embedded pattern like the title of a term paper and why not isaac was just twentytwo what did he know about anything other than school below the title a list of six homicides all on june on or near midnight six in six years her initial reaction was big deal for the past decade las annual homicide rate had fluctuated between and with the last few years settling in at around that averaged out to a killing every day and a half meaning some days there was nastiness others nothing at all when you considered summer heat june would most likely be one of the highticket dates she said all that to isaac he shot out his answer so quickly she knew hed been expecting the objection its not just the quantity detective connor its the quality those big liquid eyes detective connor how many times had she told him to call her petra the kid was sweet but there was a certain stubbornness to him the quality of the killings not in the sense of a value judgment by quality i mean the inherent properties of the crimes the he trailed off plinked a corner of the list go on said petra just keep it simple no more chi square pi square analysis of whatever i was an art major he colored sorry i tend to get hey she said just kidding i asked you to tell me about your statistical tests and you did at breakneck speed with the fervor of a true believer the tests he said arent any big deal they just examine phenomena mathematically as in the likelihood of something happening by chance one way to do that particular analysis is to draw comparisons between groups by examining the distribution of the pattern of the scores i did exactly that compared june with every other day of the year youre right about homicides clustering but no other date presents this pattern even summer effects tend to manifest on weekends or holidays these six cases fall on various days of the week in fact only one the first murder took place on a weekend petra reached for her mug her tea had gone cold but she drank it anyway would you like some water said isaac im fine what else okay another way to look at it is to simply examine inherent base probabilities hed punctuated his words with indexfinger jabs now he stopped blushed even more intensely there i go again another long deep inhalation lets take it issue by issue start with weapon of choice because thats a discreet its a fairly simple variable firearms are the clear favorite of la murderers ive looked at twenty years worth of one eightysevens and seventythree percent have been carried out with handguns rifles or shotguns knives and other sharp objects are next at around fifteen percent that means those two modalities account for nearly ninety percent of all local murders the fbis national figures are similar sixtyseven percent firearms fourteen percent knives personal weapons fists feet account for six percent and the rest is a mixed bag so the fact that neither a gun nor a knife was used on any of the june cases is notable as is the nature of the fatal injury in every data bank ive checked blunt force homicides never rise above the level of five percent theyre a rare occurrence detective connor im sure you know that better than i isaac i just closed two cases a barefist blow to the head and a broken neck via martial arts he frowned then you just closed two rare ones have you seen many others petra thought back she shook her head not for a while isaac said if we get even more specific cranial bludgeoning by unknown weapon accounts for no more than three percent of la homicides but it makes up one hundred percent of these cases when you add the other similarities identical calendar date same approximate time probable stranger homicides and look at the probability of a chance cluster youre moving way past coincidence he stopped petra said that it actually there is a bit more lapd homicide detectives solve between twothirds and threequarters of their cases yet all these cases remain unsolved thats because theyre stranger homicides said petra youve been here long enough to see the kind of stuff we clear quickly some moron holding the smoking gun when the uniforms get there i think youre selling yourself short detective connor saying it sincerely not a trace of patronizing the truth is you people are very effective imagine a major league slugger hitting seven hundred even stranger homicides get solved but not one of these all that supports my thesis these are highly irregular events the final incongruity is that during the same sixyear period gang homicides rose from twenty percent of all homicides to nearly forty meaning the chance of a nongang murder lowered proportionately yet not one of the june cases appear gangrelated add all that up and were talking a combination of highly unusual circumstances the likelihood of it boiling down to chance is one over so many zeros i dont have a name for it bet you do thought petra bet youre going easy on me she slid the list out from under his hand took a closer look june homicides an embedded pattern am marta doebbler sherman oaks married white female out with friends at pantages theater in hwood went to ladies room never returned found in own car backseat depressed skull fracture am geraldo luis solis widowed hispanic male found in his house breakfast room wilsh div food taken but no money depressed skull fracture am coral laurine langdon single white female walked her dog in hwood hills found by patrol car under brush six blocks from home depressed skull fracture dog brandy yo cockapoo stomped to death am darren ares hochenbrenner single black male navy ensign stationed in port hueneme on shore leave hwood found in alley fourth street cent div pockets emptied depressed skull fracture am jewell janis blank single white female runaway found in griffith park near fern dell by rangers depressed skull fracture am curtis marc hoffey single white male known gay hustler found in alley highland near sunset depressed skull fracture petra looked up there doesnt seem to be any pattern victimwise i know said isaac but still i have a friend a psychologist who says people are walking prisms we see with our brains not our eyes and what we see depends on context now she was pontificating isaac sat back he looked crushed my point is she said that it all depends on how you look at it youve raised some interesting points more than interesting provocative she pointed to the list ran her finger down the names these people are all over the place in terms of sex age social class weve got urban and semirural dumpsites if this is some kind of serial thing thered most likely be a sexual angle and i cant see what a sixtythreeyearold man and a fourteenyearold girl would have in common as sexual targets all thats true said isaac but dont you think the other factors are too blatant to be ignored petras head began hurting youve obviously put a lot of time into this and im not dismissing it but why he interrupted does there have to be a sexual angle thats the way it tends to shake out the fbi profile yes yes i know about all of that their basic thesis is that what they call organized killers really just a dumbeddown version of what psychologists call psychopaths are motivated by a combination of sexuality and violence im sure that typically theres some truth to that but as you said detective reality depends on which prism youre using the fbi interviewed imprisoned killers and compiled data banks but data are only as good as the sample and who says killers who get caught are similar to those who dont maybe the fbis bad guys got caught because they were psychologically rigid maybe it was their predictability that tripped them up his voice had climbed heat in the brown eyes made them something quite other than liquid all im saying is that sometimes exceptions are more important than rules what motive are you proposing for these killings said petra long pause i dont know neither of them spoke isaac slumped okay thanks for your time he scooped up the list and stashed it in the shiny brown briefcase he carried around petra had seen detectives smile disparagingly at the case shed heard the comments behind isaacs back brainiac boy wonder petras little daycare project when she felt assertive she silenced the noise with an icy stare now she found herself feeling protective of the kid but annoyed the last thing she needed was some theory that got her dredging up six years of cold cases not with four victims down at the paradiso one of them a girl she couldnt even identify on the other hand isaac was smarter than she was much smarter dismissing him out of hand could turn out to be one of those big mistakes and what if he went over her head to schoelkopf to councilman reyes if that happened and he turned out to be right headlines danced in her head young wizard uncovers unsolved killings the text lapd detective failed to investigate isaac got to his feet sorry for wasting your time is there something i can do for you on your main case my main case the paradiso ive heard its been tough going have you she said hearing the chill in her voice she coerced her lips to form a smile of her own stratospheric iq or not he was a kid an overly enthusiastic paininthebutt politically connected kid its been a tough one she agreed all those kids mowed down no one willing to talk what could you do for me i dont know he said maybe look at the data now he was blushing again that was totally presumptuous of me youre the professional what do i know sorry i wont bother you again do you know anything about pink kmart sneakers pardon she told him about the unidentified girl his posture relaxed thinking analyzing did that to him youre thinking she mightve been the intended victim and the others were innocent bystanders at this point isaac im not thinking anything i just think its odd that no ones come forth to id her hmm yes that would imply some kind of turmoil in her background it sounds as if you took the shoething as far as you could ill give it some thought im sure i wont come up with anything but ill give it a try id appreciate it she said not meaning a word but keeping the damn smile on highbeam nearly nine pm the kid was working late too and not getting paid for it she said how about some dinner a burger whatever thanks but i need to get home my mother made dinner and its a big deal to her if we dont all show up okay she said maybe another time the genius still lived with his folks the union district she recalled probably some shabby little apartment huge contrast to the green lawns and towering trees at usc getting all that attention as boygenius working here his own desk in the detectives room no reason not to stay late make me a copy of that list she said youre not dismissing it let me think about it some more biiiiig smile will do have a nice evening detective connor you too professor gomez he left and petras mind shifted back to the paradiso slaughter gun as weapon of choice at least in that way it was typical which for some reason made her feel worse chapter a copy of the list was on petra s desk the following afternoon yellow postit in the upper righthand corner detective c thanks i g she put it aside and spent the next two days talking to missing persons cops throughout california faxing morgue shots of the girl in the pink shoes getting a few callbacks but no leads she thought about expanding to neighboring states the chubby girl appeared hispanic so the southwest seemed a good bet phoning her way through arizona and nevada took another full day then she moved on to new mexico where a santa fe pd detective named darrel two moons said she might be a girl who went missing from the san ildefonso pueblo last year our vic had a recent abortion even better said two moons there was a rumor of an unwanted pregnancy a married man not a good guy weve been wondering if he got rid of her but so far no body its the tribal polices case but they called us in send the photo the father said petra is he the kind of guy whod drive to la to shoot her in terms of amorality sure would he work that hard cant say twenty minutes later two moonss partner a guy named steve katz called back and said i know darrel talked to you about cheryl ruiz sorry the pictures not her also the tribal police didnt think to tell us they found cheryl she took greyhound to minnesota had a baby has been living with her aunt all this time interagency cooperation so what else is new said petra yeah said katz la huh i used to be nypd worked midtown manhattan i remember what its like to be busy miss it depends on what on how long the night stretches on what else ive got going on in my life another shift full of nothing made her grouchy some nice athletic sex with a touch of romance wouldnt have hurt but it had been a week since erics last call she wasnt even sure where he was time to pack it in go home take a long hot gellubed bath maybe actually cook herself something decent and healthy that meant stopping off to buy veggies and whatever and she decided she just wasnt up to cold fluorescent supermarket aisles and other lonely people shed snarf whatever was in the fridge hopefully have the energy to take a stab at her okeeffe project big tall new york buildings that turned the city into a shady warren buildings no people painted long before tall new york buildings meant target what a world just as she locked up her desk her cell phone squawked from inside her purse she fumbled past her gun tissues makeup caught it on the third ring hi said a voice shed once thought flat mechanical freakishly unemotional nothing about the tone and timbre had changed but he meant something different to her now we hear with our brains not our ears she said hi whered they send you now i sent myself im down in the parking lot her heart leapt one sentence could do that to her the parking lot here right here she said im coming down eric stood next to petras accord halfconcealed in the shadows arms at his side looking in her direction not moving he had on a black nylon windbreaker halfzipped over a white tshirt pipestem black jeans those black crepesoled shoes he liked for stakeouts he looked even thinner than usual pale and hollowcheeked eyes so dark and deep set they receded into the evening dark hair cropped even shorter back to the military cut a middlesized skinny guy with the pallor of a seminary student no attempt to posture but still the james dean thing amped bigtime filling petras head how could she ever have thought him anything but sexy she hurried to him and they embraced he pulled away first touched her face buried his face in her hair held her tight the pressure of a needy child she said you okay now i am why didnt you come upstairs technically im not here she took his face in her hands kissed his eyelids held him at arms length where are you supposed to be jerusalem what you went awol technically meaning the israelis took a break because theyve got business to take care of in jenin a chance came up to hitch a ride on a plane a plane his smile was fleeting barely perceptible you know with wings how long can you stay i need to leave tomorrow pm one night said petra is that okay of course she kissed his nose you have a car he shook his head took a taxi they got into the accord petra started up the engine and noticed the dark smudges under his eyes how long have you been in transit twentythree hours some hitch part of it was a hitch i flew commercial from heathrow old ladies in wheelchairs were getting frisked while guys who look like usamas favorite swimming sperm walked right through you hungry petra wanted to play house but no food in the apartment meant dinner out they went to an italian place on third near la brea an oldfashioned chiantibottlesdanglingfromthe ceiling taverna ordered veal marsala and spaghetti with clams and slices of spumoni for dessert no wine eric never drank she asked him about jerusalem he said i was there years ago back during riyadh i thought it was beautiful then its more complicated now assholes wearing bombpacks kind of ruin the ambience he coiled pasta on his fork paused midair i met a guy who knows you superintendent sharavi daniel said petra we worked a case together he and milo and me thats what he said eric put the fork down took her hand in his played with her fingers you really have to go back tomorrow thats the plan through london he hesitated the instinctive secrecy im booked on jet blue out of long beach to new york one night she said i wanted to see you back in petras apartment they sat on the couch listened to a diana krall cd and made out eric started off gently the way he had since their first few encounters usually it turned petra on the slow simmer all the erotic ballet tonight she was impatient but she slowed herself down then she didnt stripping him down to pale bony nakedness then ripping off her own clothes so hastily she nearly tripped on a pants leg cool move detective klutz eric hadnt noticed his eyes were closed and his flat chest heaved in the flesh he looked younger vulnerable she touched him and he opened his eyes took hold of her shoulders trailed his hands down her hips and cupped her ass lifted her adroitly and settled her on him taking his own initiative moving her up and down slowly then faster kissing her nipples biting down gently throwing his head back and letting out a long deepinthe throat sigh clenching his face as he held back she said do it baby but he kept fighting it so she sped up ground against him and when she came panting and gasping her hair over her face he was bucking up at her and shouting god later in bed snuggled under the covers she pinched his butt and said didnt know you were religious not the religion i was raised with his dad was a minister reverend bob stahl a kind and gentle man determined to believe the best about people erics mom mary was no less positive petra had come to know both of them in the er waiting room petra benefiting from the disapproving glances the stahls shot at the bimbos skimpy clothing bonding some more when the bleeding crisis resolved and eric was moved to a private room still unconscious the three of them sitting by erics bed as he slept and healed when petra offered to leave to give them privacy they insisted she stay once just before eric woke up mary stahl hugged petra and told her youre just the kind of girl i wish hed bring home if you only knew eric began rubbing the twin soft spots just inside her shoulder blades the places shed told him always got sore oh man she said im not sure im gonna let you out of here tomorrow you tie me up he said it would be an excuse dont tempt me she tried to get him talking about work he said you dont want to know that bad he rolled over stared at the ceiling what she said i look at the israelis situation and it worries me theyre up against september eleven every day but they cant do what they need to do world opinion diplomacy all that good stuff his mouth snapped shut and he flung his arm over his eyes petra was sure he was going to clam up instead he said politics can be poison too much politics and you cant protect yourself chapter eric the most taciturn of men sometimes mumbled in his sleep but what woke petra in the middle of the night was her own internal voice some kind of warning she turned stared at his face saw calm the faint contented smile of a wellnurtured kid the second time she awoke it was just after noon and eric was up and showering by twelvethirty petra was cooking eggs they ate and read the paper lord wasnt this domestic at onethirty eric kissed her and headed for the door ill drive you she said i called a cab hed arrived with no luggage was leaving the same way wearing pressed blue jeans and a dark blue buttondown shirt the same black windbreaker the same crepesoled shoes fresh duds selected from the clothing hed left in her guest closet zipping halfway across the world with nothing but a wallet like it was a jaunt to the market here and back to see her she said cancel the taxi im taking you she hung with him in the cozy turquoise modern coffee shop above the jet blue terminal until a young man stuck his head in and announced the flights imminent departure eric got up shrugged looked embarrassed petra gave him the most intense hug she could muster one more kiss and he was gone she left the terminal with aching eyes traffic on the was ominous and she didnt arrive at the hollywood station until six twentyfive pm two ds were at their desks kaplan and salas and greeted her with nods no messages from mac dilbeck or anyone else on the paradiso case she headed for a free computer and tried some national databases for missing kids that shed already contacted not really expecting anything not getting anything what to do now a voice from across the room said detective connor isaac gomez wearing an olive suit yellow shirt greenandred rep tie hair parted and shiny and brushed flat to his scalp toted his briefcase toward her desk very spiffy she said heavyduty meeting the predictable blush darkened his neck not really have you had a chance to consider my hypothesis changing the subject too quickly that pushed petras mischief button cmon tell me about it you get honored again by councilman reyes not hardly mumbling tugging at his tie knot something better than being honored he kicked one shoe with the other cmon isaac said petra we common folk dont get the chance to hobnob with the powersthatbe im living vicariously through you she cupped her hand around her mouth is it true what they say about reyes is there a slight flatulence problem isaac smiled weakly petra said what can i do mr gomez is the soul of discretion he laughed loud enough to make kaplan and salas turn then he grew serious a date he blurted i had to go on a lunch date had to you make it sound like homework isaac sighed in a sense it was i was assigned by my mother she thinks i need to get out more you disagree im social enough detective connor i just dont need the problem is my mother was of the firm belief that once i entered college some golden gate of sociability would open sometimes i think shes more concerned about that than academics mothers care said petra what did she know her own had died pushing her out they do she does but isaac rubbed his cheek when his hand dropped petra saw a red raised spot fulminating zit brains or not he was clinging to adolescence he said my mothers notion of maximal personal success is that i meet a girl who elevates me socially she was never comfortable visiting my school it was an upscale private school she felt herself inferior which was nonsense shes an incredible woman but i couldnt convince her so she refused to have anything to do with the parents of my classmates but i believe part of her would have liked me to hook up with one of those girls its the same with her employers theyre doctors theyve been mentoring me they think shes fabulous but she wont step out of the servant role theres a whole pygmalion thing going on its complicated and im sure youre not interested he bit his lip one eyelid ticced poor kid was under real pressure petra felt bad about ribbing him hey she said youre smart in all kinds of ways youll do whats best for yourself i try to tell my mother my plates full enough im not ready for a relationship petra pointed to the chair alongside her desk he sat down heavily lousy date huh he grinned im that obvious well she said i figure mom sets you up with a high iq beauty queen maybe youd forget about your plate the girl was nice enough but not we had absolutely nothing in common her familys new in our church shes religious and modest and for my mother thats enough no beauty queen said petra she looks like a mastiff ouch that was cruel said isaac but so what she was also aggressive sweet in church but take her to dinner and watch out he shook his head aggressive about what everything she had opinions on matters about which she knew nothing religion really got her going nuclearstrength dogma wed barely sat down and she was telling me i needed to go to church more often instructing me what to believe and not with any particular theological elegance oh boy said petra youre not even married and shes running your life he laughed again you sound like a guy i mean thats something one guy would say to another blushing deeply not that youre not feminine youre very feminine its just that are you married used to be it didnt end because i tried to run his life i was the most perfect spouse in the universe but he was a lout he said youre joking but i bet thats true he looked at her helplessly in terms of sounding like a guy she said i grew up with five brothers you pick stuff up that must help in terms of working here the predominantly male environment somehow the subject had changed she said it does help he said anyway about those june cases i neglected to mention that four of six took place here in hollywood division im not sure yet if it adds another layer of statistical significance to the were a highcrime district isaac several divisions have higher homicide rates ramparts central newton maybe youve got a point isaac i promise to take a look but right now im kind of tied up the paradiso shootings exactly has that girl been identified not yet okay sorry for she had an abortion within the last month or two that say anything to you the obvious thing he said is a possible source of conflict with the father over the abortion i was thinking of the pregnancy itself in certain situations an unwanted pregnancy would be a pretty robust motive for homicide wouldnt you say theodore dreiser wrote a wonderful book about it she terminated the pregnancy isaac but maybe she kept that fact to herself petra considered that why not its an angle thanks now all i have to do is figure out who she is she flashed him a smile and turned back to the mess on her desk detective connor yes would it be feasible for me to ride with you to observe what you do firsthand i promise not to be intrusive its pretty boring isaac lots of routine lots of dead ends thats okay he said the longer im here the more i realize how ignorant i am writing a dissertation about crime and i dont know the first thing about it im not sure riding along will help you much i think it will detective a trickle of sweat made its way down his left hairline and reached his ear he swiped at it how long had he been building up the courage to ask her behind the precocious pronouncements was so much anxiety okay she said tomorrow morning when i recontact some of the witnesses on the paradiso case you can come along but only on one condition whats that start calling me petra if you dont ill start calling you dr gomez he smiled im a ways off from earning that ive earned my title but im forgoing the honor she said youre making me feel old chapter the bus that isaac took to the union district was a big looseintherivets halfempty dieselfed dinosaur that rumbled and bumped through dark city streets brakes squeaking belching pollution brightly lit a crimereduction measure by car the ride from hollywood would be twenty minutes using the mta an easy hour he sat at the back read the latest edition of davisons abnormal psychology his fellow riders were mostly cleaning women and restaurant workers a few drunks nearly all latino mostly illegal he figured just as his parents had been until the doctors had intervened and now he was wearing his fathers handmedown suit and playing at scholar there but for the grace when he got home his father would probably be at work lately papa had been taking a second shift dipping sheets into noxious vats wanting to earn a little extra money isaiah home from his roofing job would be sleeping and joel of late a gadabout might or might not be around his mother would be in the kitchen changed from her uniform to a faded housedress and slippers a pot of albondigas soup simmering on the stove a rack of tamales both savory and sweet fresh out of the oven isaac had barely eaten all day taking care to be hungry for her food hed learned the hard way his freshman year eating a late lunch on campus and arriving home with insufficient appetite not a word of protest from mama as she wrapped his uneaten dinner in foil but those sad looks tonight hed gorge as she sat and watched him eventually hed try to get her to talk about her day shed claim it was boring and want to know about the exciting world he lived in hed resist then finally parcel out a few details not the crime stuff the numbers and polysyllables a few wellchosen polysyllables always impressed mama when he tried to simplify his language she stopped him told him she understood she didnt have a clue what he was talking about in any language multiple regression analysis and percentage of variance accounted for were incomprehensible except to the initiated but he knew better than to patronize her sensitive guy that he was one of the initiated whatever that meant hed dozed off and dreamed when the bus came to a quick stop jolted awake he looked up in time to see the driver throw out a homeless man whod failed to produce the fare angry words and clenched fists shot through the buss wheezing door as the wretchedly filthy evictee stood in the gutter and howled vengeance isaac watched the man bent over in shame turned tiny by the buss departure the driver cursed and put on speed the cusp of violence so much of the crime isaac had studied began that way not the june murders though they were something different he was sure of it you could lie with numbers but the numbers hed divined werent lying now to convince detective connor petra thinking of her by name was unsettling it reminded him that she was a woman he sat lower in his seat wanting to sink out of view not that any of his coriders were the least bit interested in him some were regulars and surely recognized him but no one spoke the geek in the borrowed suit occasionally someone a woman not unlike his mother smiled as he boarded but for the most part everyone wanted to rest the somnolent express before being wakened his dreams had been pleasant something featuring detective connor petra had he been in it he wasnt sure she had lithe and graceful that efficient helmet of black hair the crisp features ivory skin blue vein tracings at the periphery she wasnt anywhere close to the contemporary female ideal blond busty bubbly she was the antithesis of all that and isaac respected her doubly for being herself not giving in to crass social pressures a serious person there seemed to be very little that amused her she always dressed in black her eyes were dark brown but in a certain light they appeared black as well searching eyes working eyes not vehicles for flirtation the overall impression was a young morticia addams and isaac had heard other detectives refer to her as morticia but also as barbie that he didnt get there was plenty about hollywood division about police work in general that continued to elude him his professors thought academia was complex but now after time spent with cops it was all he could do not to burst out in laughter at departmental meetings petra was no barbie just the opposite focused intense hed lain awake in bed more than once imagining what her breasts looked like only to shake himself out of that appalled at his vulgarity small firm breasts stop still she was a beautiful woman chapter petra stayed at her desk until well after midnight forgetting about isaac and his theories and anything else that didnt relate to the paradiso shootings she talked to some hollywood gang cops and their cohorts in ramparts theyd heard nothing about the killings being turfrelated but promised to keep checking then she attempted to recontact all eighteen kids shed interviewed in the parking lot twelve were home in five cases scared andor indignant parents tried to block access petra charmed her way past all of them but the teens reiterated complete ignorance among the six she didnt reach were her two nervous ones bonnie ramirez and sandra leon no answer at either number no machines she got on the computer figuring to surf her way through some more missing kid sites her mail tag was up so she checked that first departmental garbage and an email from mac dilbeck p luc and i were out in the field today nothing at our end what about yours theres talk if we dont make progress of giving it over to homspec wouldnt that be fun maybe we should pick your genius kids brain we could use a good brain to pick around here m she emailed back nothing plus nothing equals youknowwhat going home tomorrow i check out a couple of nervous ws planning to take the genius along though if you want him you can have him p but once she logged off and got her purse from her locker the thought of an empty apartment repelled her filling herself a cup of detectiveroom coffee she bought some insomnia someone had left half a box of sweet rolls out by the machine the pastries looked none too fresh the custard ones were hardening around the edges but the apple seemed passable so she brought it back to her desk along with the mochaflavored liquid plumber kaplan and salas had left and no one had replaced them she sat there alone going through old messages and nonessential mail filling out a longoverdue pension form and one for departmental health insurance what remained was isaacs summary june she separated the hollywood cases from the others copied down the vics names got back on the computer and logged on to the stations stat file just as isaac claimed all four remained open of the four primary ds assigned to the case she recognized two neil wahlgren had caught the most recent murder curtis hoffey the twentyyearold male hustler jewell blank the runaway teen bludgeoned in griffith park had been assigned to max stokes neil had transferred to one of the valley divisions wanting to cut down on drivetime a while back not too long after hoffey and max stokes had retired nearly a year ago meaning both cases could have gotten short shrift both neil and max were competent bythebooks guys would they have taken the time to work whodunits hard knowing they were leaving soon petra wanted to think so the cases were certain to have been transferred but the computer didnt list the newly assigned detectives onward to the next one coral langdon the woman whod died with her dog up in the hollywood hills that one had been handled by shirley lenois seeing her name made petras eyes ache when petra had started at hollywood shirley had been the only other female homicide d a short stocky fiftytwoyearold woman with a corona of yellowgray hair shirley looked more like a substitute teacher than a detective married to a motorcycle vet in traffic division she had five kids and treated petra like the sixth going out of her way to make things smooth for the homicide virgin making sure there were tampons in the ladies room because no one else would give a damn last december shirley had died in a skiing accident up at big bear stupid tree stupid goddamn tree petra cried silently for a while then wiped her eyes and moved on to the fourth hollywood murder first of the six chronologically the killing that began isaacs alleged series marta doebbler the woman whod gone to the theater with her friends six years ago well before petras time two detectives shed never heard of a diii named conrad ballou and dii named enrique martinez cops were leaving the department faster than they were coming in maybe another couple of retirees maybe ballou and martinez had done their best anyway sometimes that didnt matter chapter when petra showed up at ten the following morning isaac was at his corner desk poring over documents pretending not to notice her arrival she felt hungover and queasy in no mood for babysitting by tentwenty shed swallowed two cups of coffee and was ready to pretend to be human she got up waved isaac toward the door and he followed her carrying his briefcase over no more suit but not the buttondown and khakis dark blue slacks navy shirt a navy tie dressing for ridealong that monotone thing young guys did nowadays cute though on isaac it looked a bit like a costume they exited the building together but didnt talk petra left her accord in its spot and took the unmarked shed signed out from the motor pool nosmoking regulations had been in effect for years but the car reeked of stale cigars and when she started the engine it protested before kicking in bad equipment she told isaac talk to councilman reyes about that we dont talk on a regular basis she steered out onto the street he wasnt smiling had she offended him too bad what were going to do today she said is recontact two witnesses both are sixteenyearold girls both seemed nervous when i interviewed them the first time one might have a reason to be nervous that has nothing to do with the case shes got leukemia isaac said that would do it you okay sure im asking because you seem a bit quiet i dont have anything to say a beat as opposed to most of the time nah she said youre not gabby youre smart more silence she steered the unmarked clunker through smoggy hollywood streets isaac looked out the window eric did that when she drove eric noticed things she said smart people have a right to talk isaac its the dummies who get on my nerves finally a smile but it faded quickly im here to observe and to learn i appreciate your taking the time no prob she headed down hollywood boulevard to western then over to los feliz figuring to catch the golden state freeway then switch to the east all the way to boyle heights the first girl is named bonnie anne ramirez she lives on east th you know the area not well its mostly mexican there and he was salvadoran telling her subtly were not all alike petra said bonnies sixteen but shes got a twoyearold baby the fathers some guy named george who doesnt sound like a prince they dont live together bonnie dropped out of school no comment for half a block then isaac said she was nervous a defiant nervousness which could just mean she doesnt like the police she has no record but in a neighborhood like that you could get away with plenty of stuff without having your name on a file thats the truth said isaac the fbi estimates that for every crime an apprehended criminal commits another six go undetected my preliminary research shows its probably higher really most crime doesnt even come close to being reported the higher the crime rate in a given area the more thats true makes sense said petra the system doesnt come through people stop believing poor people are dispirited in general take my neighborhood in fifteen years weve had our apartment broken into three times my bikes been stolen my fathers been mugged and had his car ripped off my little brothers been held up for lunch money and i cant tell you how many times my mothers been threatened by drunks or junkies when she comes home from work weve been spared anything serious but you hear gunshots at least twice a week and sirens a lot more often than that petra said nothing it used to be worse he went on when i was a little kid before the crash units got active there were blocks you just didnt walk wear the wrong shoes and you were dead crash worked pretty well then after the ramparts scandal antigang policing was cut back and the bad stuff started to rise again his mouth set and his hands had balled petra drove for a while i can see why youd study crime maybe that was a mistake what do you mean the more i get into it the more it seems to be a waste of time most of my professors are still hung up on what they call root causes to them that means poverty and race even though they consider themselves liberal the truth is most poor people just want to live their lives like anyone else the problem isnt poor people its bad people who prey on the poor because the poor lack resources petra mumbled assent isaac didnt seem to have heard maybe i shouldve gone straight to med school get out finish my specialty training make some money and move my parents to a decent neighborhood or at least get my mom a car so she doesnt have to fend off the drunks and the junkies a beat not that my mother would ever learn to drive scared shes kind of set in her ways mothers can be like that said petra how would you know okay here we go the freeway looks pretty good bonnie ramirez lived with her mother three older brothers and little rocky in a tiny yellow clapboard bungalow that sat behind rusting chain link block after block of similar homes comprised the tract built for returning gis the houses ranged from decrepit to sparkling effort had been made to keep up the ramirez home the twopace lawn was sunken and brown but trimmed and impatiens in uneven beds struggled with the early spring heat a baby stroller sat on the wooden porch along with a plaster pedestal spraypainted gold that served no apparent purpose bonnie wasnt home and her mother was caring for rocky the toddler slept in a crib set up in the ninebynine living room the floors were wood and the ceilings were low the house smelled of good food and pine sol and just the merest whiff of dirty diaper anna ramirez was a short broad woman with hair dyed red puffy cheeks and flabby arms the cheeks were so bountiful they pushed her eyes up and turned them to slits it gave her a suspicious look even though she took pains to be cordial her voice and speech inflections were that same boyle heights singsong she invited them to sit and brought out cans of soda and a bowl of pretzels and told them bonnies dad was a vietnam vet whod survived the war only to die in a heavy equipment accident while excavating the foundation for a downtown office building removing his photo from the wall she brandished it like a religious article nicelooking guy in fulldress uniform but bad skin unfortunate legacy for bonnie petra said any idea when bonnies returning anna ramirez shook her head and frowned you just missed her she comes and goes she was out last night slept till ten left out late always rocky stirred in his crib petra said i dont want to wake him its okay said anna he sleeps good she glanced at the pretzel bowl in petras lap and petra ate one can i get you something else to eat officer no thanks maam do you know why were here that shooting in hollywood bonnie told me about it whatd she say that it happened out in the parking lot she heard the shots but didnt see anything she said she talked to a lady cop that was you petra nodded anna ramirez looked over at isaac studied him you look like my nephew bobby isaac smiled weakly petra said one of the kids who was shot was a girl we still havent been able to identify no parents asking about her no ones come forth maam thats sad little rocky peeped shifted bellowed anna ramirez went over and removed him from the crib poor kid was flushed and dyspepticlooking swaddled in too many blankets for the heat anna sat back down and lay her grandson across her commodious lap rocky burped frowned went back to sleep circular dumpling of a face curly black hair very cute petra noticed that his nails were trimmed and the blankets were spotless she said hes beautiful anna ramirez sighed very active so this girl i was wondering if bonnie knew her said petra realizing shed used the singular since entering the house should she include isaac he was sitting there upright and stiff looking like someone waiting for a job interview you didnt ask bonnie if she knew her i did and she said no im just following up anna ramirez frowned you dont believe her its not that its okay sometimes i dont believe her petra hoped her smile was empathetic anna said her brothers all finished school two of them are in jc but bonnie never liked school down deep shes a good girl she glanced down at rocky this was kind of a so now im being mama again so okay its okay its hard to tell bonnie anything but im insisting shes definitely gonna have to get at least her ged what kind of job can you get without that petra nodded anna sighed again anyway maam when she gets home if youd be so kind as to give me a call sure said anna this girl you think she couldve been with bonnie i really cant say maam what did she look like short a little heavy she wore pink sneakers that could be jacqui said anna ramirez jacqui olivares shes short and she used to be much fatter till she lost weight but shes still not skinny and shes got problems what kind of problems two kids a boy and a girl and shes only seventeen have you ever seen her in pink sneakers anna touched a finger to her mouth rocky stirred again and she bounced him gently on her knees smoothed sweaty hair off his little brow no she said i never noticed that but jacqui doesnt come around here no more i told bonnie i didnt want her here bad influence said petra you bet i have a picture of the unidentified victim maam but i need to warn you its not pretty a dead picture yes maam i seen dead people saw my rudy dead go ahead petra produced the least deathly of the morgue shots and handed it to her anna said thats not jacqui i never seen this girl the address sandra leon had given wasnt far from the ramirez home but when they got there petra knew shed been had the numbers matched a boardedup bodega on a rundown stretch of abandoned homes backed by weedchoked alleys graffiti everywhere angry young men with shaved heads and eyefilling tattoos cruised the rutted streets bopping staring sneering petra got out of there fast drove to soto avenue not far from the county morgue and into the lot of a busylooking gas station where she bought coffee for herself and a coke for isaac he tried to pay her back but she wouldnt hear it as they drank she got the number for western pediatrics hospital asked for oncology and waited a long time to be connected the secretary on the other end said thats confidential when she asked for sandra leons address petra lied easily i have reason to believe that ms leon is in danger because of her illness because of a crime a multiple murder that she witnessed long pause you need to speak to her physician please connect me the last name is leon okay here it is sandra nomiddlename that would be dr katzman ill put you through what petra got on the other end of the line was a soft male voice on tape this is dr bob katzman ill be traveling for the next two weeks but i will be picking up messages if this is a medical emergency the oncology oncall extension is petra hung up and reconnected to the secretary dr katzmans gone for two weeks all i need is sandra leons address youre with the police i am the police honey detective connor petra spelled it hollywood division heres my badge number and you can call to verify no thats okay ill give you medical records five minutes later petra had the address sandra leon had listed on her intake form the girl had signed herself into care is she an emancipated minor i wouldnt know said the records clerk is there any adults name on the form um doesnt seem to be detective who pays her bills ccs childrens cancer service its a county fund no family members said petra shes not the only one said the clerk we get runaways all the time this is hollywood the other address sandra had used was on gower north of hollywood minutes from the station if you were in an energetic mood you could walk petra got back on the freeway see what i mean she told isaac tedious i think its interesting he said what is the process how you go about putting it all together petra didnt believe shed put anything together she glanced over at isaac not a trace of irony on his face he said i also find it interesting the way people relate to you bonnies mother for example she clearly saw you as an authority figure and that caused her to be respectful shes a conventional woman proud of her husbands military service takes her responsibilities seriously as opposed to her daughter yes generation gap said petra generational breakdown he said people in bonnies generation see themselves as free from convention and regulation you think thats bad isaac smiled ive been instructed by my dissertation committee not to make value judgments until the data are all in we aint in school go a little crazy he fingered his tie i think an extremely open society is a doubleedged sword some people take advantage of freedom in a healthy way others cant cope on balance id opt for too much freedom sometimes when i can get my father to talk he tells us about el salvador i know the difference between democracy and the alternatives theres no country as great as america in the twentyfirst century except for people who cant cope with too much freedom and they said isaac have you to contend with gower street unit eleven of a twentyunit apartment complex the color of honeydew melon set midway between hollywood boulevard and franklin avenue okay said petra getting out of the car lets see what our little fibber has to say for herself when she scanned the mailboxes near the front door unit eleven was registered to hawkins a no leon on any of the slots the front door was unlocked they climbed the stairs and walked to the rear of the hallway where number eleven was tucked petra rang the bell and a very tall black man in a green sweater and brown slacks answered the door white snowflakes were printed at the neck and cuffs of the sweater a skithing in june an intricate zigzag cornrow sheathed his highdomed head one of those architectural masterpieces nba pros liked to sport rapidograph pen in one hand ink stains on his fingertips what petra could see of the apartment was spare and wellkept drafting table pushed up against a window a cloud of incense drifted out to the hall yes said the man twirling the pen afternoon sir said petra flashing the badge im looking for sandra leon who petra repeated the name she listed this apartment as her address maybe she lived here once upon a time but not for at least a year because thats how long ive been here a year said petra twelve months and two weeks to be exact twirl twirl big grin i promise you my names not sandra petra smiled back what would it be sir alexander hawkins artist when im allowed to be mostly i work at a travel agency serenity tours over at crossroads of the world another grin if that matters it doesnt said petra unless you know sandra leon is she an attractive young lady who appreciates art said hawkins shes a sixteenyearold girl who may have witnessed a murder hawkins turned serious no i dont know any sandra leon is there an inhouse landlord or manager i wish these luxury accommodations are shepherded by franchise realty headquartered in the golden city of downey i was just on the phone with their answering machine little insect problem i can give you the number know it by heart back in the car petra called the company the previous occupant of unit eleven had been a family named kim and theyd been there for five years no leons had rented any apartments in the building during the seven years franchise had managed the place she hung up told isaac sandra lied twice and that makes me real interested in her back on the phone she left a detailed message for dr bob katzman isaac said now what petra said now we return to the station and i try to locate little ms leon when i hit a wall which will probably be sooner rather than later ill take a closer look at those files of yours ive been looking into june to see if theres some sort of historical significance the best criminal link ive come up with is that john dillinger was born on that day i suppose that could be inspirational to a sociopath but dillinger was a bank robber a grandstander very dramatic the epitome of a conspicuous felon from what i can tell this killers just the opposite hes been picking a variety of victims in order to embed his pattern this killer pattern the kid was convinced of one dark hand behind all six cases ah impetuous youth as petra began the short drive back to wilcox isaac said something else took place on june the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand june essentially that began world war one there you go said petra someones declared war on the good folk of la chapter it was the wound pattern that snagged her six pm as predicted shed hit the wall on leon sooner rather than later she phoned a nearby mr pizza and called out for a small deepdish with everything on it across the room isaac remained at his corner desk scribbling punching his laptop jotting down notes making a big show out of being inconspicuous when the pie came she went over and offered him a slice he said no thanks tailed her back to her desk hung around as she opened the greasy box petra selected a slice and began picking cheese off the pointed end isaac said have a good evening and left the station she poured herself more coffee played with strings of mozzarella picked up one of the files drank and ate and began to read getting grease on the folders being a little cavalier about it until she came to the autopsy reports six autopsy reports written by six separate coroners the language was nearly identical compression injuries of the occipital skull hit from behind in every autopsy report the weapon was described as heavy and tubular approximately centimeters in diameter in three murders in one in two which was close enough given varying bone densities in people of different ages and sexes two pathologists had been willing to speculate that the bludgeon was metal or hard plastic because no imbedded wood fragments had been found what had been found was lots of blood and bone frags and gobbets of brain matter to petra the weapon sounded like a length of pipe seventyseven centimeters matched three inches on her oldfashioned ruler nice hefty chunk of pipe deep compression injuries all that gore someone if there was a someone liked braining people she started with the detective she knew still on the job neil wahlgren the d on the curtis hoffey case all shed heard was hed transferred somewhere in the valley it took a while but she located his extension at van nuys auto theft petras job trajectory had been just the opposite from chop shops to chopped humans and she wondered why neil had switched he was away from his desk but the vn desk officer gave her his cell and she reached him hey he said barbie from ken and barbie right remembering petra and stu bishop those had been good days thats me she said hey wahlgren repeated he had a hearty voice that sounded genuinely warm petra recalled him vaguely as a big ruddy nord with a bulbous nose the kind you imagined icefishing and quaffing whatever ice fishers quaffed chasing chrome she said no more dbs ten years of dbs was enough give me a nice boosted lexus with gps any day whats up ive been looking at some cold cases and came across one of yours curtis hoffey right away wahlgren said male pross hit over the head thats the one messy messy in terms of crime scene or detection both couldnt make an inch of progress said neil which is no surprise i guess a vic like that twenty years old and from what i could gather hed been on the streets since twelve poor kid probably serviced the wrong john but there was no talk on the street and no prior similars i might have one emphasize might she said someone was combing through old files and came up with half a dozen headbashes that match in terms of wound pattern and weapon guestimology she paused should she go all the way give him the june tiein no too weird not at this point the guy worked auto t anyway why would he care neil said that so well i didnt hear anything about that at the time defensiveness had crept into his voice petra said no way you could its probably nothing who found it said wahlgren an intern who else would have the time what one of those eagle scout types all gungho yup so who caught it after you left dont know schoelkopf said hed handle the transfer he still there still being a total asshole still here she said if he did transfer the case theres no record no surprise said neil even at the time he didnt want me spending too much time on it said we needed to pay attention to gang murders this was a west hollywood case you know what i mean gay gay hooker low probability of closing it and the city council was making noise about gang stuff you get a whodunit with no serious forensics no relatives or politicians breathing down your neck neil trailed off sure said petra the truth was schoelkopf was right about it being a likely dead end and you didnt care to test the assumption so curtis had no family she said using the vics name wanting neil to think about hoffey as a human being at least for a moment no one claimed the body he got bashed up pretty good if i never see another one like it ill be none the worse off chapter jewell blank the fourteenyearold girl murdered in griffith park had relatives but according to detective max stokess notes they hadnt been helpful the mother was grace blank twentynine single a barmaid living with her boyfriend thomas crisp thirtytwo an unemployed trucker and biker type neither had seen jewell for over a year since shed run away from their doublewide on the outskirts of bakersfield neither it appeared had searched for her with any enthusiasm twentynine years old meant grace had given birth to jewell when she was fifteen and petra had a good idea of what came with that another kid in griffith park that made petras stomach knot up as she thought of billy straight same background same escape billy had lived in the park like a feral child scrounging dumpsters for food and narrowly avoiding death but for a happier ending he couldve been sitting on a cloud next to jewell blank petra had rescued billy for the first year after his grandmother took him in theyd stayed in touch regular phone calls occasional outings now billy was fifteen nearly six feet tall and a prepschool junior on his way to stanford mrs adamson confided shed already talked to the dean it had been months since petra had heard from him which was probably good at least from his perspective his life was in order what use would he have for the police she found no record that jewell blanks case had been transferred to another detective max stokes appeared to have worked the case hard getting help as it turned out from shirley lenois the two veteran detectives had scoured the streets interviewed scores of other runaways checked the shelters and the churches and the agencies jewell had squatted on and off in some of hollywoods last remaining abandoned buildings and was known to her streetkid peers as stuckup an assertive panhandler an adroit shoplifter no one could say if shed prostituted herself for money but she had slept with boys for drugs multidrug user weed pills meth acid ecstasy not heroin though everyone agreed needles scared jewell petra returned to the autopsy report avoiding the photos of the little girls head no needle tracks the tox screen revealed significant levels of cannabis alcohol and pseudoephedrine probably from an otc decongestant according to the other kids jewell frequented the park when she got in a bad mood and didnt want to hang with anyone else no shed never spoken of meeting anyone there no there were no boyfriends or regular johns in her life at least not that shed ever mentioned shed been found fully clothed with no evidence of rape the coroners conclusion was that shed been sexually active for some time a premortem snapshot had been stapled to the file what looked to be a school photo of a kid around nine jewell blank had been darkhaired wan freckled reluctant to smile grace blank and thomas crisp wanted to know if the city would pay for funeral expenses max stokess notes were terse on that subject i informed them that death arrangements etc were the familys responsibility respondents were displeased by that info said theyd get back to me jewell blanks body had sat in the morgue for a month before an inglewood mortuary had picked it up for cremation was there any point talking to max disrupting the poor guys retirement by reminding him of one that had gotten away she looked around the room three detectives hunched over piles of paperwork that young goodlooking one eddie baker ryan miller another stud and barney fleischer gaunt bald ancient nearing retirement himself petra walked over to barneys desk he was filling out a requisition form for office supplies demiglasses perched on his beaklike nose his handwriting was tiny pretty almost calligraphic she asked him if he knew where max stokes was corvallis washington he said continuing to write hes got a daughter up there karen shes a doctor never got married so you can probably find her under stokes no curiosity about why petra wanted to know petra thanked him and returned to jewell blanks file skimming a bit more she put it aside called corvallis and got office and home numbers for karen stokes md max answered the phone petra connor he said we were just sitting down for dinner sorry ill call back later no its fine just cold cuts to what do i owe the pleasure picturing maxs ruddy mustachioed face she told him about reviewing the blank file gave him the same nosyintern story youre thinking of reworking it he said dont know yet max depends on what i learn i hope you decide yes maybe you can do better than me i doubt that you never know petra new blood and all that you and shirley thats a lot of detective ability poor shirley so what can i tell you i really dont know max seems to me you guys did all you could i thought we did i still think about that one from time to time poor little girl everyone said she was aggressive had a temper but looking at her such a tiny little thing it was brutal the autopsy report stared up at petra jewells stats fiveone ninetyfour pounds occipital injuries what was the point of all this max stokes was saying with the parents actually just one parent the mother plus that boyfriend of hers solid citizens said petra my gut pegged him thomas crisp as the bad guy your typical trash boyfriend scenario maybe gets a little too close to the daughter you know the coroner said jewell had been having sex for a few years id bet crisp abused her that would be a good reason for running away i never asked him directly just hinted around and he got squirrelly plus he had a felony record bad checks attempted welfare fraud i know its not sex crimes or murder but lowlife is lowlife his attitude in general was bad he didnt even fake caring about jewell i checked him out carefully even drove up to bakersfield guy had an alibi during the time of the murder hed been on a threeday bender with a bunch of other lowlifes first they barcrawled then they bought more booze and went back to the mother and crisps trailer neighbors in the trailer park complained and the police paid a call crisp was definitely in bakersfield the whole time everyone saw him what about the mother she was there too borderline retarded if you ask me she did seem to care a little but every time she started to cry crisp nudged her in the ribs and she shut up his big concern was who was going to pay for the burial i read your notes said petra max sighed what can i tell you sometimes you dont win aint that the truth enjoying retirement i dunno ive been thinking of getting a security job just to get me out of the house sure said petra makes sense anyway good luck on little jewell one more thing max i dont see any transfer i wanted to transfer it to shirley and she wanted to take it because shed already started actually it was she who came to me wanting to partner because shed caught another case couple of years before that probably wasnt the same guy but there were some similarities really said petra yeah said max another headbashing but not a kid some woman up in the hollywood hills that one a dog got killed too what was the name im having a senior moment the name was coral langdon petra said shirley thought the cases might be tied in at first she did but in the end she didnt too many differences what with jewell being a poor runaway and the other one what was her name being a financially comfortable divorcée with a nice house that one lambert lansomething anyway that one shirley had worked the exhusband as the main suspect because the divorce hadnt been friendly plus neighbors said hed always hated the dog he claimed an alibi too but it wasnt much of one sitting at home watching the tube no one else in the apartment but shirley never found anything to contradict him and one neighbor did say his car had been in his driveway around the time of the murder how come shirley didnt get jewell blanks case i assumed she did said max if she did theres no record of it hmm dont know what to tell you petra in the end shirley didnt think blank and the woman with the dog were similars the only thing similar was headbashing langdon that was it something langdon so shirley didnt work jewell huh doesnt appear so thats kind of funny said max you remember shirley tenacious real tragedy what happened to her i didnt even know she skied she thanked max apologized for interrupting his dinner hung up and turned to coral langdons file the murdered womans ex was an insurance salesman named harvey lee langdon insurance tipped you off to the best of motives but harvey had sold property casualty not term life shirley had taken a close look at corals papers anyway and contacted a bunch of insurance companies no juicy policy anywhere no financial ties at all between coral and harvey since their divorce three years ago except for five hundred a month alimony coral langdon had worked as an executive secretary to an aerospace honcho made a fine living on her own the dog brandy had been a bone of contention in the langdon marriage harvey had expressed dismay at his exwifes demise but had smirked when hearing about the cockapoo shirley had transcribed his comments verbatim quotation marks and all stupid little bitch know what her motto was the world is my toilet a shrink could have fun with that harvey had definitely been worth looking at but shirley had made no progress along those lines the modus and the crime scenes two females bludgeoned in wooded areas of hollywood had caused the tenacious detective lenois to make a connection between langdon and jewell blank had she been unimpressed by the june angle most likely she hadnt noticed would shirley astute dogged dedicated have missed something like that sure the date of a homicide was something petra never paid much attention to as a detective shirley would have zeroed in on crime scene details the headbashing like isaac said it was rare in the end shirley had decided the cases werent linked but she hadnt known about two previous headbashings on the exact same date and now shirley was dead and once again there was no evidence the case had been transferred petra studied the photocopied drivers license attached to the file coral langdon had been an attractive woman with a tan oval face under a short cap of blond hair fiveseven onethirty slender probably strong too according to shirleys notes coral had worked out at a gym studied kickboxing meaning whoever had brained her was in good shape and stealthy enough to get her from behind petra visualized it langdon taking the cockapoo out for a nighttime stroll he steps out of the shadows jewell blank wouldve been a whole lot easier a tiny little girl in the park no doubt shirley had wondered about that decided it wasnt a match but six cases on the same date that was different like isaac said statistically significant like isaac said petra figured that phrase would be adhering to her brain for a while she went back and studied the first two murders in detail marta doebbler the twentynineyearold housewife whod gone to see a play at the pantages left for the ladies room and didnt return and geraldo solis the wilshire division case elderly man found sitting at his breakfast room table brains leaking onto a plate of sausage and eggs now there was a charming detail nothing else about the solis file sparked her interest but a notation on marta doebbler gave her pause doebbler had been called out of the theater by a cell phone squawk and the detectives had traced the call to a pay phone around the corner from the theater had someone lured her out the fact that shed complied coupled with her body being dumped in her own car unlike the others said it was someone she knew the detectives had interviewed the husband an engineer named kurt doebbler and remarked that he seemed overly calm doebbler had an alibi home with his and martas nineyearold daughter katya she reread the solis file no sign of breaking and entering someone the old man had known as well no apparent connection between the victims but could it have been the same person she jotted down the names of the ds on both cases conrad ballou and enrique martinez on doebbler another unfamiliar name on solis dii jacob hustaad wilshire division barney fleischer was still at his desk pen in his hand but reading blue folder of his own shed always thought of barney as endofcareer deadweight was he still working cases she approached him again said sorry but i was wondering if you knew any of these guys he closed the murder book a file labeled chang and examined the list got a coldcase assignment selfimposed assignment said petra the kid gomez thought i should look at a few old files the genius said barney nice kid i like him he talks to you from time to time he likes to hear about the old days barney smiled and who better than a geezer like me he put the chang file on his desk thats one i did five years ago no one gives me anything anymore i should leave but im not sure it would be good for me he peered at the list again connie ballous a real oldtimer he was here well before i arrived probably has ten years on me he left around five years ago barney frowned what said petra connie left under somewhat clouded circumstances what kind of circumstances he had a bit of a drinking problem we all knew about it we all covered one night he tanked up got behind the wheel of an unmarked and crashed it into a building on cahuenga that was kind of hard to cover for how was he as a detective when he was sober barney shrugged that wasnt too often no sherlock said petra more like deputy dawg when i knew him but i heard he used to be okay in the early days what about his partner martinez enrique had no big problems but was no great talent either he got tarred by connies brush the brass decided he shouldve reported connies drinking and demoted him down to uniform the obvious question was what about all those other partners connie had ridden with but enrique was the goat i think he went over to central division as a deskman but who knows how long he lasted there hes living in florida now makes sense said barney hes cuban a lush and a notalent there was a good chance marta doebblers murder hadnt been worked to the max nor as far as petra could tell had it been transferred she asked barney about that right away he said schoelkopf he doesnt transfer cases he doesnt like to if theyve gone cold what with all the manpower problems and the gang issues you wouldnt know about that because you tend to solve your cases barney removed his reading glasses and massaged the ridge theyd etched into his nose his eyes were wide clear blue nested in a thatch of wrinkles i know you dont like him petra but i cant say as id do it any different its always a matter of priority cases go cold for a reason who says i dont like him barney grinned and petra returned the favor he looked at the list again said jack hustaads dead suicide not jobrelated we played golf together once in a while jack was a fourpackaday smoker got lung cancer started chemotherapy decided he didnt like it and ate some painkillers its not a completely irrational decision right right said petra anyway thanks barney i assume said the old detective that you want your research kept private that would be good said petra no problem said barney i dont like him either chapter the next day mac called a noon meeting on the paradiso shooting he and petra and luc montoya ate sandwiches in a small conference room and compared notes montoya was forty bald muscular with a moviestar face and the longest eyelashes petra had ever seen on an adult he wore a creamcolored sports coat beige linen slacks white shirt pale blue tie very natty but his expression was defeated and he didnt say much mac had on the usual gray sharkskin and unreadable face he and luc had dived into the witness pile come up empty and no local gang rumors were flying petra told them about sandra leons lies luc gnawed his lip mac said so we have no idea where this kid lives petra shook her head mac said that doctor of hers think he might know ive got a call in maybe you can find him before his vacations over meanwhile im heading over to compton they had a shooting last year bangers rap concert cruiseby in the parking lot three down on that one no solve but they have ideas and i figured wed compare notes misery and company and all that petra called dr robert katzmans office again talked to the machine switched to the oncology office and got assertive with a secretary who transferred her to the department administrator a woman named kim pagionides sandra leon said pagionides as if she knew the girl as if she disapproved of the girl petra said youve seen her recently oh no small nervous laugh no i dont think so ill have dr katzman get in touch when he gets back i need to speak to him now im sure hes busy so am i where exactly is he traveling to a bunch of cities hes delivering papers at four scientific meetings important papers were talking about saving lives and im talking about destroyed lives so maybe the good doctor will be able to relate silence kim pagionides said let me check his calendar a few moments later hes in baltimore at johns hopkins heres his cell phone thank you youre welcome punching the cell number elicited an identical dr bob katzman message mellow and reassuring the physicians whod treated her dad before he died from alzheimers couldve learned something from katzman about bedside manner petra tried to keep her own voice serene but she felt shed barked at dr bob so be it it was one fortythree pm and isaac hadnt come in yet and that was just fine with petra less distraction she called the lapd pension office and asked for current stats on retired detectives conrad ballou and enrique martinez martinez was living in pensacola florida but ballou was relatively local out in palmdale a onehour freeway drive if you danced around the speed limits with nothing more to do on the paradiso case and feeling lonely and itchy a onehour drive didnt sound halfbad she decided to take her own car wanted to listen to her own music as she headed for her accord someone called her name for the merest foolish moment she hoped it would be eric the last time theyd met in the lot in a movie hed be back she turned saw isaac jogging toward her wearing a white shirt khakis and sneakers briefcase slapping against his thigh hey she said whats up i got held up at school hoped id get here in time to catch you some new bit of data no i just thought if it was okay i could ride with you petra didnt answer and isaac flinched that is if it doesnt pose a problem its fine she said actually im heading out to talk to someone on one of your june cases his eyes widened so you do see the validity of the i think youve put together something interesting and seeing as ive got nothing else to do why not check it out heading toward the onramp she said theres one thing we need to keep clear this isnt an official investigation its important to be discreet about talking to anyone else period her voice had stiffened isaac shifted his body toward the passenger door sure of course especially captain schoelkopf said petra he doesnt like me never has going off on a tangent when ive got a bigtime active case could complicate my situation further also it looks as if he had specific feelings about the june murders in every case the investigating detective left for one reason or another some retired some moved to other divisions some died by itself thats not unusual since the riots and the ramparts scandal theres been tons of turnover in the department what is a bit unusual is that none of the files were transferred to new detectives thats because schoelkopf doesnt like transferring cold cases so on the infinitesimal chance that we actually learn something about any of these murders its not going to reflect well on him a long silence filled the car before isaac said ive complicated things thats okay said petra truth is these victims deserve more than they got a few moments later why doesnt he like you because hes got poor taste isaac smiled i dont think he likes me either how much contact have you had with him the initial interview and we pass in the hall from time to time he pretends not to notice me dont take it personally said petra hes a misanthrope but he does have poor taste yes he does said isaac she hooked onto the then shifted to the driving northeast through the beginnings of antelope valley passing through burbank and glendale and pasadena along the way the rocky outcroppings and green belt that were angeles crest national forest the site of bedros kashigians final moments and every psychopaths favorite dump spot pretty today under a trueblue sky barely blemished by wispy clouds nice scene to paint she should get her portable easel out here find a cozy plein air spot and go to town it had been a long time since shed painted anything with color as the drive stretched on she told isaac about being impressed by the wound patterns and everything else shed learned about the six murders he said similar dimensions that i didnt notice and none of the detectives had noticed june youd have to be looking for it ill be more careful in the future said isaac the future he said that call from the phone booth is interesting the possibility that it might be someone mrs doebbler knew what if mr solis knew him as well someone familiar to all the victims i thought of that she said but its a leap still its possible if our killer was acquainted with all six victims he had a pretty wide social network were talking runaways male hustlers executive secretaries retirees and that navy ensign hochenbrenner i havent even looked at his file yet isaac was staring out at the desert if hed heard her little speech it wasnt apparent finally he said mr solis had breakfast food on his plate but the murder occurred around midnight people eat at odd hours isaac did mr solis dont know she said what you think the bad guy dished up sausage and eggs after bashing in soliss head and served it to a corpse isaac squirmed shed grossed him out and it gave her perverse satisfaction he said i really dont have much of a database from which to make a judgment a culinary killer she cut him off as if its not complicated enough he kept quiet the car got hot ten degrees warmer out here in the desert a warm june to begin with june today was the fourth if there was anything to this craziness someone else would die in twentyfour days she said so have you come up with any other notable june occurrences in the historical archives nothing profound he spoke quietly kept his eyes aimed at the window intimidated bad petra mean petra hes just a kid tell me anything youve found she said it could be important isaac half turned toward her basically ive been logging into various almanacs printed some lists long lists but nothing jumps out here ill show you what i mean snapping open his briefcase he groped around removed a batch of papers i looked at birthdays and the farthest back i got was june which is when sigismund the emperor of hungary and bohemia was born was he a bad guy your basic autocratic king isaacs finger trailed down a long row of smallprint items then theres pope paul iv the artist peter paul rubens another artist jean jacques rousseau a few actors mel brooks kathy bates like i said it stretches on thats how i came up with john dillinger any bad guys other than dillinger not on the birthday list when i looked at june as a date of death i found a few more but none of them appear connected to this type of thing this type of thing said petra a serial killer the term set her teeth on edge too tv too damn hard to solve she kept her voice light and pleasant which bad guys died that day pieter van dort a dutch smuggler they hanged him on june thomas hickey a colonial soldier convicted of treason was hung in theres not much more until when joseph columbo a new york mafioso was gunned down ten years later ayatollah mohammad beheshti a founder of the iranian islamic party was killed in a bomb explosion though i suppose his being a bad guy would depend upon your political persuasion anything of a more wacko criminal nature a ted bundy a hillside strangler no nothing like that sorry he said in terms of historical events theres been plenty of misery on june but no more than any other day at least i cant find any statistically significant difference historys based on tragedy and upheaval as well as on the accomplishments of notable people he rolled the papers into a tight tube drummed his thigh i cant believe i missed similarities in the weapon dimensions stop beating yourself up said petra she switched on the radio tuned to a station that played harder rock than she was accustomed to filled her head with thunderdrums and guitar feedback and screaming testosteroneladen vocals until the mountains got higher and static buried the noise june she drove faster they were well past angeles crest now zipping past canyon after canyon at eightyfive miles an hour passing low graybrown bowls of highdesert to the east a smallcraft airport hugged the freeway followed by scatters of whitebox storage buildings and factories then tracts of redtileroofed houses in the distance laid out neatly in the dirt between the structures petra spied tiny green lawns the occasional turquoise pool lots of space between developments antelope valley was booming but there was still plenty of room to move a sign heralding the approach of palmdale came into view and petra pronounced the citys name isaac said it used to be called palmenthal founded by germans and swiss it got anglicized around the turn of the century petra said really as if you needed to know that hey she said educations good for the soul where do you pick up stuff like that i had an advanced geography placement in high school mostly independent study i researched several cities in la county and the surrounding areas it was a surprise youd think everything had hispanic roots but many places didnt eagle rock that used to be called the switzerland of the west back when the air was good ancient history said petra he said extraneous information tends to float in my head and sometimes it seeps out through my mouth and sometimes she said you come up with interesting stuff she exited at the first palmdale exit checked her thomas guide and drove toward the address on conrad ballous retirement forms around three miles east knowing about ballous alkieburnout history she figured him to be living in a depressing pensioners sro or worse and the first few neighborhoods she passed were pretty sad but then the environment took a swing upward the same kind of tileroofed tracts shed spotted from the freeway some big houses gated enclaves ballous place was a mediumsized spanish house in a pretty development named golden ridge heights where the trees palms and paperbarked things had grown sizable and some of the lawns sported mature shrubbery lots of motor homes and motorcycle trailers pickups and suvs the streets were wide clean and quiet and the houses had rear yards that looked out to desert panorama sharpedged mountains served as a backdrop too quiet for petras taste but she imagined warm silent starstudded nights and thought that might not be too bad she pulled to the curb and crows scattered a tenyearold ford halfton sat in ballous driveway the neighbors on both sides sported basketball hoops over the garage yards that were more cement than grass ballous place was done up beautifully with creeping dwarf junipers impeccable mounds of mondo grass lush sago palms and little crosscut tubes of bamboo lining the pebbled walkway a length of bamboo dipping toward a stone pot served as a fountain and the water trickle was a continuous soprano a japanophile it didnt look like an alkies place maybe the pension offices data bank was out of date as was so much lapd data she shouldve phoned first before wasting the time and the gas now shed look like a doofus in front of mr genius japanese letters were etched into the teak panels of the front door above a weathered brass knocker shaped like a fish a carp koi the type alex delaware kept in that cute little pond of his petra used the knocker the man who opened the door was short bandylegged lean but for a protruding belly that hung over his belt buckle koi belt buckle sixtyfive to seventy with a shaved sunburnt head and drooping white mustaches he wore a denim work shirt jeans red suspenders and laceup boots a white handkerchief flapped from his rear pocket he looked petra and isaac over rubbed his hands together as if hed just finished washing them clear eyes pale blue no boozeblear sharp eyes actually he said i only sell on the weekend detective ballou the mans hands stopped moving now the eyes were twin specks of granite been a long time since anyone called me that petra showed him her id he shook his head im out of all that breed and sell fish and dont think about the past he started to step back into the house petra said marta doebbler ever think about her conrad ballou moved his jaw around cant say that i do cant say that i give a damn about any of that it hasnt been that long sir six years im looking into some cold cases including doebbler if i could pick your brain nothing to pick said ballou rubbing his bald head according to the shrinks the department sent me to he looked ready to spit i couldve saved them the trouble i wasnt nuts i was a drunk thank god i didnt kill anybody he shook his head they shouldve tossed my can out long before they did damn department so you miss police work said petra ballou glared at her smiled laughed you like fish to eat to look at cmon in and bring the intern with you the house was rescued from tractcliché by a trove of asian furnishings vegetabledye rugs rosewood tables porcelain vases and planters paper screens on the walls all portraying brocaded koi way too much stuff for the space and to petras eye nothing pricey the kind of gaudy overlacquered stuff you could pick up in any chinatown or little tokyo tourist trap ballou led them past all that through rear double doors and out to the backyard what had been a backyard every inch of the quarteracre space had been converted to fish ponds sheets of mesh on stakes roofed the entire area casting shade cooling the desert air beyond the water was a high bamboo fence and a neighbors rv lots of burbling but the ponds werent attractive like alexs these were simply rectangular cement tanks a dozen of them arranged in a grid with a walkway between them not clear like alexs either green water soupy the only movement on the surface was created by aeration tubes but when conrad ballou approached the first pond the surface broke and scores no hundreds of little golden and pinkish fishy faces popped through flapping gulping gasping ballou pointed to the nearest wall where bright blue plastic bins were piled in a heap next to a mess of nets nearby stood a gumball machine instead of candy the glass bell was filled with little rustcolored balls half the size of a pea ballou motioned them over to the machine toss in a quarter petra did he took her hand and cupped it below the spout turned the handle and little balls tumbled out and her nose filled with the aroma of ripe seafood feed em said ballou its fun which pond that one theyre babies need the nutrition motioning toward the first pond where the little fish were still clamoring petra walked over and tossed in the pellets and a finned riot ensued isaac was already three ponds ahead bending low and examining the fish that had risen to greet him larger ones red and black and gold and blue he said mr ballou do you use domestic stock or are these from niigata ballou lowered his gaze and stared at the kid you know koi ive admired them said isaac my mothers employers have a pond admire them huh said ballou then get into it yourself isaac laughed something funny son its a bit beyond my budget and space i live in an apartment hmm said ballou then get yourself a good job work your tail off and buy a house pay down the mortgage a bit and reward yourself with a japanese garden and a pond full of nishikigoi nothing like em to lower your blood pressure isaac nodded you do all that son come back and buy some fish from me and ill give you a free karasu thats the black one symbol of good luck petra said i could use some luck on marta doebbler ballou said here we were talking about pleasant things you drink tea back in his kitchen he poured steaming green liquid into three stoneware cups dont think im some fanatic asian culture soothes me when i got out of rehab a koi dealer a nice old man in gardena hired me to mop up his place i mopped for two years kept my mouth shut started asking questions by the third year learned a bit he died and put me in his will left me some of his breeding stock that motivated me to buy this place set up a little weekend business its real peaceful i dont think about my other job with fondness petra sipped the hot aromatic tea marta doebblers a good example said ballou ugly scene when i think of the things i got used to working homicide he placed a thumb under his suspenders gazed absently through the window then back at isaac you seem like a nice kid why would you wanna do this to yourself petra said isaacs going to be a doctor meanwhile hes getting a phd in biostatistics meanwhile said ballou appraising isaac all over again were talking einstein isaac muttered hardly flushed clear through his nutmeg complexion pink as mediumrare beef petra said can we talk about doebbler chapter what i remember said conrad ballou was that the husband was interesting he returned to his tea gave no indication of having more to say petra said interesting as in prime suspect the old guy nodded there was no evidence tying him to it everyone said him and the vic were getting along fine but i liked him for it he put his cup down his reaction to his wifes death was off stoneface not a tear when i did the notification call i brought a pocket full of tissues like i always did didnt end up using one doebbler just stood there with this flat look in his eyes sometimes that happens before they fall apart i kept waiting he just stood there staring for a second i thought hed gone into one of those whatchamacallit seizures then he says i guess youd better come in guys an engineer said petra so what it doesnt explain it but sometimes that type remembering her days as a faculty brat dr kenneth connor professor of anthropology at the university of arizona tucson squiring his little daughter to academic soirees meeting the tenured crowd finding most of them regular folk with slightly higher iqs a few crashing bores a few really reprehensible jerks the type said ballou engineers physicists mathematicians all those megabrains sometimes they dont react emotionally the way the rest of us do ballou glanced at isaac as if wanting confirmation straight from the source isaac pushed a smile onto his lips ballou said well doebbler was a kind of rocket scientist i guess worked over at pacific dynamics electronics stuff some sort of computer job anything else besides his demeanor make you suspect him she was called out of the theater it had to be someone familiar with her schedule who else would know where she was and who else couldve gotten her to leave the theater without telling her friends where she was going the husband claiming an emergency said petra maybe about the daughter that wouldve brought her out ballou agreed the kid was doebblers alibi hed been home with her all night marta was having a girls night out i talked to the three friends she went with no one had anything juicy to offer about martas private life but when i pressed them i could tell they didnt like kurt one even said she thought hed done it that hadnt been in the murder book petra said thats pretty strong she didnt like him no one seemed to howd he and marta meet germany she was a brain too studying astronomy he was a foreign exchange student after they got married she dropped out and became a fulltime mom that could be frustrating sure thats what i thought said ballou maybe she tried to reduce her frustration the oldfashioned way but if she was having an affair i never found evidence of it petra said did you talk to the daughter poor little thing didnt want to pressure her ballou tugged at his mustache she sure reacted crying all over the place youd think doebbler wouldve tried to comfort her all he did was offer her juice juice a glass of orange juice here drink youll feel better like vitamin c would help with losing her mother ballou emitted a dry hoarse laugh i wouldve loved to make him for it how come youre reopening it it may be related to some others others you suspect doebbler did others with some similar forensics long silence you could hear the burbling of the fish ponds here in the kitchen then a loud splash spawning season said ballou they jump sometimes they jump clear out of the pond and if i dont get there in time ive got a dead fish he got up peered out the window sat back down so far so good you want to tell me about these others five other brainings said petra yearly intervals all on june ballou gawked youre putting me on wish i was before marta all after marta from what we can tell she was the first if its a series if said ballou all on the same day that sounds pretty convincing but the victims are all over the place in terms of sex age and race she gave him a few details see what you mean still so howd you discover this department finally doing something about working cold ones mr gomez here found them ballou studied isaac yet again did you by accident said isaac bullshit i dont believe in accidents my smashing into a building was no accident it was stupidity and your finding all this out wasnt an accident it was smarts he leaned over suddenly clapped the kid on the shoulder youre definitely going to deserve a pond one day a big one youre going to afford it and youre going to build it and im going to stock you with beauties i hope forget hope smarts and hard work does it every time thats how i pulled myself out of the shit pile to petra theres one more thing youll want to know about marta we recovered some blood in the car that wasnt hers petra didnt recall that from the chart as if reading her mind ballou said it came out later after the autopsy report just a speck the tech who scraped the upholstery mislaid it and it got filed in the wrong place by the time it got to me i might not have been in a state to keep good records he pulled out his handkerchief blew his nose said all i remember is it wasnt hers she was a positive and this was o negative kurts o positive so it didnt mean much but maybe if she had a boyfriend he shrugged petra said nothing yeah yeah said ballou it wasnt my finest hour but big deal real life aint the forensic files wheres the blood sample if its anywhere its at the coroners okay she said thanks any fluids on any of your other cases said ballou doesnt say so in the mbooks but stuff doesnt get in there irritated and not afraid to show it ballou got to his feet heavily and slowly thats all i can tell you so have a nice day pleasant lady marta from all i heard the familys back in germany they came over mother father sister took the body back had that shellshocked look i think i put their addresses and numbers in the murder book you did said petra good said ballou sometimes im not sure what i did and didnt do back then as they drove away from golden ridge heights isaac said someone marta knew and home with his daughter isnt much of an alibi not much petra agreed with the girl sleeping he couldve phoned marta with some ruse lured her done the deed and come back none of her blood in the car says she was killed elsewhere and pains were taken to keep the vehicle clean doebblers car or just a neatfreak murderer but before we jump on that wed need to assume the techs didnt miss anything that happen a lot said isaac more than you want to know one thing intrigues me though marta was the only victim whose dead body was then moved by the killer so maybe that does synch with someone who knew her she retraced the drive through the outskirts of palmdale and got back onto the isaac said a man killing his wife and then going on to kill strangers is pretty unusual right cant say that ive ever heard of it more commonly you get some slimeball serial balancing a wife or a girlfriend raising kids having barbecues with a secret life the human mask said isaac we all wear em petra exited the at brand boulevard in glendale drove north to a quiet pretty part of the street and pulled over shed brought copies of ballous notes and rifled through them until she found kurt doebblers work and home numbers it was just after five meaning he could be either place the home was on rosita avenue in tarzana clear across the valley to the west at this hour at least an hours drive she ran a dmv check doebbler was listed as still there two cars registered in his name a twoyearold infiniti coupe and a threeyearold toyota wagon if hed coveted martas opel sedan it hadnt been to keep the darn thing the daughter katya would be fifteen too young to drive but kurt had indulged himself with two sets of wheels secret life she asked isaac whats your schedule like when now i was going to work on organizing my source material it can wait i can drop you off just as easily as go on go on where to kurt doebblers house now said isaac aint no time like now she said its okay if i come along sure lets do it he said excitement in his voice then could i borrow your phone please ill let my mother know i wont be home for dinner chapter busiest freeway in the state busiest time of day from burbank to encino they rolled and stopped and waited averaging ten miles per petra finally managed to exit at balboa she took ventura boulevard the rest of the way encountered gridlock foul tempers distracted cell phone gabbers some truly frightening risktaking by the time they reached tarzana she was too grumpy to talk and isaac busied himself by pulling a book out of his briefcase reading and underlining in yellow marker she glanced over saw pages full of equations vowed not to look again math had been her worst subject in school except for geometry where her artistic pretensions had kicked in and shed excelled at drawing complex polygons someone behind her leaned on his horn what am i supposed to do moron drive through the assend of the escalade in front of me she realized her hands ached from gripping the wheel and forced herself to relax isaac smiled what could be funny about equations she said this is the exciting part of police work his smile widened i like it do you at least youve got time to think thats one way to rationalize she said he looked up from his book actually i like everything about your job kurt doebblers house on rosita avenue was a pale gray twostory traditional set in a low spot on the street higher properties behind the front yard was mostly brick and asphalt the door and the shutters were a deeper gray doebblers infiniti a champagnecolored coupe was in view sparkling clean parked in front of it was the gray toyota wagon with one flat tire and a veneer of dust the man who answered the door was nicelooking tall late thirties to early forties with a broadshouldered angular build and a thick mess of wavy dark hair graying at the temples prominent chin and nose generous mouth the kind of sunseams that enhanced some men petra couldnt think of any women who benefited from aging skin he wore a baggy plaid shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows faded jeans white running shoes a dinner plate dangled from one hand in his other was a dish towel droplets on the plate single dad doing his chores from inside the house petra smelled broiled meat dinner was over the drive had taken them that long she could use a steak mr doebbler yes friendly brown eyes slouching posture pinchmarks on his nose said he wore glasses a couple of shaving nicks stippled his neck nothing weird so far lets see how he reacts when she shows him the badge he smiled i thought you were jehovahs witnesses looking over at isaac wellscrubbed kid petra could see that doebbler said is there some kind of trouble in the neighborhood im a homicide detective from hollywood division sir im looking into your wifes murder my wife the smile finally melted down im sorry its my brother kurt you want im thad doebbler you live here too no i live in san francisco had to be down here on business kurt insisted i not stay at a hotel youre reopening martas case martas case never closed sir oh well let me get kurt for you hes up with katya helping her with her homework come on in petra and isaac followed him through a small empty entry foyer into a modest living room up ahead was a narrow walkway that led to the kitchen thad doebbler said one second loped to the kitchen and returned minus the plate and the towel to the left was a rightangled oak staircase human speech filtered down from the second floor a high girlish voice going on for a while a single baritone grunt thad doebbler walked to the bottom of the stairs and stopped i dont want to meddle detective but my brother hes been doing pretty well the past few years has something new come up can i tell him that nothing dramatic said petra were just doing our best to clear cases he rolled his shoulders got it make yourselves comfortable ill go tell kurt youre here petra and isaac sat at opposite ends of a sevenfoot sofa very soft sofa tufted exuberantly white cotton printed with huge red roses and serpentine green vines rolled arms and piped seams and a goldandred fringe running along the bottom cattycorner the couch were two of the starkest black leather chairs petra had ever seen tight black skin on chromium frames no coffee table in the middle just a faded brown needlepoint ottoman that served host to a tv tray and a remote control the entire room was like that feminine touches coexisting uneasily with the obvious signs of male inhabitance one wall was dominated by a bigscreen tv maybe seventy inches wide and nearly empty bookcases nearby was an antique sewing table covered by lace prints of flemish stilllifes hung on the white walls along with two huge brassframed photos of space shuttles blasting off and one of a fighter jet slicing through the wild blue yonder the carpeting was gray the same gray as the house and looked as if it hadnt been cleaned in a while the broiledmeat smell pervaded the man who came down the stairs was even taller than thad doebbler sixfour was petras estimate thinner too the same thick wavy hair as his younger brother but completely gray darker complexion thick eyeglasses in silver frames huge hands dangled similar features to thad but on kurt doebbler they didnt add up to handsome he wore a white polo shirt brown slacks black shoes pausing at the same spot where his brother had stopped he stood there looking at them past them petra said mr doebbler you know that already the line shouldve been accompanied by a smile kurt doebbler just kept staring sorry to interrupt your evening sir doebbler said nothing do you have time to talk sir about marta yes sir doebbler pressed his hands together shifted his eyes to the ceiling as if searching for divine inspiration petra knew that kind of movement as indication of deception doebbler said what about specifically i know its been difficult sir and im sorry sure lets talk said kurt doebbler why not he took one of the black armchairs sat all tight and hunched up long legs drawn up close bony knees shiny brown doubleknit slacks when was the last time shed seen that she said this is going to sound like a stupid question but is there anything youve thought of concerning marta that you didnt tell the original detective six years ago conrad ballou said doebbler he recited a phone number that petra recognized as a station extension i called ballou often sometimes he even called me back even seated he was tall enough to gaze well over petras line of vision it made her feel small was there anything he was a drunk said doebbler i could smell it on him the night he came to tell me he reeked i shouldve complained is he still working as a detective no sir hes retired doebbler didnt budge or blink petra said did you feel better about detective martinez who the other detective assigned to the case the only one i ever talked to was ballou and not very often doebblers lips shifted suddenly to a very unpleasant smile you couldnt even call it a smile obviously you people are wellorganized petra said i know this is tough mr doebbler not tough futile petra said the day your wife disappeared you were here doebbler didnt answer sir that was a statement not a question is it a true statement yes what were you doing homework said doebbler with your daughter she was sleeping my homework you were in school i take work home my job isnt limited to ninetofive you work with computers i develop aerospace software what kind of software aircraft guidance systems integrated spacecraft landing systems doebblers tone said she couldnt hope to understand isaac said circular wave guides storage rings doebbler turned toward the kid aerospace physicists and engineers design storage rings i write the instructions that enable them to be used in a humantomachine context human factors said isaac doebblers hand waved thats psychology to petra have you or havent you learned something new about marta one knee bounced his mouth was set tight petra said it would help me if i had a feel for what marta was like like as a person are you asking what kind of music she liked her taste in clothes that kind of thing said petra she liked soft rock and bright colors she liked the stars astronomy that and she regarded the stars as aesthetic objects said doebbler she wanted the world to be pretty she was smart but that was stupid naive stupid doebbler stared at her she pulled out her pad and made a show of writing stuff down soft rock bright colors kurt doebbler said why are you here were looking into some of our open cases trying to see if we can resolve them ballous cases youre looking at them because he was a drunk and he made serious errors and now youre afraid of scandal no sir just open cases in general only martas was ballous open said doebbler thats a euphemism for failure to you martas a statistic no sir shes was a person thats why id like to know more about her doebbler seemed to consider that he shook his head its been a long time i cant see her face anymore the night she went out said petra what was her mood her mood she was in a fine mood and she gave no indication of planning anything but seeing a play thats what she told me said doebbler his knee pumped faster the hands grasping them were whiteknuckled that question had gotten to him what she told you petra echoed no answer june she said what about it does the date have any significance its the date my wife was murdered what is this some kind of game sir doebbler sprang up made it to the stairs in three long strides ascending the flight two steps at a time he stopped midway i have to help my daughter see yourselves out he disappeared isaac began to get up but when he saw petra remain in place he plopped back down finally she got up and he watched as she paced around doebblers living room widened her circle peered down the passageway to the kitchen took in as many details as she could before footsteps sounded on the stairs and she motioned isaac to the front door her hand was on the knob when thad doebbler said sorry kurts been under stress new stress said petra turning to face him work its a highpressure job really theres nothing more he can tell you about marta did he just tell you that thad shook his head he didnt say a thing just went into his room and closed the door im sorry if hes a bit kurts done his grieving hows your niece thad blinked kurt works hard for her petra said the whole singlefather thing on some topics she was an expert professor kenneth connor had been a jewel of a single dad she could only imagine what growing up with kurt doebbler would be like thad said exactly petra turned the knob and stepped outside thad called after them im sure hell want to know if you learn anything even outside walking to the car the broiledmeat smell hung in her nostrils and she craved dinner isaac had called mama letting her know hed be missing his homecooked meal but petra had an inkling mama would leave something out for her golden boy do i drop you back off or should we hit a coffee shop for some grub he said im not really hungry but ill tag along not hungry petra realized shed never seen him eat then she remembered this one rode the bus wore the same three shirts over and over eating out was probably a onceinawhile mcdonalds jaunt she said lets go she upgraded to a steakandseafood place near the encinotarzana border because it looked unpretentious and not too expensive when she examined the menu she found it higherpriced than she wouldve cared for but so what she was in the mood for substance the dining room beyond the busy bar was cozy and dark set up with red booths dark wood walls and thirtyyearold headshots of nearcelebrities the waitress who came to serve them was a strawberry blonde young and cute and buxom and petra saw her give isaac the once over then she studied petra and curiosity sharpened her eyes wondering whats the relationship here when isaac slid as far from petra in the booth as was possible and petra ordered for him the way you do with a child the waitress smiled after that she flirted shamelessly with the kid he seemed oblivious to all the smiles and hair flipping and backarching and armbrushing with an ample bosom smiling politely and thanking strawberry shortcake profusely for every smidge of service when the food came he kept his head low studied his steak finally cut into it nice thick filet mignon hed claimed to crave a burger but petra had insisted and strawberry had backed her up on that good for strong bones smile flip arch bosombrush almost as an afterthought petra ordered two glasses of burgundy corrupting the youth of today when the wine arrived she decided to forgo the whole sniffing swirling thing not wanting to overwhelm the kid she was ravenous and attacked her surfandturf as if it was schoelkopfs face after a bit of silent snarling she asked isaac how his food was delicious thank you so much hed finished his meat was looking at a baked potato the size of a dogs head big said petra huge probably radioactive some nefarious dnascramble scheme in idaho he laughed cut into the potato so what do you think of mr doebbler hostile and asocial i can see why detective ballou called him strange anything else about him set you off he thought he certainly wasnt cooperative no he wasnt she said but that couldve been our popping in unannounced after all those years of no progress i wouldnt expect him to be a big police groupie a drunk and a noshow lapd at its finest she wondered what isaac thought about that would any of this show up in his dissertation how was she coming across she said unfortunately there are guys like ballou and martinez fortunately theyre in the minority little miss defensive what intrigues me about all that is mr kurt doebbler never complaining to their superiors all that resentment but he kept it to himself isaac put down his knife and fork he wouldnt if he wanted the case to stay unsolved petra nodded amazing he said id never have thought of that they ate some more he said that comment he made about not remembering what his wife looked like sometimes borderline personalities have a problem maintaining mental images of those close to them flat affect also except when they feel theyve been betrayed when that happens they can get pretty emotional betrayed as in the wife having an affair she said that was just ballous offhand comment and im not sure hes worth paying attention to he nodded what are borderline personalities she asked him its a psychiatric disorder involving problems of identity and intimacy difficulty connecting with other people borderlines have higherthanaverage rates of clinical depression and theyre more likely to get involved in substance abuse females tend to punish themselves but male borderlines can get aggressive do they kill their spouses ive never heard that specifically its just something that came to mind petra heard herself saying doebblers an odd one all right but when you lose someone close to you time does have a way of easing things you forget its protective ive heard other relatives of victims say the same thing talking calmly while keeping a lid on what was blowing through her consciousness all those hours poring over snapshots mom and dad dating as college students mom tending to her brothers as infants toddlers little boys mom in a onepiece bathing suit looking gorgeous at lake mead despite the photos it was all she could do to conjure up the merest hint of the woman who had died birthing her her face mustve betrayed something because isaac looked confused she said anyway before we get too psychological about kurt lets remember that his blood type didnt match the sample they scraped off the seat theres absolutely no evidence linking him to the crime and he does have an alibi of sorts she returned to her steak decided she was no longer hungry isaac said so whats next havent figured that out assuming i want to work the case any of them she shot him a fierce smile look what you got me into another classic isaac blush the kids emotional barometer was finetuned everything rose to the surface polar opposite of kurt doebbler the guy was weirdly flat isaac was saying sorry if ive complicated you have said petra but thats okay you did the right thing he kept quiet she cuffed his arm lightly hey i was just having a little fun at your expense he managed a minismile the truth is she went on diving into a half dozen cold cases that are probably unsolvable wasnt what i had in mind when i programmed my day planner but youre right there are too many similarities to dismiss when had she decided that the wound pattern or maybe sooner maybe shed known right away and had just been denying it she said letting it drop would put me in the same box as guys like ballou and martinez so im fine with it okay he murmured something pardon i hope it works out for you it will she said one way or the other listen to her little miss karma you up for dessert before he could answer she was waving at little miss strawberry chapter isaac knew hed made a mistake hed had petra drop him off at pico and union near the bus stop where he usually got off four blocks from his building not wanting her to see the liquor stores and abandoned buildings that lined the route the crumbling wooden houses converted to bytheday rooming houses fourstory stucco slabs like the one his family lived in marred by the acne of graffiti his mother kept an immaculate flat and his building was no worse than any others in the neighborhood but bad enough sometimes homeless guys wandered in and used the entry hall for a toilet when isaac walked the squeaky stairs up to his familys thirdfloor space he avoided touching the brownpainted handrail painted so often it felt gelatinous sometimes it was gelatinous wads of gum stuck to the wood and worse for a brief time as an undergrad his head filled with biology and organic chemistry hed taken to wearing plastic gloves when entering the building careful to shed and hide them before entering mamas domain the noise the smells generally he could shut it all out this morning leaving for campus hed noticed that the front facade was looking especially shabby most nights he could forget all that let his mind drift to the stately trees and brick loveliness of usc the oldpaper fragrance of doheny library his other life the life hed have one day maybe who was he kidding petra was smart she had to know the gomez family didnt live in a mansion still there was something about her actually seeing his home base that repelled him so he walked a quick right turn at the latenight liquor store favored by old winos then down dark side streets past alleys the usual sprinkle of lolling street people and addicts passive in their misery a few of them he talked to sometimes he gave them lunch leftovers mom always packed too much anyway mostly he ignored them and they returned the favor hed been doing it for years never had a problem tonight he had a problem he was unaware of them till they started laughing a hoarse highpitched hooting behind him close behind when had they started following him had he been that spacedout lost in thought marta doebbler kurt doebbler june getting closer petra those dark eyes the way shed taken on that enormous steak attacking it slender hands but strong aggressive in such a feminine way more laughter behind him closer glancing over his shoulder he saw them clearly as they passed under a streetlamp three of them a looselimbed giggly entourage maybe twenty feet from his back chattering pointing and bumping into one another laughing some more mexicanaccented spanish interspersed with rude english fuck the operative word the allpurpose nounverbadjective he picked up his pace hazarded another quick look back from the round outlines of their heads shaved domes not tall baggy clothes one of them drove a fist toward the sky and howled soprano howl like a girl maybe it had nothing to do with him maybe they just happened to be walking the same street they shuffled and bumped into one another some more young voices slurred punk kids high on something two more blocks till home he turned they stayed with him he walked faster one of them shouted yo maricon branding him queer all these years despite the rotten neighborhood hed never had to deal with this before generally he was home by eight but tonight it was well after ten he and petra had returned to the station late and hed hung around some more pretending not to pay attention as she worked at her desk pretending to work himself just wanting to be there for the ambience petra the day had shot by so quickly tagging along observing her listening picking up the nuances of detective work the things no book could communicate offering opinions when she asked and shed asked a lot more frequently than hed expected was she just being nice to him or did she really think he had something to offer it had to be the latter petra didnt suffer fools yo you maricon hey faggot whuh time izzit isaac kept walking one more block dinner dessert espresso hed never had coffee like that even the faculty club when dr gompertz sometimes treated him to lunch didnt have coffee like that hey you puto why you move you ass so fast he began to jog and heard them shouting and whooping and running after him he picked up speed was drenched by a sudden clammy fullbody sweat thank god petra wasnt here to see this something hit him from behind low in his back hard boot to the kidneys pain shot through him he buckled yet managed to stay on his feet but his rhythm had been disrupted and by the time his legs were ready to move someone was yanking at his briefcase his notes his laptop he held on but another hand clawed at his neck and as he stepped away from the blow the case flew out of his hand the clasp opened papers scattered the computer heavy remained inside his handwritten calculations lay static in the curb pages of multiple regression analyses of subethnic populations in highcrime regions he hadnt had time to enter any of it into his hard drive stupid stupid if he lost it it meant hours down the a fist hard sharp knuckles grazed the side of his head he teetered and tripped backward regained his balance and backed away and faced them even younger than hed thought fourteen fifteen small ghettostunted kids two skinny one a bit chunky same age as cousin samuelito but sammy was a good churchgoing boy and these three were shavedhead baggypants scum the fact that they were kids was meager comfort adolescents could be the most dangerous sociopaths poor impulse control insufficiently developed conscience hed read that if you didnt change their behavior by twelve they were surrounding him a trio of malignant dwarfs shuffling and cursing and giggling he moved trying to keep his back clear the spot on his cheek where hed been punched smarted and grew hot the heaviest of the three planted his feet and held up his fists small hands and knuckles like something out of oliver twist a night breeze coursed through the street and sheets of calculations billowed the heaviest one said gimme your fuckin mawney puto nasal barely pubescent voice individually he could pound each of them to oblivion but together as he weighed his alternatives one of the others the smallest flicked his wrist and flashed something metallic oh god a gun no a knife flat in an open palm the kid rotated his hand in small arcs i cut you puto isaac backed away some more another gust of breeze one of his sheets blew a few feet up the block the heaviest one said gimme the fuckin mawney you wanna fuckin get cut his voice squeaked and cracked gutted by an idiot with no pubic hair the little one with the blade danced closer stepped into the light and isaac saw the weapon clearly pocketknife cheap thing dark plastic handle maybe a twoinch foldout blade the kids wrist was thin fragile he smelled bad all three of them did unwashed clothes and weed and jumbled hormones jumpy little sociopaths not a good situation the thought of that stupid little blade entering his flesh enraged him he drew out his lapd authorized visitors badge and said police assholes you walked right into a stakeout hoping they watched tv hoping they were that stupid a nanosecond of silence a hoarse huh police motherfuckers he repeated louder reaching down in his chest to produce his lowest baritone growl reaching into another pocket he drew out his pen case because it was dark and around the right size he pressed it to his mouth said this is officer gomez calling for backup ive got three juvenile twoeleven suspects probable narcotics violation as well ill hold them here fuck said the heavy one sounding breathless isaac realized he hadnt even called in an address could they be that stupid skinny looked at his knife grim little urchin face deliberating the second one the one who hadnt spoken or done anything edged away isaac said where you going shitface the kid took off and ran and then there were two better odds even with the blade he might be able to escape with just a flesh wound chunky was bouncing on his feet skinny had edged back but made no move to leave the dangerous one not enough fear in his chemistry and he had to be the one with the knife that was why he had the knife isaac brought out his pen case again held it this time in an outstretched arm walked toward skinny pointing the stupid thing and ordered drop that fucking nailfile junior and get the fuck down on the ground before i shoot your ass do it chunky turned heel and ran skinny kept contemplating the odds threw the knife at isaac the blade whizzed by his face just short of his left eye he said youre toast motherfucker and the kid bolted he stood there in the silence putrid silence theyd left behind their stink waiting until he was sure they were gone before he began breathing normally he went to retrieve his briefcase collected the errant paper stuffed the rest of it back in then he sprinted the block to his building ran around to the side chest tight stomach churning chilled by the postadrenaline shakes he leaned against the stucco feet anklehigh in the weeds that grew there dryheaving he thought that would be it it wasnt he vomited until the bile burned his throat when all his dinner was gone he spit and headed toward his building tomorrow before he took the bus to the hollywood station hed visit jaramillo once upon a time before the burton academy before all the strange wondrous terrifying turns his life had taken he and jaramillo had been friends maybe that would count for something chapter kurt doebblers weirdness stuck in petras head and after a few more days of nothing on paradiso she found herself thinking about him it was just after noon no sign of isaac no word from eric and the mellowvoiced dr robert katzman hadnt called her back why hadnt doebbler complained about ballous drunken incompetence the more she thought about how shoddily the case had been worked the less confident she felt about the integrity of the original file like the blood scraped from marta doebblers car o negative and doebbler was o positive according to ballou how much was that worth she paged through the file finally found a note of the sample in a smallprint coroners addendum she decided to track it down the coroners clerk was sure he had it till he didnt he transferred her to a coroners investigator a youngsounding guy named ballard hmm he said i guess it could be in the bio division of your evidence room over at parker my evidence room petra said you guess well said ballard its not marked as leaving here but its not here so it mustve gone somewhere right unless its lost for your sake i hope it isnt parker had some evidence problems a while back remember lost samples spoilage she hadnt heard about that yet another snafu that had somehow evaded the evening news anywhere else it could be she said cant think of any unless it was sent up to cellmark for dna analysis but even then wed keep some here and mail them a sample unless there wasnt enough to be divided up yeah that could be it okay here it is two centimeters by one and a half thats about threequarters of an inch by half an inch says here it was attached to a square of vinyl auto upholstery meaning it was thin all we probably got were a few flakes i guess its possible cellmark got the whole thing why do you want it for fun she said and hung up and phoned sacramento the department of justice lab had no record of receiving any bio sample from marta doebblers murder parker centers evidence room hadnt logged it in bigtime screwup but get anyone to admit it time to take a closer look at the other june murders in geraldo soliss murder book she found an interesting notation by detective jack hustaad according to soliss daughter the old man had been expecting a cable repairman the day hed been bludgeoned no sign hustaad had followed up she phoned wilshire division and learned that unlike the hollywood cases solis had been transferred after hustaads suicide but not until two years after the murder had gone down hustaad mustve held on to the file all that time including a threemonth lapse between his medical leave for cancer treatment and his suicide a week after hustaads funeral solis had been passed to a di named scott weber weber was still at wilshire and petra reached him at his desk he said i never got anywhere on it how come youre asking she told him about a possible coldcase similarity talked about the wound pattern on marta doebbler made no mention of the other murders or june weber wanted to hear more but when she gave him a few details he lost interest dont see any match he said people get hit on the head not that often fatally according to my expert true she said what do you figure for the weapon on yours some kind of pipe same here said weber any physical evidence on yours just a missing blood sample not so far why was she being evasive with another detective because she still wasnt comfortable with all this anyway said weber one question there was a note about a cable repairman you have a copy of the file one of our interns doing research pulled it and made a copy from here said weber i think from the duplicate at parker oh yeah it could be duped being cold and all that the cable call she prompted there was a cable call on yours said weber no i was just wondering if that led anywhere but obviously youre wondering if i followed up on it weber laughed but the sound wasnt friendly i did even though it was two freakin years later soliss cable company had no record of any visit i talked to the daughter turns out she maybe remembered something about the old man maybe saying something turns out no one saw any cable truck near the house okay okay said petra sorry if i i couldnt get anywhere on it said weber its in the icebox no cable appointment did that mean a phony call had led geraldo solis to expect a visitor if so that could be a match to the phone booth call that had lured marta doebbler from the theater cable appointment at midnight petra recalled an incident in her own life that had spooked her two years ago in the midst of a oneweek vacation a doorbell ring at eleven pm had jolted her out of bed some joker claiming to be a ups deliveryman shed told him to go away hed persisted said he needed a signature on a package shed grabbed her gun tossed on a robe and cracked the door found a haggard brownclad zombie actual ups guy with an actual package cookies from one of her sistersinlaw running late hed explained twitching and tapping his foot not even noticing the ninemillimeter held down against her right flank she knew delivery services put their drivers under pressure but this guy looked ready to blow so it was possible a bad guy calls geraldo solis with the cable story shows up late solis opens his door no cable truck in the neighborhood didnt mean a thing at that hour in soliss quiet residential neighborhood whod be looking geraldo soliss daughters address and phone number were duly listed in the murder book maria solis murphy age thirtynine covina a dmv check put her current residence in the city right here in hollywood russell street off los feliz her work number matched an extension for food services at kaiser permanente hospital also hollywood an easy stroll from russell she was on shift came to the phone arranged to meet petra in front of the hospital in twenty minutes by the time petra arrived she was there hardbody type pretty with very short dark hair tipped blond wearing a pale blue dress white socks and tennies three filament hoops in one ear a diamond chip and a gold stud in the other tattoo of a rose on her left ankle kind of punk for a woman of nearly forty a woman with a gold wedding band on her ring finger but maria murphy had an unlined face and an aerobic bounce in her step put her in the right duds and she couldve passed for midtwenties her badge said m murphy ms registered dietician very hard body boyish hips the benefits of vitamins she said detective in a husky voice ms murphy if you dont mind i could use a little stretch been kind of cooped up they walked west on sunset past the hospital fastfood joints the prosthetic outfitters aftercare specialists and linen suppliers that attach themselves to hospitals western peds where sandra leon had been treated for leukemia was a couple of blocks east what was with that doctor katzman maria murphy said im very grateful youre reopening my dads case its not exactly like that ms murphy im a hollywood detective and i picked up a case that could conceivably bear some similarities to your fathers but its not a dramatic match were talking small details maam like what im not at liberty to say maam sorry i understand maria murphy said i discovered dads body ill never forget it that fact had been in the file geraldo solis had been found slumped over his food at one am petra asked murphy why shed dropped in so late i didnt drop in i lived there on and off temporarily temporarily i was married at the time and my husband and i were having problems i stayed with dad from time to time petra glanced at murphys gold band murphy smiled thats from my partner her name is bella petra sensed murphy sizing her up assessing her tolerance level so you and your husband were having marital problems i changed the rules midstream said murphy dave my husband was a good guy i was the one who initiated the breakup back then i was pretty moody howd dave react to that he wasnt happy said murphy he get mad without missing a step murphy turned sharply toward petra it wasnt like that dont even think that dave and dad got along great you want to know the truth dave and dad had more in common with each other than with me any time we had a fight dad took daves side he couldnt believe what i was doing and why i was doing it my whole family was in pretty strong denial big family said petra two brothers two sisters moms been gone for a while when she was alive i suppressed myself not wanting to hurt her after i came out they all ganged up on me wanted me to see a shrink which was exactly what id been doing for two years unbeknownst to them you didnt want to hurt your mother but your father you get to a point said murphy and dad and i were never close he was always working always too busy i didnt resent it he did what he had to do we just werent close even after i started living with him we had very little to say to each other she flinched sucked in a breath quickened her step how long did you live with him on and off murphy reiterated a month or so i kept most of my stuff at my house would bring a few changes to dads the story i gave him was i was working a double shift and didnt want to drive home tired dads place was a lot closer to the hospital covina to hollywood was an hour drive minimum a lot hairier with traffic the trip from soliss house on ogden near olympic was a lark in comparison so that much rang true when did you tell your father the truth said petra i didnt my sibs did a few days before the murder what about dave dave already knew he wasnt angry he was sad depressed dont go there really petra decided shed be talking to dave murphy sooner rather than later she nodded at murphy tried to look reassuring so is there anything about your fathers murder that youve thought about since the first detectives spoke to you i only talked to one detective said murphy big heavyset kind of scandinavian guy detective hustaad yes thats him he seemed nice had a real bad cough later he called me to tell me he had cancer was going in for treatment he promised to make sure dads case got transferred to someone else i felt terrible for him that cough it didnt sound good the case was transferred to detective weber he never talked to you someone did call me said murphy once but a long time years after hustaad got sick id called the police station a few times honestly not a lot i was dealing with my own stuff when no one called me back i let it go i guess what did detective weber tell you he said he was taking over dads case but i never heard from him again i guess i shouldve followed through i guess i figured after no clues came up right away it would be hard to solve being a stranger and all that a stranger a burglar said murphy thats what hustaad figured did detective weber ask you anything not really oh yeah he did ask about dad expecting the cable guy which id already told detective hustaad it was the only thing i did tell detective hustaad that i thought might be relevant mostly i was a basketcase at the time i mean finding dad nothing hysterical about her now talkative woman calm resigned to the fact that her fathers murder would probably never be solved petra kept walking waited for more half a block later murphy said detective hustaad didnt seem to have much energy youre wondering if he worked the case as hard as it shouldve been worked i dont know maybe i guess im a pretty factual person what do you mean i can accept facts even if theyre tough if dad had been killed by a burglar the only way theyd solve it was if the same criminal did it again right thats kind of what detective hustaad implied she turned to petra is your case a burglar someone pretending to be a cable guy everythings preliminary maam so i shouldnt get my hopes up its a long process what was weird to me if it was a burglar said murphy was that the only thing taken was food a fresh head of lettuce some whole wheat bread and two cartons of lemon yogurt thats a pretty strange burglar no but detective hustaad said they do that eat food mark their territory he figured the guy got scared before he had time to steal anything she shrugged maybe cash was taken i dont know i dont think so because the moment dad had any extra cash like from his military pension he banked it murphy slowed her pace and petra adjusted traffic on sunset was fast and thunderous and the two of them swerved to avoid some construction workers whod blown a hole in the sidewalk and set up orangeandwhite sawhorses murphy looked at the hardhats dad did that worked construction after he left the marines then he had his own business a tire store in culver city when that went under he was sixtyfive said hed had enough mostly he watched tv youre pretty specific about which food was taken said petra because it was my food i bought it the day before dad was more of a chorizoandfriedpotatoes kind of guy he made fun of the way i ate called it rabbit chow pain in her eyes said thered been more than dietary conflict between father and daughter your food was taken said petra it couldnt mean anything could it is there anyone whod want to get back at you through your father no said murphy no one since the divorce everythings been smooth dave and i are friendly we talk all the time any kids murphy shook her head petra said tell me about the cable call and why you think it couldve been phony that day in the morning when i left for work dad told me the cable company was sending someone out to work on the set at what time late afternoon early evening you know how they are said murphy dad sometimes napped at that hour wanted me to wake him by seven were you having transmission problems no thats the thing said murphy supposedly it was something to do with the neighborhood lines he wanted you to wake him said petra so you were home by late afternoon no i called at three told dad id be home late he asked me to call again at seven yes did you i did and he was up how did your father sound fine normal then you went back to work murphy touched her finger to her jaw actually id left work early it had been a tough afternoon shuttling back between dave and bella when i hung up with dad i was in my car i took off and went to see bella we had dinner went to a club did some drinking neither of us was in the mood to dance she wanted me to come home with her but i wasnt ready for that so she drove back to her place and i drove to dads walked into the house and smelled food cooked food bacon and eggs which was strange dad never ate late hed have a beer or two maybe some chipanddip while watching tv but never a hot meal at that hour if he ate heavy food too late he had indigestion maria murphy stopped walking her eyes were wet this is harder than i thought sorry for bringing it all back i havent thought about dad for a while i should think about him more murphy pulled a hankie out of a dress pocket patted her eyes blew her nose when they resumed walking petra said so someone had cooked breakfast food said murphy which was also weird dad was a very disciplined person exmarine very regimented you ate breakfast food in the morning sandwiches at lunch a main meal at supper you dont think he cooked the food scrambled eggs said maria murphy dad didnt like scrambled eggs he always had his eggs fried or softboiled she burst into tears walked faster at a nearrun petra caught up murphy threw up her hands and ground her jaws maam his brains murphy blurted they were on the plate along with the eggs pilled on top of the eggs like someone had added lumpy cheese to the eggs gray cheese pink can we please turn around now i need to get back to work petra waited until they were back at kaiser to ask her if there was anything else she remembered nothing said murphy she turned to go and petra touched her arm solid and sinewy maria murphy tensed up rockhard looking at petras fingers on her sleeve petra let go just one more question maam the date of your fathers murder june did that have any significance to you or to anyone in your family why would you ask that covering bases june said murphy weakly the only thing significant about that is dad was murdered she sagged its coming up isnt it the anniversary i think ill go to the cemetery i dont go very often i really should go more interesting woman going through major lifestress at the time of her fathers murder not getting sympathy from the old man quite the opposite pulled in all directions having to return to the old mans house a father with whom shed never been close an exmarine whose sensibilities shed recently offended it had to have been a tense situation from the feel of that ironarm murphy was a strong woman more than enough strength to bring a stout piece of pipe down on an aged skull murphys food taken healthy stuff that the old man ridiculed maybe the old man had humiliated her one time too many dumped lesbian daughters victuals in front of lesbian daughter and that had driven her over the edge petra had seen people killed with a lot less provocation she pulled into the station parking lot sat there imagining murphy comes home from a selfdescribed rough day driving back and forth between hubbie and lover calls dad allegedly to wake him from his nap but he gives her flack she hangs up goes dining and clubbing has too much to drink returns home craving a one am nosh finds dad up waiting for her they argue about her alternative lifestyle her rabbit chow dad scoops up the nutritionally virtuous stash tells her what he thinks about it murphy was a dietician the gesture would have been laced with extra symbolism an argument ensues he screams she screams she picks something up maybe a spare pipe who knows what brains the old guy sits him at the table cooks up some of the highfat crap he calls food pushes his face in it eat that then she makes up a phony cable story to distract the easily distracted jack hustaad some melodrama and no evidence and if maria murphy had murdered her old man what did that say about marta doebbler and the other five june killings shed follow up on solis talk to murphys exhusband the longsuffering dave but something told her it would be a waste of time kurt doebbler for his wife maria murphy for her dad meaning no connection no that felt wrong if isaac was right and she was moving toward confidence that he was this was something quite different from family passion gone bad a woman lured from the theater a hustler pulverized in a back alley a little girl brutalized in the park a sailor on leave eggs and brains on the plate this was calculated manipulative twisted chapter when she got back to the detectives room the place was bustling with phone talk and keyboard clacks isaac was at his corner desk writing something in longhand one hand cradling the side of his head he gave her a quick wave with his free hand and returned to his work give me space maybe last nights steak and beer had been too much for him shed offered to drive him home but hed insisted on being dropped off blocks away petra figured he was ashamed of his digs she didnt argue and as he trudged away lugging his briefcase she thought he looked like a tired old man give him his space she could use some too she poured coffee and flipped through her message stack nothing but department memos six new email messages on her computer four canned department announcements something from smalldotilnetvision she figured for spam and mac dilbeck informing her that homicide special would most likely take over the paradiso case by tuesday if nothing broke she was about to delete the junk mail when her phone rang a recorded message from the intramural police football team chirped in her ear big game with la county sheriffs coming up next month all ablebodied athletically inclined officers are urged to her finger drifted to the enter button and she opened the spam dear petra this is rerouted for security purposes cant be answered everythings okay hope the same there miss you l eric she smiled i send my l too she saved the message logged off began looking for david murphy common name but an easy trace the fiveyearold covina address narrowed it right down to david colvin murphy now fortytwo hed moved to mar vista on the west side had registered a dodge neon three years ago a chevy suburban twenty months after that no wants or warrants not even a parking ticket she found his number in the reverse directory a woman answered david murphy please hes at work whos this petra recited her title and the woman said police why its about an old case are you familiar with geraldo solis maam daves exfatherinlaw he was im daves wife where does your husband work mrs murphy healthrite pharmacy hes a pharmacist saying it with some pride which branch maam santa monica wilshire near twentyfifth but i dont know what he could tell you that was years ago dont rub it in petra thanked her and hung up looked up the drugstores number while glancing over at isaacs desk the kid was still poring over his papers but the hand against his face had dropped and petra saw a bruise reddishpurple high up on the left side of his face between the rounded tip of his cheekbone and his ear as if suddenly aware he reclamped his hand over the spot something had happened between last night and today rough neighborhood walking alone or worse something domestic she realized how little she knew about his private life considered going over to check out the bruise but he looked as if the last thing he wanted was company she called the healthrite pharmacy santa monica branch david murphy had a pleasant phone voice not surprised by her call the wife had prepared him he said gerry was a good guy i cant think of anyone whod want to hurt him according to maria her father had taken murphys side in the divorce petra said well someone sure did terrible said murphy so what can i do for you is there anything you remember about the day mr solis was murdered sir maybe something that didnt come up during the initial investigation sorry no said murphy what do you recall it was a terrible day maria and i were in the midst of breaking up she was driving back and forth between our home between me and her and bella kandinsky shes her partner now emotional day said petra you bet shed come home talk to me get upset run to bella then back to me im sure maria was feeling like the rope in a tug of war i was pretty stunned stunned my marriage suddenly over over another woman murphy laughed anyway that was a long time ago weve all moved on at the time of the murder maria was living at her fathers house on and off said murphy because of marital problems wed been quarreling i didnt understand why at the time you ever go over to mr soliss house i used to be there all the time before things got rough in the marriage gerry and i got along that made it kind of rough on maria how so gerry took my side he was pretty conservative marias choice was hard for him to swallow that mustve caused conflict between them sure heavyduty conflict murphy laughed again you cant be serious no no thats totally out of the ballpark dont even go there same phrase maria had used go where said petra what youre implying listen im kind of busy i wasnt implying just asking said petra but as long as were on the topic how serious was the conflict between maria and her dad david murphy said thats absurd marias a terrific person she and gerry had your typical parentchild things i had them with my folks everyone does no way could she have hurt him shes absolutely a terrific person no way she defends him he defends her and they got divorced depressing he said believe me detective im definitely right mr murphy in the file theres a note about a cablerepair appointment did maria mention that to you no but gerry did in fact the guy was right there when i called you called mr solis sure i wanted to find out where maria was she left our house pretty upset and i assumed she went home i wanted to smooth things out gerry answered and he was grumpy because the cable guy had come late what time was this wow said murphy this was what five years ago i remember it was dark already and id been working late id say eight nine maybe even ninethirty gerry said something about the guy saying hed show up by six then calling to push it to seven then still not making it on time he was pretty annoyed if i had to guess id say between eightthirty and nine mr solis was upset because of having to wait when i asked to speak to maria he said she wasnt there he had no idea where she was he was kind of abrupt in general he was a grumpy guy meaning geraldo solis already annoyed by delays couldve had a serious chip on that evening been primed for a confrontation she said did mr solis have a bad temper no not really said murphy more like a curmudgeon he was a very disciplined guy exmarine expected the world to work on a tight schedule when things didnt go that way it bugged him like a late appointment or a lesbian daughter sure oh wow youre not suggesting just asking questions mr murphy the cable guy said murphy whoa but the police said gerry was killed around midnight i guess he couldve been left there for a few hours wow a cable guy who shows up after dark whose company had no record of any scheduled service appointment which wasnt necessarily significant two years later paperwork screwups happened all the time and the cable companies that serviced la were notoriously inept still she said did he tell you the reason for the cable appointment thats another thing that bothered gerry he hadnt complained about anything it was the company saying they needed to come by general maintenance something like that my god you really think mr murphy did you tell any of this to the original detective hustaad he never asked about it and i never really thought about it what he wanted to know was how i got along with gerry how maria got along i got the feeling he was checking me out psychologically he also asked where i was around midnight thats why i figured it happened around midnight normally id be asleep at that time but that night i was pretty upset and went out with a friend a buddy from work we went out drinking and i cried in my beer so to speak can you remember anything else mr solis said about the cable appointment not really i dont think he said anything other than how annoyed he was and he definitely told you the man was there in the house yes i think but maybe i assumed he was talking softly so i assumed someone was there its not anything i could swear to in court or something like that court from your mouth to gods ears petra pressed him a bit more learned nothing thanked him he said sure good luck gerry really was a good guy a cable repairman quite possibly phony shows up after dark tinkers around and cases the place maybe leaves a rear door or a window unlocked for a return trip or he does solis right there has the presence of mind to cook breakfast stick the old mans face in it takes some food for the road healthy stuff a killer who took care of himself what did any of that say about kurt and marta doebbler isaac was right killing your wife and then moving on to strangers was unusual shed never heard of anything like that on the other hand what if kurt had dispatched marta because of some personal motive then found out hed liked it too twisted she knew she was thinking that way because doebbler was an eminently unlikable individual then again bashing six people over the head on the same date same time was pretty weird across the room isaac continued to study his numbers hand on face concealing the bruise the kid had complicated her life why couldnt he have chosen to do his thing at the sheriffs she took a bathroom break risked more coffee returned to the june files putting solis aside and reviewing the other nonhollywood case the sailor darren ares hochenbrenner on shore leave according to two other sailors theyd started out in hollywood but darren had parted ways when theyd gone to a movie at the egyptian the body had been found downtown on fourth street pockets emptied far from the others the only black victim and the pockets made it a probable strongarm street robbery taken to the extreme she rechecked the wound dimensions perfect match to marta doebbler down to the millimeter the listed detective was a dii named ralph seacrest he was still working at central sounded tired that one he said yeah i remember it kid started off in your neighborhood ended up in mine any idea how he got to yours said petra seacrest said im thinking he got picked up by a john could be hochenbrenner was gay that never came up said seacrest but sailors on leave or maybe he got lost kid was from the midwest indiana i think first time in the city he was stationed in port hueneme thats not the city whyre you asking about him petra spun him the usual yarn seacrest said another headbashing your vic get robbed no mine got robbed this was a kid got lost found himself in a real bad neighborhood also he was stoned on what marijooana some booze dont hold me to that its been a while but thats what i remember bottom line he was partying probably partied too hardy got picked up the rest is history petra hung up checked darren hochenbrenners tox screen found a blood alcohol of percent at hochenbrenners body weight that probably meant one beer traces of thc had been found but minimal possibly days old according to the coroner hardly stoned she wondered how hard detective ralph seacrest had worked the case a shadow fell across the file and she looked up expecting to see isaac but the kid was gone from his desk no briefcase hed left without saying a word a civilian receptionist from downstairs a blond cheerleader type named kirsten krebs newly hired whod been hostile from the getgo handed her a message slip dr robert katzman had returned her call half an hour ago krebs was on her way toward the stairs petra said why didnt you put him through krebs stopped turned glared clamped her hands to her hips she wore a tight powderblue stretch top tight black cotton pants vneck top it offered a hint of tan freckled cleave pushup bra long blond hair despite a face too hard to be pretty a couple of ds had turned to take in her firm young ass this was a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen your line was busy whiny petra aimed a hollowpoint smile straight at the girls upturned nose krebs sniffed and turned on her heel eyed isaacs desk as she left not much older than isaac half isaacs iq but she had other weapons in her armamentarium could eat the kid alive listen to me the surrogate mother she got on the phone and called dr katzman got his mellow voice on message and left a message of her own not so mellow chapter the joke richard jaramillo was fat so they called him flaco that was back in fourth grade then jaramillo grew up and got skinny and the nickname fit little else about jaramillo had worked out so neatly isaac had known him back in public school a jumpy scared fat kid who wore oldfashioned clothes sat at the back of the classroom and never learned how to read the teacher faced with fifty kids half of whom didnt speak english assigned isaac to tutor flaco flaco had reacted to the assignment distractedly isaac concluded almost immediately that flacos biggest problem was that he didnt pay attention not long after he realized flaco had real problems paying attention flaco hated everything about school so isaac figured some kind of reward might work since flaco was fat he tried food mama was overjoyed when he asked her to pack extra sugartamales in his lunch bag finally isaac was starting to eat isaac offered flaco tamales and flaco learned to read at the firstgrade level flaco never got far beyond that even with tamales it was never easy big deal anyway he told isaac im passing into fifth same as you then flaco jaramillos father went to prison on a manslaughter conviction and the boy stopped showing up at school period isaac found that he missed being the teacher and now he had to figure out what to do with the extra tamales he wanted to call flaco but mama told him the jaramillos had moved out of the city in shame which turned out to be a lie mrs gomez had never liked isaac hanging out with a bad boy from that family such a rotten bunch in truth the jaramillos had been evicted from their union district flat and were crammed into a roachridden sro hotel near skid row five years later the boys ran into each other it happened on a hot polluted friday not far from the bus stop half day at burton because of teacher training seminars isaac had spent the afternoon at the museum of science and industry alone was returning home from the bus when he saw two blackandwhite police cars parked at the corner in careless diagonals lights flashing up on the sidewalk a few feet away a small thin boy in a baggy tshirt sagging pants and expensive running shoes was being rousted by four muscular officers they had him in the position legs spread arms up palms pressed against the brick wall isaac kept his distance but stopped to watch the police questioned the boy spun him around got in his face and yelled the boy remained impassive then isaac recognized him the baby fat was gone but the features were the same and isaac felt his own eyes stretch wide as the unspoken huh resonated in his head he stepped even farther back expecting the police to arrest flaco jaramillo but they didnt just wagged warning fingers screamed some more and shoved the boy around a bit then as if summoned by a silent alarm all four got in their cars and sped away flaco stepped into the street and flipped off the cops noticed isaac and flipped him off too as isaac turned to leave he shouted what the fuck you lookin at motherfucker his voice had changed too small boy with a deep baritone isaac started walking yo motherfucker you hear me isaac stopped the skinny boy was advancing on him face dark and scrunched and intent all that pentup anger and humiliation ready to blow ready to take it out on someone isaac said its me flaco flaco came within inches he smelled of weed who the fuck are you isaac gomez flacos eyes became razor cuts his skinny face was rodentine with the same oversized nose weak chin and bat ears that isaac remembered the ears looked even bigger exhibited mercilessly by a shaved head flaco was short but broadshouldered veins popped on his forearms like sculptural basrelief the clear intimation of muscle and the desire to use it tattoos on his knuckles and the left side of his neck the one on the neck was a nastylooking snake mouth open fangs bared as if about to close on flaco jaramillos jaw line the number atop his right hand the police code for homicide some bangers were telling the truth when they advertised having done it who isaac fourth grade gomez my fucking teacher man flaco shook his head so so how you been said isaac i been cool flaco smiled rotten teeth several missing on top the herbal reek of marijuana permeated his clothing that had kept the police on him but theyd found nothing flaco had dumped his dope in time fucking teacher said flaco so whats with you why you dressed like a fag private school private school what the fucks that just a place said isaac why you go there isaac shrugged they make you dress like a fag im not one flaco looked him over some more grinned you fucked up as a teacher man i dont know shit isaac shrugged again working hard at casualcool i was nine i thought you were pretty smart flacos grin faltered shows what you know he flexed the hand with the tattoo reached out slapped isaac on the back held his hand out for a soul shake his skin was hard and dry and crusty like poorly sanded wood he laughed his breath was bad isaac said good to see you man guess ill be shoving off shoving off whats that from a movie or somethin flaco turned pensive for a second brightened lets go smoke up some weed man i got it where the motherfuckers cant find it no thanks no thanks dont smoke man said flaco you fucked up he stepped back reassessing isaac whatever thanks anyway flaco waved that off go man go away as isaac turned flaco said you tried to teach me i remember that you gave me some tamales or some shit like that sugar tamales whatever thought i was smart huh i did flaco bared his bad teeth shows what you know hey man check this out how bout we shove off and i smoke and you watch and we like talk man like find out whats been happening all these years isaac thought about it not for too long sure he said in the end hed ended up taking a couple of courtesy puffs they ran into each other once or twice a year mostly the same kind of chance meetings on the street sometimes flaco had no time for isaac other times he seemed to crave company when they got together it was always flaco smoking and talking isaac listening once when they were sixteen isaac in a bad mood for whatever reason took deep hits of weed hated the way the smoke burned his lungs the popcorn lightness in his head laughing too much losing control he walked home woozy stayed in bed until dinner ate well mama looking on approvingly when they were seventeen flaco had isaac decipher some probation papers because his reading had remained at the firstgrade level my pos a dumb motherfucker but i want to keep it real man show up at appointments get past this bullshit the papers said flaco had stolen cigarettes from a vending machine and been sentenced to a years probation penal code that kind of thing you didnt tattoo on your hand the following year flaco showed isaac his guns a big black automatic weighing down a pocket of his saggy khakis a smaller chromeplated sixshot thing taped to his ankle ankle gun he probably saw that in a movie isaac said cool by that time hed developed a solid fix on flacos temperament jumpy unstable completely devoid of fear the last trait made flaco more dangerous than any fanged snake flaco went on about the guns what they could do how you cleaned them what a bargain hed gotten on the purchase isaac listened when you listened people stayed calm and thought you were smart and interesting flaco liked to say that life you leading man you gonna be rich doubtful doubtful my dick man you gonna be a rich doctor and get close to all that dope wink wink we still gonna be friends man isaac laughed funny said flaco very fuckin funny but he laughed too isaac got off the downtown bus and found his way to the bar on fifth near los angeles street not far he realized from the alley where one of the june victims the sailor hochenbrenner had breathed his last bad neighborhood even with downtown getting rejuvenated cantina nueva was where flaco hung out during the day did whatever it was he did isaac avoided asking but flaco was eager to brag there were stories isaac listened to others he allowed to pass right through his consciousness sometimes flaco got really quiet didnt talk about anything both of them were young men now knew it was in their mutual interest if some things remained unspoken isaac had been to the bar twice this year both times at flacos request once flaco had needed some papers deciphered the deed to a house on nd flacos real estate agent had assured him everything was cool but the dude was a slippery motherfucker and flaco knew who he could trust flaco at twentythree would soon be a homeowner isaac was broke and the irony didnt escape him the second time flaco claimed he just wanted to talk but when isaac got there flaco remained in his booth at the rear and it was one of those days when he said little he kept ordering beerandshots for both of them and isaac tried to nurse his to the max he got drunk anyway grew really tired and sat there as people streamed in and out of the cantina made their way over to flaco exchanged glances and cash shiny chromium things in paper bags powders in plastic baggies all i need is for the place to be busted right now byebye med school flaco had seated isaac on the inside of the booth facing the pool table back to the moldy wall then hed gotten in next to isaac trapping isaac wanting isaac to see everything to know a couple of beerandshots later flaco said my old man died got cut in the shower at chino isaac said oh man im sorry flaco laughed this afternoon the bar was overheated and dim and sweatsour mostly empty except for a couple of old tio tacos hunched at the bar and three young guys who looked like theyd just crossed the border shooting pool at the solitary warped table snick snick snick as cues impacted plastic balls a disagreeable clang as the balls slid down the metal chute the doctors lattimore had a pool table at their house had a whole paneled room set aside for billiards no noisy chute on that one leather mesh sacks caught the balls silently clang spanish curses bad mariachirock fusion blared from the jukebox flaco slumped in the booth wearing a black denim jacket over a black tshirt empty beer and shot glasses in front of him hed grown his hair out but in a weird style shaved on top with two black stripes running along the side and a short tightly pleated braid dangling at the back like a reptilian tail mustache wisps at the corner of his mouth all he could grow he looked isaac decided like some hollywood directors notion of an evil chinese guy he looked up as isaac approached sleepily isaac thought isaac stood there until flaco motioned him in quick soul shake bro hey isaac slid across from him hed stopped at a pharmacy bought a tube of coverup makeup done his best to hide the bruise a patchy job at best but if you werent looking for it maybe you wouldnt notice nothing could be done about the swelling but between flacos short attention span and the bars poor lighting he hoped he wouldnt have to explain whussup flacos voice slurred his long sleeves were buttoned at the wrist usually he rolled them up hiding needle marks flaco always denied shooting made a point of preferring inhalation but who knew hed always been restless unable to leave well enough alone isaac said the usual the motherfuckin usual but youre motherfuckin here isaac shrugged you always do that said flaco with the shoulders you do that when you wanna hide something man isaac laughed yeah its funny asshole flacos head rolled i need a gun said isaac flacos head rose slowly say what isaac repeated it a gun flaco snickered what like to shoot down planes you gonna be one of them terrorists his cheeks puffed as he tried to imitate cannon fire feeble puffs resulted he coughed definitely on something for protection said isaac the neighborhood someone fuck with you tell me who i kill their ass no im cool said isaac but you know how it is things get better then they get worse right now its worse you having problems man im cool want to keep it that way a gun you mama those tamales flaco licked his lips those were fine kin you get me some more sure yeah no problem when whenever you want them i come over knock on your door you invite me in introduce me to you mama get me some of them sweet tamales absolutely said isaac knowing it would never happen flaco knew it too a gun he said suddenly reflective its like a you know a responsibility i can handle it you know how to shoot sure isaac lied bullshit motherfucker i can handle it you end up shooting off your ass you shoot your own cojones off man i aint gonna cry ill be fine bang bang said flaco no i dont think so man what for you need to mess with motherfucking guns im going to get one said isaac one way or the other you stupid man then flaco realized what hed said and cracked up isaac started to get up flaco clamped a hand over his wrist have a drink bro no thanks you turnin me down isaac swung around in the booth faced flaco fullon the way i see it youre doing the turning down flacos smile dropped his hand remained clawed over isaacs wrist another tattoo on the other hand larger fresher black ink a tiny grinning skull nested in the upper circle of the you aint gonna drink with me one drink said isaac then im going got to take care of business flaco slid out of the booth teetered to the bar returned with two beerandshots as the two of them drank he drew a white plastic shopping bag out of the black denim jacket and lowered it beneath the table isaac glanced down jewelry mart logo on the bag a vendor called diamond world happy birthday motherfucker isaac took the bag from flaco heavy at the bottom was something swaddled in toilet paper keeping his hands low he unwrapped it partially a shiny little thing squat squarebarreled perfectly malevolent chapter friday june pm detectives room hollywood division petra left two additional messages with dr robert katzman the last unmistakably cross then she regretted her tone even if she finally reached the oncologist big deal hed treated sandra leon for leukemia what else could he tell her then again she was sure the oncology clerk had gotten antsy talking about sandra but who said that related to the girl with the pink shoes or any other aspect of paradiso she went downstairs found kirsten krebs idling by the watercooler in a tank top and jeans told krebs to put katzman through immediately if he called back krebs stared at the floor and said yeah fine when she thought petra was out of earshot she muttered whatever petra returned to her desk feeling aimless shed slept fitfully burdened with too much of nothing just two weeks until june no sign of isaac for a few days had the kid lost his youthful enthusiasm about the nefarious plot or was it something to do with that bruise either way who cared unfortunately she did she turned to the file copies reviewed the two she knew the best doebbler and solis for new insights and failed to come up with any it stayed that way until she reviewed the coroners report on coral langdon the dog walker and found something shed missed the first few times around stuck in the middle of a smallprint hairandfiber list stapled under some lab results two types of canine hair had been found on langdons clothing no mention of that in the coroners nonquantitative summary the pathologist hadnt deemed it important maybe it wasnt the presence of cockapoo hair was selfexplanatory little brandy had been bludgeoned along with her mistress stupid little bitch the world is my toilet but along with the champagnecolored curls raked from corals purple cashmere blend size m robinsonsmay cardigan and her black size polycotton anne klein pants was a smaller but substantial number of straight coarse hairs short dark brown and white canine no dna had been analyzed to determine the breed no reason to get that fancy there were plenty of reasonable explanations including maybe coral langdon had owned two dogs except according to the file she hadnt detective shirley lenois might have missed the june link but shirley had been a dog person owned three afghan hounds would have been sure to note the presence of a second pet perhaps little brandy had hung with a canine buddy picked up hairs transferred them to coral or a stray dog had come upon both corpses sniffed around or coral langdon walking alone at night in the hollywood hills in the company of a pintsized pooch that provided zero protection had encountered another dog walker the two of them stop to swap dog chat dog people were like that being devoted to your pet was grounds for instant rapport because of that dogs could be a great ruse for bad guys petra recalled a case shed worked early in her grandtheftauto days pleasantlooking fratboytype thief what was his name who always took along a lumbering seventypound bulldog monroe she remembered the dogs moniker but not the guys what did that say fratboys modus was to chance upon women pulling latemodel luxury wheels into shopping center parking lots as they got out of their cars hed saunter by monroe in tow the women would get one look at the stubby dogs wrinkled frog face and melt chitchat would ensue fratboy lewis something was brilliant at putting on the wholesome dog guy act though monroe really belonged to his sister the women would coo and pet the stoic panting beast then walk off happy fifty percent of the time they forgot to lock their cars andor set the alarms yup canine companionship could definitely impart instant decency to a stranger petra thought about how langdon mightve gone down a guy with a dog a white middleclasslooking guy someone who wouldnt seem out of place in coral langdons hollywood hills neighborhood shows up on the quiet hillside road coral with her fluffy pal the guy with a larger pooch nothing scary like a pit bull short dark brown and white hairs could be a pointer a mixedbreed whatever something mellow and nonthreatening she stayed with the scenario imagining coral and dog guy stopping to talk maybe laughing as their furry buddies engaged in mutual squatting exchanging cute little arent dogs almost human stories coral single fit and youthful for her age might have welcomed some male attention a bit of flirtation ensued maybe even a phonenumber exchange no number had been found on corals body but that meant nothing dog guy couldve lifted it when his job was done his job biding his time as he and coral exchange amiable haveaniceevenings coral and brandy turn to go boom bashed from behind like all the others a coward a calculating manipulative coward reluctant to face his victims creative milo sturgis would call it his favorite euphemism when cases bogged down petra wondered what hed think about all this delaware too she was pondering whether to call either of them when kirsten krebs stomped up to her desk and straightarmed a message slip right in her face he hung up said petra its not the one you said to put through said krebs but seeing as youre so into your messages i brought it to you personally petra snatched the slip eric had phoned three minutes ago no return number the message on the slip in krebss cramped writing dont believe everything you see on the news whatever that means said krebs he sounded kinda strange hes a detective here krebs remained unimpressed petra said you told him i wasnt here he wasnt the one you said krebs insisted damn petra reread the message fine bye krebs clamped her hands on her hips cocked one leg sucked in her cheeks if youre going to be choosy you have to give me detailed instructions she marched away dont believe everything you see on the news petra headed for the locker room where the latest castoff tv sat this one was a zenith staticplagued with no cable hookup perched on a windowsill petra switched it on flipped channels until she found a local broadcast regional news nothing remotely related to the middle east was eric even there dont believe okay but he was fine hed called nothing to worry about why hadnt he insisted on speaking to her because he didnt want to bad situation something he couldnt talk about her heart pounded and her stomach hurt she hurried back to the detectives room barney fleischer was at his desk sports coat bunched up at his shoulders humming and stacking his paperwork neatly she said does anyone around here get cnn barney said i prefer fox news fair and balanced and all that either way the closest place would be shannons petra had never been to the irish pub but she knew where it was up wilcox just south of the boulevard a brief walk barney said theyve got a nice flat screen sometimes they keep the news on when theres no game she racewalked to shannons sat at the bar ordered a coke the flat screen was a fiftytwoinch plasma set like a window into the wall above the boozerack tuned to msnbc nothing about the middle east for one complete news cycle and the running banner at the bottom of the screen was cut off she asked the bartender if there was any way to fix that we format it this way on purpose he said you format the other way it burns lines in the screen how about for a few minutes or maybe we can try one of the other stations he frowned at her soft drink no way that justified special treatment but business was slow no one else shared the bar so he fooled with the remote and the banner appeared she endured financial news a basketball finals recap then the international stories an earthquake in algeria the middle east but nothing eric would call her about why couldnt he have just come out and the anchorwomans voice rose in pitch and petras ears opened reports that american military personnel may have been at least partly responsible for reducing the death toll from a suicide bombing in tel aviv a beachside café on a restaurantchocked avenue that paralleled the mediterranean people trying to enjoy themselves on a hot sunny day israelis a couple of german tourists some foreign workers from thailand unnamed american security officers scumbag with a bomb vest under his raincoat approaches from across the street scumbags black raincoat on a hot day wouldve tipped off anyone with the slightest powers of observation it had hed been wrestled to the ground put out of commission before having a chance to yank the detonator cord on his plastiqueandballbearingandnailstuffed vest score one for the good guys moments later scumbag number two saunters over gets twenty feet away and pulls his plug turning himself to jihadburger taking two israelis with him a mother and her teenage daughter and scores are reported injured two evil shitheads but for someones sharp eyes it couldve been worse someone scores injured could cover a lot of territory eric had to be in good enough shape to call why hadnt he insisted on talking to her dammit seen enough said the bartender can i format it back petra tossed him a ten and left the bar chapter back at the station she ran upstairs to the locker room flicked on the old zenith caught the four pm broadcast on kcbs the tel aviv bombing was the thirdranked story after the legislatures credibility problems and a new bank fraud scandal in lynwood same barebones facts nearly identical wording what had she expected she entered the detectives room nearly collided with kirsten krebs there you are hes on hold petra ran to her desk and picked up connor the irate detective said a mellow voice dr bob sorry about that dr katzman its been a tough week i imagine you get plenty of those you too being a cancer doctor thanks for returning as i mentioned sandra leon was a witness to a murder and were having trouble tracking her down unfortunately i cant help you with that said katzman shes no longer my patient and i could never track her down either wheres she getting her chemotherapy hopefully nowhere detective sandra doesnt have leukemia though she wanted us to think she did she lied about being sick lying said katzman appears to be one of her primary skills i guess i misspoke when i said she was no longer my patient she never was under my care in the first place thats why i have no problem talking to you talk away doctor she showed up last year with a letter from a physician in oakland saying shed been diagnosed with aml acute myelogenous leukemia was in remission and needed to be followed the letter also stated that she was an emancipated minor living with some cousins and would require financial assistance our social worker sent her to all the right agencies and booked her for an appointment with me sandra kept her appointments with the agencies but was a noshow at oncology clinic what kind of agencies are we talking about there are several county and state programs set up for kids with cancer they offer medication transportation and housing vouchers wigs when the patients lose their hair copayment for treatment ah said petra you bet said katzman and once a childs registered the family also gets hooked into the general welfare system which gets you access to food stamps et cetera so sandra got goodies but didnt show up for her appointment for the agencies it wasnt a problem technically all they require is that a patient be diagnosed not actively undergoing treatment i found out later that on some of the application forms she was listed as an active patient forms sandra filled out herself youve got the picture did you ever see her months after talking to the social worker the first time she didnt show we phoned the number she listed on her intake form but it was disconnected that concerned me but i figured shed moved or changed her mind and went to another doc then some of her forms came in for me to sign off on and i went back and checked and wondered what was going on i sent the social worker out on a home visit the address sandra gave us turned out to be a mail drop where i wouldnt know said katzman maybe loretta the social worker would last name please said petra loretta brainerd so sandra witnessed a murder murders said petra the paradiso shootings i heard about that said katzman in baltimore i left the day before it happened you finally saw her said petra howd you find her i had ccs childrens cancer services send her a letter to the effect that shed lose her benefits if she didnt show up for her checkup she was there the next day right on time in tears all apologetic going on and on about some family crisis having to travel suddenly travel where if she said i dont recall to tell the truth i wasnt listening i was annoyed because i felt she was jerking me around then when she turned on the faucet i wasnt sure shes a pretty good actress most important i wanted to check her out medically because i didnt like what i saw her complexion was yellow especially the eyes jaundice can be a sign of relapse infiltration of the disease into the liver i ordered a full panel blood workup depending on what that turned up i was ready to do a bone marrow aspiration and a lumbar puncture more intrusive tests even the most compliant patients dont like them but when i mentioned that to sandra she stayed calm that made me wonder if shed ever been through them in the first place i ordered the tests back stat scheduled her for a five pm recheck that day she said she was hungry so i gave her some money to get a hamburger in the cafeteria she and her cousin her cousin another girl around the same age said katzman the two of them showed up with a man some guy in his forties he dropped them off at the clinic and left but the cousin stayed the blood workup came back negative for leukemia but positive for hepatitis a viral hepatitis which isnt as bad as hep c but it should be followed i was ready to admit her for observation but she didnt show for the recheck big surprise thats when i phoned the doctor from oakland hed never heard of her wasnt even an oncologist a family practitioner working out of some medical clinic she mustve gotten hold of some stationery and forged the letter is she in danger from the hepatitis not unless her resistance gets bad and something else hits her hep a is generally selflimiting thats doctortalk for goes away on its own her eyes are still yellow said petra she came in id guess four months ago by six months patients are usually better how do you catch it poor sanitation katzman paused prostitutes and other promiscuous people are at risk if they engage in anal sex you figure sandra for promiscuous she was flirtatious but thats all i can say during the time she was in the system said petra how much money did she squeeze out i couldnt begin to tell you the cousin said petra what do you remember about her quiet girl sandra was more outgoing nicelooking kid despite the jaundice the cousin just sat there was she about sandras age maybe a little younger shorter than sandra chubby curly reddish hair silence that sounds familiar did she happen to wear pink sneakers yes said katzman bright pink i remember that he sounded amazed that the memory had returned petra said what else can you tell me about their relationship i wasnt noticing i was concentrating on sandras jaundice petra tensed had she touched the girl that night in the parking lot would you consider her contagious doctor i wouldnt exchange body fluids with a hep a but youre not going to get it by shaking hands what can you tell me about the adult male who came with the girls all i remember is his dropping them off in the waiting room and leaving i noticed because id stepped out to see a patient off i was planning to have a talk with him responsible adult and all that but he was gone before i could turn around whatd he look like said petra all i really saw was his back you noticed his age said petra in his forties amend that to middle aged from the way he carried himself thirty to fifty what was he wearing sorry said katzman id be getting into the realm of fantasy lots of that going around petra said would loretta brainerd know more about any of this i wouldnt think so but feel free to ask her thanks doctor there is one thing said katzman sandra gave her age as fifteen but my guess is shes older closer to eighteen or nineteen i cant back that up scientifically its just something that came to me after i realized id been conned there was a certain i wouldnt say sophistication a certain confidence he laughed about her confidence game she called brainerd the social worker barely remembered sandra leon hanging up petra thought back to the parking lot interview the girl had just witnessed the violent death of her cousin but had displayed no shock no grief none of the emotionality youd expect from a teenage girl confronted by tragedy on the contrary shed been dryeyed tapping her foot impatient as if petra was taking up her precious time the only thing that had sparked anxiety in the girls eyes had been initial eye contact with petra cool about the homicide but nervous about the cops claiming to be fifteen when she faked her patient status but that night shed given her age as sixteen her dress and makeup fit with katzmans guess that she was older dolled up fancier than the girl in the pink sneakers party garb down to the appliqué mole celebrating what an adult male had accompanied both girls sandra had mentioned a convict brother a car thief petra flipped through her notepad found her hastily scrawled shorthand bro gta lompoc she called the state prison spoke to an assistant warden learned that two leons resided within the walls robert leroy age sixtythree fraud and grand theft and rudolfo sabino age fortyfive manslaughter and mayhem the warden was kind enough to check both inmates visitors lists no one had been to see rudolfo leon for over three years sad case he was hiv positive and suffering from dementia the older man robert leroy leon had a bevy of visitors but no sandra no one close to the girl in approximate age and appearance another lie sandra leon had progressed officially from witness to person of interest petra paged mac dilbeck and told him about the scam he said she knew the vic but wasnt upset so maybe she knew it was going to happen thats what im thinking good work petra nothing else on this adult male not yet im wondering about something else leon quoted me her rights and i asked her if she had experience with the law she told me a story about a brother locked up at lompoc turns out to be another load of bs but why would she volunteer the information when it would tie her in with a criminal why not just dummy up maybe your question threw her off said mac shes a liar but still in training so she blurted out a halftruth covered with a phony detail a relative in the system said petra but not a brother maybe even a brother but not at lompoc that cancer scam was sophisticated not the kind of thing a virgin would try this girls had experience i wonder if shes part of a criminal enterprise a family thing some kind of gypsy thing like the tinkers like those somalians we busted last year yeah why not if theres an inmate leon somewhere in the system for scamming that would be really interesting robert leons locked up for fraud and theft but hes too old to be her brother interesting maybe the murders related to some scam thing and the girl in the pink shoes was the intended victim she said they set it up to look like some gang thing sandra wasnt freaked out because she knew cold said dilbeck very cold okay time to check the entire system state and federal pens even county jails whos going to do it you mind im doing it solo well said mac montoyas already been assigned a fresh case and the rest of my day is committed meeting with the hotshots downtown gonna sit there while they explain why theyre so much smarter than we are course if you want to trade places no thanks said petra ill go fetch my magic wand she ran cons named leon through ncic and the rest of the data banks came up with way too many hits time for a little logic sandra leon had brought katzman a letter from a clinic in oakland meaning she or someone she knew had spent some time there she focused on bay area leons which narrowed the search to twelve two inmates john b twentyfive charles c twentyfour fit the brother agerange both were from oakland and when she pulled up their stats she knew shed earned her share of the taxpayers money johns middle name was barrymore and charless was chaplin katzmans take on sandra shes a pretty good actress then she learned that the men were brothers and allowed herself a grin a passing detective said youre sure happy petra said once in a while john barrymore leon was serving a fiveyear sentence at norco for mail fraud and charlie chaplin leon had earned himself two years at chino for theft breaking into vending machines in an oakland arcade the wardens at norco were unavailable and the guard supervisor was new on the job but his counterpart at chino turned out to be a font of information the leons were members of an oaklandbased crime group called the players and several of their cousins had done penitentiary time his estimate of their membership was fifty to sixty most related by blood but some whod married in or had been informally adopted the majority were hispanic guatemalan americans but there were plenty of whites and blacks and at least two asians petra said diversity in the workplace the chino guard laughed they use violence she asked him not that ive heard they concentrate on scams run a lot of welfare schemes they like to think of themselves as actors because the boss tried to be one the boss was a failed actor with a fortyyear history of property crimes robert leroy leon sixtythree aka the director currently residing at lompoc lots of visitors but no sandra mac had been deadon the girl had slipped blurted out a partial truth petra pressed the chino guy for everything he knew about the players he gave her the names of some possible members but not much more she wrote down copious notes and booted up her computer logging on to google she plugged in the players and came up with hits players scams pulled up exactly one website a protest against corporate malfeasance it was nearly seven pm and she was suddenly tired and overwhelmed she was staring at the screen and wondering where to go next when isaacs voice drew her away from all those zeros hi he said her eyes shot to the bruise on his cheek faded no covered up hed tried to mask it with makeup the result was clumsy a flaking splotch hey she said i hope the other guy came out of it worse chapter isaac blushed through the makeup no big deal he said too casually the hallway was dark when i got home and i bumped into the wall oh said petra a few flakes of makeup had landed on the shoulder of his blue shirt he saw her looking at them and flicked them away i was wondering if there was anything i could do for you it was seven thirtytwo pm working late said petra i had obligations on campus all day figured id come by here see if you needed me one million six hundred forty thousand hits petra smiled as a matter of fact she gave him the info on sandra leon and the players and watched him hurry over to his laptop thrilled to be busy she was wornout and hungry she returned to shannons took the same stool at the bar and ordered a bud and a corned beef sandwich the flat screen was tuned to an infomercial none of the boozers at the bar were interested in buying cubic zirconium mystical bracelets new bartender on shift a woman and she didnt squawk when petra asked her to put on fox news and format it so the running border was visible yeah its annoying the woman said you want to read something and it cuts everything in half three other boozers nodded agreement older guys grizzled in wrinkled work uniforms the bar smelled of their sweat the color in their faces said st patricks day had started early one looked at petra and smiled not a lecherous leer paternal crazily she thought about her dad the shockingly rapid alzheimers fade she chewed on her sandwich drank her beer ordered another shot her eyes to the tv when she heard tel aviv charred and twisted outdoor furniture ambulance howls hasidic types cleaning up body parts the death toll had risen to three one of the wounded had succumbed to injuries suffered in the blast the number of wounded was now precise twentysix hamas and one of arafats groups were each claiming credit credit fuck them the sandwich steamed up at her her nose filled with brine and her stomach began churning she threw money on the bar and left the female bartender called out everything okay honey when petra reached the door the woman shouted can i at least wrap it to go she drove around the city aimlessly recklessly listening to the horn blares of those shed offended and not giving a damn spaced out she pushed the accord through traffic as if it was on tracks not looking at people the way she usually did off the job a job that never really ended but tonight it had tonight she wanted nothing to do with cons scumbags felons and miscreants had no patience to look for furtive glances suspicious moves the sudden popcornburst of violence that changed everything twentysix injured eric had phoned her so he had to be okay but eric was stoic about pain after the stabbing when hed come to hed refused analgesics perforated and he claimed he didnt feel a thing the doctors couldnt believe he could tolerate it propped up in that hospital bed so pale his parents and her and the bimbo waiting silently bye bye blondie i won what was the prize she made it home without causing a collision and painted like a demon for four hours straight working till her eyes crossed just after midnight without stopping to appraise her progress she switched off the lights stumbled to bed stripped off her clothes while lying down asleep before she took three breaths at fourfourteen am she was jolted awake by the phone its me he said oh she said stupidly clearing her head how are you fine youre not hurt thank god its minor you oh god tiny piece of shrapnel in the calf your basic flesh wound oh god eric in and out its really no big deal now she was sitting up heart racing hands frigid shrapnel in your leg is no big deal i was lucky he said the first asshole had packed his vest with nuts and bolts and ragged sheet metal the second used ball bearings and they passed straight through they more than one wound a couple of small punctures im fine petra a couple meaning two silence eric three three ball bearings through your leg no bone or tendon damage just muscle it feels like i worked out too hard where are you calling from the hospital which one where tel aviv silence damn you said petra what im going to phone the goddamn plo and give away state secrets tel aviv he said i cant talk long its an ongoing investigation like they dont know whodunit silence petra said youre the one who spotted the first one right he didnt answer right she demanded it was pretty obvious petra ninety degrees outside hes wearing an overcoat and looking like hes about to throw up a kid they use kids for that right early twenties said eric a punk an asshole you were with army guys and cops anyone else spot him silence answer me eric they were distracted so youre the hero bad word tough she said youre the hero i want you to be my hero he didnt respond shut up girl you should be comforting him not playing dependent diva sorry she said im just i didnt know i was worried i can be your hero he said its the other people who bug me chapter monday june am detectives room hollywood division isaac was waiting for petra when she arrived she walked past him and continued to the ladies room needing to compose herself frazzled despite the weekend because of the weekend all the dread shed suffered solo determined to put the bombing and work out of her mind shed sustained herself with catchup chores and manic bouts of painting that were proving monumentally depressing her okeeffe copy was a gloomy mess the old gal had been a genius petra knew she could never approach that level but simply copying shouldnt be this hard impulsively shed slathered black paint all over the canvas then regretted it and sat at her easel crying long time since shed cried not since rescuing billy and giving him up to his new life what the hell was happening to her she covered the black with white then followed with a coat of magenta because shed heard that someone some famous artist used that shade for primer with the reek of turpentine stinging her nose she washed her brushes took a long toohot bath that left her body red and stinging and tight maybe a run would help or at least a walk no to hell with that shed eat ice cream she finished off sunday with shopping and phone calls to her five brothers and their wives and kids five happy families their complete hectic domesticated lives a brief call from eric late sunday night brought a glow to her cheeks but left her feeling abandoned when he hung up without saying he missed her hed be staying longer in israel than planned was booked for some highlevel embassy meetings and whatnot then maybe on to morocco and tunisia quiet places for the mideast but there were rumors thats all he could say in his absence she turned to the papers and the tv news seeking vicarious contact nothing more about the bombing geopolitical business as usual at some level arent we all statistics now she stood at the ladies room mirror blew her nose primped her hair thirty years old and my face is starting to sag arching her back in order to flaunt whatever bosom fate had provided her she batted her lashes fluffed her hair struck a vixen pose hey sailor then she thought of the dead sailor darren hochenbrenner brained and left in a skidrow alley the other june killings eleven days until june and she was no further along than when isaac had presented her with his little gift the kid was out there looking eager she straightened her posture put on a businesslike expression erased all traces of femme fatale as if thered been any to begin with he stayed at his desk until she beckoned him over whats up as far as i can tell law enforcement doesnt know much about the players currently there are five alleged members in prison alleged because all five deny membership in any group petra took out her notepad isaac said ive got it saved can print it out for you she put the pad away whos in prison the two you found john and charles are grandsons of robert leon a nonrelative named anson cruft was convicted of possession of false identification papers and a woman named susan bianca who ran a legal brothel in nevada then tried the same thing in san luis obispo is locked up for pandering shes a younger sister of robert leons second wife katherine leon roberts kind of interesting forty years ago he did some fashion modeling then he got a few small parts on soap operas here in hollywood but after that nothing somewhere along the line he turned to crime how he started is unclear hes guatemalan but has lived here most of his life his first wife was mexican the daughter of a nuestra familia gangster she died of cancer and he doesnt seem to have ever hooked up with nf at least thats what the prison people say he did manage a porno theater in san francisco as well as some strip clubs and adult bookstores thats where he met katherine she was a dancer i suppose any of those environments couldve put him in contact with other criminal types but maybe its a gang thing he shrugged thats all i know thats all huh your best bet is probably to talk to local police i was kidding isaac you did great thats more than i couldve pulled up the compliment seemed to zip right past him and he remained grave she turned to her own computer pulled up robert leons file on ncic the most recent mug shot showed a lean silverhaired guy with a long seamed face thick wavy hair combed straight back jetblack mustache sixtythree but he looked younger good bone structure she could see hints of the young male model on soap operas hed be cast as a latin lover leon had smirked for the booking officer despite the wiseguy quality to the smile it managed to be engaging above the smile the hard eyes of a seasoned con did you come across any sibs for the brothers she asked not specifically said isaac but i did find a story in a free san francisco weekly that said robert leon had lots of kids kind of a gypsy king situation but theyre not ethnic gypsies anything else interesting in the article not really it wasnt very well written hippie prose kind of a retrosixties thing ill print it too petra born in considered all the hippie stuff quaint history what could it mean to him okay thanks she said youve given me something to work with on june i havent come up with anything new he hesitated what maybe i made something out of nothing you didnt said petra its definitely something let me run with what youve given me on leon and his gang then lets get together later say four or five and brainstorm the june stuff if youre free i am he said definitely ive got some things to do on campus but i can be back by then his smile was big as the ocean petra phoned lompoc a second time and got the details on robert leons visitors three names interested her an eighteenyearold female named marcella douquette with a venice address on brooks and two guys in their forties whod listed residences here in hollywood albert martin leon fortyfive whitley avenue lyle mario leon fortyone sycamore drive she tried all three phone numbers disconnected back to ncic albert and lyle had both done time for nonviolent crimes albert in nevada and lyle in san diego mug shots showed a clear resemblance to robert leon the same leanness the wavy hair alberts was already gray and he wore it parted in the middle and down to his shoulders no looker his nose was mashed and offcenter and his eyes crowded the misshapen cartilage his stats said his body was full of scars he was a badcheck artist lyle leons hair was still dark clipped at the sides bushy and squaredoff on top an eraserheaddo far too young for his age an earring and a bristly soul patch said this guy thought himself quite the hipster hed been busted for peddling worthless cleaning solutions to old folk had done less than a year in san diego smalltime hustler trying to look like the big dude there was no mention of the relationship between either man and robert leon given the age difference the patriarch mightve sired sons early or albert and lyle were roberts cousins whatever no criminal record for marcella douquette the girl was young give her time maybe none of it meant a thing but it was time to do some legwork albert and lyle leons addresses were bogus same setup as sandras multiunit apartments no record of either man ever living there neither con was on parole and neither had registered any motor vehicles so there was no way to trace them petra drove to venice the brooks avenue house was one of three clapboard single units on a dirt lot in definite gang territory teeny little shacky thing sitting askew on a raised foundation tarpaper roof ragged boards the surrounding lot cordoned by chain link and full of litter spare tires an old washing machine rolls of plastic tarp soda bottles beer cans splintered parts of wooden pallets it was one pm and the shavedhead crowd was sleeping in petra could smell the ocean a nice salty fragrance with just the slightest undertone of rot the shack was a total dive but only a quick hop to the beach venice beach where deviance was the norm and scamsters worked the tourists every sunday perfect for the players and their ilk petras chest twitched maybe she was finally on to something she got out of the car looked up and down the block let her fingers settle atop the spot on her hip where her gun rested a platter of soupy gray fog pressed down on the ocean the usual june gloom and the entire neighborhood was washed in newspaperphoto tones maybe thats why the headbasher chose june to do his thing depressed over ugly weather she waited some more took in marcella douquettes alleged residence from a distance and made sure no lowriders were cruising the chainlink fence was locked and bolted but low barely at waist level petra approached the property waited for the requisite pit bull to show nothing she checked out the street one more time got a toehold in a chainlink diamond and was over no doorbell no answer to her assertive knocks she was about to walk around behind the shack when the door to the neighboring unit opened and a man stepped out squinting hispanic midtwenties barechested wispy crew cut wispy mustache to match like that old actor cantinflas he wore baggy blue swim trunks and nothing else his soft hairless chest all of him was the color of mocha ice cream nicely burgeoning potbelly outsized outie navel that resembled a summer squash sue that obstetrician no tattoos or scars that she could see no machoswagger either just a sleepylooking flabby guy getting up at pm she gave him a businesslike nod he nodded back sniffed the airyawned she went up to him you live here for a while sir his reply was too soft to make out so petra got closer and said pardon just for the summer when did you start living here the guy stared at her she flashed the badge he yawned again through the door to his shack she saw a graycarpeted room with a blue couch and a pumpkincolored beanbag outsized black leather case atop the couch the window shades were drawn mildew from the carpet wafted out to the stagnant june air i started may one he said why why may said petra thats when school was over college cal state northridge he hitched his swim trunks they slid back down whats up petra evaded the question with a smile whatre you studying photography photojournalism i live in the valley figured venice would be a good place to get shots for my portfolio he frowned whats going on petra looked up at the sky how does the fog affect your photography with the right filters you can do cool stuff another frown are there problems cause i didnt realize how sketchy the neighborhood was but now i see where its at problems i wouldnt leave my equipment in the house alone bad neighbors the whole neighborhood i dont go out much at night probably ill leave at the end of the month no lease month to month whos the landlord some corporation i got it from an ad at the csun bulletin board cheap said petra real cheap petra said im trying to track down a young woman named marcella douquette she the one next door theres a girl living next door used to be havent seen her for a while how longs a while he scratched his chin maybe a couple of weeks ago right around the time of the paradiso shootings petra said could i have your name please sir mine yes ovid arnaz mr arnaz ive got a photo here not the kind of thing youd take from the coroners office you up for looking at it ive been to the coroners said ovid arnaz for a class we met with crime photographers strong stuff arnaz stretched his neck it was interesting he glanced at the shack next door what shes dead petra showed him the least disturbing postmortem of the girl in the pink sneakers ovid arnaz regarded it without a trace of emotion yup he said thats her petra phoned pacific division explained the situation to an amiable sergeant and within five minutes three patrol cars had sped to the scene the tech van took another twenty minutes to arrive during which the uniforms stood around and petra talked more to ovid arnaz on the quiet side but he turned out to be a firstrate source photographers memory keen eye for details he remembered marcella douquettes pink shoes she always wore them and described her face and body to a t more important he reported that shed lived with two other people another girl pretty slender blond who had to be sandra and an older guy with a weird bushy haircut and a soul patch lyle the dude leon petra showed arnaz lyles mug shot to be sure thats him dressed like a pirate what do you mean silk shirts with those big sleeves like pirates used to wear he was less helpful when it came to describing behavior or emotion no hed never seen any conflict among the three of them no he had no idea how they got along or how they spent their free time none of the three had spoken to him much they went their way he went his during the day im mostly out shooting film when i go out at night its in the valley cause thats where my friends live sometimes i spend the night there at your friends arnaz looked away briefly yeah or my folks scared by the neighborhood he returns to mom and dad at night he said they dont like me living out here i tell them its cool petra said makes total sense though long as youre out there avoid the drive back yeah said ovid arnaz and i know my equipments safe chapter mac dilbeck looked at the photo of marcella douquette our victim petra said maybe our main victim shes got no record but was living with a member of a known criminal enterprise could be the other kids just happened to be in the parking lot at the wrong time the two of them were having coffee at musso and frank the front room one of the stiffbacked booths hollywood oldsters and retro types petras age loped in and out petra was having apple pie and mac had chosen rhubarb with vanilla ice cream luc montoya occupied with his new case a selma avenue stabbing was off the paradiso case permanently mac forked loose an equilateral triangle of pie and guided it smoothly into his mouth it was five pm and hed been on for a day and a half but his gray sharkskin suit was immaculate and his white shirt looked freshly pressed petra had left a message with isaac at usc canceling their pm meet she felt exhilarated by the id on douquette but on the verge of letdown because of all the whodunit that remained eleven days till june but this was more important this was now mac said you did great work he wiped an already clean mouth with a linen napkin out of nowhere you pull an id abracadabra said petra she waved an imaginary wand mac smiled so youre thinking this lyle characters the one he and sandra leon lived with marcella in venice the landlord said leon paid six months rent in advance hard cash gave the name lewis tiger leon means lion in spanish right said mac lion tiger cute if he did this hes a damned snake said petra the players have no rep for violence but maybe internally its different maybe robert leon rules with an iron fist from his cell in lompoc sandra never visited him but marcella did last year and guess what shes the only female who did youre thinking she offended the boss the coroner said shed had a recent abortion maybe that broke some kind of rule getting pregnant or having the abortion could be either said petra maybe the father was an outsider or lyle he was living with both girls in a very small house anything couldve happened for all we know getting pregnant was the ideal the females role in the group is to breed and by terminating she committed a bigtime nono providing younguns for the clan said mac sounds like a cult what about sandra sandras sick hepatitis a that couldve prevented her from conceiving or lyle knew about it and stayed away or he was the one who gave it to her she repeated what katzman had told her about unsanitary sex mac excised and ate a smaller triangle of pie kind of ironic her trying to fake out like she had cancer and shes sick with something else maybe the group knew all along she was sick and has been taking advantage of it to pull off medical scams dangerous game no i assume viral hepatitis is pretty serious type a goes away by itself usually by six months mac put his fork down and ran his index finger along the border of the postmortem photo assuming marcella was hit by lyle or another player you think sandra knew about it when i interviewed her she wasnt shocked she was edgy thats why i noticed her maybe shes learned to keep things to herself the players said mac never heard of them they mostly work the north end of the state and nevada isaac got you all this petra nodded the genius said mac he pushed his plate away the pie a halfeaten polygon its progress but im not sure its good enough to keep the downtown boys at bay we hand them the id and the probable cause and they chase it down you know how it works petra maybe its best that way dambrosios their captain he wants five guys he gets five he asks for ten he gets ten that kind of coverage could be what the case needs fine said petra it isnt but mac folded his napkin into a rectangle ill do my best to see you get credit for developing the lead dont worry about it she said fair is fair on what planet sorry he said wish there was a choice i understand she said but she was thinking maybe there is a choice chapter the gun didnt weigh that much but isaac felt the difference in his briefcase hed swaddled the twentytwo in a cheap blue bandanna purchased at a ninetyninecent outlet a few blocks from cantina nueva stuffed the package in the bottom of the case under his laptop tools of the trade usc was a short bus ride from the bar and he made it on time for his appointment with dr leibowitz avuncular dr leibowitz at their first meeting isaac had thought too good to be true later hed seen that leibowitz was supportive of all his students a year from retirement a man at peace the meeting went well as always leibowitz smiling and fooling with an empty briar pipe hed been off tobacco for years but kept the pipes and a collection of smoking accoutrements as props howre those multivariates coming along some of my initial hypotheses seem to be panning out though the process seems to be infinite each new finding engenders another hypothesis in truth he hadnt looked at his calculations for over a week caught up with june the rhythm of the detectives room all that noise and anger and frustration petra leibowitz nodded sagely such is science fortified by leibowitzs strong tea isaac headed straight for a seldomused mens room at the end of the hall pressing his back against the door he placed the briefcase on the floor removed the gun unwrapped it hefted it pointed it at the mirror and scowled tough guy ludicrous footsteps in the hallway caused him to panic he dropped the gun and the bandanna back in the case the weapon landed with a thud the footsteps continued on and he stooped and rewrapped the twentytwo added another layer of concealment the brown paper bag from the lunch mama had fixed him today if anyone looked inside theyd see a greasespecked care package redolent of chili and cornmeal mother love getting the gun into the station was no problem since nineeleven front security at the wilcox station had been tighter but inconsistent on most days eyeball scrutiny of incoming traffic sufficed when the terror alert rose to a warm color a portable metal detector was wheeled in and all the cops entered through the rear door on the south side of the building isaacs political connection had gotten him an officiallooking clipon lapd badge and a key that unlocked the rear door he rarely needed to use the key the station was old with an inefficient cooling system and the door was generally left open for circulation he climbed the stairs filled with pleasant expectations of his meeting with petra four male detectives were there but she wasnt an hour later he finally accepted the fact she wasnt going to show packing up he descended to the ground floor made his way to the rear door closed now he opened it on the overly lit expanse of asphalt all those blackandwhites and unmarked sedans warm night he wondered why shed stood him up shed seemed to be taking june seriously its not a standup stupid shes a working detective something came up hed go home arrive in time for dinner make mama happy tomorrow morning hed head straight to campus hide away at his corner table in the far reaches of doheny librarys third subbasement cosseted by yellow walls red floors dusty stacks of old botany books hed sit think needing to produce needing something to show petra chapter tuesday june pm captain schoelkopfs office when the bastard called petra in she was ready knowing full well what shed done and ready to take the heat the approved way to get what she wanted wouldve been to notify the shift lieutenant receive his permission to talk to the captain obtain his permission to contact the departments public affairs office make a phone request to the pa desk jockeys follow up with a tedious written application that gave away too many facts of the case and then wait for approval her way had been to call up five reporters she knew newshounds with whom shed accumulated brownie points by trading anonymous info for discretion patricia glass at the times and four tv field correspondents no radio folk because they were of no use to her on this all five were interested and she faxed the cleanest photo she had of marcella douquette along with lyle leons mug shot spicing up the package with intimations of mysterious crime cabals and pleas not to say too much a cabal huh kind of like manson said leticia gomez from channel five burt knutsen from on the spot news made an almost identical comment the recent college grad who worked for abc said kabbalah like madonnas into petra hedged didnt deny at this point whatever got the photos on the air was good all four local news broadcasts aired them at eleven pm repeated it on todays morning broadcast nothing in the times but that was a massive bureaucracy so maybe tomorrow at two pm schoelkopf ordered her into his office she expected hell got only lackluster purgatory schoelkopf leaning back in his naugahyde desk chair tossing out all the appropriately hostile utterances but not with his usual vitriol more of a formal recitation distracted as if none of this really mattered she kind of missed the old way was he feeling all right when he paused to take a breath she actually said are you okay sir he sprang forward glared smoothed his gelled black hair why wouldnt i be you look a little fatigued im in training for the marathon never felt better cut the bullshit connor stop trying to change the subject the facts are you fucked up by not going through channels and wasted everyones time and quite probably fucked up a case i admit i was a little hasty sir but in terms of wasted wasted he reiterated homspecs taking it off your hands first ive heard about that she lied is he cut her off with a wave his nails usually manicured and buffed were too long his beige designer imitation suit was wrinkled and his shirt collar looked too large weight loss due to marathon training he definitely looked tired then petra noticed another discrepancy the framed photo of him and his third wife vacationing in mazatlan was gone from his desk empty space where the picture had sat problems at home she said im sorry sir another wave dont fuck up again or therell be repercussions theres a limit to how far your status can carry you my status schoelkopf smirked speaking of special treatment whats your pet genius doing his research meaning he works on his doctoral dissertation and keeps out of trouble schoelkopfs eyes hyphened no problems on that end none sir why i dont need a why connor thats true sir are you keeping a close eye on alberto einstein i didnt know i was suppo youre on babysitting duty connor get it dont fuck that up schoelkopf adjusted himself in his chair so what did all your media hype accomplish weve had calls cut the crap nothing yet sir but the calls are still to petras astonishment schoelkopf nodded said who the hell knows maybe somethingll actually happen because of your fuckup if not you just fucked up by four pm shed fielded thirtyfive messages resulting from the broadcasts all duds at four thirtytwo patricia glass from the times phoned and said you obviously dont need us anymore petra said we need all the help we can get then you shouldve waited snapped glass i had the article all written up and ready to go then my editor saw it last night on four and killed it we dont rehash old stories petra thought have you actually read your own paper she said its not old patricia the case is still unsolved once the airheads get it its old next time let me know if youre going to them dont waste my time im sorry if it put you in a position but it did said glass click by fivethirty twenty additional calls came in five from alleged psychics three from obvious psychotics the rest from wellmeaning citizens who had nothing to offer shed messed up and gotten nothing in return she felt bad for a minute then thought in a world where fanatical idiots blow themselves up big deal but she had trouble rationalizing it away feeling low she was about to call the day to a close when her phone rang and erics voice said im at kennedy scheduled for an eight oclock back to la if its on time i should be in by eleven back for good said petra or are you en route somewhere no other plans what happened to morocco and tunisia canceled are you all right yes youre okay to travel with your leg i considered leaving the leg behind but decided to take it along funny she said then she realized it was also the first time hed ever tried to joke with her and shed killed it lord she said ill pick you up what airline ill catch a cab no she said ill pick you up what airline eric hesitated want me to circle the airport she said american she hung up with her heart pounding what was that all about filed what needed to be filed shut down her computer collected her stuff and left the dectectives room time to do something for herself before heading for lax a light dinner somewhere casual and quiet that storefront mongolian place on la brea the family that ran it always treated her like royalty followed by a soak in the tub some of that girliestuff bath lotion one of her brothers had sent her for her birthday that shed never used then careful application of makeup even mascara which she detested because she could never apply it without getting grit in her eyes a little blush her cheekbones were still good her best feature shed always thought nick had always made a big deal about her cheekbones during the first years of their marriage when he was still noticing things eric had never remarked upon them or any other of her physical features never really complimented her except when they were making love and all sorts of utterances flew out of his mouth like little birds afterward sweatcoated and panting they shared mutual silence she never complimented him either would he notice the little touches no matter shed feel the difference mascara and blush and a change into something feminine and dare she say it sexy after a day like this could she muster up sexy well just have to see about that she took the stairs down to the rear exit nearly bumped into isaac in the stairwell hed just shoved the door open and was heading up the kid didnt drive why was he entering through the parking lot probably because thats where she took him when they exited he recovered from the surprise and said hi his back was erect his shoulders high grinning at her with bravado hi she said i hoped id catch you he said you were working pretty late last night last night their meeting oh crap im sorry something just came up on the paradiso shootings yup she lied he waited for elaboration when none followed he started swinging his briefcase against his leg little boy disappointed no more bravado and ive got to leave now she said sure he said whenever you have time the decent thing would be to go back upstairs and shmooze with him she was just too tired he said ive got someone a librarian at doheny the university library checking out historical references what kind of references old crime stories outofprint books papers anything related to june you think someones studying history and reliving it its all i could come up with he said sounding anything but confident petra thought about that isaac must have taken it for skepticism because he blushed i didnt tell her why i was asking just asked her to focus on the date she has access to the rarebook section so if something bypassed the internet shed be the one to find it i thought the net swept up everything said petra thats exactly what the net does sweep its a big cybervacuum cleaner that sucks up everything in its path indiscriminately but corners get overlooked for all the garbage that gets ingested you can find arcane obscure references that never make it to any website i had one situation in a graduate anthropology course where we were looking into tribal matchmaking rituals and youd think thered be absolutely nothing not already covered in the primary and secondary sources but he cut himself off kicked one foot with the other i also spooled some microfiche of the main la papers but all i got through was the last thirty years if i have time ill do some more of course if the source isnt local that would be a problem petra said i appreciate all the time youre putting in on this itll probably end up being futile now youre starting to sound like me she said his smile was weak anyway have a nice evening he began to move past her youre sticking around she said seeing as ive got a desk i might as well do some work he chewed his lip of course if youre free for dinner or something i wish i was isaac unfortunately ive really got to run catch you tomorrow probably he said tight voice im not sure when i can make it over ive got a couple of meetings then i was planning to go back and do more microfiche dont exhaust yourself she said sounding nothing but maternal im okay he said sounding nothing but adolescent she smiled in his general direction but he was looking away again without another word she shoved at the door and hurried out to the parking lot the night was warm and sweaty two detectives she didnt recognize slouched toward the far end laughing chatting one pivoted to look at her then returned his attention to his partners banter she hurried to her car putting isaacs discomfiture out of her mind time to focus me me me mongolian hot pot they treat me well i deserve to be treated well maybe shed pick up a magazine and read while she ate something not too challenging playing with her chopsticks pretending to be content then shed go get eric chapter stupid isaac hunched at his desk faced a grubby wall hot and sandyeyed and abashed alone in the detectives room except for that old guy barney fleischer who always seemed to be around but never seemed to be really working fleischer had a radio on at low volume some sort of easylistening instrumental didnt even look up when isaac entered by now no one in the detectives room noticed his comings and goings he was a fixture to all of them including petra asking her to dinner when shes rushing out on a case what had he been thinking unlike fleischer petra worked the job mattered to her despite all the frustration chasing down leads that failed to materialize a woman like that needed to parcel out her time carefully why in the world would she even contemplate stopping for dinner with him to her he was an assignment nothing more and yet shed been generous with her time letting him ride along sharing details of cases that skin those eyes the way her black hair just floated into place stop it stupid he started to wonder again about the june murders was his hypothesis all part of an inane infatuation hed been so certain the thrill of discovery when he first came across the pattern had nearly blown him out of his seat eureka ha at the time he thought hed been careful not to leap into conjecture without calculating and recalculating subjecting his hypotheses to multiple tests of significance the data had seemed clear this was something but what if hed convinced himself a mathematical quirk was meaningful because hed been blinded by his own bullshit because hed wanted to produce for petra did it all boil down to preening the ludicrous mating rituals of an absurd little game bird god he hoped not no it had to be real petra was an expert and she believed it because hed worn her down all his life his academic life hed been told he was built for success that the combination of brains and perseverance couldnt miss but perseverance could be pathological couldnt it he had that in him the blindered compulsiveness the irrational relentlessness barney fleischer looked over his shoulder and stared and said hey there hey detective fleischer burning the midnight oil a few hours left till then shes out you know left a few minutes ago i know said isaac fleischer studied him and isaac could see cold hard appraisal in the old guys eyes once a detective anything i can do for you son no thanks said isaac i thought id do some paperwork on my research oh said fleischer he turned his music up louder resumed whatever hed been doing isaac took out his laptop booted up called up a page of numbers pretended to be concentrating instead he flashed back to the agony of selfdoubt step back be objective six victims nothing in common but the date his calculations said it had to be meaningful but could he be trusted to think straight no no however dorky his motives this was real hed run the numbers too many times for it to be anything but real june today was the eighteenth if he was right someone some unsuspecting innocent random person would step out into a night full of expectations only to experience the crushing pain of a cranium pulverized to pulp then nothing suddenly he wanted to be wrong that had never happened before chapter wednesday june am terminal lax the flights arrival had been delayed for two hours and the baggage claim area stank of uncertainty all those weary loved ones sitting pacing peering at the board shaking their heads sometimes cursing as the numbers got worse petra spent the time sitting and rereading a copy of people magazine the bath shed taken three hours ago had been okay but shed been too hyped up to enjoy it jumping out toweling off spending a lot of time on her makeup and clothes finally selecting a tight black top over gray linen slacks the smooth black wonderbra gave her a lift nature hadnt she drove quickly to the airport found parking after two gorounds and still arrived early then she waited when the arrival time was finally announced an hour away she left the terminal to take a walk along the dim mostly deserted walkways of the airports lower level a woman walking alone her gun was in her purse no metal detectors anywhere near the baggage claim a clear lapse of security that she welcomed tonight when she got back passengers from a mexico city flight had clogged the area when they finally cleared the landed sign was flashing for erics flight and she stationed herself near the swinging doors that bottomed the arrival ramp and peered through the glass sparse flight just a trickle of zombies bumping down the ramp eric was among the last passengers to appear and she spotted him well before he got to the doors dark blue sweatshirt faded jeans sneakers his little olivegreen swiss mountainclimbers backpack slung over one shoulder light wood cane in his left hand a limp when he saw her he straightened and waved the cane as if it were superfluous he came through the doors she rushed him hugged him felt bones and sinew and tension the cane bumped against her leg excuse me annoyed female voice they were blocking the exit stepping aside petra caught a murderous glance from an allinblack harridan who tried to engage her in extended ocular warfare she smiled and hugged eric again he said one suitcase they walked toward the carousel petra reached for his backpack he held on to it im fine handing her the cane to prove it they stood there silent as bags bumped through the chute boy this is romantic she got between him and the revolving luggage kissed him hard on the ride home he said thanks for picking me up it was a tough decision he touched her knee withdrew its good to see you she said good to see you hows your leg really its okay really how long do you have to use that thing i could probably ditch it now she took century to the north not much traffic on the freeway good time to challenge the speed limits your place she said thinking she really didnt want to drive to studio city we could go to your place we could when they arrived he pronounced himself rancid and took a shower she ran the water and as it warmed fixed him coffee when he slipped off his sweatshirt she saw white flesh and bones the thin sheath of muscle that rescued him from downright scrawny a bandage on his shoulder he saw her eyeing it a fragment nicked me its nothing he stepped out of his jeans and removed his jockeys his left calf was encased in thick bandages she said you can get it wet theres inflammation but no infection in a couple of days ill find a doctor and have the dressings changed he headed for the bathroom and petra followed at a distance stood in the door as he hobbled into the shower got a hard spray going water bulleting the pebbled glass door petra watched his fuzzy reflection to heck with this she stripped down and joined him cruel and inconsiderate the positions she got him into a wounded man no less he cried out in gratitude and when they were done and lying naked and moist on her bed he said i missed you touching her breast her nipple sprang erect missed you too they kissed and he got hard again had he really craved her or was it just this hed desired was there a difference she broke a long clinch hungry he thought about that maybe ill scrounge in your fridge she placed a hand on his flat warm chest dont move ill fix you something he made his way through the turkey sandwich potato chips and hastily assembled almostfresh salad she prepared eating the usual eric way silent deliberate chewing slowly the politely closed mouth not a single errant crumb nary a grease stain on his lips she studied the turn of his wrists thin for a man long delicate fingers he shouldve played an instrument she realized shed never heard him hum or sing or express any interest in music the shower had loosened his shoulder bandage and hed redressed the wound with ointment from his backpack then popped an antibiotic petra thought the threeinch gash a lot more than nothing ragged and puffy surrounded by puckered reddened flesh horrible what would his leg look like she said whyd you cut the trip short to see you i wish its true he said maybe partially true tell me the whole thing it had gone down this way eric an israeli security officer and three other foreign cops an englishman an australian and a belgian sitting at the café on hayarkon street with iced coffees and soft drinks and in the englishmans case lots of beer ninety degrees in tel aviv with equivalent humidity you showered dried off were drenched moments later the five of them had been training all day watching footage reviewing interpol data scanning partially declassified documents the other cops were miserable hated tel aviv eric didnt mind the city hed been there twice before a few years ago running errands for the american embassy courier service from riyadh to israel via amman jordan tight little packages no idea what they were but he got through customs everywhere with no explanation later hed explored this very street taking in the cheap beach hotels the bars and clubs and restaurants thai and romanian hookers doing the stroll lots of embassies nearby prostitutes and diplomats there was a match for you when the israeli went off to fetch more drinks the other policemen started in again about how much they despised the entire damn country too noisy too humid the food was too spicy israelis were rude too youknowwhat said the belgian obnoxious by nature antisemitic by choice he was ready to display his biases the moment the israeli security guys head was turned smirks grimaces tugs at the nose sotto voce comments about arabs and jews all being sandjockeys why not just let them blow each other to smithereens this was the guy brussels had sent to work on international security cooperation back home hed been a police bureaucrat before that an army officer belgian army officer when was the last time the belgians had fought anyone probably back in the fifties when they were slaughtering congolese yesterday when the belgian and eric were alone both of them urinating in a mens room at police headquarters on french hill in jerusalem the belgian aimed his wienie away from the urinal and began spraying the floor laughing and saying i piss on all of them when the first bomber showed up the israeli officer was still off ordering refills eric would forever swear hed smelled the asshole before he actually saw him felt his fear an instant flick of some primeval nerve filament whatever the reason hed been the first to catch on turning and watching the guy wend his way through the tables young pudgy hair spiked up and blondtipped to look like an israeli beach bum but wrong the long black coat in ninetydegree weather the sweating the warpspeed eyes eric said weve got trouble and cocked his head and prepared to move the belgian said this whole fucking country is troub eric got up slowly casually taking his empty glass in hand as if ready for replenishment the asshole in the coat got closer the australian and the belgian were oblivious but the englishman followed erics sidelong glance and caught on right away he started to rise the unspoken message flank him take him down together alcohol had dulled his responses and his foot caught in the leg of his chair and he lurched forward the belgian laughed said something in french eric swiveled slowly careful not to make eye contact with the bomber ten feet between them five eric knew what the bastard was doing positioning himself in the middle of the crowd wanting to maximize the slaughter now they were brushing elbows now he really could smell the guy putrid with anticipation wild eyes lips moving some sort of silent prayer acne on his forehead and chin dirt creases in his neck a kid twenty tops the belgian said something else louder eric knew enough french to make it out hot as hell and the idiots dress like polish refugees the guy in the coat mightve caught the disdain in the comment because he stopped glared at the belgian reached inside his coat the belgian started to catch on turned white blinked and stared and peed his pants eric sprang hit black coat hard in the throat with his right hand used his left to twist the assholes arm up and back way back hard he heard bones snap the guys eyes bugged and he screamed fell his coat flapped open big thick black vest around his torso tugwire at the bottom trying to reach it eric ripped the assholes shoulder joint stomped on the free hand and broke it stomped on the guys chest too hearing ribs snap the bombers eyes rolled back someone said whats going on the tail end of the question was drowned out by screaming scattering upending chairs and tables glass shattered plates of food slid to the ground as people bolted in panic the bomber wasnt moving thank god it was over then the englishman said shit and this time it was erics turn to follow his eyes to the periphery of the fleeing crowd another longcoated figure same approximate age smaller thinner darkhaired olivedrab coat israeli army surplus too many people between them to do anything number two shouted and reached into his coat eric threw himself to the ground hell arrived chapter eric had told the story quickly in the flat voice that petra had once considered weird he got out of bed went to the kitchen came back with two glasses of water handed her one her head was still full of horror sorry if i pushed you as far as the department knows im on my way to morocco the whole thing was a fraud security cooperation the europeans were clowns it was just a pr exercise after the bombing we were all called into the us embassy a bunch of envoys each of our countries wearing expensive suits and shiteating grins presenting us with citations the american was an ivy league twerp who informed us the takedown was going to be spun as a collaborative effort the smoothly oiled international team working in concert including the belgian said petra the belgian was already wearing a medal his envoy had given him velvet box and all they must keep them in stock he rolled toward petra i left before they got to me packed up and found a flight and here i am when will you tell the department dont know if i need to she stared at him he said ive been thinking about leaving for a while except for you im not happy for a long time i figured i never would be happy but now im thinking theres a chance he kissed her lips very lightly she swung her arm over his shoulder pressed his head down onto her breasts theres more than a chance she said my quitting he said you wouldnt mind why would i mind who better than me to know what you mean about the job he thought about that she said any idea what you want to do maybe private work security dont know he said maybe basic pi stuff ive had enough of politics dont blame you think im crazy of course not she said but she was still reeling the contingencies no more partnering not seeing him every day at work was there more to his discontent than the job he said if i made a living at it i could buy a house that would be cool she said more space wouldnt be bad not bad at all the valleys probably all i could afford he said but maybe i could find a place with good natural light i could set up a room for you to paint id love that youve got major talent have i ever told you that he hadnt she said many times my dear she pressed down gently and he nuzzled between her jaw and her collarbone her nightstand clock said am shed feel dead tomorrow maybe its stupid he said do what makes you happy eric i want to good night sweetie she said he was already asleep when the phone rang she bolted up and was surprised to find eric in her bed oh yeah the airport bringing him here the horror the damn thing continued to blare and erics eyes opened and he propped himself on his elbows wide awake his training petra was still woozy am she snatched up the receiver what oh man i woke you sorry its gil petra gilberto morales one of the night detectives a guy she liked she didnt like him now he said i figured id get a machine she grunted gil said i feel shitty petra normally i wouldnt even bug you to leave a message but the desk guy was all hyped up he came up here expecting to find you youre still on nights right the paradiso things been carrying me over to days and nights and i screwed up your biorhythm sorry go back to sleep she was up now whats the desk guy have his shorts all bunched about the paradiso thing said gil when he told her the specifics of the message she thanked him really meant it lyle mario leon scamster of old people last known roommate of marcella douquette and sandra leon and the prime suspect for multiple murder had phoned her three times every hour on the hour between two and four am needing to talk to her refusing to tell the desk officer why but insisting it was crucial finally during his five oclock call leon mentioned paradiso and mr desk intercommed petras extension got no answer went looking for her in the detectives room told gil to try her at home eric said whats up too tired to answer she stared at the cell number leon had left probably a nontraceable rental she punched the phone got a recorded message this is a auction services our offices are closed now but real urgent dammit probably some crankyanker fueled by the news coverage or maybe shed reached a wrong number she tried again got the same message waited until it was finished and said this is detective connor good its you a mans voice broke in thanks for calling back smooth voice but not like dr katzmans this guy sounded coached in smooth as if hed taken voice lessons youngsounding too lyle leon was fortyone tensing with distrust petra said who is this lyle leon you ran my picture all over tv so now we need to meet detective now you nearly killed me you sound pretty alive to me sir im not kidding said leon you dont understand educate me i know who killed marcella killed everyone he wouldnt give details insisted on a facetoface got progressively edgier as the conversation stretched she told him to meet her at the station in an hour no way too public i cant take the chance of what being the next victim of who its complicated now that they know who i am im a target im scared shitless not ashamed to admit it ive done some things in my life but this its a whole new game ill meet you somewhere off the beaten path with lots of space all around how about a park oh sure said petra i just waltz into some dark park at this hour because you claim to be someone with information ive got more than information detective ive got all the answers give me a hint i cant risk that i need to know youll protect me from who long pause detective i can solve your case but we have to do this my way how about rancho park a relatively open area right off motor not possible sir okay okay said leon somewhere else then you make a suggestion bring other detectives with you i dont care about that i just dont want to be seen at the wilcox station because for all i know theyre watching the place whos they sir silence your fellow players said petra laughter i wish them i could deal with who then okay not a park but nowhere in hollywood or in venice why not venice leon ignored the question would the valley be okay theres an allnight coffee shop at ventura near lankershim too public how about encino if you told me exactly what you are afraid of sir i could you were there in the parking lot after the shooting all those bodies and youre asking me that give me a name sir ill make sure that whoever this is my final offer theres a jaguarland rover dealer in encino on ventura west of sepulveda nearby is a felafel joint its closed right now but they keep their benches out chained to the ground the car lot keeps its lights on so some of the benches are illuminated ill wait on a dark one when i see you approach ill step out with my arms up so you can make sure this isnt an ambush sounds pretty theatrical said petra life is theater detective say in an hour petra knew the exact spot shed eaten there no back alley approach even with backup thered be limits to how careful she could be sidewalk café the similarities to tel aviv were creepy but this was too good to lose shed figure out a way she said an hour it is chapter eric said sure it could be an ambush i call for uniform backup at this hour said petra everything goes crazy maybe it needs to hed watched her get dressed hadnt commented until she asked him what he thought about the call now he got out of bed limped to the chair and reached for his own clothes what are you doing backing you up how longs it been since you slept once im up im up he turned his dark eyes on her its not necessary she said mac dilbecks the primary ill call let him decide youre the one the guys expecting thats only because my name was attached to the news story the story shed provided eric finished dressing wheres your extra gun stay here and rest i can get plenty of backup like who how about the belgian she said he laughed headed for her closet knowing where she kept her spare nine millimeter she said i really am calling mac reached for the phone to prove it macs a good man he found the automatic on an upper shelf nestled in its hardshell case between two black sweaters found the black nylon holster she favored adjusted the strap and set himself up petra said you really dont need to do this yeah but its fun she dialed macs number ventura boulevard at five fortythree am was a dark and ghostly stretch buzzed by intermittent traffic the jaguars and suvs in the fenced lot were gray mounds some grace time until the sun rose but not that much which could be good or bad depending on how this shook out mac dilbeck arrived in his old cadillac deville parked two blocks west as arranged near a dormant medical building he wore a navy sweatshirt black slacks dark shoes first time petra had seen him without a suit and tie his hair was parted and brushed but white stubble clouded his chin luc montoya arrived in a company car an unmarked hed taken home off the case but this morning he was on it tense but smiling this was more fun than yet another dummyhomicide erics presence elicited raised eyebrows from the two of them but no comment protocol called for blues but this was the whole team four detectives a quartet who rarely fired their weapons filled their days mostly talking on the phone and filing paper the paradiso shooting had been a vicious driveby if this was a serious ambush it could go beyond ugly but petra having cruised by the felafel stand twice from the north side of the boulevard was feeling relaxed neither she nor eric had spotted anyone at or near the little kiosk and eric was a spotter if the man claiming to be lyle leon was righteous and really scared thered be only one place to hide behind the stand no easy escape from there a high block wall rose to the south at least twelve feet of impediment beyond that another halfacre of british car storage no cars parked nearby so if leon was waiting for her he had no simple flight plan mac reviewed strategy clipped businesslike that combatsergeant manner of his petra would cross ventura on rubbersoled shoes approaching the stand from the north her gun out but keeping it close to her body so as not to attract attention from the occasional motorist once at the building shed press herself up against the white stucco walls before announcing herself anyone behind the stand would have to slip around show himself at least partially the three other detectives approaching simultaneously from east and west would be ready for trouble no rescue word thered be no time to scream the big question mark as she saw it was a driveby from ventura eric knew that and she could tell it bothered him he kept quiet she felt better knowing hed be scoping out the boulevard you okay mac asked her lets do it feeling cool and competent she walked briskly toward the kiosk before she got there a man stepped out from behind the building arms in the air fingers wiggling spreading his legs he leaned against an outdoor table mac and montoya swarmed him and eric did the initial pat down the guy said a welcoming party in that same smooth phone voice its so nice to be appreciated after the guy was cuffed eric patted him down again that was eric same long craggy face as the mug shot she said its him lyle leon wore a maroon jacquard silk shirt tucked into baggy cinchwaisted black nylon cargo pants and laceup boots with healthy heels like pirates used to wear the eraserhead coif had been mowed down to a conservative bristle no more soul patch and a little dark hole centered his right earlobe where the earring had once sparkled the shirt was a work of art petra checked the label stefano ricci shed spotted one of those in a melrose vintage boutique five hundred bucks used leon smiled at her wellbuilt and relatively clean cut bereft of cosmetic affectations a goodlooking guy eric handed her the fat wallet hed found in a pocket of the cargo pants inside was a cal drivers license that looked real and fifteen hundred dollars in fifties and twenties the address on the license was a hollywood boulevard number petra knew to be a mail drop leon said can we talk now chapter the five of them piled into macs caddy and drove around the corner to a residential side street nice wellkept houses a hint of daylight turned everything lilacgray almost pretty petra imagined some citizen spotting the old car phoning it in hollywood ds having to explain to a nervous valley uniform lyle leon sat sandwiched in back between her and luc good cologne clean laced with cinnamon trying to smile but his mouth wasnt buying it definitely scared motivation she liked that tell us your story mr leon marcella was my niece sandras my third cousin i was supposed to take care of both of them but it got out of control where are their parents said petra marcellas father died years ago and her mother left left the players lyle said can we keep them out of it that depends on how the story goes it doesnt go there said leon were thieves but we dont hurt anyone petra said whyd marcellas mother leave she said she needed space ended up hooking in vegas marcella was the youngest of four kids one of my cousins took them all in later it got to be too much and i got marcella what sandras story sandras fathers in jail in utah for another couple of years and her mothers got mental problems whats the difference i was put in charge of them and it got out of control the problem was venice we went there last summer then again this year the deal was wed be working ocean front walk a couple of hours a day have the rest of the day to enjoy the beach the girls loved it working how selling merchandise sunglasses hats tourist stuff from the front mac said you sell tourist junk while they pick pockets petra felt leon tense up against her shoulder mac was a vet but he was approaching this wrong challenging the guy leon was a con maybe worse but let him talk she said so you moved to venice last summer leon stayed tight picking pockets is crude sir we practiced a timehonored american tradition buy low sell high hed been busted for selling useless house products to old people petra pictured fake gold chains that disintegrated into dust sunglasses that melted in the summer heat she said the girls loved venice but it turned out to be a problem marcella met a person a beat later she got pregnant and had an abortion said petra you know about that the autopsy showed it i didnt know an autopsy could do that okay so you know im telling the truth about marcella getting pregnant sure the abortion said leon was what started the problem supposedly thats not what he said the first time around just the opposite he was furious she hadnt taken precautions i had to pay him off he seemed fine with that then he showed up this summer wanting to know where the baby is i told him there was no baby and he went nuts who are we talking about omar selden a seriously bad person gangbanger though you wouldnt know to look at him half white half mexican something like that youll have him in your records he did some time for robbery but never for what he really did which was killing people said leon lots of them according to what he told marcella even if half true hes a monster he bragged about killing to marcella it impressed her said leon stupid girl whod this selden kill he claimed to be the head hit man for his gang vvo said hed also done freelance work in prison a hundred bucks and hed hit someone i told marcella it was bullshit cause thats what i thought at the time i was wrong vvo was venice vatos oakwood tight band of lowgrade psychopaths supposedly inactive until last year when theyd resumed shooting people in broad daylight petra remembered one case milo sturgis had worked family man clerk at a good guys store mistaken for a vvo dropout and hit while strolling his twoyearold near ocean park the baby spattered with blood wideeyed mute the shooter a fourteenyearold turned out to be learning disabled nearsighted never taken in for a damn eye checkup lyle leon said once i paid him off i thought we were free of him the whole year i never heard from him again so i figured it was okay to return to venice the girls had really enjoyed the summer then stupid marcella spots selden on the walkway i turn my head for a second and shes winking at him and hes winking back soon theyre off on the sand talking couple of days later couple of nights later he drops by leon shook his head you saw marcella fat dumpy those stupid shoes she insisted on wearing sandras a hardbody put her in a thong bikini some rollerblades shed turn heads so who does selden develop a thing for marcella and marcella falls for it teenagers thought petra even scam artists couldnt control them then she flashed on leons leering description of sandra and wondered where his head was at hepatitis a unhealthy sexual practices tension filled the car mac and the others wondered too sandras a hardbody she said hey said leon im being objective sandra could attract attention if she wanted to if he wanted her to using the girl as a distraction while he and marcella pulled the scam of the moment but marcella had picked up an unwelcome admirer she said sandra has hepatitis leon was silent you knew mr leon you showed up with her at the clinic did you ever get her any serious medical help its selflimiting thats medical talk for it goes away by itself youre a doctor too said petra listen said leon i took good care of those girls for ten years on and off they lived with me and ate well and learned to read and i never touched them not once petra recalled the cramped quarters of the brooks avenue shack a grown man and two hormonesuffused girls and the blue ribbon for fatherhood goes to she said so omar selden and marcella reignited their affair it wasnt an affair said leon the first summer she snuck away to be with him and he fucked her silly idiot doesnt use a condom and hes amazed when she gets knocked up for all i know he shared her with his friends wasnt even the father one thing he made painfully clear he wasnt going to be a father he threatened me until i paid him off and promised to finance the abortion thousand bucks out of my pocket a year later marcella winks at him and hes back the week before the murder im alone in the house cause i let the girls go to a concert some new band at the troubador i dropped them off at ten was supposed to pick them up at two am by eleven im back in venice mellowing out at eleventhirty the door explodes and selden is standing over me he kicked it in is standing over me saying wheres my son idiot assumed it was a son all that macho bullshit i told him there was no baby id done exactly what he wanted he says no way man i never said that i try to reason with him leon sucked in his breath his cheek twitched first i think hes listening then suddenly he swells up i swear you could see him inflate like hes hooked up to a bicycle pump all red in the face veins bulging screaming that im a murderer a longer tremor snakelike coursed from leons brow down to his chin his lips trembled thats when i realize hes nuts last summer he was freaking out because she was pregnant couldnt wait for her to get rid of it now hes screaming for his kid i try to calm him down he grabs my hair yanks my head back suddenly hes got a gun out and hes jamming it against my throat grinding it hurt like hell he starts talking in this insane whisper about how hes going to blow my tongue out for lying finally i manage to talk him down what deal did you make with him said petra leon didnt answer im sure youre a persuasive fellow lyle but charm alone wouldnt talk a guy like selden down leon stared straight ahead mac said you did something youre ashamed of we can all live with that if this sad story leads somewhere leon tightened up again the deal was he said that id let him have another go at marcella so he could knock her up again have his fucking baby no one spoke the caddy felt hot and close leons cinnamon cologne had turned sour polluted by fearsweat he said i never intended to follow through we made an appointment for the following night and the idiot left looking happy the moment i was sure he was really gone i packed all our stuff out of there picked up the girls at the troubador and left whered you go said petra another place where we have places said leon what kind of places houses apartments shortterm rentals give us an address mr leon or face a hindering an investigation charge leon twisted to face her i call you and im hindering you call us and tell us a selfaggrandizing story i tell you how i screwed up and its selfaggrandizing stop echoing leon said thats what shrinks do and it works petra got in his face youre not a shrink give us an address now okay okay i took them to a place in hollywood he recited an address on north mccadden if you go there itll be vacant im scared as hell living out of my car the sympathy ploy she said then i guess you shouldnt drive too far listen to me he touched her wrist she glared and he pulled back selden wont let go of this you saw what he did to marcella to those other kids on top of that i dont know where sandy is the day after marcella was killed she disappeared all she had to do was stay put in the apartment for one day but when i got back she was gone back from where i had business to take care of what kind of business getting some cash together whats the difference the plan was for sandy to wait and then wed leave la instead she split on her own leons eyes shut im thinking somehow she got spotted by selden or one of his homeboys seldens everywhere hes like a mad dog on scent the thing that scares me is i dont know how much marcella told him about where we stay what we do maybe sandra figured it was smarter not to stick around with you no said leon no way she didnt take anything with her not her clothes or her frog shes got a stuffed frog she sleeps with every night i got it for her when she was little told her it came from her mother no way would she leave without it she have any money i always let her keep some in her purse but not much a hundred bucks a hundred fifty enough for a bus ticket leon said im scared she left for a short while got abducted left for what leon hesitated sandra had gotten into stuff drug stuff he nodded downcast every bit the failed parent then petra remembered the players saw themselves as performers which drugs weed pills petra said so youre figuring she went somewhere to score dope got spotted by selden had to be for all i know her source was someone who knew selden and tipped him off youre making him sound like the godfather it had to go down that way leon insisted theres no other explanation unless you killed marcella sandra too the accusation didnt ruffle leon why he said quietly would i do that maybe theres more to your relationship with the girls than youve told us ask anyone he said anyone who knows should i ask robert leon you can try meaning he wont talk to me robert will talk but he wont tell you anything you visited him six weeks ago said petra was that to give him a report on the state of the business how well you were taking care of the girls were family i visit what does robert think about marcellas murder hes not happy said leon no one is that put you in additional danger leon shook his head not physically i told you were not violent not physically but leon gazed at the caddys dome light financially im screwed im going to have to leave the players i messed up too severely to be allowed to stay thats why im living out of my car i cant stay in any of their properties anymore which is fine its time for a change i dont even want to be in california too crowded mac said youre very much going to be in california right here in la friend material witness leon nodded dropped his head i knew this might happen but i had to come forward in the interests of justice said petra in the interest of getting the monster who murdered my niece and probably my cousin before he gets to you leon said if you ever catch him and need a live witness dont lock me up stop being so dramatic said petra well put you somewhere safe winging that one movie stuff she had no authority to make the promise sure said leon sure that makes me feel so comforted mac said cut to the chase where can we find selden marcella told me he lived in the valley panorama city went back and forth between there and venice if your gang people dont have their heads totally up their asses theyll have files on him the valley to venice route and something else leon had said early tweaked something in petras consciousness selden doesnt look like a gangbanger how so no tattoos and hes a fatboy soft he told marcella he went to college for at least a year some governmentfunded gangrehab thing maybe he did when you first meet him he comes across notstupid he into photography said petra leon tensed up tighter than ever struggled to make eye contact with petra youve got him tell me about the photography leon licked his lips thats him carries around a camera claims to be taking pictures thats how he hooked up with marcella in the first place told her she was beautiful wanted her to model if shed had any selfawareness shed have known he was bullshitting her sandy that wouldve been a different story shes got great bones and with black and white you couldnt see the yellow in her eyes they took leon back to the station put him in a holding cell and found the mug books one look confirmed it omar arthur selden aka omar ancho aka oliver arturo rudolph gang monikers zippy heavy o shutterbug longtime vvo member petra had an aka that wasnt in the files ovid arnaz the quiet young man shed encountered on brooks in his fouryearold arrest photo for robbery he looked nondescript the charge had been pled down to larceny and selden had done three years a year after his release hed met marcella douquette on ocean front walk petras jaw ached as she recalled how smoothly hed spun the story about renting the shack for a summer photography project claiming hed been afraid to go out at night in a sketchy neighborhood knowing the name of the landlord shed verified leon and the girls residency but not arnazseldens meaning maybe hed never even lived there meaning hed watched her arrive from next door had probably been staying in the neighboring unit an empty moldering unit so he could stake out marcellas digs hoping to spot lyle leon so he could finish the job shed had the bastard right there she remembered seldens reaction to marcellas postmortem shot not a trace of emotion claiming hed seen it before visiting the coroners as part of a photojournalism class shed swallowed it whole had barely glanced at his id the valley address hed given her the numbers matched a vacant storefront not far from the revitalized noho arts district plenty of galleries there so maybe he really was into photography the possibility didnt make her feel one bit better mac said you couldnt be expected to know but shed seen happier faces at funerals chapter thursday june pm third subbasement doheny library it would help said klara distenfield if you could be a bit more specific about what youre after and why isaac smiling up at her from his worktable said sorry thats all i can say boy said klara talk about high intrigue she was a senior research librarian fortyone years old bright and sophisticated with thick calves a soft heavy bosom long wavy flaming red hair that she barretted at the sides and a peachblush complexion klara had a soft spot for graduate students isaacs reputation had preceded him and the divorced mother of two gifted kids had made sure to be available when he had reference questions isaac had fantasized wildly about her on and off since the first time they met lately petras faced had nudged klaras out still when he spotted her filling out one of those flowered dresses todays dress was pale green printed with white peonies and yellow butterflies some sort of clingy material not silk trying to be silk klara said earth to isaac and flashed a generous mouthful of white teeth sorry he said i know it sounds oblique but i really cant say more official police business huh did she just wink he said nothing exciting do they treat you well over there very well still she said it must be quite a contrast to here she motioned with one soft arm taking in the booklined stacks its different he said klara leaned against the table and nibbled on the eraser of her pencil her breasts swung luxuriant barely fettered older women he just loved the way they what was wrong with him what was wrong was he was a sexual retardate but for a couple of unfortunate encounters with hookers set up by flaco jaramillo he was a damned virgin klara said are you okay isaac you look kind of fatigued im fine if you say so she rolled the pencil against one hip well thats all ive managed to come up with so far she aimed her goldgreen eyes at the computer printout shed laid on his work surface hundreds of historical events tied in with june nothing he hadnt seen already perhaps the clue was in here among all that history but if it was he was missing it i really appreciate the time klara my pleasure she shifted even closer and his nose filled with the sweet scent of soap and water concern widened her eyes and smoothed out her laugh lines you really do look tired especially there a pale hand indicated the skin beneath his eyes a fingertip grazed his right cheek and electric current sizzled along his thighs he crossed his legs hoping klara hadnt noticed his erection she smiled had she im at the top of my game he told her energywise well thats good its refreshing to hear some confidence from you you grad students fall into two groups slackers and slaves youre the latter isaac youre here all the time alone his spot was in the remotest corner of the subbasement surrounded by old and ancient books on botany since leavey library had opened all the undergrads studied there doheny huge grand restored magnificently served grad students and faculty but everyone did their research online once in a while someone wandered up there looking for an obscure text mostly he had the place to himself so different from home sharing that cell of a room with his brothers the street noise i enjoy the solitude he said i know you do klara pushed a wave of copper hair away from her face not a beautiful face not by a long shot more pleasant cleanlooking my daughter amy wants to be a physician a surgeon no less shes smart enough but i tell her youre twelve theres time to decide she is a straighta student though so maybe you must be proud of her said isaac i am proud of her brother too a new kind of smile open maternal suddenly isaac couldnt banish the vision of nursing at those pendulous and then there they were blocking his vision as she leaned down presented her mouth to him like stepping off a precipice he moved in her tongue tasted lemony the sweet lemon of hard candies had she schemed to do this that possibility excited him further and he felt hed burst out of his pants now she was in his lap a soft substantive weight arms curling around him his hands found her back her breasts reached under her dress touched smooth flesh smooth thighs warm and moist lifted and she was allowing him she wasnt stopping him then she took hold of his hand placed it over the silky material butterflies jumped even as she pushed him down she said oh isaac im sorry this is wrong he tried to pull away but she held his hand fast sandwiched the other between her legs looked him straight in the eye and said this wont happen again with a clumsy shifting of haunches her eyes aimed at the ceiling she rolled off her panties chapter friday june pm detectives room hollywood division no tgif end of week joy for petra she sat at her desk wondered why isaac hadnt shown up today or yesterday she asked barney fleischer if hed seen the kid wednesday he said last night he was here until around eight all by himself i was here said barney have you heard about schoelkopf no what split from his wife the third one the old man smiled serenely its la said petra always has been she sat back down exhausted from the meeting such fun detecting with omar selden idd as the prime suspect for paradiso the logical step wouldve been running an immediate search for the mass killer instead petra had been ordered to clear paper specifying how shed come up with lyle leon as a witness then sit tight until notified further by the homicide special squad the call came on thursday bigtime meeting tomorrow at two pm theyd adjourned an hour ago at three she and mac dilbeck and three golden downtown boys the agenda actually written on the whiteboard intradivisional interfacing the three hs detectives had turned out to be relaxed types nothing but praise for the way hollywood had come up with selden petra figured it for total bs but smiled prettily the confab ended up being petra and mac factsharing and the hotshots reciting everything they knew about vvo and other westsidevalley gangs theyd brought props an easel charts statistics the last sheet on the easel was a craterpored blowup of omar seldens soft glaring face seeing him like that there was no other way to think of selden but as a seriously bad guy petra realized how close shed been to evil and fought not to shiver at two fiftyeight the head downtown guy announced the plan obviously preordained the new san fernando valley gang unit would search for omar selden because even if selden was the shooter hed been accompanied by other bangers and the takedown required specialists hs would handle formal liaisoning with the gang squad and get back to mac about a followup meeting for the entire apprehension team dont call us well call you petra raised the issue of the missing sandra leon the head downtown guy said wouldnt you say shes probably dead we bring selden in alive maybe well find out the details thats why its important to do it right she left the conference room more wornout than if shed driven all over town looking for omar now she sat at her desk thinking about the june brainings because there was nothing left to think about on paradiso the killdate was seven days away and she and isaac hadnt sat down for a while shed dropped the ball but paradiso had been the here and now she could be forgiven seven days lord help the next victim unless isaac was wrong how could he be the woundstats were nearly identical that old gnawing feeling surfaced under her breastbone retrieving the june files she reviewed the cases yet again concentrating on marta doebbler lured out of the theater because shed met kurt doebbler and he was weird then old man solis and the phony cable guy coral langdon the dead dog the more petra thought about her dogwalkingkiller scenario the better it felt nothing in common between the victims except a calculating psychopathic flavor to the killings someone extremely clever calculating willing to shift his approach chameleonlike heterogeneous victims not a sexual thing or an ambisexual killer or did it have to do with the challenge fun of the hunt even so there had to be something that tied the six dead people together she strained to come up with a unifying factor half an hour later it was killer six detective zero seven more days had the creep selected his quarry what criteria did he use what was it that marked them why crack their skulls a lot riskier than shooting or stabbing that had to mean something alex delaware had told her about cannibals eating their victims brains in order to capture their souls was this some newage cannibal thing or was the killer boasting im the brain a selfstyled genius lots of psychos had inflated selfesteem this one had gotten away with it for years maybe he really was smart if so her best weapon was a big brain on her side which she already had but where was he all that youthful exuberance the way isaac had latched on to her like a puppy why keep his distance now because shed put him off or was it something to do with that facial bruise no way did she buy his story about walking into a wall some babysitter i am was isaac in trouble she imagined a host of worstcase scenarios pictured headlines stories her name paired with neglectful cop councilman reyes demanding her badge now her stomach was a sloshing sack of acid stop it hes fine working on his dissertation gonna be a doubledoctor one day why hang around here youve given him no reason or was isaac making himself scarce because he couldnt figure out june if a genius couldnt untangle the pattern how could she hope to she placed the six files back in a drawer tried to rationalize away the stressache by reminding herself that she had produced omar selden the oldfashioned way that would be useless for june she shifted her thoughts to eric she hadnt seen him since early wednesday morning when hed slipped away limped away from the station as lyle leon was being booked drawing petra into the stairwell kissing her briefly then hurrying off one call since then the message slip had greeted her when she arrived this morning ill be in touch soon e off doing his thing whatever that was did that mean a prolonged retreat into one of those long dark silences of his she tried to retrieve the taste of his lips on hers failed satisfaction over selden began to tarnish because collaring the bastard wouldnt bring back marcella douquette and the other paradiso victims she phoned the biostatistics department at usc was told isaac was rarely in but she could leave a message to heck with it shed kill the next hour driving the streets and pretending to be observing her turf no better to walk bleed off nervous energy collecting her purse she left the station out in the parking lot she saw two guys loitering by her car a pair of suits she didnt recognize dark suits badges on their breast pockets then she realized she had seen them before the pair that had been shmoozing and laughing in the lot a couple of nights ago that time theyd ignored her now they were waiting for her she walked straight up to them two mustachioed guys one fairskinned one swarthy blue tie blue tie the light one said detective connor lew rodman the gang squad all business no smile the stache above his bloodless lips was the color of summer weeds his partners was a black pencil line so thin it couldve been grease pencil gang guys wanting to talk to her directly about selden instead of going through metro she had come up with the id nice to be appreciated she smiled good to meet you guys so whats the plan on omar rodman and grease pencil exchanged glances pencil said whos omar nothing appreciative in their eyes petra said whats this about rodman said can we talk somewhere private if you tell me what its about rodman looked at pencil the darkskinned man said its about an intern you supervise named isaac gomez isaac is he okay that said pencil is what were trying to find out their bronze crown victoria was parked at the far end of the lot the car was stifling meaning theyd been here for a while petra got in the back and rodman and pencil identified as detective ii bobby lucido sat in front and cracked their windows petras was inoperative and they made no effort to give her air she said its sweltering push the release rodman moved a click sounded and now she could breathe lucido looked over the seat checked her out his hair was gelled and thinning runways of scalp alternating with thick black strands so what can you tell us about gomez nothing said petra until you tell me why you want to know lucido gave a disgusted look and showed her the back of his head she heard him breathe he made eye contact again youre his babysitter petra didnt answer lucido smiled at her a mustachioed gecko heres the situation gomez has been spotted consorting with a known drug dealer and allaround very bad guy the facial bruise the kid really was in trouble lucido said you dont seem surprised petra said of course i am youre kidding yeah were a standup team said rodman doing the laugh factory tonight the ice house tomorrow petra said whos the alleged bad guy you dont know she felt her face go hot im his babysitter for official police stuff meaning he hangs around rides along plays with his computer at his desk what i know is hes a genius accepted to med school going to get a phd at twentytwo for fun you want to tell me whats going on fine you want drama go take acting lessons the black line bisecting lucidos face dipped then rose a phd for fun rodman said no telling petra stared at both of them well said lucido maybe he likes all kinds of fun he turned away from her again and petra heard paper shuffling something passed over the seat eightbyeleven blackandwhite glossy of isaac and a skinny guy sitting together really skinny guy the sunken cheeks and droopy eyes of a junkie the two of them huddled in what looked to be a restaurant booth plywood booth no food in front of them maybe a cheap bar the junkie wore black clothes and had a pathetic bit of fuzz over his top lip aggressively bizarre haircut skinned on top skunk stripes at the side a very long eely braid hanging over his right shoulder isaac looked like isaac neat clean buttondown shirt but different around the eyes more intense than shed ever seen him angry he and junkie sat close together the camera had caught them in the middle of something serious petra said whos the skinny one flaco jaramillo said bobby lucido thats skinny in spanish flaco jaramillo aka mousy aka kung fu cause of the braid his real names ricardo isador jaramillo known dope dealer and theres talk he kills people for money though he never got called up for that which gang hes not a banger said rodman but he deals with bangers from east la and central omar selden had bragged to marcella about doing oddjobs for various gangs could there be some connection petra studied the photo some more where was it taken all these questions said bobby lucido if its answers you want you came to the wrong place howd you come to work with gomez he was assigned to me by my captain who got his orders from deputy chief randy diaz who got his from councilman reyes yeah yeah we read all the pr bullshit what we want to know is his connection to a sackofscum like flaco jaramillo then ask him said petra the only side of him that ive seen is a wellbehaved graduate student detective lucido call me bobby this is lew the place we got the photo is on fifth near la cantina nueva dealers border coyotes freelance scum your basic bottomfeeding dive petra flicked the edge of the photo with her fingernail you have an undercover guy there lets just say were in a position to take pictures said lew rodman and flacos the subject of lots of them so when your boy showed up looking all preppy he got noticed especially when he slides right into flacos booth is clearly a ka of flaco we got curious and followed him figuring to run his tags turns out he has no car takes the bus we did a nice slow mta tail that was fun got gomezs home address traced it to gomezs father finally idd the kid yesterday but didnt know he was connected then someone in our detail was looking at the picture recognized gomezs name from a story in the paper reyes giving him some kind of award for being smart petra said obviously he knows jaramillo but thats a long way from being a ka they associate theyre known associates said rodman were not getting phds but we do know how to add your boys palling around with bad news boy in a back booth at cantina nueva any evidence gomez is engaged in criminal activity bobby lucido said he talked to flaco flaco got up and went behind the bar sat back down a few minutes later gomez left with a briefcase he always carries a briefcase bet he does said bobby lucido petras gut churned so what do you want from me nothing yet just continue to do what youve been doing but keep an eye out for anything sketchy the situation changes well let you know all of a sudden im working for you lucido said youre working for the department same as us you got a problem with any of this feel free to complain petra felt an urge to bolt and twisted the door handle it didnt budge why would it she was in the suspect seat before she could say anything lew rodman laughed and pushed another release button as she got out lucido said so whos omar petra leaned into his window he drew away and she stuck her head in the car you guys from the valley lucido shook his head central gang then you dont need to know chapter petra watched the crown victoria drive off the parking lot isaac into something really bad she changed her mind about walking decided to get her stuff play hooky as she reached the stations back door someone called her name she turned and there he was mr double life waving with the hand that wasnt gripping his briefcase wearing what appeared to be the same clothes hed had on in nueva cantina had he been watching her chat with the gang ds could the kid be that savvy he trotted up to her the bruise was paler but still swollen and covered with pancake makeup hey she said been a while sorry ive been burning the midnight oil bet you have dissertation stuff mostly some june research nothing to show on that unfortunately the librarians still looking he frowned to be honest ive been wondering if i was wrong maybe i made too big a deal out of what was actually a statistical artifact you didnt said petra she eyed the bruise conspicuously isaacs hand rose toward the spot dropped back down youre convinced its genuine seems that way she showed him her watch tiny black numerals in the calendar window declared i know he said he shifted the briefcase to his left hand his shoulders drooped petra said you look a little beat the buses were running late so i took an alternate route ended up walking a few extra blocks did you indeed petra said must be hard without a car you get used to it i heard one of the leons face was on tv my father saw it on the news id mentioned to my parents that you were working the case i hope that wasnt indiscreet nope said petra my name was on the broadcast so is leon the shooter she shook her head unsure how much to tell him now engine noise made her look over his shoulder a black suv had entered the lot and it nosed aggressively into the first empty slot at the wheel was one of the downtown hotshots squareshouldered and confident as a movie cop his buddy rode shotgun same demeanor reflective sunglasses on both of them the motor gunned then turned off petra said lets talk later and held the door open for isaac reverse chivalry he thought as he entered the station to her im nothing but a kid hotshot i said hi ready for the meeting what meeting in five we called when fifteen minutes ago while shed been sitting in rodman and lucidos car short notice like she was their handservant she said whats up hotshot ii said lets meet and find out isaac set up his computer at his corner desk two other detectives were in the room barney fleischer and a heavy man he didnt know wearing an xshaped leather gun harness that bit into a tight green polo shirt he plugged in logged on to the doheny library database pretended to have something to do pretended nothing had happened with klara but it had and now hed fouled things up personally and professionally taking advantage of a vulnerable woman which by itself was sleazy the bigger issue was mixing business with pleasure and the risk of a screwup on the june investigation he tried to rationalize it away by telling himself that klara had taken advantage of him the impressionable student wanting only peace and quiet and musty books not the clashing of thighs the moaning it had been great the second time not the first the first had been over before he could digest the fact that his head throbbed with surprise and orgasm klara had kept moving and hed stayed hard cupping his face in both her hands shed whispered yes keep going keep it going which of course had only charged him up further the second time had felt fantastic for klara too if writhing and mewling and having to muffle her own cries with her hand counted for anything afterward she remained in place straddling him trapping his detumescence kissing his neck scratching the back of his shirt with her fingernails loose strands of red hair tickling his face until he could no longer stand it and he turned his head and she took it for fatigue and said you poor guy all my weight on you im so fat she was smiling but looked about to cry so he said not at all and kissed her and grabbed hold of her pillowy hips through the butterfly dress god im still tingling she said then the tears came im so sorry isaac what do you need with a fat hysterical old woman that led to his reassuring her caressing her kissing her some more though by that time his emotions had shriveled along with his penis and body contact was the last thing he craved she did feel heavy youre so sweet she said but this really cant happen again right right he said you agreed pretty fast at a loss he said i just want what you want do you she said well if it were up to me wed fuck a hundred more times but cooler heads must prevail she kissed his chin its a shame isnt it the way life gets so complicated im old enough to be your mother she frowned at the thought a blade of shame cut through isaacs brain he fought to banish it focused on butterflies and flowers shifted his weight to let her know he was uncomfortable but she said finally getting off him stepping high as if to avoid touching him avoiding his eyes too as she rolled up her panties and put on her shoes and fluffed her fiery hair isaac fixed his khakis and zipped up his fly and sat there waiting for the rest of her sentence got only a weak smile tremulous lips but what he said but what you said but and then nothing oh she said dropping her hand and grazing his groin with her fingernails but it was still fantastic even though im old enough to be your mother we can be friends cant we of course said isaac not sure what he was agreeing to klaras grin was crooked and complex so can we go out for coffee as friends sure he said now now right now they left the library together and walked to a coffee shop on figueroa across the street from the campuss eastern border passing students and faculty people walking with people their own age klaras hips swayed and touched him from time to time isaac tried to put some space between them enough to dispel any image of intimacy but not so much that shed catch on she kept bumping into his flank at the restaurant she led him to a booth and ordered mint tea and a mixed green salad thousand island on the side isaac suddenly parched asked for a coke when the waitress left klara confided i always get hungry her neck turned rosy after for the next hour she proceeded to tell him about her schooling her childhood the young marriage shed once thought eternal her two gifted children her wonderful mother who could be controlling but only with the best of intentions her corporateattorney father retired only for a year before he died of prostate cancer when she was through she said youre a great listener my ex was terrible about listening have you ever thought about becoming a psychiatrist he shook his head how come i havent thought about any specialties yet too far off in the distance she reached over and touched the tips of his fingers youre a beautiful boy isaac gomez one day youll be famous i hope you think of me kindly when you are he laughed klara said im not being funny he walked her back to her desk in the reference section and turned away as she began chatting with her assistant mary zoltan a molefaced woman ten years younger than klara but somehow more cronelike when klara saw he was leaving she ran after him caught him by the door touched his shoulder and whispered fiercely that he was beautiful it had been beautiful too bad it could never happen again mary zoltan was staring no warmth in her rodent eyes klara squeezed his shoulder okay okay he moved out of her grasp and left the library too wound up to concentrate on his doctoral research or june or anything else as he stepped out into the open air the bulk between his legs throbbed and klaras scent adhered to his skin his throat his nasal passages he stopped in a mens room in the neighboring building and washed his face to no avail he stank of semen and klara no way could he face petra he had nothing to offer her anyway why was he feeling as if hed been unfaithful to her he walked back to figueroa caught the metro bus to hill and ord picked up the at cesar chavez and broadway and bypassed the sunsetwilcox exit for the station house continuing to la brea he got off and walked all the way to pico boulevard there he caught a santa monica blue line to the beach it was nearly six by the time he arrived at the pier where he bought a chewy corn dog crisp fries and another coke walked a while checked out the few old japanese guys fishing from the far end then he just hung out his gradstudent clothes and briefcase drew stares from tourists and toughfaced teens and vendors or were they seeing something else the person who never fit in never would if they only knew what bounced at the bottom of the case leaving the pier he walked down to the beach got sand under his socks and didnt care as he continued to the shoreline where he rolled up his khakis and got barefoot and waded out into the cold surf standing there until his feet grew numb he thought about nothing that felt great then he flashed back to june petra thinks im right but i could still be wrong it would be good to be wrong once in a while he walked back onto the sand put his socks and shoes back on without bothering to dry his feet by the time he got back home it was close to ten and his mother was sulking because hed missed the dinner shed prepared albondigas soup teeming with meatballs and herbs beef tamales a big pot of black beans with salt pork as mama hovered and counted every forkful he ate as much as he could stomach when his guts were about to burst he wiped his chin told her it was great kissed her cheek and headed for his room isaiah was already asleep in the upper bunk lying on his back snoring rhythmically his left arm flung across his eyes for the past year isaiah an apprentice roofer had bounced from one construction job to another working for barely above minimum wage acquiring a permanent reek of tar generally isaac was used to it but tonight the tiny space smelled like a freshly asphalted freeway his older brother snuffled and rolled over and returned to his original position the job demanded rising at five am in order to be in place at the pickup spot when the shift boss drove by in his panel truck and collected day laborers isaac removed his shoes and placed them down on the floor quietly his younger brother joels rollaway cot was empty still madeup from the morning a parttime city college student when he wasnt clerking at the solario spanish market on alvarado joel had taken to staying out late without explanation the same transgression committed by the older gomez boys wouldve brewed a parental storm but joel goodlooking with a tom cruise smile got away with everything isaiah snuffled again louder muttered something in his sleep went silent isaac disrobed carefully folded his clothes over a chair and slipped into the lower bunk a slurred hmmm came from above and the bed frame squeaked that you bro its me where you been moms pissed working isaiah laughed whats funny said isaac i can smell it all the way up here what are you talking about you smell like heavyduty fucking man yo little bro right on the following day he returned to the library determined to meet klaras eyes forthrightly were all adults here she wasnt at her desk sick said mary zoltan nothing serious i hope when she called in this morning she sounded pretty bad a cold said isaac no more like mary stared at him and isaac felt his face catch fire hed showered for a long time but if isaiah halfasleep could smell it whatever said mary is there something i can help you with no thanks she smirked sick more than a cold a woman on the edge and hed driven her over bad enough on its own but there goes june as he made his way down to the third subbasement nightmare scenes tumbled out of his brain like a payoff of slotmachine quarters klara having convinced herself shed been sexually exploited by a young ambitious man had plunged into a deep dark depression and dealt with it by selfmedicating overdosing or shed drowned her sorrows in pills and alcohol pills and white wine yes that fit tranqs and chardonnay besotted she staggers to her minivan another car heads her way but its too late two gifted children left orphaned a police investigation ensues what had led a middleaged librarian to engage in such rash behavior who was the last person shed been with mary knew from the way shed looked at him mary knew he stopped midway down the second flight what if the two of them hadnt been as discreet as theyd believed and someone some botany scholar some damned chlorophiliac lured to isaacs quiet dark corner by a crumbling antiquarian text on molds or marigolds or whatever had seen everything careerkilling publicity bye bye med school byebye phd for that matter hed be standing with isaiah at fivethirty am waiting for roofing jobs the shame his parents the doctors lattimore everyone at burton academy the university councilman gilbert reyes by the time he reached his corner hed conjured a vivid image of reyes calling a press conference in order to distance himself from his prodigal project he looked around no one in the botany section as usual but what did that mean during the whole thing the entire damned orgiastic fifteen minutes or however long it had taken his eyes had been shut he shut them now as if to bring back the moment opened and saw high library stacks dim empty corridors but everything felt wrong the air smelled reproachful he turned face and ran back to the stairs tripped and nearly tumbled but managed to maintain balance or something that passed for it he couldnt be here today back to the beach the beach had been good hed return stuff his face with junk food play video games like an everyday bonehead numb his feet and whatever else demanded numbing in the vast relentless pacific he did it but by noon he craved the police station chapter the second meeting was worse for petra five minutes after it started a valley gang unit rep arrived a uniformed threestriper a huge man with a shaved bullethead ice eyes and all the charm of a virus he kept inspecting his nails as hotshot i gave more speeches about gang behavior the search for omar selden and associates was now an official task force schoelkopf had decided to sit in not that the captain said much for the most part he looked sleepy and small and petra knowing about his third wife felt sorry for him she started nodding off as honcho droned on finally the guy slapped his notepad shut and motioned for his buddy to collapse the easel so he said tightening the knot of his tie were all on the same page petra looked at the big gang sergeant and said one thing you might want to check out our boy omar took college courses in photography and when i saw him in venice he had camera equipment with him he listed a phony address in noho so maybe hes got some kind of connection there it was a phony address schoelkopf cut in that was the point of lying detective connor to throw you off which was utter nonsense criminals lacked imagination made stupid mistakes all the time if they didnt police work would be an exercise in futility no one backed her up she said still sir the gang guy stood to his full sixfour and broke in never seen any bangers in noho except for a few straggling in when theres a street fair no street fairs till next month he left the room the head downtown guy said onward when petra returned to the detectives room isaac was waiting for her now she did need to walk and she told him so they left the station and headed south on wilcox isaac was smart enough not to talk as she stomped her way toward santa monica eventually she cooled down and noticed that he was keeping his distance from her she was probably scaring him time to force a smile so she said june the date has to mean something a birthday an anniversary something personal to the bad guy or some historical event that turns him on i checked dmv stats on all the principals in the files none of the vics were born that day so maybe our boy is a history freak she waited for him to comment he didnt any ideas everything youre saying sounds reasonable was he losing interest distracted by his other life what keeps coming to me she said is an extremely seductive killer someone subtle really careful about the way he sets things up marta doebbler being called out of the theater geraldo solis possibly being conned by a phony cable appointment if the cable guy is our suspect he was canny enough to case the house and come back later maybe he was also canny enough to use a dog as a lure she told him about the two kinds of canine hair found on coral langdon recounted her friendly neighborhood dogwalker scenario the setups she said could be as much a turnon as the kill a choreographer he said thats a good way to put it so what do you think youre right about the subtlety until he blitzattacks the victims from behind and bashes their brains out thats anything but subtle isaac to me that says a cowardice hes afraid to look them in the eye so he avoids the usual sexpsycho strangulation thing and b hes got lots of rage beneath the surface that hes able to control in everyday life more than control he functions well until hes triggered we know the date is one trigger but there has to be something about the victims they walked for a while before she said anything you want to add is okay he shook his head you okay he startled shed shaken him out of some sort of reverie sure you seem a bit spacey sorry he said no apology necessary i just want to make sure youre okay she smiled as your mentor not that ive mented much is that a verb isaac smiled back nope mentored feel free to speculate about what i just said everything youre saying makes sense i wish i had something to add but i dont a halfblock later he said one thing does occur to me theres a discrepancy between marta doebbler and the others if the killer was able to disguise himself as a cable repairman to get into mr soliss place mr solis obviously didnt know him if the dog theorys true the same could go for coral langdon she met a man walking his dog in her neighborhood chatted turned to go and got bludgeoned the killer couldve rehearsed the scene by dogwalking previously in order to familiarize himself with the surroundings but he still couldve been a relative stranger that cant be true of marta doebbler she wouldnt have left the theater in the middle of the show unless she knew who had called her plus a stranger wouldnt have known marta was going to the theater someone she trusted said petra back to the husband weird kurt theres another discrepancy between marta and the others she was killed on the street but then placed in her car you could look at that as her being treated with a bit more respect which would also fit with a killer who knew her well he grimaced i shouldve thought of that distracted by klara selfdoubt flacos gun my gun would i ever really use it thats why its good to brainstorm said petra they reached santa monica boulevard traffic noise pedestrians gay hustlers loitering on corners petra said heres yet another distinction for doebbler she was the first when detective ballou told me he thought kurt doebblers reaction was off and then after i met kurt it got me thinking what if the bad guy never set out to commit a string of murders what if he killed marta for a personal reason and found out he liked it got himself a hobby which brings us back to kurt aonceayear hobby said isaac an anniversary she said what if june is significant to kurt because he happened to kill marta on that day so he relives it he stared at her thats brilliant return of the youthful exuberance oddly it deflated petras enthusiasm and she said hardly its a theory but at least were focusing on marta doebbler for lack of anyone better maybe he said touching his bruise absently we should find out who knew she was at the theater she went with friends right staring at her with that unlined precocious innocent face she wanted to kiss it they returned to the station and petra pulled the doebbler file marta had gone out with three friends and detective conrad ballou had listed their names dutifully along with the fact that hed contacted two melanie jaeger and sarah casagrande telephonically the third emily pastern had been out of town according to ballous notes neither jaeger nor casagrande knew for certain whod called marta out of the theater witness casagrande reports that victim doebbler appeared agitated by telephonic interruption and that vic doebbler reacted quickly to said interruption jumped out of her seat and just left like it was an emergency she didnt even apologize for having her cell phone on which wasnt like marta she was always considerate likewise witness jaeger interviewed independently vics husband kurt doebbler denies calling vic at any time that night denies owning cellular phone k doebbler agreed to immediate inspection of home telephonic records which was accomplished this morning at am per pacific bell confirming said denials ballous next notation identified the origin of the call as the pay phone around the corner from the theater isaac reading over petras shoulder said doebbler couldve driven from the valley to hollywood called marta from the booth and waited by her car what if he agreed to have his phone records inspected because he knew they wouldnt incriminate him petra said i wonder if mr doebbler has ever owned a dog she called valley spca no dog registrations at the doebbler household but plenty of people didnt register their pets next she phoned the numbers ballou had listed for martas friends melanie jaeger and sarah casagrande both were now owned by new parties transitory la dmv records showed no listings for jaeger anywhere in california but a sarah rebecca casagrande was listed on j street in sacramento petra got her number from the sacramento directory and phoned it the receptionist at a family medicine clinic answered doctor casagrande was with a patient what kind of doctor is she psychologist actually shes a psych assistant is that like a nurse no dr casagrande is a new phd shes supervised by dr ellis and dr goldstein if youd like an appointment this is detective connor los angeles police would you please have her call me petra recited her number the police nothing to worry about said petra an old case next she tried emily pastern the sole friend ballou hadnt reached a machine picked up on the fifth ring and a perky female voice said this is emily and gary daisys place were not in now but if youll leave petra sat through the message blocking out the words because the background noise had captured her attention running canine commentary as emily pastern chirped away a dog barking as she hung up mac dilbeck passed her desk shot her a long unhappy look and kept going toward the mens room she followed waited in the hallway was there when he exited the lav he was only mildly surprised to see her something up mac for the record he said i thought your point about photography was good thanks she said its at least something petra which was more than those yahoos had to offer his eyes glinted i just got a call from one of the victims mother the dalkin kid that freckled boy trying to look punk poor lady was sobbing begged me to say weve made some progress so what could i tell her he slapped his hands together hard the sound as sharp as a gunshot nearly made petra jump you know whats happening dont you petra we hand them their prime suspect on a silver platter they take over but dont have the smarts to move their sorry butts and find him he looked around as if seeking somewhere to spit task force all theyre going to do is keep taking meetings with their easels and their diagrams like its a football play theyll probably give themselves a sweet little name operation alligator some garbage like that he shook his head brylcreemed hair didnt budge but his eyelids fluttered like crepe banners taking their sweet time he went on until word gets out to selden that theyre coming for him and he rabbits if he hasnt already he looked old tired miserable petra didnt console him a man like mac wouldnt take well to consolation its a drag she said its a superdrag regular cagé au follies his smile was nervous fleeting his neck tendons flexed and lumps formed under his ears that was a joke by the way petra smiled mac said i crack wise like that at home everyone tells me im inappropriate believe it or not i used to be a funny guy back in the service i was part of this theater review we had this little stage set up in guam im talking barebones but we got some laughs musical review she said we had ukuleles whatever we could come up with he colored no one dressed up as women nothing like that thats not what im getting at just that i used to know my way around a joke now im a humorless geezer inappropriate his discomfiture made petra edgy she laughed more for herself than him come over and joke any time mac sure he said walking off we call that police work right petra watched him vanish around a corner people they could always surprise you returning to her desk she saw isaac hunched over his laptop she returned to the doebbler file studied it as if it was the bible by fivethirty friday neither dr sarah casagrande nor emily pastern had returned her calls she tried again with no success everyone gone for the weekend suddenly all the energy generated by her brainstorm with isaac was gone she walked over to his desk he stopped typing cleared his screen an albert einstein screensaver popped up genius in a funny bow tie wild hair but ol albies eyes isaac closed the laptop something he didnt want her to see she said want some dinner thanks but i cant he looked down at the linoleum and petra prepared herself for a lie promised my mother id spend some time at home thats nice she cooks these enormous meals and gets deeply hurt if no ones around to eat them my father does his bit but its not enough she wants all of us my younger brother tends to stays out late and sometimes my older brother eats on the job comes home and goes straight to sleep leaving you said petra he shrugged its the weekend i really do think its nice isaac mothers are important he frowned klara her kids you okay said petra tired youre too young for that sometimes he said i dont feel very young petra watched him tramp off lugging the laptop and his briefcase something was definitely weighing him down that junkie jaramillo putting on some kind of pressure maybe shed disobey the downtown gang guys and confront the kid no that would be a really bad idea still theyd put her in a bad position drafting her into the unpaid job of keeping an eye on the kid with no authority to do anything babysitting just as it had been all along could she let isaac go down without a warning could she afford not to meanwhile shed use him on the june killings the mess hed foisted on her in the first place her head hurt time for dinner another solitary night maybe eric would call sometime during the weekend as she cleared her desk he phoned as if shed conjured him free just about whats up doing things he said id like to tell you about them id like to hear about them they met just after six at a thai café on melrose near gardner a place favored by fauxdepressed hipsters and wannabe performers but the food was good enough to override the selfconscious atmosphere petra figured she and eric fit in at least superficially he was wearing a white vneck tshirt black jeans that drooped on his skinny frame the crepesoled black oxfords he favored on stakeout his oversized multizone military wristwatch eric was as far as you could get from hip but add up the clothes the closecropped haircut the indoor complexion the deepset eyes and emotionless face and he looked every bit the misunderstood artiste with her black donna karan pantsuit and matching loafers she figured shed be taken for a stylish career woman maybe someone in the entertainment biz hah the place was already starting to fill but they got seated immediately served quickly ate their papaya salads and panang curry with silent enthusiasm so said petra what you been doing eric put down his fork looking seriously into private work the licensing requirements dont seem too tough dont imagine they would be hed done military special op work spent a tour as an mp detective before signing on with lapd all that had taught him endless patience for surveillance perfect for private work the question he said is do i go out on my own or hook up with an established pi so youre definitely doing it dont know whatever you decide is okay she said he rolled the forks handle petras warning system already primed by too much frustration at work went on full alert something else on your mind the frost in her voice made him look up not really not really he said are you upset why would i be at me for quitting she laughed no way maybe ill join you bad day one eye started to itch and she rubbed it he said paradiso that other stuff he waited she was in no mood to talk then she was pouring it out shunted aside on paradiso schoelkopf dissing her in front of the others zero progress on the june killings with the target date a week away someones going to die eric and i cant do a thing about it he nodded any ideas she said not about that as far as selden youre right about the photography angle think so definitely youd pursue it if it was my case well she said go and tell the geniuses in charge geniuses are rarely in charge his eyes slitted and he picked at his salad petra wondered if he was thinking about saudi arabia or a sidewalk café in tel aviv an uneasy expression slithered onto his face what she said he looked at her blankly youre holding back eric he rolled the fork some more and she braced herself for yet another put off he said if i go out on my own itll mean less money until i build up a clientele i havent been lapd long enough to get a city pension all i have is my military pension thats decent money it pays the bills but i couldnt buy a house he returned to his food chewed slowly excruciatingly slowly the way he always did petra a rapid eater table habits borne of growing up with five ravenous brothers typically sat idly as he finished most of the time it amused her or she rationalized that she should learn to emulate him now she wanted to flip his switch onto high squeeze some emotion out of him she said a house would be nice but its not necessary he placed the fork on the table shoved his plate away wiped his mouth your place is small sos mine i thought if the two of us his shoulders rose and fell petras chest grew warm she touched his wrist you want to move in together no he said not the right time why not she said dont know he said looking about twelve years old she thought about the magnitude of his loss what it took for him to express himself emotionally even at this level heard herself saying i dont know either chapter friday june pm the gomez apartment union district the kitchen was hot and fragrant not even a trace of isaiahs asphalt leaking through the savory steam his mother washed dishes pivoted to accept isaacs cheek peck youre early not true it sounded like an accusation no more work its the weekend ma youre not too busy to eat with us i smelled your food from miles away this its not fancy just tamales and soup still smells great a new kind of beans black ones but bigger i saw them in the market the korean said they would be good she shrugged maybe hes right sounds pretty fancy to me when someone gets married ill

cooked a fresh whole chicken to get the stock and put the white meat in the tamales whatevers left is in the refrigerator mostly skin but you can snack on it now if youre hungry ill wait wheres dad on the way home the toyota acted up again he had to take it to montalvo hopefully he wont get robbed blind anything serious montalvo claims some kind of filter i dont know that kind of thing she scurried to the refrigerator poured him a glass of lemonade here drink he sipped the cool overly sweet liquid have another glass he complied joels not coming home said his mother a night class on friday can you believe that isaac figured joel was lying if it kept going like this maybe hed talk to him he drained the second glass of lemonade headed for his room isaiahs sleeping so go in quiet did he eat already he ate some but hell come to the table for more small smile he loves my tamales especially with raisins i do too mom she stopped turned her mouth was set tartly and isaac prepared himself for a guilt trip she said its nice youre here my doctor returning to the stove for a change he removed his shoes and cracked the bedroom door carefully but isaiah sat up in the top bunk man rubbing his forehead as if trying to restore focus its you sorry said isaac go back to sleep isaiah sank down on two elbows glanced at the brittle shade that yellowed the solitary window air shaft light glared through the security bulb yellowgray the asphalt smell was strong in here isaiah said youre here bro got out early said isaac isaiah laughed wetly coughed wiped his mouth with the back of his hand isaac wondered about his lungs the alveoli clogged with all that got out early said isaiah sounds like probation or something isaac stashed his briefcase well under the bed took off his shirt and put on a fresh t he lifted the shade and stared down the air shaft stories below garbage flecked the pavement isaiah shielded his eyes cut that out man isaac dropped the shade i stink bad can you smell it no you lie bro go back to sleep when isaac reached the door his brother called out you got a call some laydee detective connor i said a lady detective connors female yeah she cute who called wasnt no detective isaiah grinned who you getting excited why would i cause she sounded excited bro who said isaac knowing dreading wanna guess isaac stood there isaiahs eyebrows bounced someone named klara

stuck her number under your pillow eight one eight you messin with a valley girl isaac retrieved the scrap of paper made a second attempt to leave she cute she white she sounded real white thanks for taking the message said isaac you better thank me man she was hot to go isaiah sat up again new clarity in his eyes she the one you did that other night right she sounded like she could be fun she give good head dont be stupid said isaac isaiahs mouth hung open and his face turned old he sank down hard flat on his back staring up at the ceiling one hand drooped over the side blackened with tar the fingernails cracked filthy beyond redemption yeah im stupid isaac said sorry man im just tired isaiah rolled over faced the wall chapter saturday june pm lankershim boulevard flash image gallery noho arts district no more talk of moving in together friday night after dinner petra and eric had driven to the jazz bakery in venice separate cars a moody quartet was the main act sleepyeyed guys stretching old standards with an ear toward atonality by eleven petra was bushed the two of them returned to her place her small place and fell asleep in each others arms saturday morning they awoke feeling fresh and horny the next few hours had been lovely now they were checking out the noho galleries for some connection to omar selden erics suggestion you sure shed said why not why not indeed doing police work even unauthorized probably futile police work was easier than thinking about the other stuff the square mile encompassing lankershim just south of magnolia had been a breeding ground for boardups and petty crime for years transformed by creative types and obliging developers into an arts district the area was an amalgam of pretty and seedy petra had been there several times for the street fair and to browse galleries the fair had great ethnic food and crappy tourist trinkets the galleries were an interesting mix of talent and selfdelusion on a nonfair sunday noho was peaceful and gray livened in spots by the colorful signage of clubs and cafés and exhibitions foot traffic was moderate for the most part people looked happy they took petras car parked on a side street and went hunting eight galleries featured photography and five were closed of the remaining three one was showing handmanipulated polaroid landscapes dreadful stuff by a latvian émigré another combined photocollages of asian women with woodblocklike oil paintings flash image a halfwidth storefront next to a defunct theater academy was all blackandwhite camera work the bright pencilthin room had warped wood floors water marks browned the acoustical ceiling very good lighting and handlettered partitions showed a real attempt to spruce up what had obviously been a dump the smell of mildew interfered this months exhibit was image local artists do la an alphabetical list of half a dozen photographers was posted on the front partition first on the list ovid arnaz the multiple murderer was good with a camera his contribution to the show half a dozen street scenes unframed and mounted on board buildings and sidewalks and sky and bare trees no people from the cool light and chopped shadows probably winter the lack of activity said early morning night owl prowling empty city streets with a nikon good use of structure omar decent composition the photos were dated and signed oa the initials graffitisquare dated six months ago shed been right about winter the posted prices ranged from a hundredfifty to three hundred dollars the two best prints a long shot of the sepulveda basin and a fisheye upshot view of the carnation building on wilshire were reddotted in order to look casual they moved on to the other pictures in the exhibit all throwaway pretense and returned to seldens work petras black hair was tucked under a whiteblond wig shed used for undercover jobs back in her autotheft days posing as a shady maybehooker type out to buy a mercedes cheap real hair nice quality courtesy lapd shed found it tucked in her closet under a pile of winter clothes had to shake out the dust and comb out the tangles her duds were a longsleeved black jersey top under a black denim jacket tight black jeans loafers and bigframed raybans the shades were leftovers from her marriage one of nicks twenty pairs shed ripped up the clothes hed left behind always wondered why she hadnt stepped on the sunglasses karma a purpose for everything eric wore mirrored ski shades yesterdays black jeans and soft shoes had traded his white tshirt for a black vneck and put on his black nylon baseball jacket with the custom gun pocket his limp had subsided a bit but his gait was still a bit off no need for the cane he insisted only a few more days of antibiotics the pinkhaired girl who worked at the gallery had smiled at him more than once from behind the scratched metal desk she used as a work station petra hooked her arm around his as they both stared at the same photo the parking lot of the paradiso flat stretch of blacktop devoid of cars bounded by posts and chains different light longer shadows than the others dated a week before the murder the title club take it home for only two hundred bucks pink hair came up to them she wore a short green dress that did little for her hair how could anything go with bubblegum clearly a wig cheaper than petras blond tresses probably darnel for some reason that made her feel smug pink said ovid is acute isnt he perfect aim said petra wheres he from ovid hes from here la right here in the valley howd you find him he was part of a student class at northridge said pink but hes the only one we took on way better than anyone else eric leaned in closer to the photo studied the details pink hair said are you guys interested petra said are we honey eric said hmm what i like said pink hair is that its pure line and shadow no clutter of humanity who needs people said petra exactly the girl smiled hoping for a shared ethos eric wandered over to the next print fullon shot of a theater on broadway downtown one of the old ornate dowagers its marquee now read jewelry gold wholesale selden had an eye petra eyed the paradiso photo i really like this one honey eric shrugged stepped backward and positioned himself midway between the two photos pink hair said everythings priced good petra said we need personalized signatures pink hairs smooth little brow mustered up a shallow furrow pardon these just have generic initials we want it signed to us personally petra explained after we meet the artist we do that with everything we collect she favored the girl with a cool smile arts more than buying and selling its about chemistry sure eric said maybe i like this better pointing to the theater i like this one honey pink hair said you could take both silence i guess i could ask ovid about signing it to you especially if you buy two we begin any collection with a single piece said petra take our time to see how we live with it after that she looked pink up and down pink said well sure so which one petra said i assume youve got some stretch on the price well we could give ten percent courtesy we always get twenty percent courtesy on this we were thinking more like twentyfive im not the gallery owner said pink twentyfive off would be onefifty said eric keeping his back to them pink said what i meant is it would be a lot more than we usually give whatever said petra she began to walk away pink hair said i guess i could call the owner if that works for you petra continued toward the exit well check out the other galleries maybe come back if hold on i mean the owners my boyfriend im sure he wont mind big smile a sprig of fake hair protruded above one ear haloed by artful gallery lighting you guys look like serious collectors itll be okay eric swiveled turned robot eyes on her petra thought the girl would swoon onefifty he said sure great petra said when can we meet the artist um thats the thing i dont know let me try to arrange it if you leave a deposit well leave you fifty said eric producing two twenties and a ten pink took the money great ill take your number and let you know im xenia turning it into a question as if unsure of her own identity vera said petra arching an eyebrow as she scrawled her cell number this is al vera and al great said pink hair you wont regret it i think one day ovids going to be famous back on lankershim strolling north along with the saturday throng eric said al and vera cause were silky smooth he smiled petra said youre very good at what acting then i can get a job as a waiter a beat provide us some income she gripped his arm harder youve got the military cushion and once you get going privately youll probably double your income if i get going why wouldnt you he didnt answer eric private clients means kissing butt he said charm you can be charming he stared straight ahead kept walking when you want to said petra suddenly he veered out of the pedestrian stream guided her toward the facade of a vintage boutique placed his hands on her shoulders something new in his eyes sometimes i feel like im running on empty he said you make me feel fuller baby she said hugging his waist he pressed his cheek to hers touched the back of her neck softly she said youre good for me too they stood there as people moved past them drawing a few stares a few smiles mostly apathy clanking sunglasses then weapons as their gun pockets brushed the percussion made them break the embrace petra smoothed down her jacket fooled with her wig if pinkie actually phones for a meet with omar ill have to notify the task force which will cause all kinds of complications eric said the task force should be grateful and i should be rich and famous she frowned this whole things nuts i get them their suspect hand them everything and theyre futzing around the rationale is theyve got to proceed cautiously in order to get seldens associates but if we had omar in custody wed have a better chance of doing that true sandras probably dead right he said thats where id put my money stupid kid said petra stupid case from inside her purse her cell phone squawked vera this is xenia from the gallery guess what i managed to find ovid and hes real close by he can be there in a half hour to meet you and sign your print great said petra her mind racing do you think you might like two al really liked theater didnt he personally its my favorite my the owner says you can have it for the same price as club sounds like a deal its an awesome deal ill ask al let you know when we show up okay said xenia but id seriously think about both of them ovids a seriously talented artist chapter with a pounding heart trying not to look panicked petra scanned lankershim found a mexican café across the boulevard that had a clear diagonal view of the gallerys entrance they lucked out by scoring a window booth ordered food theyd never touch coffee they would rummaging through her purse she found the head downtown hotshots number and tried to reach him machine at his desk number no answer on his cell she waited out the tape recited clearly and slowly hoped her fear didnt seep into the message a call to parker center trying to reach the guy was no more helpful even after she convinced the desk that she was legit out no forwarding same for his cohorts all three hotshots were checked out for the weekend the big aloof gang sergeant was gone too yet another tape answered at the valley gang units main extension multiple murderer on his way and all the experts were mellowing for the weekend some task force if joe taxpayer only knew she phoned mac dilbecks house and his wife louise said aw honey he took the grandkids to disneyland didnt take a phone something you want me to tell him not important said petra well talk tomorrow what next informing schoelkopf was proper procedure but out of the question hed kill the whole deal discipline her for insubordination and omar would get away worse a noshow at the gallery might make omar suspicious and motivate a serious rabbit upon arriving at noho shed spotted three uniforms a blackandwhite one block east near a chained parking lot the officers shmoozing and a single female cop on foot patrol up near chandler boulevard the woman had clipped hair thin lips shorts that exposed dimpled knees an lapd tshirt above her equipmentladen belt the whole blendin thing calling in any of them was too risky with twentyfive minutes to go there wasnt even time to explain the basics and she couldnt risk having omar spot blue and bolt besides nothing was more dangerous than a poorly designed operation that left her and eric he sat across from her looking calm serene even she pressed end on her cell pocketed the little contraption tried to take his example and calm down any way you cut it she was in trouble might as well catch a bad guy they planned it this way omar selden had never met eric so eric would be the inside guy returning to the gallery alone pretending to browse not talking much petra would remain across the street in the café her eyes fixed on flash images front door as soon as she spotted selden shed connect with erics cell ring twice hang up after that it would all be improvisation twenty minutes after xenias call eric left his breakfast burrito minus two bites on the table drained his coffee cup and walked out petra watched him ease his way across lankershim gliding a graceful man in another world hed have been great at ballet eric in leotards that made her smile she needed to smile because her gut was churning her temples were pounding and her hands had gone cold she rubbed them together her fingers felt fuzzy slipping her right hand down into her gun pocket she traced the outlines of her glock their waitress matronly smiling latina came over saw her nearly untouched food everything okay great said petra cutting into her own burrito my boyfriend got called away ill take the check nice girlfriend my boyfriend alone again petra pushed rice and beans and chicken enchilada around her plate closed her eyes and took a deep breath opened them to see omar seldens stocky frame approaching the gallery from the south end of the boulevard twenty yards away with a girl her frame was blocked by omars she autodialed eric beeped twice kept her eye on omar he had a rolling flatfooted walk appeared loose casual not a care in the world fresh haircut a skin job made him look like a banger his baggy brown tshirt was marked xxxxl in big white letters on the back under it were even baggier kneelength khaki shorts and brown sneakers colorcoordinated killer petra could see the girls legs but she remained mostly out of view damn a complication she squinted kept her eyes on both of them then omar stepped ahead momentarily and she got a partial look at his companion petite long blond hair nice figure a black halter top with a shoelace back exposed smooth bronze skin ultralow tight jeans showcased slim but curvy hips denim lifting and cupping ass cheeks too firm to be anything but young spiky openbacked shoes hot little mama on a sunday morning stroll the girls skinny arm snaked around omars torso reached midway across his broad waistline petra watched as the two of them nearly reached the gallery and the girl turned tossing her hair and laughing at something omar had said sandra leon petra got the check tossed money on the table stuck her hand in her gun pocket and left the café someone called after her and her chest constricted the waitress stood in the cafés doorway holding a white bag you hardly ate anything i packed it for you togo rushing back petra snatched the food thanks youre a doll sure have a real nice day when the woman returned to the café petra placed the bag by the curb and made her way toward the gallery thinking how funny it would be if that female foot officer happened by and tried to bust her for littering it was time to stop thinking about anything else but the job she had to do omar selden was bent over the metal desk signing club flanked by a stoic eric and a grinning xenia no sign of sandra probably in the ladies room good maybe this could go smoothly petra walked toward them omar looked up eric said i decided to buy both of them omar smiled barely glanced at petra no sign of recognition not good pal an artist should be more discerning okay he said signed trying to be casual but pleased at the celebrity cool said xenia i love your signature omar petra was a few feet away when a voice behind her said hey sandra leon stepping out from behind one of the partitions staring right into petras face less yellow in her eyes but still jaundiced up close way too much makeup the things you noticed petra held up a pacifying hand sandra screamed cops omar theyre cops selden dropped his pen looked up stupefied for less than a second then a foxy gleam brightened his eyes and he reached under the baggy brown tshirt petra had her gun out sandra was pounding her back still screaming she shoved the girl hard with one hand concentrated on keeping her glock steady easy omar selden cursed more screaming xenias horrorflick shrieks omar got his hand out of his shirt aimed a black matte gun a glock too plastic one of those foolthemetal detector deals pointed straight at petras face eric had moved directly behind omar expressionless petra saw his shoulder twitch but no other sign of movement erics arm jumped ever so slightly still expressionless pop pop pop omar stiffened his face scrunched with pain and surprise and his mouth made a little stunned o then blood began seeping out of his nose his ears gushed from his mouth as he toppled over facedown on the desk pinning his artwork color on the photos now xenia had backed away and stood against the wall her hand covered her mouth but that did little to squelch the pitch and volume of her shrieks a golden puddle of urine settled and pooled at her feet she sat down heavily in her own water sandra leon had rebounded from the shove and was up on her feet flailing at petra long sharp nails jetblack caught in petras jacket sleeve when sandra tried to headbutt petra petra slapped the girl hard across the face the blow stunned her gave petra time to spin her around bend an arm back and kick her behind the knees easy no weight to her she pushed the girl down on the floor kept a knee in the small of that smooth shoelaced back and got her cuffs out making sure she was nowhere near sandras teeth all that saliva teeming with virus bitch cunt murderer sandra was screaming murdering cunt xenia sounding halfcomatose said im calling the police chapter a slew of blackandwhites arrived with sirens blaring then crimescene techs the coroners the usual but this felt different to petra this was hers and erics he hadnt blinked during the shooting or since someone you could depend upon still it threw her off in charge was a valley lieutenant soon supplanted by a captain both started off treating petra and eric like criminals but eventually eased up last to show up was the officerinvolved shooting team two internal affairs detectives with all the emotional resonance of statuary questioning eric and petra separately eric first petra watched from ten feet away knew the story he was telling the one theyd prepared it had been his idea to go looking for selden hed had to overcome petras reluctance once the meet had been set up shed made multiple attempts to call for backup finally decided there was no choice but to go ahead the fact that eric had done all the shooting backed that up clear and present danger protecting a sister officer in the best of circumstances hed be suspended with pay for as long as it took to sort out the paperwork if the media got hold of it some pc moron at the times or one of the throwaway weeklies trying to manufacture a racial thing or a police brutality thing it could get ugly and go on longer that would mean lawyers the police union maybe suspension without pay petra had tried to talk him out of being the scapegoat he said thats the way im telling it back me up gave her arm a short hard squeeze and left to face the turmoil she stood by as the shooting investigators doubleteamed him watched as they came up against his stoicism and started passing glances between them she knew what they were thinking this is weird cops even hardened vets usually reacted to blowing out the back of someones head with a modicum of emotion for all the feeling he was displaying eric mightve just filed his nails because he had to because he was protecting her she couldnt remember the last time someone had protected her at threeforty pm with the scene still cordoned and active the head downtown hotshot showed up wearing a freshly pressed suit and tie meaning hed been out by the pool or playing golf or whatever had finally been reached rushed home to dress for the occasion before he stepped into the mess he looked around at the media vans congregated outside the yellow tape hoping to be noticed when it didnt happen he frowned spotted petra came toward her she told him the story he said messy left conferred with the techies sandra leon had been on the scene for hours mostly stashed in a rear storage room of the gallery under guard petra ached to interview her knew it would never happen now two uniforms escorted sandra to a cruiser and put her in the back downtown strode over opened the door said something stepped back with a stunned angry expression the girl had dissed him probably with the foulest language possible he told the driver to leave and the blackandwhite rolled away glided past petra through the side window sandra leon glared at her twisting her body so she could maintain eye contact through the rear glass petra stared back received a clearly enunciated fuck you as the girl diminished disappeared chapter monday june am detectives room hollywood division finally released for duty by the shooting team petra arrived at work to find kirsten krebss little butt perched on a corner of her desk right atop petras blotter shed wrinkled some papers from across the room barney fleischer shot her a sympathetic smile did the old guy ever leave krebs arched her back as if posing for a boudoir shot one of her fingers twirled blond hair what was she doing up here on the second floor when she saw petra she smirked nicotine teeth captain schoelkopf wants you when now petra sat down at her desk krebss thigh was inches away did you hear what i just said comfortable kirsten krebs got off the desk and left pissed off then she flashed a knowing smile like she was in on some private joke why was a downstairs receptionist delivering schoelkopfs message personally did krebs have some special rapport with the captain were she and schoelkopf could it be why not two misanthropes finding common ground schoelkopfs third marriage kaput because of a woman even younger than the latest wife the captain and krebs wouldnt that be great she glanced over at barney fleischer the old guys back was to her punching the phone with a pencil eraser he misdialed hung up started again petra cleared her throat barney didnt acknowledge her time for fun schoelkopf sat back in his tufted leatheroid desk throne the two side chairs usually positioned for visitors had been shoved into the corner the room smelled of pineapple juice but there was no sign of the liquid anywhere freaky when petra made a move for one of the chairs schoelkopf said leave it alone she drew back stayed standing you fucked up he said without preamble his desktop was clear no photos no papers just a blotter and pens and a digital clock that displayed time and date on both sides he removed a plasticwrapped cigar from a drawer and held it suspended between his index fingers no smoking in the building but he played with it for a while shed never known him to smoke kirsten sucked cigarettes a nicotinefiends gift you fucked up connor what can i say sir you can say i fucked up is this confession time sir schoelkopf bared his teeth confessions good for the soul connor if you had one youd understand anger tightened her throat he said youre amoral arent you petras hands clenched keep your mouth shut girl schoelkopf gave an airy wave as if her control didnt impress him you contravened direct orders and fucked up a wellthoughtout task force agenda sorry she said dont think youre going to get any credit for paradiso or publicity publicity tv interviews all that shit thats fine with me sure it is you and i both know thats what floats your boat getting on tv any kind of attention youre an attention junkie a media hound connor you learned it from bishop mr hairdye screen actors guild you and him ken and barbie big fashion show huh the big pity is you messed up a good detective like stahl hes in deep shit because of you stu bishop had been her first homicide partner a brilliant photogenic diii widely rumored to be in line for a deputy chief promotion hed trained her well did have a sag card because he played occasional bit parts on cop shows hed retired to take care of a wife with cancer and a slew of kids and bringing him up now felt like sacrilege petras face burned like a habanero pepper her eyes were gritty and dry but her heartbeat had slowed going into attack mode her body marshaling its reserves she was prepared ready to spring for the bastards throat but kept all the rage in a tiny little zone of her prefrontal lobes eric had it right say nothing show nothing but she couldnt resist detective bishops hair color was natural sir right said schoelkopf youre amoral and sneaky connor first you sneak to the media with that picture of leon instead of doing it the right way then you ignore task force instructions and sneak in your own little grandstand play youre toast get it suspended without pay if its up to me leave your gun and badge with sergeant montoya petra tried to stare him down he wasnt biting had opened another desk drawer busied himself with shuffling whatever was inside she said this isnt fair sir yadda yadda go as she turned to leave she noticed the date numerals on his desk clock four days until june and she was being cut off from her files her phone access to data banks from isaac fine shed adapt call the phone company and have her calls forwarded to her home number take what she needed from her desk and work from home petra connor private eye absurd then she thought of eric going out on his own bye she told the captain the lilt in her voice made him look up something funny nothing sir enjoy your cigar when she returned to her desk the top was cleared even the blotter krebs had sat on was gone she tried a drawer locked her key didnt fit then she saw it brandnew lock shiny brass what the barney fleischer said schoelkopf had a locksmith in while you were in his office bastard the old guy stood up looked around came over meet me downstairs near the back door couple of minutes he returned to his desk petra left the detectives room descended the stairs to the ground floor less than a minute later slow plodding footsteps sounded and barney came into view wearing an oversized tweedy sports coat and draping a longer garment over one arm a raincoat a wrinkled gray thing that he usually stashed in his locker once in a while shed seen it draped over his chair had never actually witnessed him wearing it not today that was for sure the heat had burned through the marine layer this morning temperatures rising to the high eighties the old man looked as if he was ready for winter he paused three steps from the bottom eyed the top of the stairwell descended all the way unfurling the raincoat he produced half a dozen blue folders doebbler solis langdon hochenbrenner all six thought you might need this petra took the files kissed barney full on parched lips he smelled of onion rolls youre a saint so they tell me he said then he climbed back up the stairs whistling back home she cleared away her easel and paints and set up a workstation on her dinette table stacking the files laying out her notepad a fresh legal tablet and pens eric had left her a note on the kitchen counter p appts at parker until love e love that started all kinds of gears grinding time to concentrate on something she could control she started with the phone company put in the forwarding request the operator started off friendly came back a few seconds later with a whole different attitude the number youre forwarding from is a police extension we cant do that im an lapd detective said petra rattling off her badge number im sorry maam is there anyone else i can talk to heres my supervisor a steelyvoiced oldersounding woman came on with a manner so rigid petra wondered if she was really a department plant same message no give petra hung up wondering if shed done herself even more harm maybe the fates were telling her something even so shed work june to do otherwise would drive her crazy she got herself a can of coke sipped and flipped through her notes the calls shed put in friday marta doebblers friends dr sarah casagrande in sacramento emily pastern in the valley emily with the barking dog this time the woman answered no noise in the background still perky until petra told her what it was all about marta its been years six years maam were taking a fresh look at the case like that show on tv cold case whatever something like that maam well said pastern no one talked to me when it happened howd you get my name you were listed in the file as someone ms doebbler had gone out with that night i see what was your name again petra repeated it cited her credentials again as well committing yet another breach of regulations impersonating an active officer of the law emily pastern said so what do you want from me now just to talk about the case i dont see what i could tell you you never know maam said petra if we could just meet for a few minutes at your convenience working up her own perkiness praying pastern wouldnt call the station and check her bona fides i guess thanks very much ms pastern when sooner the better ive got to go out at three to pick up my kids how about in an hour that would be perfect said petra name the place my house said pastern no lets make it at ritas its a little coffee place ventura boulevard south side two blocks west of reseda theyve got an outdoor patio ill be there wanting distance from her home somewhere out in the open well within her comfort zone petra said see you there dont be the suspicious type emily she got out of the mornings black pantsuit and searched her closet for something more welcoming her first try was one of the few dresses she owned a shortsleeved gray silk aline patterned with nearly invisible lavender squiggles too clingy way too party the black max mara jersey affair with the cap sleeves and the price tag still attached was even less appropriate back to basics a slateblue pantsuit free of lapels some cute reverse stitching along the hems tiny hyphens of celluloid laced into the stitches when shed bought it at the neimans summer sale two seasons ago shed thought it way too froufrou but on her it looked subtle a bit dressy maybe emily pastern would be impressed she made it to the valley with time to spare drove around a bit pulled up in front of ritas coffees and sweets right on time the place was a pair of cute tileroofed bungalows combined into one establishment one of a group of little spanishstyle structures assembled around a small patch of foliage several steps up from the sidewalk at the center of the green patch was a gurgling fountain older buildings from the twenties or earlier tarzana had been farmland back then and petra wondered if the houses had been built for migrant workers now they housed teeny trendy retail businesses giovanna beauty leather and lace boutique optical allusions even the premises of zoë psychic adviser looked cute the outdoor patio was off to the right of the coffee house surrounded by low wooden fencing with a latched gate one woman sat there visible from her bosom up pretty strawberry blonde hair pinned loosely mid to late thirties wearing a long gauzy sleeveless smock the color of daybreak behind her through open french doors petra spied groupings of wellputtogether women sitting indoors laughing sipping the west valley was ten degrees hotter than the city torrid but emily pastern wanted an al fresco meet petra climbed the stairs and the woman watched her as she unlatched the gate ms pastern pastern nodded gave a small wave so far so good as petra made it to the gate she saw that pastern had chosen the table farthest from the restaurant the pale blue top was worn over fashionable jeans and white clogs pastern had milky skin lots of freckles eyes the color of the iced tea or whatever it was that filled her brandy snifter lying at her feet was why she wanted the patio needed the patio the biggest hunk of canine flesh petra had ever seen bluebrindle and massively boned in repose ears clipped to nubs body and face a mass of loose skin and acromegalic bone head shaped like that of a hippo resting on the flagstone floor big as a hippo she stopped as the dog glanced up drooled checked petra out with tiny redrimmed eyes intelligent eyes lord the thing was huge an upper lip flapped teeth fit for a shark emily pastern bent in her chair and whispered something to the dog the beasts eyes closed and it returned to sleep or whatever it was protective dogs did during their downtime petra hadnt budged its okay said pastern just sit down on this side indicating the seat farthest from the dog shes fine if you dont try to get too friendly with her too fast the dog cocked an eyelid really said pastern its okay giving wide berth to the behemoth petra settled in a chair good girl pastern whispered to the dog petra held out a hand petra connor emily pasterns fingers were long cool limp the dog remained inert making sure her foot was nowhere near its mouth petra tried to get comfortable is that daisy no daisys home youve got two of these how do you know about daisy oh my phone tape no this is sophia daisys little sister little said petra figuratively speaking said pastern birthorderwise daisys a tenyearold cavalier king charles spaniel she weighs fifteen pounds a little lighter than sophia pastern smiled sophia likes her food what breed is she mastino neopolitan mastiff all the way from italy pastern nodded we imported her shes great protection does daisy get to ride her no but my kids do doggy chitchat relaxed the woman time for business thanks for agreeing to meet with me emily sure pastern looked over at the french doors a slim androgynous waiter came over and petra ordered coffee the daily blend sure he left looking puzzled pastern said theyre not used to that no interrogation most people who come here are picky about their coffee halfcaf seventeen drams of soy foam onefifth kenyan fourfifths jamaican and a sprinkle of zanzibar allspice pastern displayed pretty teeth exactly i dont care as long as theres octane in it said petra an oversized mug of something dark and hot came and the waiter took a few seconds balancing it on the table bit of a challenge the top was fashioned of handlaid mosaic tiles blue and yellow and green shards arranged in graceful florets and grouted carefully petra ran her fingers over the contours nice work but impractical like it said pastern the tiles very nice said petra my work really its lovely i dont do much art anymore said pastern three kids my husbands an orthodontist the first fact seemed to explain things the second didnt petra said busy you bet would you tell me this detective how come no one talked to me six years ago my friends the other women who were at the theater were interviewed because the d who worked the case was an alkie burnout who didnt follow through when he didnt reach you the first time petra said ms jaeger and dr casagrande pasterns penciled brows arched sarahs a doctor shes a psychologist in sacramento isnt that something said emily pastern she always talked about becoming a therapist but i never thought shed actually do it guess sacramento was good to her how longs she been there she and her husband moved up there a while back not long after marta was killed alans a lobbyist and they wanted him fulltime at the capital hows sarah doing havent spoken to her yet havent been able to reach melanie jaeger either mels in france said pastern got divorced and moved there a couple of years ago finding herself she stirred her tea some more no kids shes got mobility finding herself how said petra pastern pushed fine ginger hair away from her face she thinks shes an artist a painter no talent huh petras palm caressed the tabletop trying to communicate as opposed to you emily i dont want to badmouth we were all friends but guess im the only one still in the valley so why wasnt i talked to from what i could tell the detective couldnt reach you he called when i was out and left his number said pastern i called him back petra shrugged six years said pastern is there some reason its been reopened no dramatic evidence im afraid were just trying to be thorough pastern frowned are you from here originally arizona said petra this was getting personal lonely woman or was pastern resisting ive got cousins in scottsdale pastern stopped herself you dont care about any of that this is about marta do you have any theories who killed her not yet how about you said petra sure do i always thought it was kurt but no one asked my opinion petras hand clamped around her coffee mug the ceramic was scalding and she freed her tingling fingers why do you think that emily im not saying i know he did it its just my feeling said pastern marta and kurts marriage had always seemed off in what way remote platonic even like they never went through that initial passion stage most people start out with know what i mean sure said petra everything cools down eventually but with marta and kurt you just felt thered never been any heat in the first place not that marta ever said anything she was german had that european reserve remote said petra remembering kurt doebblers flat affect two cool people one had ended up beaten to a pulp i never saw them kiss said pastern or touch for that matter then again ive never seen kurt display anything in the way of emotion even after marta died she bent toward sophia kneaded the dogs neck folds he still lives there you know in the same house seven blocks from mine after we heard about marta i brought over food offered to help any way i could kurt took the plate at the door never invited me in never thanked me charming fellow have you met him petra nodded so you know i cant prove he did it i just feel it always have we all did sarah and mel and i not just because kurts strange because of the way it happened that night in the theater when martas phone rang she bolted up so quickly she nearly tripped over my legs then she hurried out without explanation as if her life depended on it pastern smiled queasily that came out wrong petra said did she slip the phone open and read the senders number pastern thought i dont think so no im sure she didnt i dont think her phone even had a lid to flip six years ago mine didnt no she just switched it off and got up and ran out we were pretty taken aback generally marta was superpolite sarah wanted to go out and check immediately but melanie told her it might be a private family affair she should give marta her privacy marta was a private person you never really knew where she was coming from the three of us were making too much noise discussing it and people started to shush us so we shut up and waited until intermission how long was that maybe ten minutes said pastern maybe fifteen when marta didnt return in a couple i remember not being able to concentrate on the show then i figured she didnt want to cause any more disruption by coming back for such a short interval was probably waiting for us in the lobby the moment the curtain dropped we hurried out to find her but she wasnt there we immediately called her cell but no one answered and thats when we started to get worried we decided to split up to look for her in the theater which wasnt easy the pantages is a big place all those people streaming out she frowned i got the job of checking the ladies room kneeling down and checking the shoes in the stalls marta wasnt there wasnt anywhere we tried to figure out what to do the consensus was that shed been called out on a personal matter probably by kurt maybe something to do with katya it had to be serious for her not to return not to even tell us maybe she needed to keep her line clear so we decided not to try to call her again and went back in saw the rest of the show i didnt really enjoy it worried about marta at that time i was more worried about what had caused her to leave so impulsively said pastern do you have kids petra shook her head its a lifetime of anxiety detective anyway after the show the three of us walked to my car id driven everyone except marta she came in her own car why she had an appointment in the city didnt want to bother coming back to the valley then back again she arrived when we did parked right near my car when we looked her car was gone that made sense to us given what we figured where was the lot right across the street from the theater martas vehicle had been found around the corner from the theater and two blocks down ballou had made no mention of it being moved from the parking lot shed left with the killer lured to a dark quiet spot bludgeoned on the sidewalk then propped behind the wheel of her own vehicle petra said what kind of appointment did marta have in the city she didnt say pastern shifted looked down at her own tilework marta went into the city a lot my initial take was that the valley bored her she grew up in hamburg which is supposed to be a pretty sophisticated city back in germany shed been some sort of mathematician or engineer thats where she met kurt hes a rocket designer or something like that he was doing something for the government at one of the military bases they got married there had katya in germany moved to the states soon after long answer to a short question and now pastern was stirring her tea rapidly as if willing the liquid to evaporate talking about martas errands had made her jumpy your initial take was boredom said petra any other reason for her to come into the city frequently the spaces between pasterns freckles pinkened i dont want to say when i dont know say what emily are you married detective used to be oh sorry for prying no prob its funny said pastern the way were talking as if this was just two girls im glad the police let women do important jobs now down below sophia stirred pastern dipped a finger in her snifter rubbed liquid over the dogs nose and mouth the heats not great for her but shes pretty robust back in italy they live outdoors guard estates did the doebblers own a dog never said pastern at one point marta wanted one for katya she said kurt wouldnt allow it i think thats abusive dont you animals are great for kids they teach them a lot about giving and sharing absolutely said petra so kurt doesnt like animals he told marta they were too messy pastern fiddled with her hair what i said before that i always thought kurt did it that wont get back to him right because its not an accusation just a feeling and he does live close it will absolutely not get back to him emily im going to believe you on that i guess thats about it petra said could we talk more about martas errands in the city pastern answered quickly she liked to shop discount clothing places that kind of thing let it ride okay can you think of any reason kurt might have to murder marta so you do suspect him at this point i dont know enough to suspect anyone emily thats why its important for you to tell me everything you know i have pasterns smile was shaky petra smiled back tasted her designer coffee dreadful shed give pastern one more try and if the woman continued to resist follow up with a phone call tomorrow tonight emily pastern untied her hair and shook it loose she had knotted it up tight created an austere little bun that gave her face an ascetic cast the errands said petra okay i might as well tell you because youve taken the trouble after all these years and you do seem like someone who cares she moistened the dogs snout again breathed in deeply dramatic type petra wondered how much of what she said could be taken seriously okay pastern repeated im pretty sure marta was having an affair petra waited for the womans breathing to slow with who i dont know detective but she gave off all the signs petra held out an expectant palm emily pastern said dressing better walking bouncier sexier color in her cheeks she was still reserved but there was something going on beneath the surface a glow a fire the color in pasterns cheeks heightened ah suburbia petra said happier than usual more than happier alive it wasnt because of kurt believe me he was the same old dull kurt but marta changed anyone who knew her could tell she had suddenly she was gone all the time rushing here rushing there which wasnt like marta at all it was true what i said about her being bored she told me she found the valley too slow but her way of coping had been stayathome stuff being a pta mom collecting glass figurines samplers little japanese teapots she used to hit the flea markets regularly then all that stopped and she boxed up her collections and started driving into the city regularly around the same time she started to dress and walk sexier exactly the same time said pastern youre a woman you know im right youre making a good case emily maybe kurt found out maybe thats why he did it it sure wasnt for any romantic reasons of his own hes never remarried and if hes been hooked up with another woman i havent heard would you have heard said petra with his being distant and all that oh yeah said pastern our kids still go to the same school west valley prep its still suburbia petra petra watched as she wiped her lips daintily drama queen or not pastern had given her something to work with she asked her if there was anything else she wanted to say and when pastern shook her head thanked her fished a ten out of her purse and stood sophia grumbled pastern patted her calm and reached for her own purse no its on me against regulations said petra smiling little miss bythebook ha youre sure okay then nice to meet you hope you get him as petra started to leave pastern said whyd you ask me if kurt and marta had a dog just curious said petra trying to get a feel for them as people hes a cold person said pastern she was a nice person ill tell you who did love dogs katya she was always over playing with daisy her needs were so obvious but kurt wouldnt hear of it too messy hes compulsive pastern frowned real life isnt like that sure isnt said petra what color is daisy a deep beautiful mahogany red shes showquality no match to the hairs on coral langdon so much for the complex transfer scenario petra had formulated from daughter to dad to she said ill bet she is any idea how katyas doing my daughter whos in the same grade but not the same class says shes very quiet keeps to herself what else would you expect growing up with someone like that besides that a girl needs a mother its basic psychology right petra flashed a plastic smile muttered something escaped chapter petra drove east on ventura boulevard to laurel canyon took that winding leafy route back to the city she loved laurel with its mix of ramshackle radical and royal great place to live in the unlikely event she ever had money she zipped past what was left of the old houdini estate some magic would be nice right around now something to help her figure out if emily pasterns suspicions were righteous martas infidelity kurt a revenge murderer if so hed planned meticulously lured his wife out of the theater maybe using katya as the bait then hed exploited his daughter again for an alibi from everything shed seen now buttressed by pasterns comments kurt was a cold fish one of those technically minded guys who saw everything as an equation you humiliate me i kill you no reason it couldnt have happened that way she ran the scenario through her head kurt calls marta from the phone booth then heads over to the theater parking lot to wait marta shows up they drive off he drives then he pulls over around the block tells her the real reason hes there he knows about all those trips to the city maybe theres a confrontation right there or perhaps marta caught offguard tries to smooth things out kurts beyond appeasement hes brought a weapon or perhaps hed planted it in the trunk of martas car or had used something already there a jack a tire iron no the coroners report said something wider smoother marta tries to escape runs from the car he grabs her spins her gets behind her a tall guy like kurt would have had plenty of leverage for a crushing occipital blow she goes down he continues bashing her brains out doing it on the street you act like a slut you die like a slut had he intended on leaving her there remembered that the bleeding thing on the sidewalk had once been his wife and relented propped her back in the car or had that just been an attempt to conceal the body in order to give him more time to get home crawl into bed and enjoy murderers dreams marta hadnt been found until morning kurt getting katya ready for school wouldve had plenty of time to be surprised as she passed the canyon market petra thought of a third possibility positioning marta behind the wheel had been a different kind of message you drove into the city to meet your lover now sit in the drivers seat in that same damn car with your brains leaking out destroying her humanity her soul would a tech type like kurt doebbler believe in the soul or would he view people as nothing more than the sum of their cells i pulverize your gray matter i reduce you to nothing pastern had called kurt compulsive maybe that cold flat demeanor masked volcanic rage he does marta gets away with it decides he likes it decides to commemorate the date what were anniversaries but time souvenirs and psycho killers loved to keep mementos nice little profile she was developing the only problem was lots of stuff didnt fit like the dog hairs on coral langdon when kurt hated animals and kurt as charmless a man as petra had ever encountered seemed the last guy coral would have stopped to have a pooch chat with did he have acting skills no one knew about she decided shed made too much out of the hairs langdon was a dog person ran into other dog people picked up foreign hairs but what of the phony cable visit to geraldo soliss house how did doebbler synch with that maybe kurt had worked in the cable business before becoming a missile designer some sort of student job even so if hed wanted to commemorate his wifes murder why not choose a victim similar to marta at the very least a woman not a grumpy old exmarine like solis unless solis had somehow been involved with the doebblers could he have been martas lover in the city then why wait a year to get him solis was a cantankerous old loner thirty years martas senior people made strange choices but it just didnt fit she ran through the rest of the victim list langdon hochenbrenner the young black sailor jewell blank and curtis hoffey two street kids what was the damned pattern by the time she made it to sunset her head throbbed and she decided shed been fixing air sandwiches as she reached fairfax and sixth her phone beeped mac dilbecks mobile just heard petra sorry i really couldnt expect different mac only because theyve got their heads tucked so tightly up their posteriors they cant see the light of wisdom thanks mac i should be thanking you he said for clearing the case saving us the paperwork and the city a trial some types deserve killing and he fit the bill right right whats erics situation meetings at parker when the dust clears hell be okay it was righteous it sure was im also calling to fill you in on sandra leon the gods from olympus allowed me to sit in on her interview she wouldnt talk to them no matter what they did so finally they left to confer he snorted so while theyre gone i do the old grandfatherly bit and guess what she starts to open up oh yeah said petra smiling oh yeah indeed said mac i made sure the tape was running by the time they got back with a plan with a big old task force plan shes talking and at least theyre smart enough to keep their mouths shut and back off sandras story is she and cousin marcella didnt get along too well bigtime jealousy going way back that scumbag lyle leon was messing with both of them for years and they ended up competing for his attention when marcella got involved with omar selden sandra figured that was wrong she was the pretty one so she moved in on marcellas territory also get this there was bad feeling because once when sandra was waiting to see a doctor for her hepatitis marcella left her alone found an arcade on the boulevard and played games for two hours that really frosted sandra sounds like a motive for murder to me you shouldve heard the kid petra cold she was the one told omar that marcella had aborted his baby told him marcella had joked about it called the baby garbage lord said petra she set marcella up she did more than that she told omar the two of them would be at the paradiso pinpointed where and when marcella would be coming out omar photographed the parking lot a full week before the concert the whole thing was well planned oh boy he said thats why sandra was so cool after the shooting she stuck around to gloat got a little nervous when i tried to interview her but no grief she was digging the scene that is one sick kid whats she being charged with das not sure yet im pushing for a full one eightyseven but the only evidence is what sandra said on tape so maybe theyll plea it down to something juvie shes pretty smug seems to think shell get away scotfree because shes seventeen for all i know she will some slick private attorney showed up this afternoon he wouldnt tell me who hired him but im sure hes being paid by the players hes already making noises about dismissing the confession because i didnt give sandra her rights right before she talked the downtown guys mirandized her at the beginning and i was in the room so the adas claiming i was part of the interrogatory team the first warning was enough here goes the system said petra so what else is new what about lyle hes open to a big fat pedophilia charge lyle rabbited right after we let him out of the holding cell which wouldve posed some problems if omar had gone to trial so its pretty nice that he wont be needed for that i thank you again youre welcome said petra you all right taking some downtime how about you im off to play puttputt golf with my grandson dont let them grind you down kid youre a solid girl shrinks kept fortyfiveminute hours so at four fortyfive petra tried the clinic where dr sarah casagrande worked was transferred to voice mail left a forceful message no return she repeated the process at five fortyfive and this time a womans voice broke in this is sarah soft breathy hesitant i was just about to call you thanks said petra as i said in my message doctor this is about marta doebbler all these years said casagrande has something changed in terms of the detective i spoke to led me to believe the case was unlikely to be solved did he oh yes said casagrande i suppose he was being honest but at the time it was hard to hear do you remember what reason he gave he said there was no evidence he had suspicions but nothing more suspicions of who kurt i felt the same way all three of us did you told him that of course something ballou had neglected to tell her or write down why did you suspect kurt he made me uneasy sometimes he made me feel uncomfortable lecherous said petra no i couldnt say that couldnt say he was actually projecting any interest in me it was just the opposite a lack of emotion id see him looking at me during a barbecue or some other social thing and then id realize he wasnt he was looking through me i told my husband and he said hed noticed that too all the guys thought kurt was strange no one invited him to play poker youre a psychologist care to diagnose im a psychological assistant said casagrande a year away from taking the licensing exam still said petra you know more than the average person how would you classify kurt doebbler i hate to do that longdistance analysis isnt worth much off the record doctor off the record if i had to bet id say kurt displays schizoid tendencies that doesnt mean hes crazy it refers to an asocial personality flat emotion a lack of connection to other people can that lead to murder now said casagrande youre really asking me to step outside the bounds of my off the record doctor most asocial types arent violent but when they do act out when schizoid tendencies are combined with aggressive impulses it can be pretty horrendous meticulous planning followed by stunning violence the unabomber comes to mind said sarah casagrande a lifelong loner who hated people he constructed an ecological excuse for murder but all he wanted to do was destroy the bomber had been a tech type too math phd meticulous scheming and how many years had it taken to bring him down im not saying kurts like the unabomber said casagrande that was serial murder were talking about someone killing his wife if you only knew if kurt did murder marta what do you think his motive was casagrande laughed nervously all this speculation detective ballou thought the case was hopeless and maybe he was right doctor but im trying to prove otherwise and i need all the help i can get i hear what youre saying a motive id have to say jealousy of who its possible and this is real speculation that marta was seeing someone so ive been told you have by emily pastern emily said casagrande yes it was emily who raised the possibility in the first place but id been thinking the same thing we all had because of changes in martas behavior she seemed happier there was more physicality to her the way she carried herself the way she dressed sexier wardrobe said petra no marta was a very restrained person even after the changes she was a long way from sexy but she did start wearing more feminine clothing dresses stockings perfume she had a lovely figure but always used to cover it up under baggy sweats she had great bone structure fixed up with just the smallest touches she was a very attractive woman how long before she was murdered did she start to change id say months four five months i suppose there couldve been other reasons for it such as trying to breathe new passion into her marriage but i never saw any change in the way marta and kurt related which was platonic the exact same word emily pastern had used which could be nothing more than consensus born of girlchat on the other hand these were smart perceptive women whod known marta doebbler a lot better than petra could ever hope to she pressed casagrande more on the affair got nothing but a polite denial of details running casagrande through the events at the theater produced an account consistent with pasterns thanks doctor i hope you succeed in getting him said casagrande if it is him have you considered his job what he does for a living missile designer said petra guidance systems think about that said casagrande he figures out ways to destroy things chapter tuesday june pm la public library central branch w fifth street history and geneology department lower level tom bradley wing isaacs eyes had blurred twenty minutes ago but he waited to take a break until hed finished the herald examiner files his selfassigned task of today going back to the birth of as many la newspapers as he could find and reading every june issue in the case of the herald crossreferencing to the photomorgue when something interesting came up lots of duplication among the papers but all that history added up to hundreds of felonies mostly robberies thefts burglaries assaults and as the automobile took control of the city drunkdriving arrests he whittled down the homicides to those that werent bar killings or family disputes or related to robberies some of what remained was distinctively psychopathic a series of chinatown prostitutes slashed at the turn of the century unsolved drownings and shootings even some bludgeonings but nothing matched the modus or the flavor of the six cases no huge surprise when hed first come across the pattern before hed gone to petra before running his statistical tests of significance hed covered some of the same ground in the la times files still it paid to be careful maybe hed missed something three days to go until june and after nearly seven hours of tedious backcramping eyestraining work hed come up with nothing yesterday had been just as futile spent on the third floor of the goodhue building in the rare books department where hed showed up full of purpose only to be informed that he needed an appointment which was logical these were collectors items what had he been thinking hed flashed his grad student id made up some story about thinking the biostat department had already made an appointment and the librarian a thin older man with a bristly white mustache had taken pity what is it youre looking for when isaac explained keeping it ambiguous but you couldnt get away from the word murder the librarian looked at him differently but hed been helpful anyway handing isaac a written application form then guiding him through the holdings california history mexican bullfighting ornithology pacific voyages i suppose its the first that would concern you mr gomez seeing as bulls and birds dont commit murder actually they do said isaac and hed delivered a little treatise on violent animal behavior the odd member of the herd or flock who turned out to be antisocial it was something he thought about from time to time hmm said the librarian and directed him to the history catalog five hours later hed left the room exhausted and unfulfilled no shortage of human beings turning murderously antisocial during californias bloody history but nothing that could be construed as relating to his cases his as if there was pride of ownership lets face it there is coming across the pattern thrilled you now he was more than willing to relinquish ownership petra was probably right the date was personal not historical leaving him with nothing to offer her he hadnt heard from her since friday had shown up at the station monday morning earlier than usual ready to brainstorm again she wasnt there and her desk was clear totally clear three other detectives were in the room fleischer montoya and a man at the bulletin board any idea where detective connor is hed said to no one in particular fleischers shoulders rose but he didnt speak montoya frowned and left what was that all about then the man at the board said shes out and turned dark suit thinning black hair pencil mustache kind of pimpish vice isaac said any idea when shes coming in and the man stepped closer detective ii robert lucido central division why had he answered the question lucido said im looking for her myself youre an intern i work with detective connor doing research research lucido peered at isaacs badge well shes out isaac he winked exited leaving fleischer who sat there with the phone receiver in his hand but not dialing what did he do here all day isaac scribbled a note for petra and left it on the bare desk was headed for his own seat in the corner when fleischer put the phone down and waved him over dont waste your time what do you mean shes not coming in suspended suspended for gods sake why shootout north hollywood saturday fleischers bushy eyebrows turned into croquet wickets it was on the news son isaac hadnt watched the news too busy but shes okay fleischer nodded what happened petra and another detective were staking a suspect there was a confrontation and the bad guy didnt respond appropriately dead said isaac extremely the suspect on the paradiso case thats the one for that she got suspended its a procedural thing son meaning what rules were broken how long will the suspension last havent heard where is she now anywhere but here said fleischer i dont have her home number fleischer shrugged detective fleischer said isaac its important that i get in touch with her she have your number yes then i dont see any problem son she hadnt called and now it was tuesday caught up in her own problems shed probably forgotten about june not that he had anything for her he missed being at the station suddenly his neck kinked painfully and he got up from his computer terminal in the history and geneology catalog room and stretched being left out in the cold was poetic justice over the past few days hed ignored half a dozen phone messages from klara had stayed away from campus and made the public library his work station expressly to avoid her the decision to break communication had been rationalized as kindness given klaras fragile emotional state wouldnt contact do her more harm than good though what had happened down in the subbasement was regrettable but not a felony two adults doing what adults did one of those odd confluences of time and place and hormones thinking about it now he couldnt believe what hed done the impulsiveness klara whatever her emotional complexities might be needed to realize that he sir said a wispy voice behind him he looked over his shoulder then down several inches saw an elderly black woman smiling up at him oversized purse in one hand big green reference volume tucked under her other arm tiny and stooped she looked to be ninety had beautiful skin the color of prunes a tooheavy wool coat bulked her meager frame a green felt hat sat atop marcelled hair the color of fresh snow are you through sir she said and isaac realized his was the only free computer in the room all those geneology addicts clicking away the fire in the old womans eyes said she was probably one of them he had a few more years of herald to cover but said sure and stepped aside thank you young latin gentleman she enunciated clearly some kind of island lilt scurrying past him she plopped down in front of the terminal cleared the screen of newspaper references clicked found what she was looking for and began rolling through databases ellis island immigration records she mustve felt isaac looking over her shoulder turned and smiled again tracing your roots sir mexico yup isaac lied too tired to get into details its marvelous fun isnt it the past is delicious its great he said the deadness in his voice killed the old womans glee she blinked and he left the room quickly before he ruined someone elses day chapter petra spent a good deal of monday trying to locate melanie jaeger the fourth member of marta doebblers theater party living somewhere in the south of france she recontacted emily pastern who now seemed reluctant to talk but pushed and got the woman to specify somewhere near nice i think using the internet she pulled up maps and phoned every listed hotel and pension in that region slow painful process being cut off from official data banks the ability to use the reverse directory any clout with the airlines reminded her that she was just another civilian she spoke to a lot of baffledbored french desk clerks lied tried charm finally struck gold at a place called la mer where a concierge who spoke beautiful english put her through to madame jaegers room after all that jaeger had nothing new to tell her she too was certain kurt doebbler had brained marta why because hes a spooky creep who never smiled hope you catch him and cut off his balls by eleven pm she still hadnt heard from eric popping a couple of benadryl she sank into ten hours of druggedout sleep and awoke tuesday ready to work back to the computer experienced private eyes had their own methods could sometimes tread where cops couldnt her ignorance of all that bugged her eric was a fast learner soon hed be in touch with all that good stuff if he really made the move she allowed herself a fantasy the two of them working together partners in a highend pi firm beautiful office suite on wilshire or sunset or maybe even out near the beach cool deco furnishings rich clients you write the screenplay and ill pitch it to the networks he called at noon just as she was finishing a quick lunch of toast a green apple and strong coffee she chewed fast swallowed where are you downtown second day running maybe the last day he said hows it going theyre being thorough you cant talk freely i can listen okay she said im really sorry eric for what your having to go through this because of no sweat got to go in a softer voice honey google pulled up zero on kurt doebbler an achievement in itself because the search engine was a monstrous cybervacuum cleaner she supposed the absence of a personal website was consistent with doebblers asocial personality but his name did come up on the pacific dynamics homepage one of many names on a roster of the companys senior staff kurt was listed as senior engineer and technical designer on something called project advent no details on what that was the bio did note that doebbler had interfaced with the th engineering battalion at baumholden army base in germany having spent his high school years as an army brat near hamburg and speaking fluent german kurt was a natural for the assignment that seemed odd american army engineers would speak english was kurt into hushhush stuff something else to make her life more difficult she read on bs from cal tech ms from usc isaacs alma mater speaking of which she hadnt talked to isaac since friday with nothing to show there was no sense bothering the kid according to the bio kurt doebbler was wellregarded as a systems designer whod worked at pacific dynamics for fifteen years meaning soon after grad school no listing of prior employment as a cable dude but why would there be she printed the info reread it the german connection got her going in a whole new direction and she spent the afternoon making international calls until she reached the right person at the hamburg police department chief inspector klaus bandorffer it was the early morning hours in germany still dark and she wondered what kind of chief inspector kept those hours but bandorffer sounded chipper a professional but amiable fellow intrigued by a call from an american detective adding yet another potential infraction to her departmental jacket she told him the june cases were being actively and officially investigated and that she was the lead detective another one said bandorffer another what chief inspector serial killer detective is it connor yes sir youve got a lot of serials in hamburg nothing active right now but we have our share said bandorffer you americans and we germans seem proficient at growing such sociopaths a spooky thought maybe were just good at detecting patterns bandorffer chuckled efficiency and intelligence i like that explanation so you believe you have a suspect who may have lived in hamburg its possible hmm during what time period kurt doebbler was forty high school years meant twentytwo to twentyfive years ago she gave bandorffer those parameters and the details of the headbashing we had such a murder last year he said two drunks in a beer hall brains knocked clear out of the skull our killers an illiterate carpenter never been to the united states your suspects family name is doebbler christian name curtis just kurt with a k click click click i find nothing under that name in my current files but i will check retrospectively it may take a day or so petra gave him her home number and her cell and thanked him profusely bandorffer chuckled again times like these we efficient intelligent law officers must cooperate she tried every cable outfit in la orange ventura san diego and santa barbara counties dealing with paperpushers at human resource departments lying when she needed to no record of kurt doebbler ever working as an installer or any other type of employee which didnt mean much she hadnt expected them to keep records that old and that was it still doebbler was all she had especially for his wifes killing worse came to worst she could stake out his house june hope for a miracle and prepare herself for disappointment maybe it was time to try isaac hed had a few days to mull perhaps a high iq could accomplish what her average little brain couldnt hed probably been by the station yesterday and learned about her suspension whatever his issues were with that jaramillo loser she knew that hearing about her plight would upset him in her selfobsession shed neglected to consider that some babysitter shed turned out to be it was sixfifteen pm and all the university departments were closed she phoned the gomez residence and isaac picked up sounding sleepy dozing in the middle of the afternoon isaac its a loud flapping yawn drowned her out like a horses neighing kind of gross this was a side of isaac she hadnt seen he said you again again this is klara right listen my brothers this is detective petra connor youre isaacs brother silence hey sorry i was sleeping yeah im his brother sorry for waking you is isaac there another yawn then a throat clearing the guys vocal tones were a lot like isaacs but deeper slower like isaac on downers he aint here still at school dont know please tell him i called sure go back to sleep isaacs brother isaiah yeah i will at eight pm she fought the urge to throw together a lonely gal outofcans dinner and went out if she was forced to live like a civilian she might as well reap the benefits she drove around the fairfax district for a while considering the grove or one of the places on melrose ended up at a little kosher fish restaurant on beverly where she and stu bishop had lunched from time to time the owners father a doctor was a colleague of stus ophthalmologist dad petra had returned by herself because the place was close to her apartment had sawdust floors fresh tasty cheap food and a counter pickup policy that avoided chitchat with the waitstaff tonight the owner was out and two hispanic guys in baseball caps were running the place lots of people and noise good she ordered grilled baby salmon with a baked potato and slaw snagged the last vacant table and sat next to a hasidic family with five tiny rambunctious kids the blacksuited bearded father pretended not to notice her but when she caught the eye of the pretty bewigged mother the woman smiled shyly and said sorry for the noise as if her progeny were responsible for all the din petra smiled back theyre cute bigger smile thank you stop it shmuel yakov leave yisroel tzvi alone by nine fortyfive she was back at her place erics jeep was parked on detroit and when she cracked her door he got up from her living room couch and hugged her he had on a tan suit blue shirt yellow tie shed never seen him in light colors and it gave his skin a little earth tone it wasnt necessary to dress for me big boy he smiled and removed the jacket aw she said they kissed briefly he said you eat yet just finished you were figuring on going out out or in doesnt matter he moved his mouth toward hers again she turned her head to the side my breath smells of fish he took her face in his hands touched lips gently then pressed his tongue forward and got her to open up hmm trout salmon i can still go out have coffee and stare while you eat he moved to the kitchen opened the fridge ill forage let me fix you something by the time she reached him hed taken out eggs and milk and pulled a loaf out of the bread box french toast she said i do that real well she cracked eggs and sliced bread he poured milk and said you havent heard about schoelkopf what about him it was on the news i havent watched tv in two days whats going on dead said eric three hours ago his wife killed him she left the kitchen and sat down at the dinette table my god which wife the current one how many did he have she was number three what she left him and then decided to kill him from what i hear said eric he left her no one from the station had thought to call her what happened schoelkopf moved out of the house a few weeks ago rented an apartment near the station one of the highrises on hollywood boulevard west of la brea he was up there with his girlfriend some civilian clerk they headed out for lunch went down in the sub parking lot to get his car the wife stepped out and started shooting schoelkopf caught three in the arm and one right here he tapped the center of his brow the girlfriend got shot too but she was alive when the ambulances arrived then the wife turned the gun on herself is the girlfriend named kirsten krebs blond midtwenties worked downstairs eric nodded you knew about it i guessed about it krebs always had an attitude with me the day schoelkopf called me in she was the messenger i found her sitting on my desk liked she owned it wheres the wife on a respirator not expected to live krebs is in bad shape too she got up flicked on the tv found news on channel five a cheerful latina in a mockchanel suit delivered bad news investigating this evenings murder of an lapd police captain edward schoelkopf fortyseven a twentyyear veteran was allegedly gunned down by his estranged wife meagan schoelkopf thirtytwo who shot herself fatally in what investigators believe was a lovetriangle murdersuicide also wounded was a yetunidentified young woman the backdrop shifted from a ragged white homicide header over a chalked body outline to a wedding photo of the couple in happier times that left this quiet residential area of hollywood shocked and schoelkopfs colleagues at the police department stunned now on to other local news petra switched the set off i couldnt stand him and lord knows he despised me why ill never know but this he hated women said eric you say that as if you know for a fact when he first interviewed me he tried to sound me out about minorities women mostly women it was clear he didnt like them he thought he was being subtle wanted to see if i agreed whatd you do kept my mouth shut that made him assume it was okay to talk freely and he told some really nasty antifemale jokes you never told me what was the point none i guess she sat down eric walked behind her and massaged her shoulders ive found he said that in most situations the less said the better but not all situations my dear schoelkopf dead what will it mean for us in terms of our suspensions before it happened i was led to believe they werent going to be too hard on either of us itll probably delay our dispositions no matter to you youre leaving his hand stopped working maybe she twisted around looked up im still thinking he said big decision makes sense disappointed of course not its your life we could still get a house he said with both of us working we could probably get a decent place sooner rather than later sure she said surprised by the coolness in her own voice is there a problem im a little overwhelmed right now dangling and all because i helped get rid of a really bad guy she broke free stood marched into the kitchen plus theres the june stuff three days to go and ive got squat what about that husband doebbler everyones sure he killed his wife but theres no evidence he fits in some ways but not in others like what she elaborated he listened petra saw the eggs and bread and milk sitting on the counter time to be useful scooping butter into a pan she turned on the gas soaked the bread in milk and when the butter was bubbling and barely brown dropped in two slices nice sound the sizzle there was something to be said for mindless work eric said you could surveil doebbler on the twentyeighth he moves hes your guy and if he doesnt someone dies he shrugged mister blasé he didnt answer the french toast was ready she plated it set it in front of him he didnt move sorry for snapping she said i didnt mean to be glib he said you didnt do anything wrong i didnt take you seriously he said youre up to your eyeballs in junk gazing up at her eyes softer than shed ever seen she cradled his head picked up a fork and slipped it between his fingers eat before it gets cold chapter wednesday june am number seven bus santa monica line pico and overland isaac almost left home without taking the paper bag plagued by restlessness all night hed slept until eightforty his parents and his brothers were gone and he admitted with some shame that the resultant silence was wonderful with the bathroom all to himself he took his time showering shaving walked around naked slid his briefcase out from under the bunk bed checked under his papers to make sure the gun was all right why wouldnt it be he pulled it out aimed it at the mirror bang stupid idea the gun what had he been thinking he rewrapped it put it back in the bottom of the case touched the bruise on his cheek no swelling slightly tender those kids had been stupid little punks hed overreacted maybe hed return the gun to flaco running his hands over his body he lifted an edge of window shade looked out and caught a blade of sky above the air shaft blue streaked with white he put on fresh khakis and a shortsleeved yellow shirt the heat that had already permeated the apartment said this would be a shortsleeves day even at the beach where the air was always cooler was he growing addicted to sand and ocean there were worse vices last night unable to sleep hed allowed himself fantasies of living there one day rich doctor beautiful wife brilliant kids set up in one of those big houses on the palisades or if fate really steered things his way a place right on the sand surf gulls pelicans dolphins waking every morning to the sound of the ocean about as likely as waking up naturally blond but he could while away another day at the pier hed worked hard was entitled spoiled brat deservedness has nothing to do with it the key to success wasnt virtue it was knowledge knowledge was power the old familiar mantra filled his head stay on target get educated the phd then the md acquire a specialty get an academic appointment publish like a demon earn early tenure build a reputation that can be parlayed into lucrative consultantships maybe even an mba a position at some pharmaceutical company one day hed be dr gomez meanwhile hed gotten himself into a fix with klara she kept calling how long could that go on hed have to deal with it sooner rather than later but today the beach he went into the kitchen put his briefcase on the counter and poured a glass of milk changed his mind hed return to the public library use the tools hed come to believe in thorough data collection deductive and inductive reasoning hard work problems were solvable there had to be an answer he gulped the milk and headed for the door saw the bag on the tiny mail table to the right of the door brown paper neatly folded his mothers trademark his name printed in red crayon shaky letters because shed never been confident about her literacy the exact same way shed printed his lunches when he was at burton all the other kids eating in the school cafeteria a wonderful place those steam tables the hairnetted women jewelgreen and sunyellow vegetables slabs of pink meat and white turkey things hed never seen succotash welsh rarebit his mother had been afraid of the strange food or so shed claimed later hed found out that scholarship students didnt qualify for the caf the schools generosity only went so far hed been ashamed of his sack lunches until some of the other kids had thought his tamales and black beans cool thered been a few snickers this was middle school after all but the burton student body had been welldrilled in the virtues of diversity and for the most part had seemed impressed by irma gomezs cooking that made it easy for isaac to trade his homemade fare for the contents of the rich kids caf trays chewing away with forced aplomb pretending to like the bland stuff because he desperately wanted to blend in it had been a while since mama had packed him a lunch maybe hed ditch it get himself a fried sausage from a street vendor near the library no way the guilt would overwhelm him he stuffed the bag in his briefcase left and hurried down the stairs guilt was a big part of his makeup so scratch the mba and the drug companies there goes the house on the beach as he hit the street he changed his mind again two days of library work had produced nothing what could he hope to find he walked to pico caught the number seven bus and rode all the way to overland when the aroma of his mothers food seeping through the brown paper got his gastric juices going and he unfolded the flap and looked inside atop the foilwrapped morsels was a scrap of paper folded over he fished it out read bro in large clumsy capitals isaiahs writing he unfolded the note the lady cop called last night just that no number he got up from his seat rang the buzzer exited at the next stop the stations rear door was locked since hed been coming here that had only happened twice because someone had forgotten to open it he found his key it didnt come close to fitting change of locks then he noticed the closedcircuit camera above the door flaking paint where the device had been installed the lens was focused right on him it made him feel like a suspect and he turned his back new security measures because of some terrorism alert he was thinking about that when he saw an older silver cadillac drive into the lot and park that old drillsergeant type detective dilbeck isaac approached the car and dilbeck rolled down his window morning detective morning mr gomez the doors locked and my key doesnt work mine neither said dilbeck everyone comes in through the front until things calm down calm down from what dilbeck bared his teeth captain schoelkopf was murdered yesterday oh no for the time being theyre being extra careful not that what happened to the captain applies to anyone else he cheated on his wife hell has no fury and all that you havent annoyed any feisty females lately have you mr gomez isaac smiled his stomach churned dilbeck got out of his car and began walking toward the lots entrance isaac stayed in place no work today mr gomez isaac half heard him thinking heightened security probably means a metal detector the gun actually im on my way to school just dropped by to get detective connors number she phoned me last night but my brother neglected to write down her number shes home said dilbeck you know what happened to her yes sir its kind of important that i talk to her she was trying to reach me about a case were shes working on well shes not working on anything now mr gomez still i think i should return her dilbeck clapped his shoulder and stared into his eyes youre a nice young fellow but were sticklers for privacy around here how about i call detective connor and tell her you stopped by give me a number where you can be reached isaac gave him the biostatistics office number now he had to return to campus what a tangled web we weave he reached usc forty minutes later took an indirect route to biostat that circumvented doheny and headed straight for his mailbox it had been days since hed checked and the box was stuffed circulars departmental memos junk mail five messages from klara all in the same curvy handwriting the last three were dated yesterday exclamation points sandwiched between those was a single slip listing petras name and a number to call a prefix that had to be her home he asked the secretary if he could use a department phone to make a local call she said havent you been a stranger he shrugged working on the dissertation poor baby dont tie up this one use the extension in the xerox room you know the drill eight for an outside line and no phoning europe the door to the photocopy room was open hed nearly made it over there when a hand landed on his upper back light touch the barest contact he wheeled and faced klara distenfield she wore a royal blue dress printed with tiny yellow fish fresh lipstick mascara perfume the same perfume her hand remained near the side of his neck she smiled and said finally he ushered her into the room what an elusive fellow klara im sorry you should be no rancor in her voice that made him really anxious he found himself looking her up and down stopped but not before the images had registered red hair pinned soft hairs escaping the blue dress tight over round belly and meaty hips the breasts the perfume oh shit he was hard her goldgreen eyes narrowed do you know how many times ive tried to reach you ive been out family issues everyones got a family her lips pursed and tiny wrinkles formed above the gloss whatever the family issue was it couldnt be too grave i talked to your brother and he didnt say anything he sounds like you by the way the prospect of constructing another lie exhausted him he said nothing grave it just took time so youre okay im fine what about you me she laughed im great why i thought you were upset about what what happened me she placed a dainty hand over one commodious breast i was a little thrown but then we had coffee remember and i was fine didnt i seem fine the next day he said you werent at work mary zoltan said you were sick she implied it was more than a cold he shook his head maybe i misread the whole thing marys an idiot i wasnt the least bit sick i missed two days because my daughter was ill high fever stiff neck we were worried about meningitis is she okay shes fine just a virus but i was pretty frantic she sidled closer to him you were worried i had some big old neurotic reaction to our little tumble thats kind of touching her smile was wry except that you dealt with it by avoiding me not neurotic he said i thought i he shook his head you thought youd traumatized the poor sexstarved librarian and she was going to make your life miserable she threw back her head and laughed soft laugh sexy her hand moved down to his crotch youre not that worried klara what happened was great dont see it any other way she squeezed him released him winked klara chemistry is chemistry isaac one can never explain it rationally that doesnt mean we have to give in to our impulses sly grin though i can think of worse things she stroked his face youre really a beautiful young man i admire your brain and i adore your body but it could never be anything more than an erotic tumble which isnt halfbad right youve got the potential to be a fantastic lover and im a pretty good teacher another downward glance dont worry thats not an invitation for episode two because right now there are more important things to discuss and thats why ive been trying to reach you for days silly lad first of all a cop has been nosing around asking about you he just left the library as a matter of fact which is why i came here to leave you yet another message a cop he said whats his name detective robert lucido the guy whod been hanging near the bulletin board pencil mustache thats the one said klara i didnt know anyone but john waters wore those anymore what did lucido want he said he was carrying out a routine security investigation of lapd volunteers because of some new september regulations wanted to know what kind of person you are who you hang out with then he got downright unconstitutional what books you checked out of course i declined howd he get to you she eyed the door he came to biostat first and they told him you spent most of your time doing research in the stacks his story a routine investigation is it baloney probably whats really going on isaac i dont know he said thats the truth i was just over at the station and they changed the locks maybe its because their captain got murdered i heard about that or it really is terrorismrelated that said klara would scare me you know how open our campus is are you sad about the captain i didnt know him well cheating on his wife said klara one must be careful who one fucks and who one fucks with she dropped one hand and isaac readied himself for another goose instead she held his hand he felt leaden so many unanswered questions but his erection hadnt flagged down you little bastard and lucido just left maybe ten minutes ago said klara i made sure he didnt follow me when i came here thanks said isaac thank me with a kiss he complied she said yum youve got serious potential but first things first the main reason ive been trying to reach you isnt lucido its because i finally came up with something on those june murders what she pressed herself against him positioned his hands on her rear pressed down and made him squeeze when she spoke they were so close her lips grazed his i do think i may have solved your mystery isaac chapter klara left first exiting the building to make sure lucido was gone isaac waited in the hallway and moments later she stuck her head in and gave him the thumbsup sign enjoying the adventure they walked back to doheny blending with student traffic a girl in shorts and bikini top lay on the lawn of the fivestory building reading philosophy a couple of male students hurried by wearing sweatshirts that read lsu sucks tenn swallows klara wore a beatific smile once they were inside instead of descending to the subbasement they climbed two floors the rare book room a series of locked chambers and brief hushed corridors klara had all the right keys inside the central reception area was cozy hushed paneled in new beautiful oak stained oxblood discreetly lit by milkglass lamps and chandeliers that hung from a white coffered ceiling bordered with turquoise green leather chairs oak tables off to the left side a few administrative offices no one in sight lunch hour klara led him to a room marked reading inside was a mediumsized conference table a photocopy machine a small desk sided by an armchair thats for the student monitor she explained someone sits and watches when you read the really rare material i told her to take an early lunch i spent some time here said isaac researching lewis carroll for an english class pencils no pens white linen gloves when necessary we have a wonderful carroll collection sit weve got an hour he pulled up to the table expecting her to leave and return with something instead she settled next to him unclasped her purse out came a book a booklet brownpaper cover printed in rough black lettering wrapped in a zipsealed plastic bag she said i was a very bad girl taking it out of here i did it just in case that lucido person was still skulking around and we were unable to return he took her hand and kissed it she laughed smoothed out the plastic removed the booklet carefully talk about esoteric i found it in the graham collection it wasnt even cataloged in the main collection it was in one of the appendices out of her purse came a pair of soft white gloves speaking of which she said rotating the booklet so the title faced isaac he gloved up read the sins of the mad artist an account of the horrible deeds of otto retzak recounted by t w joseph teller esq former superintendent of the missouri state penitentiary and published by him in st louis ad mcmx the brown cover was cardboard acidburned brown at the borders brittle isaac lifted it gingerly flipped began reading after covering a single paragraph he turned to klara youre brilliant she beamed so ive been told otto retzak was the son of bavarian immigrant farmers whod come to america in and ended up on a scratchy patch of rockstrewn land in the southern illinois region known as little egypt the sixth of nine children and the youngest son otto had been born on american soil born june one hundred years to the day before marta doebblers murder isaacs hands started to shake he steadied them and hunched over the crudely printed text retzak was eight when his drunkard father abandoned the family considered extremely bright but uneducable due to a frightfully overactive and heated temperament otto displayed a precocious ability to wield charcoal stubs in a way that created faithful images his artistic talent went unappreciated by ottos drunkard mother who routinely beat him with switches and kitchen implements and left him to the mercies of his older brothers with great enthusiasm and teamwork the elder siblings sexually abused the boy at age nine the illiterate otto burgled a neighboring farm of twentynine cents hidden in a flour jar and a plump laying hen the money was traded to another farm boy for a rusty clasp knife the bird was found off the pitted dirt path that led to the decrepit retzak homestead gutted its eyes scooped out its head yanked off manually when confronted otto admitted his guilt with no sense of childish shame on the contrary he boasted beaten by his mother with special severity he was turned over to the neighbors who added their own lashwork to his tender back and worked him as a barnhand for a month of fourteenhour days the day after returning home otto stabbed his younger sister in the face without apparent provocation as superintendent t w joseph teller recounted a cold eye even a sly smile he did present to all those in attendance as the girl shrieked and wept and bled the local sheriff was called in and otto was locked in a cell with adult miscreants two months later the boy bruised and limping was brought before an itinerant magistrate who warned him about substantial characterological degeneracy and sentenced him to five years in a state reform school there otto claimed to have learned that mankind is not glorious nor good nor fashioned in gods image rather it is a dungheap of stink and sin and hypocrisy the hatred that was to drive me for the entirety of my accursed life took hold and was fed in that dark place the outrages that were done to my person and mind in the name of spiritual cure were of benefit to me in a manner that could not be predicted they turned my belly to iron and my mind toward revenge bound over for two extra years because of chronic disciplinary problems sixteenyearold otto now strapping and hardmuscled was released of a surprising pleasant countenance when not enraged retzak presented the thoughtful mien and demeanor of a man in his twenties yet all that could change in a trice during his stay in the reformatory the boy had been befriended by the wife of one of the guards a woman named bessie arbogast impressed by ottos drawings she brought him paper and charcoal sticks and it was to her house that he headed on his initial day of freedom once free of his bonds the incorrigible repaid mrs arbogasts kindnesses by entering her bedroom through an open window what commenced was described in retzaks alleged words though the flowery language made isaac wonder if teller had taken substantial literary liberties in the chamber of her common little snuggery enriched by the pleasure of violating her worm of a husband as well as her flabby person and dewyeyed soul i used a wooden hairbrush in plain sight to bash him energetically about the head feeling quite fond of myself then had my way with her in manners all the more pleasurable to me for their unspeakability william arbogast survived the beating as a cripple his wifes trauma rendered her virtually mute retzak escaped on foot and avoided capture traveling the country by hopping freight trains he survived by eating pilfered domestic animals and produce and meals donated by kindhearted housewives often he repaid them by doing odd jobs before moving on sometimes he left them drawings that were universally appreciated the young man was capable of capturing garden scenes and furniture with utmost accuracy it was only the portrayal of the human figure that posed technical problems for him interestingly teller went on during this period retzak did not choose to inflict similar punishments upon these altruistic women as he had upon mrs arbogast when i inquired as to the cause of this discrepancy retzak seemed genuinely puzzled i do not know why i do what i do sometimes i have the urge and other times i dont sometimes my brain remains cool and other times it boils like a cauldron of lard i am not controlled in my impulses as are most men and i do not regret the lack of restraint in my soul i have been anointed by satan or howsoever you recognize the dark angel to behave in the way that i do and i have obeyed my master with the same mechanic idiocy as the fools and worms who squander their wretched little lives kneeling before the altar of some blabbering lying diety it was teller concluded a great puzzle of medicine and characterology in that retzaks entire anatomy including his brain has been examined by learned physicians and found unremarkable this has included detailed measurement of his cranium by practitioners of the discipline called phrenology now considered of questionable scientific merit by some but employed in the hope of ascertaining basic truths about the fiend that analysis deciphered nothing out of the ordinary as did all other analyses one can only hope that exposure to the twisted workings of this monsters soul as put forth by this humble tract will benefit mankind that is in fact the purpose of the author at the age of eighteen retzak made his way to san francisco where he was hired as a deckhand aboard the steamer grand tripoli bound for the orient the ship made a stop in hawaii where retzak took shore leave and abandoned his post in honolulu retzak embarked on a course of drunkenness and debauchery with numerous women of ill repute soon he was living in common law with a prostitute a fallen alsatian girl named ilette flam spectral and pasty as such types tend to be and an opium addict retzak appointed himself ilettes procurer and for a period of nearly one year sustained himself with her illgotten earnings on retzaks nineteenth birthday ilette threw a party for him at a waterfront dive during that celebration she made an offhand remark that annoyed retzak and when the two of them returned to their flat an argument ensued retzak claimed not to recall the precise manner in which ilette flam had offended his sensibilities however when challenged by myself on this point he owned up that it was something about my being lazy the sow was hazy with dope and booze and believed my intake of rum would dull my thinking and allow her to insult me with no consequence just the opposite my senses were heightened and every stupid remark from her flapping sow lips served to inflame me further when she uttered another taunt perhaps it was something that challenged my intelligence a definite thought crossed my field of vision like a beacon your sow brain is that of a mindless animal waiting until ilette had fallen into a drugged stupor because shed earned me a fair bit of money and for the most part she wasnt allbad retzak put her to bed turned her on her stomach picked up an iron pry bar and bashed the back of her head the skull cracked like an egg and gobbets of brains seeped out accompanied by a clearish liquid then some blood the sight of it thrilled me as nothing had thrilled me before new feelings took hold of my mind and i maintained a focused wielding of bar against bone specks of the tissue sprayed out like the finest mist and adhered to the walls when a large brainy clot slipped down the back of her dress i stared at it amazed that this ugly grayish pink gelatin might very well house what christian fools considered the seat of the soul could there be anything more hideous just one look at the cloudy mucus would inform any logical man that religion is rot suddenly i was awash in calm and sat gazing at my handiwork with rapture it was a new feeling and i quite liked it i fetched my tablet of drawing paper and some pens id stolen from berringers department store in waikiki as the sow lay there leaking and seeping and demonstrably dead i drew her for the first time i was able to capture the human form with a degree of accuracy it was retzak concluded a fine birthday present isaacs throat had gone dry his hairline ached swallowing and gulping he tried to stimulate saliva klara said this has to be it her voice was thick he nodded but he was thinking something else june had been a double anniversary for otto retzak commemoration of his birth and the date of his first murder his first victim a commonlaw wife the la killer had begun in commemorating the centenary of retzaks birth his first victim a wife martas friends were sure kurt doebbler had killed her sometimes things were just as they seemed isaac turned the page upon finishing the drawing of ilette flams mangled corpse retzak wrapped it in a bloody sheeting packed a duffle walked to honolulu harbor and got himself a job on an oil tanker bound for venezuela all the way there the memory of what id done to the sow burned in my brain like a sacrament the ability to extinguish the flame the power as i swabbed decks and emptied slop buckets i barely thought of anything else i was much more than a deckhand i had danced a dance few men can hope to know at night as i lay in a bunk surrounded by snoring swine it was all i could do not to bash them all but cunning prevented me from such rashness for the ship was a prison at sea with no chance of escape it was on shore in caracas months later that i allowed myself the next delicious indulgence the proprietor of a beerhouse a foulmouthed old mestizo got on my wrong side and i decided hed be the one waiting until hed closed for the night and retired upstairs to his personal lodgings i snapped the latch on the rear door of his establishment and surprised myself to find him awake and eating a late supper of pork and rice and some such swill as he started to curse i picked up a frypan resting atop the stove a lovely castiron implement it was with agreeable heft and a stout handle within seconds gray halfbreed gelatin had leaked into that hispanical dinner no different did it look from the sows and as i sketched the scene i got to thinking that all persons are but pathetic sacks of flesh and gristle and disgusting fluids our delusions of cleanliness and nobility are the basest of lies the world teems with hypocrisy and falsehood and loosing the pitcocks of humanity in order to free the fluids is the greatest honesty of all it was my destiny i decided to bring about truth once again retzak jumped ship and hid out in south america for several months eventually making his way back to the states he tramped across the country stealing and doing odd jobs finding employment as a menial laborer a shortorder cook or a night clerk at shabby hotels his offhours were spent brawling overindulging in alcohol opium marijuana and patent medicines seducing and raping prostitutes sneakthieving butchering wild and domestic animals at whim murdering five more human beings the third victim a matron walking her dog in le doux missouri an affluent suburb of st louis nocturnal walk shed been surprised by a handsome strapping fellow with a mutt in tow id watched this one for days a sturdy sow she was and i admired her form and her walk believed her someone id enjoy knowing in the biblical sense but then the urge came over me to go beyond that merest intrusion and i stole an old yellow cur from a frontyard in her neighborhood a wretched mongrel so old and blind that he put up no resistance when i lifted him over the fence fashioning a leash from a length of rope i set out to see if hed cooperate and he did though in a clumsy halting manner i offered him a slab of meat and he regarded me as a religious fool might regard a savior that night i stationed myself outside the sows house and she emerged as always at nine pm with her fluffy little annoyance tethered by a satin cord as she strolled from her house she began humming a jaunty tune and that inflamed me further i followed her at a distance until she entered a dark section of her street then hurried after her carrying my borrowed mongrel when i was sufficiently close i set the dog down walked past her stopped several yards ahead and pretended to be tending to the cur my possession of a canine companion caused her to see me as trustworthy and she approached without hesitation within moments we were chatting idiotically and i sensed that she found me gentlemanly after an exchange of polite utterances she turned to leave and down came the ax handle id secreted in my coat the gelatin her little fluffy thing began whimpering and for dessert i stomped it its gelatin appeared no different to my eye than hers and i found that quite amusing when i was finished recording the scene in my tablet i picked up the yellow mongrel carried it a half mile away to a wooded place it looked up at me with affection as i twisted its neck after inspecting its vitals i kicked it under a tree isaac exhaled klaras breathing was audible and minty he hesitated before turning the page knowing what would follow number four a nigger sailor stalked accosted and bludgeoned in a chicago back alley five an insolent prostitute skinny as a young girl but syphilitic and insolent brutalized in a new orleans park six an abominable nancy boy living in the same hotel as myself in san francisco pursed his lips at me in a disgusting manner and repeated the insult the following day i pretended to enjoy his attentions waited until a moonless night and followed him when he went out to prowl the streets in order to accomplish what that ilk accomplishes accosting him in a quiet alley i agreed to grant his request he bent and looked up at me much as the yellow dog had i told him to close his eyes and proceeded to dispense the sodomite with energy and efficiency using the handle of an ax id stolen that very morning visiting ministrations of my unique design to his perversityfilled cranium was a special joy his brain resembled that of a normal man in every way perfect match but retzak hadnt stopped at six hitchhiking from san francisco to los angeles the itinerant killer decided he was now capable of drawing the human figure and face setting up an easel near the central railway station he tried to earn a living drawing caricatures of tourists however wrote superintendent teller whatever technical ability he did have was overridden by a tendency to depict others as leering saturnine creatures his rendering of the eyes especially was upsetting to those who sat for him and payment was often refused retzak kept the unsold drawings and these works have provided much fodder for analysis by alienists of both the boston and the vienna schools when his artists career failed to materialize retzak resumed his pattern of thievery and transitory labor working as a ditchdigger a cook a janitor at a school even a footcourier for a small independent bank careful never to pilfer from the money satchels he was found stealing paper and pens from the financial institution and dismissed it was summertime and rather than pay for lodgings retzak began sleeping outdoors near railyards and in parks his wanderings took him to elysian park where a sanitorium for tubercular war orphans and other sick children had existed for decades in that treeshaded and verdant place retzak always careful to present himself in a clean and acceptable manner attracted the attention of the staff by sitting on a bench near the childrens rest area and drawing curiosity brought the young ones and their caretakers over and soon retzak was creating pictures for them they began regarding him as a friendly wholesome young man that of course was the falsest of false impressions i was able to impersonate the character of a sound conventional stupidly amiable man with laughable ease all the time even as i smiled and nattered and sketched the wheezing piglets the fire burned in my brain i contemplated luring one of them away from the trough dashing its little brains upon hard ground then watching the gelatin seep into the sand it had been some months since id indulged myself in my favorite game for there were periods when i did try to abstain during those arid days memories of my exploits served to amuse me but of late i had grown weary of mere nostalgia and knew that something new and fresh a fine challenge was called for id learned what i could about brainjelly and decided that nothing short of a complete medical exploration from cranium down to the toes would suffice a composite of humours a veritable flood of release would elevate me to new heights of devilry not piglet humours something mature it was then that my eyes settled upon the smiley chanting starchywhite nurses who attended to the little gaspers my favorite was one sow in particular a dagolooking type of fine form and dark eyes of apparent cold nature she had not joined the others in inspecting my sketchwork quite the opposite she maintained a careful distance gazed at me with impudence seemed to harbor a disdain for fine art such rudeness could not be countenanced i was determined to teach her a hard lesson klara stretched its dreadful stuff no when was the book donated said isaac thirty years ago dr graham was a forensic psychiatrist he died in his sons were wealthy bankers and they gave us his books as a tax deduction i need to know everyone who checked this out that would be a violation of constitutional rights unless the fbis looking for terrorists she didnt answer please said isaac its essential finish reading when he did she made him a copy of the booklet then led him out of the reading room he followed her down to her desk at the reference counter one middleaged woman spooled microfilm her back to the desk no sign of mary or any other librarians klara said walk away over there pointing to a stack of periodicals isaac obeyed pulled out a copy of the new republic and pretended to read as klara sat down at her computer put on half glasses typed brought something to the screen pursing her lips she touched her right temple looked around returned to isaac oh dear she said ive just gotten the worst headache time to find myself an aspirin before it gets out of hand she left wiggling prettily isaac stepped forward chapter wednesday june petras apartment detroit street near sixth a nurse she said maria giacometti said isaac her murder was different from the others a lot more violent more intrusive instinctively he closed his eyes remembering the butchery opened them quickly not wanting to come across squeamish escalation is typical said petra what turns them on in the beginning stops working so they get nastier isaac knew that intellectually hed learned a term for it sensory saturation but saw no reason to mention that he sat at petras dinette table as she leafed through the photocopy of the booklet such a neat clean compact apartment a faint feminine smell exactly what hed imagined she turned a page said oh my at seven shed gone out for dinner with eric then he drove up to camarillo to visit his parents said hed be back in the morning when she returned home just before nine a message from barney fleischer was on her machine isaac gomez had been by the station had seemed anxious to talk to her kind of nervous also barney added some clown from central gang control was asking around about the kid she called the gomez home more out of some sort of hazy maternal obligation than expectation as the phone rang she wondered if shed wake the poor brother again but isaac picked up and when he learned it was her he began talking shouting at warp speed thank god ive been trying to get you all day detective fleischer told me you ive got the answer petra to june the pattern the motivation who and why everything who his next victim will be whos he silence doebbler breathing hard almost panting she said start at the beginning she picked him up in front of his building at nineforty he was pacing the curb swinging his briefcase jumped into the car before her tires stopped rolling his eyes shot back reflected streetlight bright jumpy she had to remind him to fasten his seat belt as he chattered she drove back to her place initially shed figured on a restaurant meeting then decided they needed total privacy bringing isaac home was something shed have considered out of the question an hour ago now things were different forget all the personal stuff this was the job she finished the booklet wheres the list isaac pulled a folded slip of paper from the case computer printout from klaras workstation teller twj the sins of the mad artist subjs crime us history retzak o graham coll catal below that a list of everyone whod requested a peek at the booklet short list september professor a r ritchey pitzer college may k doebbler using an alumnus library card kurt doebbler had imbibed these horrors one month and thirteen days before murdering his wife seeking inspiration or had the bastard come across the booklet by chance and decided to emulate otto retzak she asked isaac what he thought he said my guess would be he already knew about retzak he could even have read the book somewhere else and wanted to refresh his memory where else could doebbler have gotten hold of something this obscure its esoteric but not really that obscure once i had retzaks name as a keyword i went back on the internet hes been discussed in a few truecrime chat rooms and the booklets in the holdings of at least twenty campus libraries also soon after it was published initially it was translated into french italian and german doebbler lived in germany as an adolescent makes sense she said he couldve stumbled across it gotten stimulated decided to take a second look she got up and paced her small living room isaac watched her then stopped abruptly and stared at the carpet she noticed became aware of his maleness her clothing baggy chocolate sweater over black leggings skintight leggings revealing more thigh than she wouldve liked but no one could accuse her of being seductive she caught isaacs eye he just sat there looking like an abashed schoolboy she said okay lets lay it out marta cheated on kurt he found out built up some serious anger hed always been a cold controlled man but now his control was slipping he stewed started to obsess remembered the retzak book from his impressionable teen years or he was a truecrime buff lots of serials are any clues from those chat rooms i skimmed them searching for some indication doebbler was chatting if he was i didnt catch it lets pull them up see if theres something traceable he shook his head chats cant be traced because they occur in real time arent stored on the hard drive i doublechecked with a guy i know whos a real computer wizard and he confirmed it damn she said cracking her knuckles okay back on track one way or the other doebbler read about retzak and retzaks first murder stuck in his head a commonlaw wife who ticked the guy off suddenly doebbler finds himself to be a tickedoff husband and retzaks adventures take on a whole new meaning that turned killing marta into more than revenge he was reliving history assuming the persona of a bigtime monster she shook her head doebbler wanted to be otto the second so seven innocent people died its beyond twisted but it makes sense feels right victims with no apparent link gave him confidence said isaac why would he even imagine getting caught petra smiled he wasnt figuring on you i was lucky eyes back to the floor blushing cute when he did that she wished she could find him a genius girlfriend seven innocent people she sat back down and reread the booklet despite superintendent tellers delicacy in dancing around the details maria giacomettis murder was stomachchurning retzak had been found sitting under a california oak not far from the elysian park sanitarium with the young womans entrails around his neck peaceful expression on his face knees crossed like some homicidal yogi humming softly seemingly entranced a hobo crossing the park spotted the horror and ran terrified to the nearest police officer no big detective work necessary retzak had left a blood trail snaking from the playground killspot to his tree sounds like he lost it said petra thank god said isaac can you imagine the next one she put the booklet aside her head felt swollen and her heart raced seven for mr retzak six so far for mr doebbler she said and were going to make sure it stays that way she fixed coffee for both of them gave the booklets final chapter yet another scan otto retzaks final days his arrest trial and execution had taken all of three weeks the good old days retzak had gone defiantly to the gallows proclaiming his hatred for god humanity and all that you brainless sheep deem sacred give me a chance to leave this room and ill brain every one of you chew on your guts have myself a blood and gelatin party petra said i wonder how many italianamerican pediatric nurses are out there if doebblers really a stickler said isaac we should be looking at an italianamerican pediatric nurse who takes care of respiratory patients that would narrow it down not that it matters preventions worth a whole lot of cure were going to be surveilling doebbler starting tomorrow morning hes not going to get close to number seven just tell me what you want me to do hed scooted forward on the couch all eagerness misinterpreting we uhoh she said by we i meant police officers i cant afford to involve you in this isaac his face fell he tried to recover with a confident nod oh sure i can see that no active involvement ill just ride along and observe in case you need a free set of hands or theres some function i can fill she shook her head sorry youre absolutely the hero of this story without you nothing wouldve happened but having civilians along on highrisk operations is a bigtime nono especially now im in enough trouble cant afford more its beyond absurd he said with sudden adamance your suspension i mean selden slaughters all those kids and the departments worried about picayune procedure the department is a paramilitary organization i obey therefore i am putting on the calm wise mentor persona while her mind raced who did i mean by we it would have to be her and eric sorry reverend bob and mary right now i need your son more than you do eric would be a major asset he was great on surveillance had the patience the low resting heart rate but a twoperson surveillance was barebones fine for a lowstakes stationary watch what if doebblers house provided some kind of rear escape or the bastard took a complicated route and they got snarled in heavy traffic losing him was out of the question no way it just couldnt happen three would be a whole lot better than two three pros she glanced over at isaac crestfallen and trying to hide it could she risk it no way especially not with gang control surveilling him maybe she should break that wide open no not a good idea why not she said so hows flaco jaramillo he turned white nearly fell off the couch several moments passed why do you ask you tell me isaac tell you what your connection to flaco jaramillo he stayed calm but his face got hard hawkish a little scary his hands tightened into fists and as he rolled them forearms bunched veins popping like miniature pylons thick arms some serious muscles shed never noticed all that brain power had made her forget this was a healthy young man in his prime now shed tapped into something that evoked his physicality she wondered how much of himself hed kept from her so thats it he said thats what someone from the departments been asking about me over on campus some detective named lucido bobby lucido he and his partner spoke to me a few days ago isaacs eyes flashed with anger you didnt think to tell me i didnt even consider it my friend because i didnt know what you were up to still dont idiots he mumbled his laughter was coarse staccato free of amusement not you but you work with a bunch of really stupid people we cant all be geniuses i didnt mean it that way jesus he knuckled the spot between his eyebrows raised a rosy spot theyve got pictures isaac his shoulders stiffened of what now ive buried myself of you and a lowlife dope dealer slash possible triggerman shmoozing it up in a lowlife bar she folded her arms across her chest he tried to force relaxation his body cooperated but his eyes were way too jumpy just like a suspect the kid had broken the case and now she was breaking him did life have to be this hard he said i can see why that might lead to a mistaken impression dont bullshit me she said he blinked hard no more hard guy scared kid what was real what wasnt im not bullshitting you he insisted but theres nothing ominous going on flaco and i go back we grew up together i tutored him in grade school in public school before i got into burton we run into each other from time to time i know hes been in trouble but ive never been involved in any of that a few days ago he called me up and asked me to meet him to help him out with a family matter what kind of family matter his mothers sick cancer shes illegal cant qualify for medical he was under the impression i was already in medical school figured i could help her get free medical care hes always about that getting an angle i went to see him because he used to stick up for me when we were kids i explained that i wasnt in the system he didnt want to hear that got persistent i told him id look into it when i got back to campus i made a few calls couldnt do a thing told him thats it is it yes dammit youre not a dope courier his eyes got wide are you insane petra didnt answer i promise petra i swear ive never had anything to do with dope never and growing up the way i did there was no lack of opportunity flacos a psychopath and a felon but we dont hang together this was about doing a favor thats all and i think its crazy that im being persecuted for it i guess you couldnt tell me earlier but if you had i couldve cleared it up sick mother she said yes that can be verified pretty easily verify away his dark eyes met hers and held the gaze his fists had uncurled he looked tired petra said there was some curiosity about your briefcase flaco going up to the bar maybe getting something to give you under the table he laughed the briefcase have you ever seen me without it here want to check he picked up the case offered it to her praying its okay she said ive never sold dope and im certainly no mule jesus petra can you imagine what would happen to my med school career if i got caught doing something like that he frowned what still might happen if your idiot colleagues keep harassing me he gnawed his lip maybe its time for me to get an attorney do what you need to do but i cant imagine that any kind of publicity could help you true true he shook his head what a mess if nothing happened there wont be a problem how can i prove a negative he said take a polygraph if it comes to that once this is resolved ill do what i can to run interference for you so its important for your sake that i dont lose any more department brownie points is there anything else you havent told me no your suspension that didnt have anything to do with me did it no that i did all by my little lonesome she got up poured yet more coffee for herself offered him a refill no thanks any more insights on doebbler he shook his head she said ill drive you home i can take the bus no way she said not at this hour by the way that bruise you were sporting what really happened my brother and i had a little scuffle he said nothing serious you know what its like with siblings you guys are a little old for roughhousing isaiahs a good guy petra but lifes hard for him he works like a dog doesnt get enough sleep last time i called you i woke him poor guy isaac smiled he told me he got to his feet lifted the briefcase petra said all right im glad we cleared the air me too they left her apartment stepped out into the warm june air twentyfive hours until the killing hour i meant what i said before isaac you really are the hero on the other hand if i hadnt spotted the pattern you never would have had to worry about it yeah ignorance can be bliss she said but i like it better this way chapter thursday june pm plexitech inc westridge hills advanced industrial park westlake village the plastics fabricator a massive white windowless hatbox two miles north of the freeway was ringed by an open unguarded asphalt lot the space was halffilled with cars and trucks and vans lots of empty slots in random places the first few rows provided a nice clear diagonal view of the smaller brick structure across the street sandcolored brick mirrored windows cursory landscaping black block lettering above the mirrored front door pacific dynamics kurt doebblers workplace was less welcoming than its looming neighbor wroughtiron fencing surrounded the property a slotkey parking arm bisected the entry you could walk under but no drivethrough no front parking either a driveway snaked down to the left of the building and continued around to the west side once doebblers infiniti made the turn no visual access damn petra was wondering about rear entry to the building when doebblers tall angular form appeared at the top of the drive walking slowly almost tentatively on long thin legs he wore a shortsleeved palegreen shirt brown slacks white running shoes dunkin donuts bag in one hand steel attaché case in the other with his blackframed glasses and looselimbed shamble the guy was a walking promo for the nerd channel nothing humorously quirky about this nerd she watched as doebbler strode over to pacific dynamics front door and walked in that was at ninethirty am it was five hours later and nothing had happened and petra and eric remained at opposite ends of the plexitech lot drinking coffee chewing on the dry sandwiches shed packed communication was cell phone speeddials a couple of those nifty hardtojam twoway radios the department had just stocked up on wouldve been nice an officially sanctioned departmental investigation of kurt doebbler wouldve been nice hot sunny day this far west chemical smell in the air and despite the heat the sky was sheathed by a sickly gray cloud cover shed phoned eric at his folks home last night just before midnight after dropping isaac at home the kid was clearly dejected about being excluded from the stakeout but pulled it off with grace once this was over shed fix the misunderstanding over flaco jaramillo at first eric didnt pick up and she wondered if hed gone to sleep early normally he was a night owl but the reverend bob and mrs stahl retired early so maybe hed conformed sleeping in his boyhood room in the modest camarillo ranch house the pennants and poster and athletic trophies his parents had held on to the military medals hed wanted to throw out arranged on a corkboard by mom just as she was about to hang up he said hi did i wake you no im up sorry to pull you away but june seems to have clicked she told him about otto retzak doebblers reenacting hundredyearold murders he said when do you need me the next day the two of them met up at six fortyfive am at a taco stand on reseda boulevard one mile north of ventura a fiveminute drive to doebblers house on rosita eric a stranger to the quarry was the obvious choice as the up close he headed north in his jeep found the palegray traditional continued up the street and uturned into a treeshaded watchspot sitting low at the wheel shielded by windows tinted way darker than the legal limit quiet block a few sleek women jogged by and latemodel foreign sedans pulled out of driveways as men in suits left for work the jeep was black unobtrusive a perfect match for the neighborhood if anyone asked eric had several alternative stories ready police id if it came to that it didnt petra was stationed just south of ventura pulled over to the east curb ready to tail doebbler if he headed for the or turned either way onto the boulevard a left turn was most likely pacific dynamics was sixteen miles west at eightfifteen eric called in doebbler and the daughter are getting into the infiniti hes backing out driving east unless her school is somewhere up in the hills he should be passing you soon ill have a quick look around the back of the house and catch up with you minutes later doebblers champagnecolored sedan cruised through a green light at ventura petra let two more cars pass before she pulled out and followed doebbler bypassed the freeway continued north until riverside turned left drove four blocks then hung a right three more blocks and the infiniti was pulling into a line of cars facing west valley comprehensive preparatory academy a rentacop directed the slowmoving motor queue no sign of eric shed call and let him know where she was but just as she started to punch in the speedcode she spotted a black jeep in her rearview someone elses no the blackout windows and the dusty grille meant eric he passed her without acknowledgment drove past the motor queue faded from view petra parked and kept her eye on doebbler the infiniti was easy to spot lone sedan in a stopandgo parade of fourwheelers trim wellcoiffed moms in toobig motorized behemoths dropped off wellfed kids in school uniforms as they talked into cell phones white shirts for the student body olive pants for the boys oliveplaid skirts for the girls a strawberry blonde in a blue volvo c drove past emily pastern at the wheel two kids in the back of the convertible petra sank lower the rentacop waved doebbler inched forward west valley comprehensive prep was a small place with a big name what looked to be four fiftiesera apartments converted into a school a stingy grassy area in the center the whole thing behind high iron fencing the kids hunched under oversized backpacks were all white with a high proportion of blonds the infiniti made it to the gate and katya doebbler tall for her age her straight dark hair pulled into a ponytail got out and walked through the schools gates without a word or a backward glance at her father sadlooking kid soon shed be a lot sadder doebbler pulled into the street and continued up the block a second later eric called its a culdesac im going to hang back ill pick him up said petra emily pastern unloaded her brood and got out to talk to another mother petra shifted into drive ready for doebbler she caught a glimpse of the bastard as he sailed by oblivious sitting tall staring straight ahead bespectacled sharpjawed expressionless both hands on the wheel the perfect tenthree driving position lawabiding citizen back on reseda a commuter rush curdled the two blocks just north of ventura boulevard but eric managed to regain the numberone position and when doebbler made his westward turn the jeep was three cars behind both vehicles rolling along in the slow lane from the center lane five cars back petra watched as eric maintained a steady tail unobtrusive to the point of invisible his style was silky effortless a surveillance ballet that never lost sight of the quarry her man had grace her man she laughed out loud didnt like the sound of that and said oh shut up doebbler turned the trip to westlake village into a leisurely slowlane cruise staying on ventura giving every amber light the benefit of the doubt allowing other motorists to cut in and pass making full stops for pedestrians getting busted for a traffic violation wouldnt do not when you had big plans for tonight half a mile short of his work address doebbler pulled into a dunkin donuts got out and ordered emerged with a bag junkfood breakfast whoda thunk he returned to his car with that same robotface scary did it all come down to weird wiring doebbler looked around briefly got back in the infiniti resumed his leisurely exploration of the broad sunwashed western tip of the valley five hours eighteen minutes of boredom in all that time two interruptions at tenforty eric crossed the street to pacific dynamics and walked under the parking arm retracing the infinitis path he walked down the westside driveway and was gone for ten minutes when he popped back up at petras window he said loading dock bolted from the outside doesnt appear to be in active use the lots aboveground one levels interior the tops out in the open doebblers parked on top if he drives out hell have to come back the way he went in what about on foot fifteenandahalffoot block wall at the back on the other sides some kind of warehouse unless hes a rockclimber theres no alternative exit he leaves we see him at elevenfifty petra left for a muchneeded bathroom break driving all the way back to ventura before she found an accommodating dennys picking up some fries for fortification as long as she was at it some for eric too and she hazarded a sprint to the jeep to give it to him moments later right after shed settled back in her own car thirtythree people exited pacific dynamics in small chatty groups got into their cars and drove away twentyfive men mostly in shirtsleeves like doebbler eight woman equally casual lunchtime no sign of the quarry maybe hes eating donuts said petra carboloading for his big night erics voice through the phone was soft working at his desk would fit a compulsive personality which could apply to eric and her she glanced two aisles up where the jeep was parked kind of weird having to talk to you this way how about some phone sex sure he said but only as prep for the real thing by threetwenty doebbler still hadnt appeared just to be sure they hadnt missed something eric called his work number doebbler picked up and eric said mr doebbler yes this is dwayne hickham from new jersey life have you considered term click friendly fellow said petra eric didnt answer at three fiftythree her phone squawked her butt was sore she had a hungerheadache and her bladder was bursting the scene through her windshield was a damned oil painting what could eric have to

work shortly before midnight two blocks from her destination someone hooked an arm around her neck pulled her down onto the street turned her over onto her stomach and began kicking at her ribs then

collects public assistance she rarely ventures out of her apartment poor thing fraulein wiegeland had a reputation as a wild girl and our men suspected a former lover a pastry baker with a drinking problem the two of them had engaged in public arguments but the man was able to account for his whereabouts and the crime was never solved i have confirmed that your mr doebbler and his family were living at the army base during that time period how many blows were delivered to the head said petra one said bandorffer our boy bashes his victims repeatedly said petra perhaps he panicked being young and inexperienced if it was your boy twentyfour years ago kurt doebbler had been eighteen the creepo had come across the teller book as an adolescent and something had twisted up inside him raging hormones sexual confusion a kink in some nerve fiber lord knew what else plotting and planning but unable to pull off his virgin murder had he dealt with failure by pulling back until eighteen years later or just the opposite other cities other junes the thought was sickening either way martas cheating had been a catalyst stoking or restoking the fires she said thank you inspector my pleasure detective please let me know if you come up with a solution bandorffer hung up petra thought isaac had nailed it again chapter thursday june pm room casa figueroa motor inn figueroa near jefferson boulevard this is lovely said klara she rolled the bedcovers down to her waist ran her hands over soft white spreading breasts pinched her own pink nipple and watched with satisfaction as it inflated reaching over to the chipped nightstand she lifted her wineglass and sipped fifteendollar bottle of chardonnay shed insisted on paying isaac lay on his back next to her staring up at cottage cheese plasterspray studying the brown stain where the airconditioning vent had leaked brown inkblot like a rorschach isnt it said klara wetting her finger with wine and tracing it along his upper lip lovely he nodded in his position that meant bobbing at the ceiling she leaned over and chewed his earlobe you were a bit more enthusiastic five minutes ago my dear you were more than enthusiastic volcanic id say isaac smiled the brown stain had a definite shape two bears a large one and a small one facing off or dancing what did that say about his unconscious my personal vesuvius said klara she reached down ready for another eruption isaacs member was sore and his neck ached but klara had all kinds of skills and the second time ended up being fine afterward she said shower time and sashayed into the tiny motel bathroom flaunting the fullness of her body unfazed by slackness of waist drooping bosom the occasional clot of cellulite he liked her better for that and when she yelled come on in he complied and when she pulled him under the spray for a deep kiss he didnt mind at all the shower stall was prefab fiberglass just like the one at home but not as clean klara soaped him with enthusiasm positioned his hands all over her slick dolphin softness threw back her head and laughed into the water pretend its a waterfall she said somewhere exotic just the two of us she shampooed her hair with a travel bottle shed brought rinsed squeezed her red hair dry and wrapped it in a towel they returned to the queensized bed with its coinslotted electric fingers gadget bolted to the fake wood headboard tawdry isaac was surprised at how much he liked that somehow he wasnt sure when the transition had occurred hed turned into someone else the person he imagined when he made love to her horny latin stud bunking down with a willing flamehaired woman trysting in a cheesy claustrophobic room with cigarette burns along the curtain hems the odors of sin and beer and instant

vibrating bed and a hershey bar that she broke in half dessert mdear they both ate candy fattening said klara licking chocolate from her lips but loaded with good stuff too like antioxidants we deserve some fun solving a big case like that shed found him at six pm down in the stacks working on his data and trying not to think of what petra was doing marching right up to him she took his hand and slipped it under her dress no panties isaacs face got hot she knew she had him and grinned pack your books sir were out of here they watched twenty minutes of an atrocious show on usa network as klara combed out her hair at the commercial break she said time to go home sweetie domestic obligations and all that well do this again her tongue thrust between his lips sweet with chocolate sooner rather than later as isaac walked her to her car she said it really is fantastic the way we solved all those murders i mean just think of it isaac people like us book people turning out to be the real detectives youre the master sleuth klara she slapped his shoulder lightly of course im not i was merely the tool of your intellect they reached her car and she rested her head on his shoulder sensing that she needed more praise he said klara i couldnt have done anything without you she stood there pressed against him in the dim tacky motel parking lot finally she straightened and unlocked her car i read it again she said that horrible little book she shuddered how could anyone be so evil isaac shrugged i mean it she said how do you explain something like that retzak claimed he was abused lots of people are abused but they dont end up like that true she took his hand played with his fingers i know you need to be discreet and all but was that guy the one the police are focusing on abused because thered have to be parallels right between him and retzak otherwise why imitate retzak and not just do his own thing i dont know he said dont know much about him well she said one thing we do know hes evil and youve made a major contribution to getting him off the streets the police will do that hopefully theyll be competent she said because i have to tell you i havent always found that to be the case one time years ago there was a burglary in my neighborhood one of my neighbors a woman living alone and all the police did was fill out reports the detective on this case is great said isaac sounding defensive klara said i hope he is anyway when you can tell me more please do the whole thing fascinates me i was a history major at smith but ive always been curious about psychology about what transforms people its the greatest mystery of all right she touched his cheek one day youll be a physician not a psychiatrist but who knows maybe youll get closer to figuring it out right now id be satisfied finishing my dissertation youll finish youve got character and people with character finish what they begin she opened her car door took his face in both her hands i believe in you isaac gomez i dont love you never will but i sure like you a lot can we be friends we already are her eyes moistened then the right one winked time to go home and be a mom but ill be thinking about volcanoes chapter thursday june pm the doebbler residence rosita avenue tarzana hes here erics whisper barely filtered through the phone doing what said petra reading a magazine and doing hand exercises hand exercises with a springgrip while he reads getting in shape for his big night any weapon in sight no he probably keeps it in one of the cars she said what about katya not here shes probably upstairs the day i interviewed him she stayed up there the whole time he look tense not really normal demeanor expressionless said eric thats normal for him she clicked off and her cell phone went dark two lines on the gizmo but only one was open on vibrator mode and only for eric after too many interruptions by telemarketers she and eric had decided to have all calls but theirs forwarded to their land phones it took a bit of doing but they shared the same cellular carrier and by eightthirty they were functionally locked in every half hour each of them checked for messages to make sure they didnt miss anything the last time had been ten minutes ago a couple of junkers and a call from her brother brad nothing urgent he just wanted to say hi shed deal with that tomorrow after all this was over shifting in the drivers seat she drank bottled water popped a couple of skittles maintained her visual fix on the gray house determined this time to spot eric as he emerged from the backyard and returned to his jeep she was fifteen yards from doebblers front door facing west the jeep was a ways up just out of view aimed east no matter which direction doebbler took someone would be ready to pick him up a few trees but good visibility on the dark street and fences prevented escape from one property to the next doebbler would have to show himself ten plus hours of nothing petras brain was starting to crumble from disuse at fourthirty pm kurt doebbler had left pacific dynamics along with a slew of other employees after picking up a dominos pizza he drove to katyas school made it just before five at that hour west valley comprehensive prep looked closed but doebblers bellring brought a sullen katya to the gate accompanied by a grayhaired female teachertype who let the girl out some kind of afterschool daycare thing the teacher smiled and said something to doebbler who left without responding no conversation between father and daughter as they headed for the infiniti katyas backpack looked stuffed doebbler made no attempt to carry it for her the infiniti headed straight home arrived at five twentysix doebbler walked to the door with that dorky stride of his stayed several feet ahead of katya remotelocked the vehicle without glancing back the girl hurried to catch up and he did hold the door for her as she entered the house he collected his mail from the box bolted next to the door stood outside shuffling through envelopes not a glance up the street as he stepped inside and closed the door why would he be nervous hed pulled it off six years in a row since then no sign of him or the girl and both of doebblers cars remained in the driveway at nine oclock petra and eric agreed that someone should have a look from the backyard just to make sure the quarry hadnt managed to sneak out on foot someone was eric petras watch read hed been back there eight minutes still hadnt emerged had something engaged him her phone vibrated me again where are you back in the car i was looking for you how the hell do you do that do what mr invisible i just walked sure you did master ninja making light of it but failing to spot him bugged her despite her determination to focus had her mind wandered god she hated stakeouts the erosion of iq what kept you there so long watching anything new no hell would be an infinity of stakeouts they cut the connection and petra ate more candy braindeath and tooth decay a minimum of two and half hours to killtime and doebbler was sitting in his easy chair reading a magazine and flexing his hands what the latest edition of modern murderer working on his grip strength maybe that meant he was getting edgy two and a half hours had he planned so well that there was no need to leave any earlier preselecting the prey a nurse someone who took care of children maybe with lung disease maybe an italian girl if he was imitating retzak that closely shed already confirmed that no hospital remained in elysian park when it came to kids the first thing you thought of was western pediatrics medical center back in hollywood not that far from the park she could see it appealing to doebbler at this hour western peds was at least a halfhour freeway ride from tarzana probably longer so doebbler was really cutting it close petra knew the hospitals shift schedule because billy straight had been taken there and shed spent plenty of time at his bedside afternoons three to eleven meaning day nurses would be heading for their cars between eleven and eleventhirty as the night shift arrived lots of women walking to and from the outdoor lots shabby side streets east hollywood not the greatest area and security was lax but in all her time at hollywood division she hadnt heard of any serious problems with all those women how would doebbler pick a victim hed picked already five minutes passed ten fifteen still no movement from the gray house a trip to hollywood seemed increasingly unlikely so she was probably wrong about western peds okay there had to be lots of pediatric units all over the city with the time ticking away doebbler had probably aimed closer to home somewhere right here in the valley northridge hospital was a fifteenminute drive even less with no traffic did northridge nurses follow the same schedule as the western peds staff speeddialing eric she let him know her line would be busy for a few minutes and made the call the northridge night clerk confirmed it three to eleven more than enough time for doebbler to get over there she had no idea how the parking was laid out at northridge no confidence the site would be northridge the valley was a big place when doebbler made his move shed have to improvise didnt it always come down to that chapter thursday june pm the gomez residence union district from the upper bunk came the sound of isaiahs snoring loud and intrusive as a leaf blower the eldest gomez brother had come home late and exhausted in a foul mood that silenced the rest of the family flinging his work clothes on the floor hed lurched straight to bed tar reek bittered the room along with alcohol isaac would keep that to himself no reason to upset mama on the other side of the celllike space joel slept on his air mattress eyes closed chest rising and falling slowly a smile on his almostpretty face a maddeningly cheerful bundle of libido and superficiality joel would always be happy isaac sapped from his motel time with klara had eaten lightly and fallen asleep quickly his dream cycle was frantic and ambiguous in the midst of an abstract expressionist nightmare he woke drenched with sweat and disoriented the din from the top bunk told him where he was god bless isaiahs deviated septum now he was wide awake trying not to think about klara but of course thinking of nothing else not the things shed done something shed said there would have to be parallels otherwise why imitate retzak an eccentric woman probably neurotic woman but smart too smart to be ignored and now isaac was sweating for another reason a big fat balloon of denial punctured its out of your hands petra knows what shes doing reaching out for the wooden crate that served as his nightstand he got hold of his watch less than an hour to showdown soon it would be over would it he closed his eyes and the facts loomed larger discrepancies impossible to ignore sliding out of the bunk he found his briefcase tiptoed across the closetsized space isaiah moved and bedsprings squeaked a mumbled whu isaac left the bedroom closing the door silently and went into the kitchen hoping his parents in the neighboring room wouldnt hear him his mother in particular had the sleep rhythms of a chihuahua switching on the dim light under the stove he sat and thought decided he wasnt being psychotic pulling his laptop out of the case and plugging it in shifting the ragwrapped gun in the process he rummaged some more and finally came up with his seldomused modem connecting the box to the corner phone jack behind the table he booted up and hoped for the best hed set up the modem years ago but rarely used it no reason to given highspeed access on campus the apartments phone wires were eroded and chancy even if he got a line making it to the internet would be an infuriatingly slow ordeal neanderthal dialup what a joke spoiled boy scared boy the modem squawked stopped made more noise his mother padded in rubbing her eyes whatre you doing studying at this hour i thought of something what my research its not important ma if its not important you should go back to sleep she blinked couldnt focus go back to sleep you dont sleep enough in a few minutes ma its my doctoral research it cant wait until tomorrow no ma go back to sleep the modem buzzed and hummed and beeped kept chirping its little modem song interminable whats that said his mother the thing that connects to the internet whys it plugged in there im using our phone line what if someone calls no ones going to call mama she looked at the stove ill fix you something to eat no he raised his voice and she gave a start he got up and placed an arm around her shoulder no thank you ma really im fine i she looked around the kitchen he guided her back to her room wasnt sure shed really been awake when he returned to the kitchen table the connection had been completed and he logged on to his university server scanning his bookmarks he found the chat room text hed saved began retracing cybersteps five minutes later his heart was pounding so hard it felt as if it would rip through his rib cage online host you are in bloodngutschat

machine he talked to it trying not to sound weak or scared or frantic guessing that hed failed would she call home for messages why would she busy on stakeout thinking she knew the clock on the stove said pkasso rushing back to his room he looked for his shoes couldnt find them felt around under the bunk finally got hold of the right loafer then its mate hed gone to sleep in a tshirt and sweatpants no socks that would have to do shoes in hand he ran toward the door isaiah sat up what the sweet dreams bro where goin out down on the floor joel rolled to the wall rolled back smiled isaiah said goin out for more pussy isaac closed the door on both of them isaiah owned a pickup truck that needed an engine the sole operating gomez vehicle was the intermittently operant toyota corolla papa chanced driving to work papas keys dangled from a plastic frog screwed to the wall next to the fridge the car was just back from the shop new filters of some sort isaac slipped the ignition key off his fathers ring began sneaking across the kitchen feeling like a burglar before he stopped minor omission he corrected that left chapter thursday june pm the doebbler residence rosita avenue tarzana youre sure said petra eric had just returned from another look behind the house this time shed seen him emerge the faintest black smudge against the indigo valley night hed probably showed himself on purpose to make her feel good no more magazine he was watching tv i couldnt get an angle to see the screen at eleven sharp he got up turned off the light went upstairs less than an hour to go both of doebblers cars were in place youre sure theres no way he can leave from behind steep hillside up to the neighbors property then wroughtiron fencing anythings possible but if its possible we need to worry about it little miss shrew before she could apologize eric said want me to go back there and stay that would mean no twoway view of the street but maybe just tell me what do you think tough call he said this doesnt feel right eric even if the killspots some closeby clinic hes cutting it too close hes compulsive would take his time setting it up maybe hes preparing right now in his head maybe she said okay look go back there if nothing happens within ten fifteen minutes im marching up to the front and ringing the bell no response you think its a bad idea no he said im on my way right now chapter thursday june pm vermont avenue one block south of pico the toyota stalled again third time in a mile isaac shifted into neutral coasted into the right lane as cars sped around him depressing the clutch then releasing as he gassed he tried to revive the ignition a sputter a nanosecond of panic and the puny engine was chugging again pausing on the brink of death resuscitating barely freakin piece of junk so much for montalvo his fathers friend the alleged mechanic or maybe it was his own fault poor stickshift skills it had been a long time since hed gotten behind the wheel he snailcrawled north on vermont struggling to keep the gas flow even anticipating lights and working at minimizing unnecessary stops and starts halfmoon night pebbled lunar light filtering through neon and smog and humidity no shortage of activity on vermont at this hour rainbows of neon in spanish then korean then spanish again the car wheezed steadily past darkened buildings that alternated with the flash and buzz of bars and liquor stores and clubs asian kids milling around the betterlooking clubs nice clothing souped up wheels that worked the confident smiles of affluent youth then back to the workingclass mexican and salvadoran joints vamos a bailar english was his language his passport to some suburban xanadu but sometimes he dreamed in spanish mostly he didnt dream music poured out of a raunchylooking danceplace as he puttputted by the gaiety didnt seem right for killing time neither did the weather warm night a pleasant breeze maybe this wasnt killing time had to be no it didnt look how wrong hed been pkasso even if something was going to happen tonight hed almost certainly embarked on a fools mission heading for a destination based on theory and the cold flat religion that was logic the single best deduction given the facts but what did facts mean chances were he was wrong yet again dreadfully tragically wrong at third street the toyota sputtered and threatened to die once more holding his breath he pressed down gently on the accelerator and the damn thing relented he made it to fourth beverly idiotic and quixotic but what else could he do petras cell was still transferred some police thing for sure what the cops called a tactical line and contacting anyone else at the department was out of the question would bring the cops looking for him fourfifteen mental case male hispanic heading north on vermont in a moribund clunker he passed melrose just another couple of miles and then what hed park at a safe distance proceed on foot check out the layout and find some kind of vantage point playing detective the object of his guess western pediatrics hospital the one place you could count on a slew of nurses who took care of children hed rotated through western peds as a premed sophomore introduced by a bio professor who wanted aspiring physicians to see what health care was really like isaac had found the hospital a wonderful terrifying place brimming with compassion frantic activity the saddest stories of all the bigeyed stares of very sick kids bald heads waxy skin sticklimbs tethered to iv lines hed decided then and there that pediatrics wasnt for him now he was headed back there on a return trip so terribly asinine it made him tremble the car made a retching noise isaacs body lurched backward as the vehicle accelerated spontaneously he maintained shaky control rolled through an intersection just south of santa monica violated a boulevard stop and narrowly avoided being pulverized by a housesized supermarket truck the truckers klaxon rage filled his ears as he kept going two seconds later the toyota gave up on foot jogging the halfmile to sunset staying in the darkness close to buildings so as not to attract attention male mental case running north he reached his destination by eleven fortythree slowed his pace and stayed on the south side of the boulevard as he ambled toward the big blocky buildings of the hospital complex most of the structures were dark the western peds logo a pair of blueandwhite clasped hands glowed from the top of the main building he remained in the shadows as women mostly young women in white and pale pink and pastel blue and canary yellow uniforms streamed out of several doors and crossed sunset only twenty or so nurses stragglers at the end of the day shift if through some miracle he was right the bastard would be watching but from where isaac watched the nurses arrive at a sign that said staff parking arrows pointed both ways and the group split into two most of the women headed west a few east two lots which way he thought it out if doebbler were here hed want things as quiet as possible east he followed five distant female shapes down a surprisingly dim street shabby apartment buildings not unlike his own lined the journey half a block north sat a twolevel parking structure dark the nurses walked right past the cement tiers and as isaac got close to the structure he saw the chained entrance the sign hanging from the mesh gate earthquake retrofitting due for completion august the nurses kept going twenty more feet thirty fifty nearly to the end of the block another sign too distant to read but isaac made out cars in dirt he sped up temporary staff parking highintensity lights bleached the rear righthand corner of the outdoor lot the left fixture was out and half the space was a belt of black poor maintenance or a predators move the slim chance of the latter gave isaac hope hed guessed right stupid hope the city was filled with scores of other health facilities many of which treated children how many treated lung diseases he had no idea this was worse than angelsonapinhead academic theorizing this was wild guesswork primed for the worst kind of error he crossed the street and slipped between two apartment buildings feeling the softness of weeds beneath his feet smelling the stink of dog shit home sweet home he stepped back another foot made sure he had a long but clear view of the dirt lot for all he knew doebbler was watching from a nearby spot could hear his raspy breathing he silenced himself watched the five nurses head for their cars some highlighted by the functioning light fixture others slipping into invisibility the dark side would have to be it if ififififififififif chapter june pm the doebbler residence tarzana petra said im going to the front want me to stay back here said eric yeah removing her gun from her purse she got out of her car paused for a moment to steady her breathing crossed to doebblers front door hand on the glock ready for anything the queasy feeling in her bowels told her anything could happen this was wrong how could she have been that off she rang the bell nothing a repeat ring elicited silence too maybe doebbler had somehow managed to get out without eric or her seeing him fooling her she could see but eric she rang a third time nothing she called him no response here same scratch that hes coming down the stairs switching on the landing light bathrobe and pajamas looks like you woke him hes pissed weapon not that i see okay hes headed to the front im coming around kurt doebblers voice behind the door demanded who is it police detective connor petra had backed a few feet away behind her concealed by bushes eric waited she could smell him such a good smell no answer from doebbler petra repeated her name i heard you could you please open up sir why please open why police business what kind of business homicide the door swung open and doebbler stared down at her long arms crossed over a white terry bathrobe sleeves too short for his big bony hands huge hands under the robe were striped pajamas big bare veiny feet his gray hair was mussed without his glasses he was less nerdy not that badlooking in a coldeyed angular way petras eyes were level with the robes shawl lapel she noticed a small sienna spot on the right side that could be dried blood her eyes climbed and she saw the shaving nick on doebblers neck three nicks scabbed old kurt a little nervous this morning planning for something that hed decided to cancel because he knew he was being watched how had he known sir she said may i come in you he said more contempt in that single word than petra had believed possible he blocked the doorway petra said in for the evening sir doebbler pushed hair away from his forehead sweaty forehead shadows under his eyes his arms twitched and for a second petra thought hed close the door on her she moved forward ready to block him he watched her and frowned she repeated the question in for the evening he said as opposed to going out why would i be going out well she said in a few minutes itll be june doebbler went white youre sick he braced himself against the doorpost with one hand tall enough that the contact was inches from the top im not going out he said some of us work and take care of children some of us do our job with minimal competence muttering something petra was nearly certain was imbecile may i come in sir come in to your house to talk for a little social visit said doebbler he managed a smile detached all mouth no eyes knitted his big hands and cracked his knuckles and stared down at her past her through her the way he had the first time the way emily pastern and sarah casagrande had been stared through a cool dry snake slithered down petras spine and she was glad eric was backing her up she smiled back at doebbler he slammed the door in her face chapter friday june am rodney avenue temporary eastern staff parking lot western pediatrics hospital isaac watched the digital numerals of his watch click into place the ultimate numerical reproach all the day shift nurses gone unlike another nurse somewhere a darkhaired girl maybe italian he imagined what was being done to her and the starch went out of his spine and he hunched like an old man he stayed in place not knowing what else to do kept staring at the dirt lot three cars on the illuminated side two maybe three parked in darkness it was hard to tell probably nightshifters whod arrived early but if that was the case why so few no big puzzle the staff obviously preferred the western lot probably better lighting anyone who arrived early nabbed a space there hed give it another five minutes then hed return to where hed left his fathers toyota parked along vermont hed forgotten to lock it what had dad left inside not much dad was neat a set of work clothes folded on the backseat probably some papers in the glove compartment hopefully nothing worth stealing would the car even be there if it wasnt how would he explain it to his parents the five minutes passed reluctant to face reality he lingered at twelvenineteen feeling like the idiot he was he slipped out from his hiding spot and began walking south voices from sunset made him stop female voices three women small women youngsounding women passed the chained cement parking structure and entered the dirt lot isaac hurried back to his spot watched them white uniforms dark hair pulled into ponytails tiny women filipinas they chattered gaily paused ten feet into the lot one nurse veered into the light the other two crossed into the darkened area no danger there doebbler wouldnt go for a pair would want his prey alone the litup nurse started up her minivan and drove away a set of headlights went on in the dark side and a zippy little sports car a yellow mazda rx sped out making that distinctive rotary sound leaving one nurse he waited for more headlights darkness silence had he missed something a rear exit as he stepped closer to the sidewalk a low mulish sound cut into the night the futile whine of an engine refusing to turn over a car door opened shut then a scream reaching into his pocket isaac ran the gun caught in the generous fleece of his sweatpants and refused to pull free he picked up his pace shouted stop screamed it louder ripped frantically at his pocket the gun was hopelessly tangled he reached the lot sprinted across black dirt unable to see anything homing in on the site of the scream then he saw a man a very tall man wearing a long white coat a doctors coat standing over a tiny prone woman she lay on her stomach one of the mans feet pressed down in the center of her back pinning her like a butterfly on a board she struggled in the dirt arms and legs effecting an earthbound breaststroke cried out again the man reached into his coat drew out something the size and girth of a baseball bat not wood translucent a thick rod of clear plastic slick dense that would explain the lack of fibers in the wounds stop analyzing idiot and do something isaac raced toward the tall man out of his mouth came a strange voice hoarse bellowing stop motherfucker or ill shoot your ass the man in the white coat maintained his foothold on the tiny darkhaired woman pretty woman isaac could see her terrified face now young maybe even younger than him not filipina latina or maybe she was italian stop he was three feet away still struggling with the gun the tall man mustve pressed down harder on the girls cheek because her features compressed and her mouth was forced shut eating dust she choked coughed isaac ripped at the pocket fuckingidiotfuckingclown the man faced him translucent truncheon held diagonally across his chest very tall broadshouldered powerful plaid shirt and jeans and sneakers under the white coat those shoes would leave marks in the dirt but thad doebbler was a careful man an artist he would be sure to clean them up when he was through handsome man with the confidence that tall handsome men acquire easily undeterred by isaacs goofy presence he knew he could handle a fool like this hey he said isaac said pkasso doebblers grin died the cudgel caught filmy moonlight and gleamed isaacs battle with his pocket continued all told seconds of struggle but it felt like years suppressing panic he stopped analyzed felt around some metal piece on the gun maybe a rough spot on the barrel was snagged on fleece threads the key was to free it with a circular movement rather than fight and twist it tighter thad doebbler his foot still on the girls back stepped forward with his free leg long leg big stride the motion brought him within two feet of isaacs head striking distance he lifted the weapon and isaac danced back while yanking his pants upward tight around the crotch hed given himself a fucking wedgie and thad doebbler laughed see me now petra idiotclownidiotclown the little dark girl moaned in pain thad doebbler closed another few inches of the space between him and isaac isaac said let her go or ill shoot you i mean it thad doebbler regarded isaac with amusement with what your little dick isaac yanked the gun free stepped within the downward arc of thad doebblers murderous arm dodged the crushing blow by inches and managed to maintain his balance as he aimed upward for the handsome face he pressed the trigger shut his eyes involuntarily and kept pressing chapter monday july upper rockridge district oakland california residence of thornton thad doebbler a historian thad a renaissance man of sorts website designer graphic artist alternative comix illustrator computer animator sculptor in lucite and polymer resins and spaceage plastics abstract stuff not to petras taste but she was forced to admit that his work showed talent serpentine twists of translucent rods imbedded with polychrome fiberoptic filaments good eye for balance and composition last year hed exhibited across the bay in san francisco at a post street gallery two to three grand per piece and three had sold pkasso him and omar her year for artists bundles of spare lucite rods in various sizes were stacked neatly in doebblers garage the largest size conformed to the june skull compressions when shed met him at his brothers hed claimed his home base as san francisco but his digs were in oakland nice part of town a cute little mock tudor on a hill landscaped prettily no bay view but a treeframed rectangle of the oakland hills was visible from the secondfloor bedroom nothing in the bedroom but clothing a few truecrime paperbacks and a tv on a card table the rest of the house was similarly spartan attached to the garage out back was a fourhundredsquarefoot windowless cinderblock addon secured by a bolted steel door thad doebblers tracklit studio thad doebblers museum a man of parts thad more useful to petra a damned egomaniac and compulsive chronicler of his own dark side twentyfour years of dark side the guy had kept every playbill airline ticket and receipt cataloged compulsively within moments petra was able to verify his quarterly flights to la but petra already knew that uncle thad stayed with older brother kurt and niece katya in the house on rosita bunking down in a spare bedroom next to katyas where he kept a few pairs of pants three shirts a leather jacket and a black italian sports coat nothing of obvious forensic value until the techies managed to scrape tiny little stains from two of the shirts and a jeans leg that had somehow managed to survive laundering and pressing maybe it was kurt doebblers inefficient balky kenmore washing machine a contraption characterized by solemneyed katya as crap it leaks all the time and never really cleans stuff the way you want it dagger eyes at dad kurt had flinched finally some emotion ill get a new one katie you always say that three of the stains were too degraded for dna analysis one was a perfect match to marta doebbler another fit coral langdons genetic makeup a third matched that of navy ensign darren ares hochenbrenner petra had made it to the scene after hearing about it on her scanner hearing it during the debacle at kurt doebblers house when she got there isaac was being treated like a suspect by two hollywood ds who didnt know him well enough hed dropped councilman gilbert reyess name and that of deputy chief randy diaz finally someone called diaz who drove up in a corvette dressed in black velvet sweats and twohundreddollar running shoes just in time for petra to grab him and brief him the kid solved it sir she spat out details diaz said impressive think hell share credit with the department i dont think credit matters to him said petra hes a good kid a great kid i vouch for him absolutely diaz smiled probably thinking she was in no shape to vouch for anyone thats big of you detective he earned it isaac using an illegal gun to kill thad could be a problem they agreed diaz said it can be dealt with long searching look of petras face so can your issues detective if everyones discreet therere going to be some changes in your division id like them to be smooth what changes diaz put a finger over his lips walked over to isaac the following night petra flew to oakland and sunday morning accompanied by a friendly oakland d named arvin ludd she began the first of two solid days in the cinderblock trove finding the best stuff in a doublewide black filing cabinet a folder marked travel beautiful penmanship ol thad hed filled three muslinbound madeinfrance notebooks with detailed accounts of murderous fantasies initiated at age twelve the melding of sex and violence and power solidified by a chance encounter with a copy of the teller booklet found in a hamburg antiques store retzak is me and i am him i dont know why people like us are what we are we just are i like it after that a lifetime of converting fantasy to reality thad described his failure to murder the german cakeicer gudrun wiegeland as an understandable lapse given my youth and inexperience plus a modicum but only that of anxiety at the time of the wiegeland bludgeoning with a crowbar borrowed from the base autoshop hed been a sixteenyearold army brat two years younger than ever pedestrian kurt perhaps thads anxiety had been higher than he was willing to admit by his own account it took another eight years for him to try another murder after a twoyear stint in the army most of it spent as a layout editor for a military newspaper in manila thad moved to pittsburgh and enrolled in carnegiemellon as an art and design major andy warhols alma mater they told me he drew shoes for newspapers ads i am a good deal more conceptual soon after graduation he waylaid an eighteenyearold coed named randi corey as she enjoyed a latenight campus jog june the spring semester had ended but corey had remained for the summer to practice with a gymnastic coach thad doebbler had stayed in town to murder her the girl incurred three crushing blows to the back of her skull and according to a newspaper clipping thad had mounted in volume of his chronicles was likely to remain in a persistent vegetative state when i cracked her open i did manage to get a look at the gelatin but not much the bones wouldnt give when i tried to pry them apart then i heard someone coming and skedaddled it was two days later that i learned id once again inexplicably failed to exert enough pressure to snuff the soul candle i will not repeat that transgression two months later a fiftytwoyearold university maintenance man herbert lincoln succumbed to a fatal braining as he walked to his car in an offcampus lot from what petra could tell no connection had been made between the homicide and the attack on randi corey young woman older man some accordance with otto retzaks pattern but doebbler had veered from the june routine still in training the deviation hadnt muted his feelings of triumph i studied him as he leaked watched the spark leave his eyes and sketched the phases a wholer sense of completion cant be imagined sandwiched into the book were the drawings horrible because the bastard really could draw end of volume as petra put it aside and picked up the next notebook she made a mental note to try to locate the pittsburgh detectives whod worked corey and lincoln find out if the girl was still alive her family and lincolns would want to know she flipped the next book open arvin ludd said interesting if you like that kind of thing he smiled crossed

brown seaman usn brained near the docks thad doebbler has taken a threeday vacation in la jolla traveling solo staying at the la valencia hotel lovely a welldeserved splurge i saw dolphins from my window then sisterinlaw marta lover marta thad accounted the affair in prurient detail rhapsodizing equally about the release of martas pentup teutonic sexuality and the pleasure at demeaning ever pedestrian kurt henceforth referred to as ept during the threemonth adultery he traveled to la twelve times telling his brother that hed gotten an illustration job at a beverly hills ad agency in reality my job was waiting until ept had departed for his ever pedestrian employment then fucking martas brains out ah the irony in her marital bed shed start off pretending to be reluctant but always gave in she ended up being one hell of a screamer i decided it would be nice to hear different kinds of screams pouring out of her startingtopucker hausfrau mouth she was beginning to grow emotional and tiresome a neardisaster was averted when kurt returned home shortly after leaving to get a trade journal hed left near his recliner ept didnt even bother to come upstairs to say hi to m just collected his mag and left he has no social skills never did lucky for m and me as we were in the throes connected rather ahem deeply i placed a hand over her mouth and succeeded in not laughing myself after that marta insisted they tryst at motels over the hill in hollywood and west hollywood the downtown errands shed lied about to her friends when marta announced to thad that she loved him was ready to leave kurt and katya he decided to kill her he thought it out waited until her theater night phoned her cell from a nearby booth telling her he was just around the corner had planned a surprise meeting her at her car after the show hed booked a room at the hollywood roosevelt hotel a suite actually but now he wasnt feeling well chest pains probably nothing more than indigestion but he was going to drive himself over to the hollywood presbyterian emergency room just to make sure hed call her when he was through she freaked and insisted on taking him met him at her car before she knew it he was sitting behind the wheel driving away looking fine she said thought you were sick he laughed told her they were through she began sobbing wanted to know why begged to know why he parked on a dark side street took her in his arms kissed her shoved her away roughly and got out she went after him tried to hit him he got hold of her arm twisted shoved her to the ground and smashed the back of her skull with the lucite club hed concealed in his coat the specially stitched internal pocket hed fashioned good with his hands ol thad she whimpered stopped id had this woman at will knew her as intimately as one can know anyone yet her jelly was no different to me than any other nevertheless this jaunt solidified my goals this was the closest id come to ecstasy and to honoring the memory of that sage or something worth appreciating worth celebrating yearly feeling her emotions begin to click off petra read the rest of it quickly turned to the back of the notebook found the postmortem sketches of marta doebbler and the others something different about his portrait of marta something searching needy and adoring in the womans eyes dead but hed drawn her eyes full of life that evening in her room at the jack london inn she took a very long very hot bath watched court tv and managed to keep a room service cheeseburger down pleasant room white walls blue bedding rates higher than the department would normally compensate but shed found a good deal on the internet outside was activity the hotel was right in the heart of jack london square another time and place shed have explored tonight she had no intention of leaving until the airport ride tomorrow morning washing the burger down with a coke she went to the minibar studied the cute little bottles of booze and mixers contemplated the advisability of a homemade tanqueray and tonic decided against it her cell phone rattled on the nightstand still on vibrator she hadnt altered it since the stakeout at kurt doebblers another potential career disaster busting the door in rushing kurt and handcuffing him waking the poor daughter too exigent circumstances was her excuse deputy chief diaz said that made sense to him kurt doebbler lying pinioned on his living room floor had threatened to sue he wouldve mightve won big if not for his brothers bad behavior blood on the clothing in the closet kurt claimed he had no idea thad was sleeping with marta let alone using his house as a crash pad for his yearly murder jaunts probably telling the truth the clueless nerd but the das theatrical skepticism and the threat of bad publicity had led pacific dynamics to lean on kurt and hed backed off no harm no foul petra felt bad for katya but that was someone elses business maybe at some point shed call delaware about the kid no she wouldnt she was a cop not a social worker thad doebbler would never bash anyones brains out again case closed with a little help from a friend isaac a shooter his little gift from flaco jaramillo finally hed told her why a touch of deviousness in the kids makeup that she hadnt imagined thank god she picked up the phone studied the numerical readout hoped it was eric they had a dinner date tomorrow back in la big splurge at ivy at the shore intimations as much as eric was capable of intimating of serious talk career plans whatever the phone read out a number not eric but someone she didnt mind talking to hi she said hi said isaac hope im not bothering you not at all whats up i just thought id tell you i was by the station today and theres a new captain someone named stuart bishop he made a point of coming up to me said he knows you he seems friendly stu youre kidding is there a problem no said petra not at all no problem her mouth hung open unbelievable isaac said he seemed like a very decent person hes terrific used to be my partner until he left the department oh i guess hes back like eric stu had talked about going private unlike eric he had family money and connections that couldve led to the corporate world so now he was back in the department hed said nothing to lead her in that direction then again they hadnt talked in months back as a captain how had he pulled that off therell be changes in your division so thats good news for you said isaac id imagine so said petra talking through her grin howre you doing hero whens the

salcido was lucky cute little heather from brea california darkhaired bigeyed petite and twentythree cheerleaderpretty despite all those cheek abrasions a newly graduated rn shed worked pediatric pulmonary for less than a year still lived at home traditional family dad a retired sheriff mom a housewife one older brother a muchomacho chp motorcycle officer from the way the girl had gazed at isaac from her hospital bed from the way hed looked at her the kids relationship to the world of law enforcement might take on a whole new twist petra kept grinning no he said it was luck thats all then youre a lucky guy she said and i thank you for that i should thank you for teaching me so much my pleasure dr gomez one more thing the gun she said i its been logged into evidence as a legally registered firearm isaac registered to you last january you even merited a concealedweapon permit because of your law enforcement activities combined with living in a highcrime area as things turned out that was a good call wasnt it silence thanks he said sure she said now go have some fun chapter friday july pm leonards steak house eighth street and albany just west of downtown la isaac cut into his hangar steak big as a baseball mitt soft as a doughnut like it said heather shed made unbelievable headway with her tbone and sirloin tip combo how could a girl that small pack away so much prime beef its great he told her meaning it i love this place she said partly because of the food but also because of all these memories i have back when my dad was with the sheriffs and he had to be in court late hed take us here rather than battle the traffic back to brea mom and gary and i would meet him and wed have a huge meal it was kind of like sunday during the week she patted her mouth with a corner of snowwhite napkin pretty mouth bowshaped and some of her lip gloss remained the scratches on her smooth olive cheek were healing nicely shed concealed the dark marks with makeup did a lot better than he had with his bruise my family doesnt eat out why had he said that heather said a lot of families dont actually we dont very often that makes it more special dont you think she rubbed a corner of a linen napkin between tapered fingers i love the feel of this he smiled she smiled back and they both ate drank wine red wine a sixyearold california cabernet way past his budget hed faked out choosing from the fivepage wine list knowing that red went with beef but not much more than that pretending to contemplate hed finally jabbed randomly and hoped for the best then the whole sniffing swirling routine the way hed seen it done in movies gomez james gomez agent double phony fine hed told the sommelier very good sir heather took one sip and said oh man this is fantastic you know your wine hed visited her twice in the hospital but this was their first date spurofthemoment thing after the ceremony on the front steps of city hall shed occupied his thoughts from the first time he saw her the ceremony had turned out to be councilman gilbert reyes a couple of flunkies the media isaac and his family his parents beaming and his brothers squirming as he accepted the calligraphyladen official commendation on mockparchment then made a cursory speech all those microphones jammed in his face cameras clicking and whirring he hated every minute of it longed for the solitude of the library his laptop and books and the opera of deduction not klara in his lap she was too much for him way too much but he would work at keeping her friendship he got through the ordeal shaking hands and smiling and waiting for an opportunity to escape then heather came up to him where had she been before he could ask her councilman gilbert reyes spotted her and had her pose for stills sandwiched between himself and isaac later isaac found out shed wanted to be present for the whole thing but had arrived late because of traffic i heard your entire speech though she assured him and the ceremony was on kfwb daddy always listens to news and talk radio oh here he is a big square truck of a man stepped out from behind the departing media hounds white hair and mustache outdoor skin iron grip then a small slender vivacious woman younglooking for her age who heather resembled strikingly heather would age well nancy and robert salcido thanked him then turned to converse in spanish with irma and isaiah gomez sr somehow isaac and heather drifted away from the crowd over to a shady spot just north of the steps somehow she got him talking about himself a phd and an md she said thats ambitious thats unbelievable dont tell anyone but ive been thinking of med school too my grades were good and my adviser thought i should apply but all those years seemed daunting i thought the rn would be enough for me but now im not sure you should go for it he said think so sure you can do it as if he knew what he was talking about well she said thanks for the vote of confidence i dont know maybe i will well it was nice seeing you again it doesnt have to end she gave a puzzled look that made his heart sink then a smile that inflated the damned hunk of cardiac muscle as in lunch he said as in now smooooth stupid now okay ill tell my parents they were figuring to go out as a family but i like your idea better at a loss for a restaurant phony cool guy that he was he was grateful when she came up with leonards despite the fact that it would empty his wallet reyes had intimated some kind of reward would be forthcoming maybe true maybe not what the heck live dangerously now he watched heather slice pink meat off the bone chew swallow everything she did was adorable she said what pardon you got really quiet isaac im just enjoying myself he said the peace and quiet of course she said reaching over and placing her hand atop his he felt his skin go hot she said lifes so funny you know you plan and scheme and then out of nowhere something happens i know
