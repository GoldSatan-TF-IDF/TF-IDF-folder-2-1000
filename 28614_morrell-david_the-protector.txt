prologue state of emergency riot police dispel protestors st louis missouri april apwhat officials feared would be a third day of rioting ended this morning when two thousand armorclad policemen used batons pepper spray and tear gas to dispel ten thousand protestors the riots disrupting the world trade organization conference here had turned downtown st louis into what amounted to a war zone with damage from fires and vandalism estimated at million the protestors claim that wto ignores environmental and labor abuses in undeveloped countries although similar demonstrations in seattle four years earlier had alerted st louis authorities about what to expect police still found themselves overwhelmed we prepared for six months police chief edward gaines said at a press conference but these anarchists are even more organized than they were in seattle thank god we finally wore them down anarchists the thinktank supervisor considered the word nicely chosen al suggested the police chief include it in his statement the army general said but the chief has no idea what really happened a perfectly successful operation the military analyst said two lieutenant colonels and a tall sinewy woman filled out the group the al short for alicia to whom the general had referred wore a khaki pantsuit that resembled a uniform she sat with the others in a darkly paneled drawing room their highbacked chairs were arranged before a large screen onto which an overhead television projector beamed videotaped images of the crisis highlights from nbcs coverage had just ended now a condensed version of cnns began the initial sequences showed the first day of rioting protestors stretched all the way from busch stadium and the federal courthouse to the huge americas center where the world trade organization was holding its conference by nightfall downtown st louis was paralyzed on the screen rioters smashed every window they came to they overturned vehicles and set fire to them flames reflected off sidewalks covered with shattered glass the second days edited sequences showed more protestors cramming the streets damaging anything they could find at a press conference the mayor declared a state of emergency ordering all civilians to avoid the downtown area but on the third day the outnumbered police joined by state troopers and the national guard organized a counterattack the screen showed them using tear gas to funnel the rioters along market chestnut and other downtown streets toward memorial park there in the green space around the towering gateway arch retreating protestors trampled a tent city theyd erected a reporter spoke urgently as a camera in a helicopter peered down on the rioters being pushed beyond the arch protestors threw rocks and bottles at the relentlessly converging policemen one bottle was filled with liquid and had a rag stuffed into it as a young man lit and threw it the camera whipped to show it crashing into flames gas masks helmets shields and body armor made the police resemble an army of robocops the reporter breathlessly announced ignoring the burning gasoline and the rocks the police fired teargas canisters so much haze spewed around the rioters they could barely be seen a camera on a mississippi barge now showed the action the rioters stumbled from the haze bent over coughing they looked as frightened as theyd looked angry moments earlier police in gas masks emerged pounding with batons pushing with shields coughing harder the protestors panicked and lurched in the only unimpeded direction available the mississippi thousands tumbled into the river struggling to stay afloat as the dark figures of the police reached the bank and stood guard im sure you noticed the man who threw the molotov cocktail the general said some liberal commentators are claiming hes part of a group of agitators the theory is that the corporations whose policies are under attack paid thugs to instigate the violence the police fought back and the legitimate protestors had to defend themselves eventually becoming rioters and discrediting their cause a conspiracy theory the thinktank supervisor sighed there always has to be a conspiracy theory but in this case they happen to be correct its just not the conspiracy they imagine the general nodded and it was right there on television for everyone to see on every network as plain as day but nobody noticed as i saidthe military analyst made a congratulatory gesture to the four men and the woman seated near hima perfectly successful operation army rangers die on training mission camp rudder florida april apthe commander of camp rudder headquarters for the army sixth ranger training battalion confirmed that fifteen army rangers had drowned in a swamp two nights earlier while on a training exercise the announcement had been delayed he said so that family members could be notified were still trying to determine what happened lt col robert boland said we train in that area all the time but we almost never have problems granted last night was unusually cold for this time of year and recent rains had made the water unusually high but these men were rangers at this stage in their training theyd already been taught to endure much more difficult conditions all we know is they didnt make radio contact when they were supposed to the swamp is my friend braddock insisted to himself holding his m above his head wading through the cold chesthigh water pulling his combat boots out of muck he repeated the mantra his survival instructors had drilled into him long ago when hed joined the rangers the swamp is my friend a lot had happened since then braddock had been through combat in grenada panama iraq afghanistan and in numerous unpublicized missions often in jungles now he was an instructor and as he slogged through the darkness leaning slightly forward to compensate for his sixtypound pack he hoped that every man in his squad had made the swamp is my friend their mantra as well the alligators are my friends the snakes are my friends dont think just repeat it and believe it ignoring what felt like a sunken log that shifted under him nearly causing him to lose his balance braddock focused on those words to live by hoping that his men would also theyd been in the swamp for three hours with another two to go youre more than halfway through braddock wanted to assure them but he couldnt this exercise was being conducted under strict voice silence even their radio transmissions every half hour to their companion squad a quarter mile away were voiceless composed of electronic pulses as a further deprivation none of them wore nightvision goggles on the theory that sophisticated equipment was a luxury they shouldnt rely on the darkness is my friend this night had been chosen because it didnt have a moon as a bonus thick clouds from yesterdays storm lingered blotting out the stars hulks of dead trees loomed in the darkness gray against black only the slightest gradations at the lowest end of the light spectrum providing an indication of braddocks surroundings under such sightless conditions the streaks of greenandblack camouflage grease on their faces might have seemed unnecessary but braddock had warned them to plan for every contingency saying that even on a night mission camouflage grease was mandatory his drenched cold uniform clung to his legs hips and chest he saw a slight glow ahead as the squads scout checked a luminous compass and shifted direction the other men following braddock would have to discipline him for that confine him to barracks make him run extra miles i shouldnt have seen the glow from the compass he thought a sniper out there would have seen it too despite the insect repellant braddock wore mosquitoes settled on his face drawing blood making him itchy he ignored them insects are my friends he listened to the ripple of water as his squad waded onward through the barely visible dead trees his upraised m cramped his arms the fetid swamp rose to his neck under the water something nudged against his left side he smelled rotting vegetation he shivered that troubled him accustomed to much worse conditions braddock accused himself of starting to lose his edge a gray mist drifted over him a pungent odor beginning to irritate his nostrils as the water felt colder he shivered harder but the numbness in his legs and the tightness in his chest didnt matter more important things occupied him any second now braddock thought his sense of timing was perfect overhead flares burst haloed by smoke their harsh light pierced the darkness braddocks men stared up in surprise the descending glares reflecting off the scummy water although braddock had known about the flares hed been under orders not to tell his men anticipate dont be surprised by anything part of the point of the exercise was to make braddocks alreadystressed unit feel unexpectedly threatened at once three fighter jets streaked over the skeletal trees their approach so swift that only after the jets passed could they be heard their thunder deafening braddock wore a waterproof electronic location transmitter so that the pilots knew where not to shoot ahead the jets fired rockets and mm tracer bullets into the swamp two hundred yards away the night became alive with explosions and fire jesus somebody said no braddock mentally shouted youre not supposed to talk what the somebody else demanded dont they know were here braddock surged through the water toward the second man and glared shut your mouth braddocks eyes said smoke from the flares drifted over them smelling of cordite and dead things almost making braddock gag christ those rockets almost hit us a third man said braddock splashed urgently toward him glowering him into silence damn it keep control obey orders he wanted to shout the water seemed colder as another soft thing nudged against braddocks left side he shivered harder his heart pounded his breathing quickened nobody mentioned anything about rockets a fourth man said his voice wavering furious braddock surged toward him then stopped as the descending flares hissed into the water spewing more smoke darkness overcoming everyone braddock shivered so hard that his teeth chattered at the same time his stomach felt on fire unaccountable fear crept up his torso cramping his muscles spreading heat around his heart his breath came so fast he couldnt control it inhale one two three hold it one two three exhale one two three inhale one two three hold it one two three but his chest kept heaving refusing to obey he didnt understand after the numerous combat missions hed been through this was nothing the swamp is my friend the darkness is my friend whats happening to me he wanted to scream one of his menthe toughest of his traineesdid scream something bit me no the man sounded as out of control as a civilian would have been it didnt make sense a snake a logor somethingbumped against braddocks side an alligator somethings under my suddenly one of braddocks men fired fullauto at the darkness muzzle flashes illuminating ripples in the water bullets shredding dead trees men screaming as they too fired at the night a bullet seared braddocks right arm he lost his balance and fell back greasy water flooding into his mouth and up his nose the rattle of the ms sounded hollow beneath the surface keeping a tight grip on his weapon braddock fought against the weight of his pack and struggled upward as he broke into the air desperate to breathe the multiple gunfire suddenly became loud enough to make his ears ring smoke and the smell of cordite swirled around him muzzle flashes blinding him he shouted cease fire cease fire he barely recognized his voice so severely had fear seized his throat making his normally husky tone a shriek a bullet struck his left shoulder slamming him backward into the water fangs seemed to pierce his neck no the swamp is my friend the alligators the when he scrambled upward again resurfacing into the panic of screams and gunfire a bullet blew the back of his head away part one threat assessment shoes and watches cavanaugh had learned a long time ago that one of the secrets of being a capable protective agent was to pay attention to shoes and watches loafers for example somebody wearing them was unlikely to be a trained kidnapper or assassin because an experienced runnerandgunner knew how easy it was to lose loafers in a chase or a fight only boots or laceup shoes were acceptable thin soles were a further indication that someone was unlikely to be a serious threat thick soles being mandatory in a fight of course somebody wearing loafers or thinsoled shoes could still be a threat but at least cavanaugh would know he was dealing with an amateur similarly watches told cavanaugh a lot many operators trained in the s and s wore either rolex divers watches or rolex pilots watches the rationale was twofold first those watches had a reputation for functioning under rugged conditions an essential requirement for a runnerandgunner second in an emergency a rolex became portable wealth easily sold for cash not that everyone wearing a rolex aroused cavanaughs suspicions they had to be in their forties or older fitting the age profile of someone whod been trained during the seventies and eighties also operators from that era tended to prefer sneakers jeans tshirts and windbreakers often leather for their casual street clothes the windbreaker would be loose capable of concealing a handgun to the untutored eye someone who fit that description wouldnt seem unusual but to cavanaugh that person caused concern operators trained in the s and afterward had a different profile they were younger of course and the watch they preferred was cheap and anonymous but capable of taking a beating the sort of rubbercoated divers watch that had a timer function and could be bought in any decent sportinggoods store they preferred hiking boots tough thick soles loosefitting camping pants with baggy pockets to conceal a weapon a loose pullover to conceal a weapon and a fanny pack to conceal a weapon given the poor fashion sense of most people on the street anyone who matched this profile didnt stand out except to a protective agent like cavanaugh who instantly placed them under suspicion watches so much could be revealed by them cavanaugh had once been on a protective detail in istanbul his assignment had been to help provide security for an american billionaire who had gone to istanbul to negotiate a corporate merger despite threats against the mans life because of his muchpublicized financial support of israel before the billionaires jet arrived at istanbuls airport cavanaugh had checked the busy concourse and the area outside the variety of clothes that the crowd woretraditional arab robes as well as numerous types of western dress made it hard to find a telltale common denominator but watches cavanaugh knew seldom lied when he noticed half a dozen men in their thirties who wore dissimilar but baggy clothes who appeared not to have anything to do with one another but who all had similar thicksoled shoes and the same type of sturdy black rubbercoated athletes watch alarms went off inside him warning him that he had to find another way to get his client out of the airport it wasnt something cavanaugh did consciously it was his reflexive way of seeing the world much as the legendary security expert col jeff cooper advised everyone to maintain a state of vigilance that cooper called condition yellow white being the average persons lack of awareness orange being intense alertness in response to danger and red being a fight for ones life in condition yellow then observing shoes watches and other indicators cavanaugh got out of a taxi at columbus circle and walked into central park the time was around two in the afternoon the route he took through the trees avoided paths and was intended to let him know if he was being followed he exited at west seventieth street and crisscrossed blocks at random heading south eventually climbing the steps from columbus avenue and starting across the huge open area in front of lincoln center one benefit of this cautious frame of mind was that it kept him solidly in the moment appreciative of each second not only aware of the crowd that was typically in front of lincoln center but also aware of the unusually clear sky of the pleasant feel of the sun on this splendid may afternoon he crossed to the famous fountain sat with his back to it and considered what was going on around him two young men threw a frisbee back and forth students presumably from nearby juilliard sat on benches reading textbooks busylooking people crossed back and forth from the various buildings couples chatted turning cavanaugh saw a businessman sitting behind him on the edge of the fountain the man had a briefcase in his lap and glanced at his watch out of habit cavanaugh shifted so he could pay closer attention the man was in his thirties of medium height and weight with short dark hair any number of businessmen fit that profile his black suit looked expensive and fit him perfectly no place to hide a weapon the mans black briefcase also looked expensive and was shiny enough to be brandnew when the man crossed his legs cavanaugh was able to study one of his shoes a sturdy black oxford so new that the sole was barely scraped and as for the watch cavanaugh didnt mind that it was one of those shiny types with all sorts of dials and buttons true a certain level of businessman preferred to be unostentatious but others liked to indulge themselves with gadgets and a watch capable of being a tinier while it also indicated the hour minute and second in two different time zones could be amusing for a certain type of mind no what bothered cavanaugh was that the watch was so thick the shirtsleeve around it had to be unbuttoned looking sloppy in contrast to the mans otherwiseimpeccable appearance the man checked his watch again then directed his attention to the left toward the entrance to avery fisher hall one of the buildings in the complex at that moment cavanaugh sensed someone coming toward him and peered up at a tall slender man who had a slight mustache and a widebrimmed hat that cavanaugh knew hid thinning gray hair although the man was in his fifties he exuded the wiry strength of someone much younger his shoes were so polished that they reflected the movement of people walking past his gray pinstriped suit gave the impression of a uniform his white shirt was heavily starched the only colors were the red and blue of his tie which didnt relieve his pallor duncan cavanaugh smiled and shook hands with him you look pasty you need to get outside more bad for my health the brim of duncans hat cast his face in shadow his last name was wentworth and because hed spent much of his life outdoors as a member of special forces and later as the head instructor for delta force hed had three operations for serious skin cancer youre far too tan put on more sunblock yeah the ozone layers getting thinner one more thing to worry about cavanaugh glanced again toward the man in the black suit sitting behind him on the edge of the fountain anyway its too nice a day to be indoors i figured since you were supervising the new security arrangements at lincoln center we could meet here instead of at your office he referred to the madison avenue headquarters for global protective services a security agency duncan had established when hed left delta force after only five years the agency had branches in london paris rome and hong kong with another soon to open in tokyo its reputation had spread because of the quality of the protective agents duncan hired all of them having been specialoperations personnel many of them duncans former students how are your injuries duncan asked healed the ambassador sends his regards hes very lucky yes to have had somebody as good as you running interference for him cavanaugh couldnt resist grinning anytime you start buttering me up it means you want something duncan gave him a guilty as charged look do you think youre ready to go back to work taking another glance over his shoulder cavanaugh noticed that the man in the black suit looked more intense as he checked his watch yet again and continued staring toward avery fisher hall the open cuff around the thick watch became more bothersome at once the man saw something that made him sit rigidly with the briefcase on his lap he placed his hands on the buttons that would open it excuse me a minute cavanaugh said to duncan he stood and rounded the fountain following the mans gaze toward avery fisher hall and a redhaired woman who had just stepped out in her thirties well dressed and pleasantlooking she was with a man whom she gave a see you later kiss on the cheek then she started across the open area in ten seconds she would pass through the crowd and be close to where the man in the black suit sat staring at her cavanaugh came up on his blind side as the man opened the briefcase just enough to reach inside it the woman came closer and glanced in the mans direction amazing cavanaugh inasmuch as most people never noticed anything around them she froze as the man dropped the briefcase revealing a pistol in his hand several things happened almost at once the woman screamed the man moved toward her and cavanaugh darted behind him shoving his arm into the air he wrenched the pistol from the mans hand dragged him backward tipped him into the fountain and pressed his head underwater duncan came over to him yes youre certainly feeling better are you just going to stand there enjoying yourself or would you mind calling a cop duncan pulled out a cell phone dont you think you should let him breathe not really but i guess well never hear his story otherwise she told him she wanted a divorcesomething like that and he couldnt take the rejection of course duncan said of course but i want to know why he dressed up he doesnt normally wear a suit you can tell because his watch is too big for the cuff on a dress shirt if you dont let him breathe pretty soon youll never know spoilsport cavanaugh pulled the mans face from the water watched him splutter and demanded to know about the suit with a little more submersion the man was persuaded to explain after shooting his wife who had indeed asked for a divorce and whod been going to meet him at her lawyers office he had planned to shoot himself the black suit like the shoes was new he had left instructions that they were to be his burial clothes just when you think youve heard everything cavanaugh said but there was more the man had kept checking his watch because hed known when to expect his wife to leave work and go to her appointment with her attorney one of the three dials on his watch indicated the current time another dial showed the amount of time that had elapsed since shed told him she wanted a divorce a third counted down the remaining seconds that shed had to live cavanaugh shoved the mans head underwater again so what do you think duncan asked about are you ready for another assignment the warwick hotel had recently been renovated but its marble and dark wood lobby still evoked the tradition and character of a manhattan landmark cavanaugh turned left and entered the hotels quiet bar where an attractive woman with green eyes and an intriguing expression sat at a corner table he approved of her choice of locationher back to an inside wall away from the bars numerous windowsalthough if hed believed she was in any danger he wouldnt have let her appear in public in the first place her name was jamie travers and until recently she had lived in seclusion with him at his ranch in the mountains near jackson hole wyoming from where he had periodically set out on security assignments taking care that her weapons training was uptodate and that colleagues in need of r and r were there to watch over her when he had to go away two years earlier she had testified about a gangland killing shed witnessed the mob boss whod gone to prison had put out a contract against her twice despite police protection shed nearly been killed prompting cavanaugh who admired her determination to step in and arrange for her to disappear the contract had finally ended when the man whod ordered it choked to death while eating spaghetti and meatballs in a federal prison despite the seeming innocence of the mob bosss death jamie had been convinced that cavanaugh had had something to do with it but he continued to deny any involvement even though he had once told her that the only way to stop the mob boss from being a threat was to kill him kismet was all cavanaugh would say about the supposed accident shortly afterward they had married now they continued to base their lives in wyoming but for its beauty not its seclusion shoulderlong glossy brunette hair made the beige pantsuit and the emerald blouse she wore perfect choices admiring his wife he moved a chair so that he could sit in the corner with her the location allowed him to survey both entrances to the room as well as the pedestrians passing the windows along fiftyfourth street and the avenue of the americas what are you drinking he asked perrier and lime he tasted it savoring the lime how was your afternoon enjoying being a tourist love it i havent been to the museum of modern art in so long it was like seeing an old friend and how was your afternoon he told her you accepted another assignment jamie looked surprised we planned to fly home the day after tomorrow so this wont interfere with much especially since youre seeing your mother again tomorrow i didnt think youd mind going home ahead of me ill join you in a week but youre barely healed from the last job you did this ones easy thats what you said the last time and the moneys good ive got more than enough money for both of us jamie said cavanaugh nodded his protective agents income allowed them to stay at the warwick which was comfortable without being palatial but if theyd used jamies money which came from the sale of a promising dotcorn company shed founded during the internet frenzy of the s theyd have stayed in a master suite at the plaza or at the very least the st regis why dont you let me take care of you she asked foolish male pride you said it i didnt he shrugged people need protecting and thats what you do i shouldnt have bothered asking she hooked an arm around one of his so what makes this job easy the client doesnt want anybody to shield him oh jamie looked surprised again what does he want the same as you did to disappear cavanaugh got out of the car a twoyearold ford taurus that global protective services had supplied apart from its special modifications including a racecar engine and a suspension to match it had been chosen because its dusty gray color and ubiquitous design made it so nondescript it was almost invisible among other sedans sunday afternoon however it was the only vehicle in this abandoned industrial area of newark new jersey he scanned the graffiticovered warehouse a sprawling threestory structure that had most of its windows smashed ruststreaked doors hung open revealing what at first appeared to be garbage but turned out to be a city of homeless people as far as was visible into the building battered cardboard boxes provided shelter black plastic bags held whatever possessions the inhabitants treasured dark clouds cast a cold shadow on the river behind the warehouse boat engines droned a tug blew its horn thunder rumbled cavanaugh pressed his right elbow reassuringly against the mm handgun holstered on the belt beneath his jacket the sig sauer held eight rounds in the magazine and one in the firing chamber not a massive amount of firepower not the sixteen rounds that a beretta was capable of holding but hed found that a pistol containing that much ammunition was slightly large for his hand affecting the accuracy of his aim nine wellplaced shots being better than sixteen that went astray because of a poor grip plus as the federal air marshals had decided in the late s the sig sauer s lighter weight and thin compact design made it an ideal concealed carry weapon but just in case he had two other eightround magazines in a pouch on the left side of his belt beneath his jacket a chill wind strengthened redolent of approaching rain at the gaping entrances to the warehouse a few grizzled faces squinted out cavanaugh took his cell phone from his jacket and pressed the good for today only numbers duncan had given to him as the phone rang on the other end more grizzled faces appeared some apprehensive others assessing on the other end the phone rang a second time yes a mans trembly voice asked sounding like he was in an echo chamber cavanaugh supplied his half of the recognition sequence i didnt realize the warehouse was closed ten years ago came the other half of the sequence the voice continuing to sound unsteady your name is cavanaugh and yours is daniel prescott daniel not dan this exchange too was part of the sequence more haggard faces studied him an army of rags trying to decide if the newcomer was an enemy a benefactor or a target isolated drops of rain struck the greasy pavement global protective services has a reputation for being the best the voice said i expected a fancier car one of the reasons were the best is we dont attract attention to ourselves and more important to our clients heavier drops struck the pavement i assume you can see me cavanaugh said as you wanted i came alone open the car doors cavanaugh did open the trunk he did that too the man evidently had a vantage point that allowed him to look into the vehicle the dark clouds thickened a few more drops of rain struck around him cavanaugh heard faint echoing metallic noises on the phone hello no response hello he asked again more faint echoing metallic noises thunder rumbled closer a few derelicts stepped from the warehouse like the others they were scruffy and beardstubbled but the desperation in their eyes contrasted with the blankness and resignation cavanaugh sensed in the others crack addicts he assumed so overdue for a fix that theyd try taking on a stranger who was unwise enough to visit hell hey i came here to help you he said into the phone not to get soaked more metallic noises i think we both made a mistake he shut the trunk and the passenger doors about to get into the car he heard the trembly voice say ahead of you on the left you see the door yes it was the only door still intact closed come in the unsteady voice said cavanaugh got behind the steering wheel i said come in the voice insisted after move the vehicle he drove along the cracked concrete parking area near the door he turned the car in a half circle facing it in the direction from which hed come ready to leave in a hurry if he needed to entering he said into his phone he got out of the car locked it with his remote control and sprinted through the drizzle sensing movement with his peripheral vision he glanced to his left along the warehouse toward where more crack addicts stepped into the increasing rain and watched him wary of what might be behind the door more crack addicts he put his phone into his jacket and did something that he hadnt planned drew his pistol as he turned the knob he noted that although the lock was coated with grit there was a hint of shininess underneaththe lock was new but it wasnt engaged pulling the heavy creaking door open he ducked inside as swiftly as the doors protesting hinges allowed cavanaugh closed it no longer a silhouette he shifted toward the deepest shadows and took account of where he was at the bottom of a dusty concrete stairwell metal steps led up cobwebs dangled from the railing on the left a motor rumbled behind an elevator door the place smelled of must and gave off a chill aiming his pistol toward the stairs and then toward the elevator he reached behind him to turn the latch on the sturdy lock and secure the door but before he could touch it the locks bolt rammed home triggered electronically from a distance he concentrated to control his uneasiness there wasnt any reason to suspect he was in danger after all duncan had warned him that the potential client although legitimate had eccentricities prescotts merely being cautious cavanaugh tried to assure himself hell if hes so nervous about his safety that he feels he needs protection its natural hed make sure the doors locked hes the one in danger not me then why am holding this gun he pulled the phone from his jacket and spoke into it now what his voice echoed as if in response the elevator opened revealing a brightly lit compartment cavanaugh hated elevatorssmall sealed boxes that could easily become traps there wasnt any way to know what might be on the other side when the door reopened thanks he said into the phone but i need some exercise ill take the stairs as his eyes adjusted to the shadows he noticed a surveillance camera mounted discreetly under the stairs facing the door i was told you wanted to disappear it seems to me youve already done that not enough the unsteady voice said this time it came not from the phone but from a speaker hidden in the wall cavanaugh put away his phone a vague pungent smell pinched his nostrils as if something had died nearby his pulse quickened no matter how softly he placed his shoes the metal stairs echoed loudly as he climbed he came to a landing and shifted higher the pungent smell became a little more noticeable his stomach fidgeted as he faced a solid metal door hesitating he reached for it not that one the voice said from the wall nerves inexplicably more on edge cavanaugh climbed higher and came to a door halfway up the stairs not that one either the voice said incidentally am i supposed to feel reassured that youre coming with a gun i dont know about you but under the circumstances it does a world of good for me the voice made a sound that might have been a bitter chuckle heavy rain hit the building sending vibrations through it at the top a final door awaited it was open inviting cavanaugh into a brightly lit corridor which had a closed door at the other end this is the same as stepping into an elevator he decided the pungent smell seemed a little stronger his muscles tightening he didnt understand what was happening to him a visceral part of him warned him to leave the building abruptly he wondered if he could leave the building even though he always carried lock picks in his jackets collar he had the suspicion that they wouldnt be enough to open the downstairs door breathing slightly faster he had to keep telling himself that he wasnt the one in dangerprescott was which explained what cavanaugh hoped were merely security precautions and not a trap that had been set for him he glanced up at a security camera in the corridor he was expected to enter to hell with it he thought annoyed by the nervous moisture on his palms if prescott wanted me dead he could have killed me before now regardless of the insistent pounding of his heart a strong intuition told cavanaugh to surrender to the situation something else told him to run which made no sense inasmuch as he didnt have a reason to believe he was in danger impatient with himself he came to a firm decision and holstered his weapon its not going to do me any good in that corridor anyhow entering he wasnt surprised that the door swung shut behind him locking loudly after the gloom of the stairwell the lights hurt his eyes but at least the pungent smell was gone managing to feel less on edge he walked to the door at the end of the corridor turned the knob pushed the door open and found himself in a bright room filled with closedcircuit television monitors and electronic consoles across from him bricks covered a window what captured his attention however was an overweight man in his forties who stood among the glowing equipment the man wore wrinkled slacks and an equally wrinkled white shirt that had sweat marks and clung to his ample stomach his thick sandy hair was uncombed he needed a shave the skin under his eyes was puffy from lack of sleep the dark pupils of his eyes were large from tension the man aimed a colt semiautomatic pistol at him its barrel wavered cavanaugh had no doubt that if he had still been holding his pistol when hed entered the man would have fired doing his best to keep his breathing steady he raised his hands in reassuring submission despite the big gun that was nervously aimed at him the uneasiness cavanaugh had felt coming up the stairs seemed of no importance compared to what this man must be feeling for outside of combat prescott was the most frightened man cavanaugh had ever seen please remember you sent for me cavanaugh said im here to help you as prescott continued to aim the colt his pupils got larger the room became more sour with fear i knew your onetimeonly phone number and the recognition code cavanaugh said only someone from protective services could have had that information you could have forced those details from the person they were sending prescott said as on the phone his voice was unsteady but now cavanaugh understood that it wasnt an electronic effectprescotts voice shook because he was afraid the door behind cavanaugh swung shut its lock ramming electronically home he managed not to flinch i dont know who or what you feel threatened by but i hardly think one man coming here would be the smartest way to get at you not the way youve got this place set up logic should tell you im not a threat the unexpected is the most brilliant tactic prescotts grip on the was as unsteady as his voice besides your logic works against you if one man isnt much of a threat how can one man provide adequate protection you didnt say you wanted protection you said you wanted to disappear sweat marks spreading under his arms prescott studied cavanaugh warily my initial interviews are always oneonone cavanaugh said i have to ask questions to assess the threat level then i decide how much help the job requires i was told you used to be in delta force prescott licked his dry fleshy lips thats right the classic specialoperations physique involved muscular shoulders that trimmed down to solid compact hips upperbody strength being one of the goals of the arduous training lots of exercise prescott said is that what you think qualifies you to protect somebody trying to put prescott at ease cavanaugh chuckled you want my job stats if you want to convince me youre here to help if you want to work for me youve got this turned around when i interview potential clients its not because i want to work for them sometimes i dont want to work for them you mean you have to like them prescott asked with distaste sometimes i dont like them either cavanaugh said but that doesnt mean they dont have a right to live im a protector not a judge with exceptions no drug traffickers no child abusers nobody whos an obvious monster are you a monster prescott had a look of incredulity of course not then theres only one other standard thatll help me decide if i want to protect you which is are you willing to be compliant prescott blinked sweat from his eyes what i cant protect someone who wont take orders cavanaugh said thats the paradox of being a protector someone hires me in theory that persons the boss but when it comes to protection im the one who gives the orders the employer has to react to me as if im the boss are you willing to be compliant anything to keep me alive youll do what i say prescott thought and then fearfully nodded so okay heres your first order put that damned gun away before i ram it down your throat prescott blinked several times stepping back as if cavanaugh had slapped him he held the gun steadier frowned and slowly lowered it an excellent start cavanaugh said if youre not who you say you are do it right now prescott said kill me i cant stand living this way relax whoever your enemies are im not one of them cavanaugh surveyed the room to the right in a corner past the electronics and the monitors he saw a cot a minifridge a sink and a small stove beyond was a toilet a showerhead and a drain the type of food on the shelves made clear that prescott didnt worry about being overweight boxes of macaroni and cheese cans of ravioli and lasagna bags of chocolates candy bars and potato chips cases of classic coke how long have you been here three weeks cavanaugh noticed books on a shelf below the food most were nonfiction on subjects as various as geology and photography one had a photo of a naked woman on the cover and seemed to be a sex book in contrast another volume was the collected poems of robinson jeffers with a few books about jeffers next to it you like poetry cavanaugh asked soothes the soul prescotts tone was slightly defensive as if he suspected that cavanaugh might be mocking him cavanaugh picked up the book and opened it reading the first lines he came to i built her a tower when i was young sometime she will die prescott looked more defensive knows how to grab my attention cavanaugh set down the book and continued scanning the place videotapes sat next to a small television prescotts taste had no consistency a clint eastwood thriller an old troy donahuesandra dee teenageromance tearjerker ive seen worse places to go to ground cavanaugh thought about it homeless people and crack addicts as your cover smart howd you know about this warehouse howd you set up this room i did it a year ago prescott said whatever your trouble is you saw it coming not this particular trouble then why did you i always take precautions prescott said youre not making sense in case prescott told him in case of what movement on a tv monitor abruptly caught cavanaughs attention wait a second whats wrong prescott spun toward the monitor on the screen a gray image showed a dozen ragged men plodding through the rain converging on the taurus jesus prescott said crack addicts are amazing cavanaugh said no matter what it is if its left alone theyll try to steal it i once knew a guy who stole forty pounds of dog food from his father so he could buy crack whats more amazing his drug dealer took the dog food rather than demanding money for all i know the drug dealer ate it on the screen the ragged men drenched with rain tugged at the sideview mirrors or used chunks of metal to pry at the hubcaps have you got a way to hear whats going on outside cavanaugh asked prescott flipped a switch on a console immediately the sound of rain came through an audio speaker cavanaugh heard the distant scrape of metal as the ragged men worked in the downpour to try to disassemble his car get a job guys he took the cars remote control from his jacket pocket it was more elaborate than usual equipped with half a dozen buttons prescott looked puzzled as cavanaugh pressed one of the buttons suddenly the audio speaker filled the room with an eartorturing siren that came from the taurus and made the men drop their makeshift burglary tools fleeing like drenched versions of the scarecrow in the wizard of oz cavanaugh pressed the button again and the siren stopped are you ready to get out of here he asked prescott to prescott looked apprehensive somewhere safer than this although lord knows this place is safe enough after my team arrives after we get organized well give you a new identity and relocate you but first i need to know what kind of risk level were talking about why are you so frightened prescott opened his mouth to answer then frowned at the monitor four of the men were back heading for the taurus at least they get points for persistence cavanaugh said he pressed another button on the remote control gray vapor spewed from under the wheel wells despite the rain it blossomed enveloping the crack addicts coughing and cursing they stumbled back bent over as if they were going to be sick they pawed at their eyes and staggered away cavanaugh pressed the button again and the vapor stopped spewing from the wheel wells what on earth was that prescott asked tear gas what the cars modified the way the best secret service vehicles are its armorplated and a new image on the monitor made him stop amazing with their ambition if these guys were in politics they could run the world on the screen two more crack addicts approached the taurus turn down the volume on that speaker cavanaugh told prescott confused prescott did what he was told as the men came closer to the taurus cavanaugh pressed another button on the remote control small black canisters catapulted from under the wheel wells shaped like miniature soup cans they exploded with numerous roars that shook the speaker even though its volume had been reduced the multiple flashes of the explosions were so bright that the camera had trouble maintaining its contrast level when the smoke cleared the two crack addicts lay on the concrete my god you killed them prescott said no but they were so close to the grenades those werent grenades on the screen the two men began to squirm i used flashbangs cavanaugh said flashbangs sort of like grenades except they dont throw shrapnel but they blind and deafen for a while those guys are going to have a whale of a headache on the screen the two crack addicts struggled upright holding their ears but this car can be equipped to launch grenades if the mission calls for it cavanaugh said and it can be modified for machine guns under the headlights all the best dictators and drug lords have those extras in a more luxurious car than a taurus of course believe me mr prescott we can take care of you cavanaugh looked back at the row of monitors where one of the images showed the taurus at ground level able to see partway under the car he frowned noticing what appeared to be a shadow under the vehicle he pointed does that camera have a zoom lens all of them do prescott twisted a dial enlarging the image on the monitor the shadow under the taurus took the shape of a small box jesus cavanaugh thought one of the crack addicts must have put it under there he blinked as the taurus exploded the roar from the speaker was so loud that the entire room shook on the screen chunks of the taurus crashed onto the concrete smoke and fire swelling prescott gaped a second explosion rocked the room on a different monitor the door through which cavanaugh had entered the building blasted inward smoke and flames filling the area at the bottom of the stairs three men rushed in but although their hair was matted and their faces were beardstubbled and filthy their eyes had neither the blankness of the homeless nor the desperation of drug addicts these men had eyes as alert as any gunfighter cavanaugh had ever encountered is there another way out of here prescott kept staring at the screen which showed one of the men aiming a pistol at the elevator door while the other two aimed pistols upward and stormed the stairs prescott cavanaugh repeated drawing his weapon prescott kept staring at the screen cavanaugh grabbed him turned him and shook him for christs sake listen to me is there another way out of here instead of responding prescott lunged toward one of the electronic consoles and twisted a dial what are you doing cavanaugh asked prescott stared toward a different screen the two men came into view on an upper portion of the stairs they stopped and aimed upward looking as if they thought getting in had been too easy that there had to be traps in the building on the monitor that showed the entrance to the building two other ragged men charged in through the fading smoke from the explosion they too aimed pistols they started up the stairs then paused as had the pair above them wary they glanced behind and below them seeming to sense danger have you got the stairwell boobytrapped is that it cavanaugh asked prescott but on the screen nothing exploded in the stairwell no hidden guns went off no flames erupted from the walls even so the gunmen were obviously disturbed about something various monitors showed the man watching the elevator the two that had just paused on the stairs and the pair halfway up who stared apprehensively toward the top as if they knew they were walking into a death trap moisture dripped from their faces at first cavanaugh thought it was from the rain theyd charged through then he realized it was sweat one of the gunmen on the stairs suddenly started firing toward the upper level abruptly the other gunmen on the stairs did the same at the bottom the ragged figure watching the elevator kept looking behind him as if hed heard a threatening sound he spun toward the blownapart door and fired toward the rain what the hells gong on cavanaugh asked prescott kept twisting the dial mumbling to himself as if something had malfunctioned yes he spun toward cavanaugh theres another way out of here puzzled cavanaugh watched prescott hurry toward the shelves of food then he frowned again at the monitors seeing the gunmen continue firing up the stairs two furiously reloaded the other pair spun to aim behind them the man on the ground floor kept switching his aim between the elevator and the blownopen door a noise in the room distracted cavanaugh a scrape as prescott slid the shelves to the left revealing a door where does it lead the warehouse recalling the army of crack addicts hed seen when hed arrived cavanaugh wondered how much he could count on prescott to help do you know how to handle that gun you pointed at me no cavanaugh wasnt surprised he picked up the and found that prescott had aimed it with the safety on worse after cavanaugh freed the safety and pulled back the slide half an inch he saw that the firing chamber was empty releasing the magazine from the grip he discovered that it did contain the usual seven rounds however after he shoved the magazine back into the grip he racked a round into the firing chamber ready for business do you have extra ammunition no cavanaugh wasnt surprised about that either because the needed to be cocked before it could be fired he left the hammer back and the safety on a method preferred by most professionals after shoving it under his belt he drew his sig he took one final look at the monitors where he saw other ragged men rush into the stairwell aiming pistols like the others they suddenly hesitated as if threatened by something the cameras didnt show in the stairway the image that most caught cavanaughs attention however was one in the middle where a beardstubbled man in grimy clothes stood outside beyond the wreckage of the taurus which was still in flames despite the downpour drenched the man held a metal tube that was about four feet long and looked suspiciously like an antitank rocket launcher prescott is there a way to tell whats behind this door the top row of monitors on the right the screen showed nothing but a shadowy metal catwalk open the door get out of the way wildeyed prescott freed the lock and yanked the door open veering toward the cover of the wall cavanaugh aimed through the opening but saw nothing except the catwalk hed observed on the monitor the suspended metal walkway stretched into the shadows the warehouse rumbled from the rain remember what i said about following orders prescott could barely speak yes do you have a heart condition any serious illnesses that would keep you from moving fast prescott squeezed out a no okay when i run through this doorway run after me stay close on the middle screen the drenched grimy man outside finished arming the antitank rocket launcher it was short enough that he could easily manage it as he raised it to his shoulder and sighted upward through the rain toward the rooms brickedin window now cavanaugh said charging through the door then aiming down toward the shadows below the catwalk he heard his urgent footsteps on the catwalks metal an instant later he was relieved to hear prescotts footsteps clattering close behind him then all he heard was a ringing in his ears as the rocket exploded against the side of the building behind him he felt the concussion like hands slamming against his back shoving him forward and although he couldnt risk distracting himself by looking behind him he imagined bricks flying into the room smashing the monitors and electronic consoles the shock wave knocked him off balance sending him sprawling onto the catwalk his forehead banging against it as prescotts heavy frame landed on him the under cavanaughs belt gouged into his side for a moment his vision turned gray the catwalk swayed prescott moaned the catwalk swung farther out cavanaughs mind cleared inhaling painfully he tried to squirm from under prescotts weight smoke and dust from the explosion swirled over them prescott the big man coughed cavanaugh felt the force of it are you hurt not sure dont think so the ringing in cavanaughs ears made prescott sound far away instead of on top of him we have to stand the catwalk prescott warned its backandforth motion made cavanaugh feel he was in a plane being tossed in a storm his delta force training had conditioned him not to feel off balance or nauseated but prescott was another matter with no experience he had to be nearly out of his mind with fright pigeons scattered in panic rain cascaded from holes in the roof prescott ill take care of you all you have to do is something simple simple prescott clung to him as a drowning man does to his rescuer very simple cavanaugh imagined the gunmen running up the stairs about to burst into the room but he didnt dare communicate his urgency to prescott what do you want me to do lift yourself as the catwalk vibrated prescott tensed theres nothing to it cavanaugh strained to keep his voice calm pretend youre doing a pushup prescott couldnt move do it cavanaugh said now prescott cautiously made an effort at straightening his elbows an inch another inch cavanaugh crawled from under prescotts bulk he shoved his handgun into its holster and rose to a crouch gripping the metal railings as the catwalk shuddered now that the dust had lessened gray light through the broken windows was enough to help his eyes adjust to the shadows he stared toward the wreckagefilled room theyd escaped from and saw where the catwalk was attached to the wall its corroded bolts were half out he wondered how long it would take the gunmen to break into the room prescott youre doing fine now all you have to do is stand cant the catwalk trembled cavanaugh could barely keep his balance rain coming through holes in the roof fell around him then crawl he said what crawl now he tugged prescott inching him forward more a little faster cavanaugh gave another tug and prescott crawled farther along water splashed his hand feel sick prescott said save it for when we get off this thing cavanaugh hoped to transport prescotts mind into a future scenario off this thing prescott murmured thats right keep crawling faster well soon be at the other door cavanaugh peered through the shadows ahead and saw that the catwalks bolts were halfway out of the opposite wall too metal creaked from below a man shouted look on the catwalk in the room where prescott had been hiding an explosion blew away the door through which cavanaugh had entered as gunmen charged in cavanaugh drew his pistol and fired three times sending the assault team for cover he fired three more times hoping to keep the gunmen down long enough for him and prescott to reach the opposite door but as prescott flinched from the roar of the shots his sudden movement jerked the catwalk the bolts popped from the wall they approached the catwalk plunged rusted metal buckled the end of the catwalk scraped downward against the wall tilting forming a slide down which cavanaugh and prescott struggled not to fall grab the railing cavanaugh yelled for once prescott didnt need prompting even in the gray light it was obvious how white his knuckles were from the force with which he gripped the railing metal protesting the catwalk tilted lower more steeply pretend the railings a rope cavanaugh ordered climb down hand over hand with a shuddering clang the end of the catwalk slammed to a halt on the shadowy second floor the force with which it struck almost yanked cavanaughs hands off the railing he and prescott hung at a fortyfivedegree angle cavanaugh worried about the gunmen in the room above he hoped that the shadows made him and prescott hard to aim at but what about the man whod shouted from below prescott forget trying to climb down dig your heels against the metal and slide prescotts face was stark now cavanaugh said watch me he used his shoes as brakes while he slid down on his hips using his hands on the railing to guide him gratified he heard scrapes behind him as prescott did his best to follow gunshots reverberated through the warehouse bullets from the room theyd left blew chunks from the wall at once prescott needed no further encouragement he slid down so rapidly that his shoes bumped against cavanaugh in turn cavanaugh slid faster feeling the seat of his pants threaten to tear as prescotts shoes bumped harder against him and cavanaugh slid even faster he tumbled onto the wet floor rolling free just before prescott slammed to a halt but before cavanaugh could check that prescott was all right he drew his weapon and crouched on guard against the man whod yelled from below the catwalk a wall seemed to move immediately cavanaugh realized it was derelicts cowering in the shadows he saw huge boxes where they slept and garbage bags filled with god knew what the stench of urine and feces was overwhelming a few crack addicts stepped forward from above gunshots made them scramble back into the shadows bullets whacked the floor the gunmen cant see us cavanaugh thought theyre shooting blindly if i return fire theyll see my muzzle flashes and know where to aim water from the roof fell around him he looked behind him noticed a door and dragged prescott to his feet but when cavanaugh tested the door he found that it was locked mentally cursing he searched for another way out saw a stairway that led down to the ground level and tugged prescott toward it for all he knew gunmen would be waiting down there but he had to take the chance it had been less than twenty minutes since he and prescott had met he had no idea who prescott was or why these men wanted to kill him he wasnt even sure hed have accepted the assignment after hed finished questioning prescott and made a risk assessment for one thing he had only prescotts word that he wasnt a drug trafficker or any of the other monsters cavanaugh refused to protect but none of that mattered any longer the attack had made cavanaughs choice for him he and prescott were now protector and protected as he guided prescott down the stairs into deeper shadows he rapidly did a tactical reload taking the partially depleted magazine from his pistol pocketing it and inserting a full one from his belt the stench became more nauseating prescott moved so frantically that his footsteps echoed loudly no cavanaugh thought theyll hear us and shoot he could only hope that the rumble of the rain on the roof would obscure the noises they made his hope was illfounded shots roared from above blasting more chunks from the wall hurrying prescott to the bottom cavanaugh froze at the sight of another cluster of derelicts he aimed unable to distinguish those who were truly homeless from those who might be a threat most had already cowered from the shots on the floor above and the sudden descent of strangers into their midst the sight of cavanaughs pistol made them cower even more a few others however had the look of jackals waiting for their prey to become distracted but none drew handguns or assault rifles even though they would have a good chance against one armed man and the client he was doing everything possible to protect cavanaugh heard loud angry voices above him and the sound of the catwalk scraping as if some of the gunmen were trying to descend the way cavanaugh and prescott had the rest of the assault team would be charging down the stairs toward the outside door they would race through the rain burst into the warehouse scatter its ragged occupants and continue hunting meanwhile some of the assault team would rush to the opposite side of the warehouse in case cavanaugh and prescott tried to escape in that direction but the gunmen couldnt possibly have moved fast enough to reach there yet aiming toward the ragged men cavanaugh motioned for prescott to follow him toward where a rusted door lay next to an opening on the river side of the warehouse but then he realized that even if part of the assault team hadnt had time to reach that side a few marksmen could be watching from upper windows ready to fire through the broken glass we wouldnt have a chance he thought rain gusted through the opening gray light beckoned a tugboats horn blared from the river so close again cavanaugh imagined the gunmen bursting into the warehouse scattering its ragged occupants hunting for scattering prescott follow me back to where we were but arent we leaving when i tell you cavanaugh led prescott into the middle of the area he faced the ragged men ive got a job for everybody they looked baffled a few even looked as frightened of the word job as they were of the pistol in his hand thunder rumbled your first step on the road to selfsufficiency they looked more baffled it requires no skills and if everything goes as planned ill send a truck here tomorrow with food and clothes for all of you you cant ask for a better deal than that they looked at cavanaugh as if he spoke an incomprehensible language so what do you think are you ready to start working they kept staring great cavanaugh said now this is all you have to do you see that opening over there it leads toward other warehouses and then the river what i want you to do is prescott what put your hands over your ears no questions this time prescott obeyed what i want everybody to do cavanaugh told the group is keep thinking of the food and clothes youll get tomorrow andcavanaugh raised his pistolrun in that direction they stared blankly run when they didnt move he fired the pistol over their heads in the shadows the muzzle flash was vivid the eartorturing roar making the group stumble back run cavanaughs own ears were punished as he fired twice more above their heads and now terror made them move a little faster desperate to get away from the madman with the gun the next time cavanaugh fired over their heads did the trick they broke into a fullsized panic and scrambled toward the exit bumping into one another they charged out into the rain follow them cavanaugh told prescott to increase momentum cavanaugh fired one last time so terrifying the group that unheeding they charged through the storm there must have been thirty of them at least scurrying for whatever shelter they could find he urged prescott to keep running with them hoping that the chaos would distract the assault team enough to make them hold fire he felt the cold rain drench him as he and prescott rushed down a concrete ramp and across a garbagestrewn parking area scarecrows ran everywhere around them ahead some ducked through a gap in a chainlink fence splashing through puddles cavanaugh led prescott toward the hole he put his hand on prescotts head protecting it as he shoved him through ducking after him he felt frozen by more than the rain because with just a few derelicts around them now he and prescott were obvious targets the only things in their favor were the distance and the difficulty of aiming at moving targets from an elevated position blam a shot from behind them tore up pavement prescott that warehouse ahead blam more pavement disintegrated almost there prescott blam a chunk of pavement zapped past cavanaughs forehead move it prescott cavanaugh couldnt allow himself to run as fast as he was able he had to match prescotts pace shouting encouragement grabbing prescotts arm when the heavy man seemed in danger of faltering even so cavanaughs lungs burned from exertion as they rounded the warehouse corner shielded by the wall prescott bent over and shuddered gulping air we did it he managed to say i cant believe we keep moving but i have to catch my no time lets go cavanaugh tugged prescott he studied the warehouse its windows werent broken boxes were stacked inside still in business he thought as the rain lanced against him he came to a door and tried it locked although it was only midafternoon no lights glowed inside he didnt see any movement not surprising on a sunday afternoon he managed to yank prescott into a halfrun bringing him to the front of the building where they faced smaller buildings and then the stormshrouded river although those other buildings had been maintained also none showed any activity there might be a watchman somewhere but cavanaugh didnt see him and for sure he wasnt going to shout to get the watchmans attention that would also attract the assault teams attention by now they had to be converging on this area as the rain made cavanaughs clothes stick to his skin causing him to shiver he frantically considered and rejected options he could pick the lock on a door and try to hide with prescott in one of the buildings but every door he saw had a barred window all the assault team would need to do was look through each window the splashes of water that he and prescott couldnt possibly avoid leaving on the floor inside would tell their hunters which building theyd chosen to hide in with a hand on prescotts arm cavanaugh moved along the deserted rainy street the seething dark clouds and the shadows from the warehouses turned afternoon into violent dusk thatll give us some cover he thought but it wont be enough tensely aware that he and prescott couldnt stay in the open he looked for a hiding place a dumpster briefly attracted his attention but it was full and anyway it would only be another trap eventually the gunmen would check it have to rest prescott murmured fatigue and his weight outmatched his fear now making him plod soon thrusting him farther along the street cavanaugh reconsidered picking the lock on one of the doors it would take a while for the assault team to discover which building hed chosen it would take them even longer to search inside and discover where he and prescott were hiding meanwhile he could use his cell phone to get help from protective services possibly the explosion and the shots had caused someone in the area to phone the police but the explosion might also have been attributed to thunder or a lightning strike as for the shots perhaps the storm had muffled them or perhaps they were common in this rundown neighborhood in any case if the police did arrive theyd be a complication more than a help after all since the gunmen had disguised themselves as crack addicts could a few members of the assault team not also disguise themselves as police officers cavanaugh wouldnt know if he could trust them it was safer to depend on protective services hed phone duncan a rescue team could arrive in when fifteen minutes unlikely a half hour maybe but not guaranteed and how would the rescue team be able to determine which of the several buildings was the one in which they were hiding we have to keep moving cavanaugh thought he had his right hand on his pistol and his left on prescotts soaked shirt pulling him through the rain ahead another chainlink fence caught his attention but this one was intact it had a stout metal gate with a lock next to it a sign on a building read wilson brothers construction contractors shivering from the cold he led prescott closer to the fence and saw two forklifts a dump truck a pickup truck and a beatup rustcolored sedan that looked to be twenty years old please let there be gas in it cavanaugh removed his lock picks from a slit beneath the collar of his soaked jacket he felt increasingly vulnerable as he holstered his pistol chose two picks that would fit the lock and worked both of them one applying torque while the other freed the locks pins ten seconds later he had the gate open no sooner had he tugged prescott into the parking area and closed the gate than several men raced between two warehouses down the street he heard their urgent footfalls and angry voices as he forced prescott down behind the rustcolored sedan barely noticing that the vehicles color was due to actual rust and not paint he tried the drivers door and found it unlocked the construction company must have thought the fence was sufficient protection for a car that looked like junk the voices of the men sounded nearer if they get to the fence if they notice it isnt locked rain misting his eyes cavanaugh opened the door he slid into the passenger seat faced the steering column braced his feet against it and used both hands to yank on the steering wheel breaking the internal lock that kept the steering wheel from moving he pulled the hoodrelease lever and scrambled into the rain hurrying to lift the hood a bundle of wires led into the engine compartment from the steering column knowing the wires he needed he pulled a safety pin from under his collar pierced the wires so they formed a circuit and closed the pin over them the engine started the sound made the men rush closer their footsteps and voices more audible now no longer caring about making noise cavanaugh slammed the hood and shoved prescott into the car put on your seat belt he rammed the gearshift into drive and stomped the gas pedal roll down your window the rusted car surprised cavanaugh by rocketing forward with amazing energy somebody had obviously cared for the engine even though the body had been allowed to go to hell roll down your window cavanaugh shouted again to prescott and prescottconditioned by nowinstantly obeyed slide toward the floor cavanaugh drew his pistol as the car struck the fence headlights shattering the fence slamming open to the right cavanaugh fired repeatedly through prescotts open window at two nearby gunmen theyd been coming to check the fence as it slammed open theyd halted in openmouthed shock and now lurched back from the impact of cavanaughs bullets the slide on his pistol stayed open the magazine was empty but as he steered violently to the left to get away from other gunmen suddenly appearing he couldnt free his hands to reload the sig with the remaining magazine on his belt hed have to rely on the hed taken from prescott he pulled it from under his belt and dropped it on the seat but as things were he didnt have time to shoot anyhow he was too busy trying to control the car it fishtailed on the wet oily pavement the rain struck the windshield so hard that he could barely see the narrow street ahead with his left hand he fumbled for the windshieldwiper control on the steering wheel twisted it and discovered that only the wiper on the drivers side was functional it only had one speed ultrafast as the wiper flipped hysterically back and forth a bullet shattered the sedans rear window and went through the roof just above cavanaughs head he sank low trying to peer over the dashboard at the rainobscured street trying also to make himself a minimal target even though he knew that the bullets aimed at the trunk had a good chance of plowing through the trunk through the backseat and through the front seat possibly hitting him he didnt care if the assault team shot at the gas tank which the gauge on the dashboard told him was threequarters full true the bullet holes would cause him to lose fuel but unless the gunmen were using tracer rounds which they werent there wasnt any risk that the fuel would explode that impossible phenomenon of bullets igniting gasoline happened only in urban myth if anything the fuel in the tank could help him by slowing any bullets that hit it and preventing them from plowing through the seats the better tactic would be for the assault team to shoot at cavanaughs tires but even then the damage would be much less than what might generally be expected a blast from a shotgun or a volley from an automatic rifle could blow a tire apart but if a tire was hit by one or two bullets from a handgun the tire usually retained air for about five miles a distance that would give cavanaugh a chance to elude the assault team if necessary hed been forced to do this a couple of times he would keep driving on a wheels metal rim another bullet smashed through the rear window this one blew through the front windshield cavanaugh heard it zip past he felt the air forced away strike his cheek but he couldnt think about how close it had come and he couldnt think about prescott huddling as near to the floor as the bulky man could press himself what cavanaugh concentrated on was trying to see past the rain and the blur of the superquick windshield wiper as he drove faster a long black car sped from a side street and skidded to a stop blocking the narrow intersection ahead men jumped out into the storm and aimed pistols from behind the vehicle but before they could shoot they realized that instead of trapping cavanaugh theyd trapped themselves for cavanaugh didnt have time to stop their look of confidence changing to one of panic they bolted toward buildings on either side prescott brace yourself theres going to be a hell of a bump as cavanaugh sped toward the car blocking the intersection he saw enough through the rain to be certain that there wasnt space on either side of the car for him to swing around it that left only two choices the first was to yank the lever for the parking brake and twist the steering wheel a quarter turn spinning the car degrees facing it in the opposite direction the socalled bootleggers turn he would then release the parking brake and speed from the barricade but that wouldnt solve anything because the new direction would only lead back to the gunmen chasing them besides the slippery pavement would make it difficult to execute the maneuver with precision that left choice number two cavanaugh checked the speedometer sixty too fast sweating he eased his foot off the accelerator and tried to keep his moist hands firmly at ten oclock and two oclock on the steering wheel his fingers spread for maximum grip it was obvious that if he hit the car straight on he would probably kill prescott and himselfan irresistible force against an immovable mass but there was a way to survive the crash what he had to do was change the relationship between the force and the mass here it comes prescott hold on reducing his speed to fortyfive miles an hour cavanaugh stared past the frantic windshield wiper toward the vehicle spread sideways in front of him he aimed toward where the vehicle had the least weightthe trunk end which was on his right he focused on the rear fender at the same time he turned so far to the right that only the area around his left headlight would strike the cars fender the impact sent a shock wave of punishment through him prepared for his head to jerk back he hunkered down bracing his head against the seat even then the jolt to his neck was painful instead of percent force hitting percent mass the precise way in which cavanaugh rammed the other vehicle reduced both factors by twothirds more glass shattered metal crumpled the opposing car pivoted in front of cavanaugh its trunk end swerving out of the way creating a gap through which cavanaugh increased speed stomping his foot on the accelerator behind him the assault team overcame their shock enough to fire at the receding vehicle cavanaugh stayed low hearing bullets whump against the back of the car some of them going through the nowalmostnonexistent front windshield one bullet whacked into the dashboard another blew away the spastic windshield wiper as rain lashed through the gap where the windshield had been cavanaugh continued speeding down the narrow street he heard sirens in the distance prescott are you all right no answer between gusts of wind cavanaugh saw a looming intersection and eased his foot onto the brake pedal so he could make a turn the slippery pavement caused the tires to slide as if on ice he released his foot from the brake simultaneously applying less force to the accelerator letting the engine act as a brake even so the intersection was behind him before he could make the turn prescott talk to me are you all right huddled close to the floor prescott moved glad to know youre still with us as the distant sirens wailed louder another intersection loomed and this time cavanaugh was able to control his speed enough to stop the tires from gliding as he turned to the right not a target at the moment he felt marginally elated as he asked prescott are you hit no then get up here and make yourself useful dont feel so good ive had better days too look i need to concentrate on driving take my phone from my jacket and call this number cavanaugh dictated it then give me back the phone so i can get help yes help prescott said and then cavanaugh said youre going to tell me who the hell those guys are and why theyre so eager to kill you theyre not eager to kill me prescott said what they want me alive abruptly cavanaugh felt a deeper chill than that caused by the rain blowing in on him as he checked the rearview mirror to see if the assault team was in pursuit his sense of reality shifted dramatically making him think of the attack in an entirely different way in the warehouse when the gunmen had fired cavanaugh had believed that the shadows and the rain falling through the roof had thrown off the attackers aim now he realized that the bullets had in fact been carefully placed trying to stop prescott but not to kill him if anyone was a shoottokill target i was cavanaugh thought it was now clear to him that the bullets aimed toward the car had been directed toward the drivers side toward him not toward prescott the only indiscriminate part of the attack had been the rocket aimed toward the brickedover window but that too could be explained in retrospect cavanaugh realized that the explosive force of the rocket had been less than normal the damage it inflicted to the building should have been far more extensive the shells power had been reduced in the hopes that it would stun not kill sure gratified to see traffic through the rain cavanaugh steered from the warehouses and reached decrepit houses near a highway they disguised themselves as crack addicts blending with their surroundings hoping to catch you by surprise when i showed up they realized the situation was about to change and quickly adjusted their time table attacking before they were ready ahead the sirens grew louder use my cell phone cavanaugh repeated press the numbers i gave you prescott finally did here its ringing on the other end as cavanaugh released his right hand from the steering wheel and took the phone he decided to test prescott by saying those sirens dont you want me to go to the police no prescott said why not no police prescott emphasized before cavanaugh could question him further he heard duncans voice say global protective services this is cavanaugh im in condition red cavanaugh imagined duncan sitting ramrodstraight the wind and the roar of the broken muffler made it difficult for cavanaugh to hear what duncan said next the location transmitter in your taurus isnt functioning i cant find you on the screen the taurus is history prescott and i are in a stolen car working to control the vehicle with his left hand cavanaugh pressed the cell phone harder to his ear give me your location im going to voice encryption cavanaugh pressed a button at the bottom of the phone which activated a scrambler if the men in the pursuing cars had cellphone scanners they wouldnt be able to overhear im still in newark he continued heading away from the river i see a lot of traffic ahead but i cant identify the highway how many assailants tension made duncans voice sound tight maybe eight are they in pursuit im not sure i might have speeding past more dismal houses toward the highway cavanaugh peered again toward his rearview mirror he was about to finish his sentence with lost them when two cars skidded around a gloomy corner back there and rushed in his direction yes he said theyre in pursuit cavanaugh reached the access ramp and saw a sign im heading north on route twentyone he saw another sign the me carter highway if youre leaving the river and moving north on twentyonecavanaugh imagined duncan scanning a map on a computer screenkeep going in that direction in about ten miles youll intersect with route three head east then north on seventeen can you make it to teterboro duncan meant the teterboro airport the fourthimportant airport in the new york city area after kennedy la guardia and newark international located where routes and converged near interstate in new jersey teterboro was twelve miles from midtown manhattan via the george washington bridge it was designated a reliever airstrip which meant that corporate charter and private aircraft used it taking pressure off the larger airports and the large passenger carriers they served because many of global protective services clients were corporate executives the agency had an office and a helicopter at the airport although these had logos for atlas avionics a protective services subsidiary im in the teterboro office now duncans voice crackled from the storms interference were doing a handover translation after having been protected while in manhattan a client was being transferred from an armored car to the clients corporate jet where nonprotective services agents would take over when the jet left the ground the assignment was completed can you get here id better cavanaugh studied the fuel gauge which had dropped from threequarters to half indicating how much gas he was losing from bullet holes in the tank call back in ten minutes duncan said by then ill have rendezvous specifics cavanaugh broke the transmission and put the phone down beside the on the seat he stared toward the rearview mirror and saw the two pursuing cars merge onto the highway because of the storm most cars had their headlights on but these cars stayed dark as they sped past traffic the sirens receded into the distance prescott you didnt answer my question cavanaugh wiped rain from his face and concentrated to pass a transport truck why dont you want me to go to the police they wouldnt know what to do with us guns a stolen car christ prescotts face had lost some of its puffiness tension shrinking it theyd question us on the street theyd question us at the station when they finally let me go the people who want me wouldve had time to get ready again true cavanaugh wiped more rain from his face but i get the feeling youve got another reason for not going to the police the same reason i wouldnt go to the drug enforcement administration i dont trust anything to do with the government the drug enforcement administration what have they got to do with cavanaugh had a sudden sick feeling that prescott might be a monster after all the men chasing us work for jesus escobar fear made prescotts face the color of his soiled white shirt cavanaugh felt even sicker jesus escobar was one of the biggest drug lords in south america he took another quick look at the rearview mirror and saw that the cars chasing him were drawing closer you promised me this has nothing to do with drugs i dont protect drug dealers i told you i wasnt a drug dealer thats the truth but i didnt say this has nothing to do with drugs youre not making sense have you ever heard of dp bio lab no his tires sprayed a haze of water from the pavement as cavanaugh sped past another transport truck the dp stands for daniel prescott its minea sophisticated biotech research facility the pupils of prescotts eyes grew larger with fear as he stared back through the rain toward the two pursuing cars if you had heard of dp bio lab id have been concerned most of my work is for the government cavanaugh suddenly had an uneasy feeling about what he was going to hear as part of the latest antidrug campaign i was hired to do research on the parts of the brain involved with addiction emotion made prescott speak quickly addictions immensely complicated it isnt clear whether some people become addicted for psychological or physical reasons prescott spoke faster different personalities become addicted to different effects passives go for depressants active types crave stimulants sometimes its the reverse the pursuit cars were now a hundred yards behind the rusted sedan the idea was prescott said if i could find a common denominator a physical trigger common to all of them in the cerebral cortex for example or the hypothalamus there might be a way to stop that trigger from functioning the addiction wouldnt happen the pursuit cars were now close enough that in the rearview mirror cavanaugh could see there were four men in each one driver had a mustache another had shaved his head their eyes had the determination of manhunters and did you find itthe addiction trigger no cavanaugh tried to anticipate how the gunmen would handle this they want prescott alive he thought they wont shoot at me not driving this fast they dont want to cause an accident thatll kill prescott their only choice is to force me off the road i didnt find a trigger that could be disabled to prevent addiction prescott said what i found instead god help me is an easytomanufacture chemical that can instantly cause an addiction to itself its cheap to produce it doesnt require elaborate equipment and the manufacturing process doesnt have toxic side effects or cause explosions and fires the way some illegal drugs can cavanaugh stared again toward the rearview mirror speeding through the rain the pursuit cars were now only twenty yards behind the sedan as soon as i reported my findings prescott said the agency i worked for became so alarmed they terminated the research program one of the cars positioned itself behind the sedan while the other came up on cavanaughs left theyre going to try to box us in and push us off the road cavanaugh thought suddenly the dea showed up and confiscated my research prescott said they swore my lab assistants and me to secrecy not that my lab assistants are a security risk im the only one who knows the formula cavanaugh studied traffic ahead and made a quick decision prescotts voice shook his words gushed out but escobar must have an informant in the dea my research is so well guarded there that even escobars people cant breach it that leaves me they want to capture me and force me to tell them the formula for gods sake why didnt the dea try to protect you they did but escobars people attempted to capture me anyhow i think somebody at the dea works for him and told him where i was the team guarding me was attacked i barely escaped a kidnapping attempt thats when i took advantage of the confusion and slipped away managing to reach the warehouse which youd set up earlier in case cavanaugh said but i couldnt stay there forever id have run out of food i wanted people to talk to im tired of being afraid ill do my best to fix that cavanaugh rolled down his window in addition to the rain he heard the car coming up next to him do you know how to load a pistol no it figures cavanaugh thought hed been about to give prescott one of the sigs spare magazines and have him reload the weapon now there wasnt time to explain what to do cavanaugh was going to have to rely on prescotts the car on cavanaughs left came abreast of the sedan and slammed against its side make sure your seat belts tight cavanaugh said quickly the car struck the drivers side again cavanaugh heard metal crumble concentrating to control his steering with his left hand he used his right hand to pick up the this pistol had better work he transferred the to his left hand and now controlled the steering wheel with his right the car on the left struck cavanaughs side a third time trying to force him onto the highways shoulder feeling the shudder of the impact cavanaugh thumbed off the safety on the cocked their mass being equal two cars can bang at each others side for quite a while and if the drivers are skilled neither car will be forced off the road the trouble is that the car banging at cavanaughs rusted sedan was bigger and heavier the laws of physics were in its favor eventually its weight would shove cavanaughs sedan onto the shoulder he could have shot the driver but as the attacking car veered out of control there was too much risk that it would strike cars behind it and kill their occupants moreover the bullets could go through the driver and continue toward cars on the opposite side of the highway possibly killing someone over there but there was another way to use the prescott put your hands over your ears cavanaughs own ears had been ringing incessantly since hed started shooting now he prepared himself for them to hurt even more pressing the accelerator hard he surged forward abreast of the attacking cars engine he shoved the out the window aimed at the front hood and fired seven times emptying the pistol as quickly as he could pull the trigger under the hood the fan disintegrated the radiator exploded oil and carbon dust blew from the engine erupting from the holes that his bullets had made in the hood of the engine steam from the radiator burst from the front of the car the slide on top of the stayed back indicating that the pistol was empty at once cavanaugh pulled the weapon back into the sedan so the gunmen would know the shooting was over so they wouldnt return fire as it was they had plenty to concern them without disobeying escobars orders and endangering prescotts life by shooting at the driver of the vehicle prescott was in the power of the had damaged the engine enough that the attacking car rapidly lost speed falling back enveloped by more oil vapor and steam the crippled vehicle angled toward the left shoulder the car behind cavanaugh tried to compensate by speeding close to him and slamming the sedans back bumper apart from sending a shudder through the sedan this had no effect on cavanaughs ability to control the vehicle although the tactic looked dramatic it accomplished little when the pursuing car hit cavanaughs bumper a second time all he had to do was touch the brake pedal a little and the car behind him was reduced to doing little more than pushing him that the attacking driver thought ramming would work told cavanaugh that his opponent didnt have much experience with car fighting there was only one effective maneuver in a car fight but first cavanaugh had to get into position he veered unexpectedly onto the right shoulder and pressed the brakes applying most but not all of their force he could tell how much force he was applying by judging the speed of the brake pulses through the pedal ninetyeight percent pressure gave him stopping power while at the same time allowing him to continue to control the vehicles steering one hundred percent would have meant that the swiftly accelerating pulses had abruptly stopped and the brakes locked turning the sedan into little more than a couple of tons of skidding metal he dropped behind the pursuing car released the brakes and came up behind it still on the highways shoulder aiming his left front fender he tapped the side of the opposing cars right rear fender in the socalled precision immobilization technique the pit maneuver required virtually no force just a kiss of the left front fender again physics took over the opposing car spun degrees rear to front the startled occupants staring back toward cavanaugh facetoface with him at the same time the car shifted sideways to the right pivoting onto the highways shoulder but as it continued to spin it moved so far to the right that it crashed against a barrier at the side of the highway meanwhile cavanaugh steered onto the highway and sped forward prescott look behind us are there any other cars going off the road any accidents prescott peered back in amazement no my god some cars are sliding but theyre holding the road no other accidents i cant believe you did it you got us away from them no cavanaugh said but the pit maneuver barely damages the other car cavanaugh said the what unless that car broke something when its side struck that barrier those menll soon come after us again cavanaugh stared toward the fuel indicator on the dashboard the needle was now at onequarter plus weve got too many bullet holes in the gas tank well soon be on empty in the distance a new group of sirens wailed cavanaugh checked the rearview mirror no sign of the second car pulling onto the highway he peered ahead through the rain and saw an exit ramp he was far enough along the highway that the men in the car behind him might not notice the rusted sedan leaving or so he hoped the sirens wailed louder time for a change of plan cavanaugh took the exit ramp came to the bottom saw a shopping mall on the left and headed toward its crowded parking lot people in other cars gaped at the smashed front end of cavanaughs car prescott use your shirtsleeve wipe everything you touched smudge your fingerprints counting on the rain to obscure his movements cavanaugh entered the expansive parking lot but every space in the row he chose was filled cursing he steered through puddles toward the next row where all the spaces were also full sure he thought a rainy sunday afternoon how do people pass the time they go to the shopping mall cavanaugh tried the next row and the next and the next all were filled with vehicles in the distance the sirens stopped presumably at the car whose engine cavanaugh had disabled the black car suddenly steered into the row cavanaugh was headed along and sped toward him through the cars flapping windshield wipers the three passengers and the skinhead driver glared at him cavanaugh braked put the car in reverse and started backing away but not before a man on the passenger side lowered the window and leaned out into the rain aiming a pistol with a silencer on it cavanaugh didnt hear the shot but he did hear the bullets impact against the radiator steam rose from the puncture whump a second bullet hit the radiator the assault team had learned from the way cavanaugh had disabled the first car by firing the at the engine and the radiator the pistol the passenger used wasnt large enough to be a it wouldnt damage the engine as much but it would definitely play hell with the radiator backing swiftly cavanaugh swung the steering wheel pivoting the sedan degrees in the limited space on wet pavement he couldnt execute the backward half spin as neatly as he was capable of doing his right front fender glanced off a parked vans taillight sending a shudder through the sedan even so in a rush he corrected the steering and now faced the mall instead of the pursuing car he rammed the gearshift into forward and sped along the row but as rain suppressed the steam from the radiator cavanaugh felt his chest cramp when a woman holding an umbrella stepped from between cars she walked halfway across the open area and froze at the sight of cavanaughs car rocketing toward her never look at what youre trying to avoid always look at where you want the car to go cavanaughs instructors had drilled that rule into him at the bill scott raceway in west virginia where global protective services and various intelligence agencies sent their operators for training in evasive driving why is it that in many accidents cars get hit directly on the side or the front as if there wasnt any attempt to evade them duncan had demanded from the passenger seat cavanaugh hadnt been able to answer too busy rounding a curve at miles an hour why is it that if a driver hits a patch of ice and skids off the road the only telephone pole for a hundred yards or the only tree in a field will be what that driver slams into square on again cavanaugh hadnt been able to answer too busy feeling the hum and pulse of his cars tires knowing that if the hum sounded any higher if the pulse got any faster his tires would lose their grip on the curve and hed fly off the raceway duncan had answered for him because the driver looks at the car that veers in front of him or the driver looks at the telephone pole at the side of the road or the driver looks at the tree in the middle of the field and although the driver wants to avoid them he hits the damned things why does he hit them because he looks at them cavanaugh had finally managed to answer speeding out of the curve yes you steer where your eyes lead you if you look at what youre trying to avoid youll head in that direction suddenly a large cardboard box had hurtled across the track in front of cavanaugh startled hed looked at it and almost steered toward it with a flick of his eyes hed stared forward again and managed to remain on the track his speeding car had veered only slightly as he passed where the box flew into a ditch he thought hed seen a rope on the box did somebody hide at the side of the track and yank that box across cavanaugh had rushed into another curve eighty percent of the beginning students here see that box and follow it into the ditch duncan had replied so whats the lesson look at where you want to go not at what youre afraid youll hit yes now cavanaugh stared past the paralyzed woman toward rain splashing a puddle beyond her dont move lady cavanaugh stepped on the brakes feeling their pulses through the pedal judging their increasing frequency at what he estimated was percent stopping power he kept his foot steady any more pressure and the brakes would lock making it impossible for him to control the direction of the sedan but as long as the brakes werent locked he could steer the car while reducing speed he was so close to the paralyzed woman that he saw how huge the pupils of her eyes had become as he twisted the steering wheel to the right no dont look at her look at the rain in the puddle beyond her cavanaugh felt the car threaten to slide out of control on the wet pavement at once the sedan shifted to the right the way he wanted continuing to stare toward where he wanted to go toward the puddle he twisted the steering wheel to the left now veering around the woman sensing her umbrella zip past him as his car reached the puddle and he released the brake for a heartskipping moment as cavanaugh jerked his gaze up toward his rearview mirror he feared that the pursuing car would hit her but the near miss had broken the womans paralysis she raced toward cars at the side just before the black car sped past her splashing water from a puddle drenching her wary of other pedestrians who might suddenly appear cavanaugh sped along the row heading toward the mall he steered to the left toward one of the malls entrances a group of glass doors beckoning on prescotts side of the car prescott open your door were bailing out but do it cavanaugh skidded to a stop in front of the doors he grabbed the sig and the now behind him he heard the black car speeding close as he and prescott charged into the mall two levels high the place was warm dry and bright packed with shoppers loud with conversations but all cavanaugh paid attention to was an electronics store immediately on his left in there he told prescott the black car would stop at the rusted sedan cavanaugh knew the three passengers would rush into the mall the driver would stay with the car and use his cell phone to keep in touch with the gunmen as they tried to find where cavanaugh and prescott had gone that way the driver could be alerted to speed to another section of the mall if cavanaugh and prescott tried to leave via other doors urging prescott toward the electronics store cavanaugh shoved the under his belt frantic to get out of sight before the gunmen rushed into the mall he held the sig close to him hiding it he ejected its empty magazine put it in a pocket shoved in a fresh one from the pouch on the left side of his belt and pressed the lever that allowed the slide on top to snap forward chambering a round moving he did all this without thinking with a sureness that came from hundreds of training exercises a young clerk in the electronics store looked puzzled by the haste with which cavanaugh and prescott entered water dripping from them may i help you holding the sig out of sight beneath his jacket cavanaugh tugged prescott past the clerk past harshly lit rows of televisions video tape recorders and dvd players what were looking for is in the back of the store the clerk hurried to follow if youll show me what it is ill be glad to help great cavanaugh and prescott squeezed past customers approaching a counter in the rear the counter had a door on the left cavanaugh nudged prescott past the counter and opened the door sir the clerk said customers arent allowed in the storeroom but this is what were looking for pulling prescott into the storeroom cavanaugh closed the door and locked it sir a muffled voice objected cavanaugh spun toward palely illuminated shelves stacked with boxes containing vhs and dvd players lets go prescott hearing the knob being turned and then someone pounding on the door cavanaugh headed toward a metal door on the opposite wall hed seen the outside of that door when hed stopped at the malls entrance he knew that the law required exterior doors in commercial establishments to have locks that could be easily freed so that people wouldnt be trapped if there was a fire this door was secured by a simple dead bolt he twisted the locks knob while the gunmen searched the mall cavanaugh and prescott rushed out into the rain at the curb the black car its engine running was parked behind the rusted sedan as cavanaugh expected the skinhead driver stared toward the glass doors through which his companions had hurried again as cavanaugh expected by the time the driver noticed movement next to him cavanaugh had run in a crouch through the gloom using the rusted sedan and the steam from it to conceal his approach he drew the which was useful to him now only as a blunt object he could afford to risk damaging and slammed its barrel against the cars passenger window beads of safety glass burst inward over the startled skinhead as cavanaugh aimed his sig at him and saw that the mans cell phone and pistol were on the seat next to him along with a zippo lighter and a pack of cigarettes the motor kept running out cavanaugh told him with his gloved hands on the steering wheel the frightened skinhead glanced toward the pistol on the seat out cavanaugh shouted terrified the skinhead continued to stare at the pistol on the seat cavanaugh pulled the sigs trigger and blew a hole in the ceiling flinching the skinhead hurried from the car run cavanaugh fired above the drivers bare scalp making him race faster through the rain as he headed along the side of the mall prescott get in as prescott obeyed cavanaugh ran around to the open drivers door but before he got in he grabbed the cigarette lighter off the seat he ignited it and threw it under the back of the sedan where the lighter was protected from the rain and where gasoline from the perforated fuel tank had pooled immediately vapor erupted into flames that spread along the bottom of the sedan he hurried into the black car put the gearshift into drive and sped away looking in his rearview mirror he saw the rusted sedan heave as its gas tank filled mostly with fumes detonated it didnt explode contrary to popular belief no huge fireball no roar as if tons of tnt had gone off just a whump and an energetic burst of flame in fact if the gas tank had contained mostly fuel there wouldnt have been enough oxygen for it to explode the car would have kept burning only on the outside taking one last look at his rearview mirror cavanaugh saw three angry men charge out of the mall it seemed to him that like the skinhead driver they wore gloves then he reached the street beyond the parking lot and couldnt see them any longer he sped toward the ramp that led back to the highway it was a luxury to have a car with an intact windshield and two functioning wipers prescotts bulky chest heaved he clamped his hands to it are you all right cavanaugh accessed the highway staying in the right lane trying to blend with traffic youre not having a heart attack are you no just cant get my out of breath out of condition cavanaugh said youve got to take better care of yourself to calm prescott cavanaugh prompted him to imagine a future scenario one in which hed be safe after we make you disappear youll have plenty of chances to get some exercise exercise even that would be welcome in the distance yet another group of sirens wailed although cavanaugh wanted to get to the teterboro airport as fast as possible he kept his speed under the limit so he wouldnt attract attention its good to be somewhere dry again cavanaugh was trying to calm prescott and warm yes cavanaughs wet clothes were cold against his skin the driver had kept the cars heater on cavanaugh felt air from it waft over him prescott shivered turn the heater up cavanaugh said adjust the blower as high as itll go hands shaking prescott fumbled at the controls on the dashboard you set fire to the car aswhat a distraction partly the police will have to waste time while they deal with the fire and try to figure out what happened you said partly prescotts puffy forehead wrinkled you had another reason our fingerprints cavanaugh again checked his rearview mirror originally i planned to abandon the car in the parking lot it wouldnt have been noticed for a while wed have had a chance to wipe our prints before we ran from the area and called for help but then the other car showed up and this way with the fire we dont have to worry about our prints believe me the police would have dusted for them and they would have been able to identify us not a good idea when you want to disappear and i want to stay invisible cavanaugh what i dont know your first name i dont have one cavanaugh is the only name i go by a work name i never give my real name it would endanger the people i protect a pseudonym you know some of the trade jargon relieved that prescotts breathing was less agitated cavanaugh didnt mind distracting him by answering harmless questions one way for an opponent to get at a client would be to learn the identities of the clients protectors what would that accomplish the opponent could discover where the protectors live whether they have relatives and so on you see the liability prescotts ample chin wavered as he nodded the opponent could kill the bodyguards where they live when theyre off duty when theyre not as alert and the new team the client hires wouldnt be up to speed on how to maintain his security the client becomes a viable target cavanaugh said prescott nodded again or else the opponent kidnaps the bodyguards relatives and puts pressure on the bodyguards to lessen the clients security you catch on quick people close to me cant be threatened if the bad guys dont know who the people close to me are because the bad guys dont know who i am cavanaugh said you have a family no cavanaugh replied lying you referred to bodyguards thats not what i am then the technical term is protective agent whats the distinction bodyguards are thugs theyre what mobsters use crude muscle but what you do as youve proven requires sophisticated talents thank you what you went through to save me is the bravest thing ive ever seen no cavanaugh said not brave i cant think what else to call it conditioned between them the skinheads cell phone buzzed prescott flinched the phone buzzed again press the answer button cavanaugh said then give it to me uneasy prescott obeyed steering expertly with his left hand cavanaugh held the phone against his right ear pizza hut cutea sandpapery voice said thanks not the pizza hut thing i meant about setting fire to your car and stealing ours i know what you meant prescott watched intently trying to figure out what cavanaugh was hearing this wont stop us well keep coming the voice said i expect that cavanaugh said into the phone youre not a cop youd have called for backup instead you kept clear of police cars you must be private security give it up youre way out of your league gee i thought id done pretty good so far did prescott tell you who youre dealing with he hasnt had time to tell me anything cavanaugh lied the transmission was weak the shots had made his ears ring enough that he had to press the phone tighter against his ear so he could distinguish what the voice said next if you dont know anything we can cut you some slack give him to us and well let you go say it again this time as if you mean it the voice sounded weary youd be dead now if you hadnt been near prescott this has to be the only time the guy we were after was a shield for his bodyguard protector what im not a bodyguard whatever the voice became harsher the next time i see you youd better pray youre close to prescott otherwise ill put a bullet through your head does that sound like i mean it is that the reason you phoned to make cheap threats the voice became silent cavanaugh suddenly understood what was going on lots of cheese right what your pizza will be ready in fifteen minutes cavanaugh risked taking his eyes off the road long enough to press the disconnect button a pickup truck loaded with junk drove past him he lowered his window and tossed the phone into the back of the truck what are you doing prescott asked escobars men didnt call just for the hell of it they want to make certain were with the phone but why would the phone must have some kind of location transmitter in it theyll follow it hoping it leads them to us now itll take them nowhere for all i know this car has a location transmitter also but right now theres nothing i can do about that why didnt you kill this cars driver prescott asked what cavanaugh frowned at the unexpected question back at the mall you took a chance when you told him to run he might have reached for his weapon prescott said a dead man in the car would have slowed us id have had to pull him from behind the steering wheel the other men might have found us before we could drive away would you have killed him if he hadnt been in the car prescott asked if he gave me a reason otherwise im a protector not a killer the rain lessened cavanaugh took his phone from his jacket and pressed the recall button global protective services duncans voice was tense the phone remained in scrambler mode i had to switch cars were in a black pontiac can you make it to the holiday inn near the airport im here with some of your friends good cavanaugh said i can always use friends part two threat avoidance the rain had lessened to a drizzle by the time cavanaugh following duncans instructions reached the holiday inn on route a half mile from teterboro airport duncan waited under the carport at the motels entrance he wore a raincoat and hat his hands were in the coats pockets one of them no doubt holding a pistol his trim mustache emphasized how pinched his lips were with his straight military posture and intense eyes he exuded a focus that made cavanaugh pleased to rely on him the moment cavanaugh drove under the carport and stopped next to duncan a gray van suddenly appeared behind them prescott flinched they caught us no cavanaugh said its fine glancing in the rearview mirror he saw two men and a woman all three familiar to him all wearing rain slickers step from the van they kept their hands beneath the slickers presumably on weapons while they scanned the area around them paying particular attention to the highway beyond the parking lot five seconds later everything looking satisfactory one of the men approached cavanaughs side of the car with that allclear sign cavanaugh pressed the cars unlock button instantly duncan opened the passenger door and looked in mr prescott prescott looked dumbfounded im duncan wentworth global protective services we spoke on the phone come with me please before prescott seemed aware of it duncan had guided him from the car meanwhile the woman and the remaining man flanked prescott duncan leading the way escorting him to the van cavanaugh got out of the car how ya doing the trim man who waited on the drivers side chewed gum better than i was a half hour ago you can relax now leave the show to us looking forward to it the car might have a location transmitter by the time they find it itll be far from the airport theyll never suspect how you got away the pistol on the seat belongs to the assault team cavanaugh pulled the from under his belt this belongs to prescott i have no idea where else its been the man whose name was eddie nodded the rule was you never kept a weapon whose history you didnt know if you were caught with it ballistics might prove that the weapon had been used in various shootings the police would have every reason to believe you were implicated in them these piecesll soon be in pieces in a sewer eddie said amused by the pun cavanaugh stepped aside and let eddie get behind the steering wheel they all wore gloves eddie tightened his own gloves no way to use fingerprints to identify them so it wont matter if i wipe down your prints the only places we touched are in the front seat makes it easier ciao as the black car drove from the hotels carport into the drizzle cavanaugh got into the van and closed the hatch hey cavanaugh the driver who was hispanic put the vehicle into gear and proceeded from the carport the drizzle made a hissing sound on the roof hey roberto cavanaugh knew the goateed man only by his first name and assumed it was an alias how are the tropical fish they ate each other im getting a better hobby what kind model airplanes the kind with a motor so the planes can actually fly im gonna rig them so they have aerial dogfights and shoot at each other and stuff stuff you know tiny rockets maybe they could drop little bombs the van was configured so that two rows of seats faced each other with a table in the middle cavanaugh buckled himself into a seat in back next to prescott and duncan and looked across the table toward the man and the woman whod escorted prescott into the van their rain slickers were off now revealing kevlar vests and holstered pistols on their belts hey chad he said to the redhaired man who was about thirtyfive and had the same strongshouldered build that cavanaugh had his name too was probably an alias in some elements of the security business chads red hair would have been a liability drawing attention to him but as a protective agent chad often took advantage of his hair color to act as a decoy an assassin or a kidnapper having studied the target long enough to determine that a redhaired man was one of the protectors would pay attention to where chad went on the assumption that chad would be near his client thus chad made a specialty of pretending to protect a lookalike client while the real client slipped away under escort when chad wanted to be inconspicuous he wore a hat i heard you got shot cavanaugh said nope good im glad you didnt get hurt i didnt say i didnt get hurt chad said i got stabbed ouch couldve been worse it was my left shoulder if itd been the shoulder i bowl with cavanaugh looked at the woman next to chad hi tracy she wore a yankees sweatshirt and concealed most of her blond hair under a yankees baseball cap she had the capability of making herself look plain or gorgeous at will and if shed been in the holiday inn restaurant if shed put on lipstick taken off her cap let her long hair dangle and pulled her sweatshirt tight everybody in the restaurant including fouryearold kids would have remembered her after she left i heard you quit cavanaugh said and give up these fabulous working conditions besides when would i ever see lover boy if i wasnt working with him she meant chad but she was joking protectors who had a relationship werent allowed to work on the same team in an emergency they might look after each other instead of the client but on numerous assignments chad and tracy had proven where their priorities lay the van reached the highway and headed toward the airport meanwhile duncan handed blankets to prescott and cavanaugh then poured steaming coffee into styrofoam cups for them well soon have dry coveralls for you cavanaugh felt the coffee warm his stomach you did good mr prescott mr now you call me mr ever since the warehouse its been prescott do this and prescott do that duncan frowned is there a problem prescotts puffy eyes crinkled not in the least this man saved my life im deeply grateful with a smile prescott shook cavanaughs hand your hands cold cavanaugh said i was just going to say the same thing to you cavanaugh looked down at his hands they did feel cold he realized but not because hed gotten soaked its starting he thought he wrapped his hands around the warm styrofoam cup but the hands which felt as if they belonged to someone else trembled enough that some of the coffee almost spilled over your adrenaline will soon wear off duncan said it already is do you want dexedrine to make up for it no cavanaugh removed his hands from the cup and concentrated to steady them no speed cavanaugh knew all too well the down effect that the central nervous system experienced after the high of adrenaline had made it possible to perform extraordinary acts of strength and endurance already he felt uneasy urges to yawn which had nothing to do with needing sleep but a lot to do with the uncomfortable release of muscle tension dexedrine would return his nervous system close to the high level at which it had functioned when he had rescued prescott but he hated to rely on chemicals and as always was determined to go through what amounted to adrenaline withdrawal in as natural a way as possible he disliked having a client see him go through it the slight unsteadiness the yawns there was always the chance that prescott would misinterpret the unavoidable effect of being in violent action as a symptom of fear just as earlier he had praised cavanaugh for being brave a virtue that cavanaugh denied no speed cavanaugh repeated after the control tower radioed clearance the bell l helicopter rose from teterboro airport and headed north along the hudson river because the airport was a facility for corporate charter and private aircraft there hadnt been a need to go through metal detectors and similar security checks thus making it easy for the team to take aboard their weapons which they were licensed to carry in several states like boats cars and firearmsto name a few items crucial to the security professionno helicopter fulfilled every purpose swiftness had to be considered in relation to seating capacity cargo space and maneuverability along with how far and high the helicopter could fly called the long ranger this sleek helicopter was designed to get neatly in and out of inaccessible or remote areas and was popular with emergency and lawenforcement agencies although corporations liked it for its efficiency and comfort it could accommodate seven occupants including the pilot who in this case was roberto it had a top speed of miles per hour and a maximum fuel range of miles which meant that at peak performance it could stay in the air for approximately three hours its altitude capability was twenty thousand feet but robertos flight plan called for him to stay four thousand feet above the river the drizzle had become a mist and now that the sky was clear he was able to try to calm prescott by giving him a view of the cliffs and woods along the new jersey palisades but prescott showed no interest in the view ignoring the ample plexiglas windows which duncan explained were bullet resistant the long rangers seating arrangement was similar to that in the van two rows of seats one facing the other while the seats in the armored van had been designed for their sturdiness in case of an attack those that duncan had ordered for the kevlarprotected long ranger were remarkably comfortable with footrests armrests a tiltback function and soft leather wearing large coveralls that still managed to look tight on his stomach and chest prescott ignored the view too busy answering duncans questions and explaining about jesus escobar cavanaugh remained silent any remarks from him would contaminate the debriefing the team needed to hear prescotts problem in his own words in the lownoise lowvibration cabin duncan finally directed his attention toward cavanaugh anything to add i got a fairly good look at the men in the two cars i didnt see any hispanics roberto whod been listening from the pilots seat said over his shoulder so escobars an equalopportunity employer the same as blacks dont always hire only blacks it would take somebody with escobars resources to mount that kind of attack cavanaugh said the way it sounds to me chad said theyd put together a careful plan with the kidnappers posing as crack addicts blending with the neighborhood if mr prescott had left the warehouse they were ready to make their move or if they got tired of waiting they were prepared to blast their way in and take him when cavanaugh showed up they got nervous that he was part of an extraction team so they felt they had no choice except to move up their timetable ill contact the dea and tell them to plug their security leak duncan said for gods sake dont tell them i hired you to make me disappear prescott said whoever escobar has working for him will pass that information along not to worry duncan said i dont intend to create my own security leak relax and enjoy the ride where are you taking me where youll be safe the helicopter followed the hudson river two hundred miles north passing several waterfront towns and cities some of which were crested with smog beyond kingston it headed west into the low rolling catskill mountains thickly wooded they had numerous scenic valleys look cavanaugh pointed toward a plume of smoke rising from a ridge to the north yes duncan said its been a dry spring ive been listening to radio chatter roberto said over his shoulder as he worked the helicopters controls the rain didnt get this far but the lightning did and thats what started the fire its small theyve got it under control duncan nodded and glanced toward the sky behind them is anybody following us the helicopter had been modified to accommodate a sophisticated array of electronic instruments including a powerful radar system which was capable of isolating any aircraft following their course roberto tapped numbers on a keyboard and studied the radar screen nada do it duncan said roberto crested a peak and sank into a small valley that was especially dense with evergreens look down mr prescott chad said youll find this interesting the helicopter sank lower into the valley what am i looking for prescott said all i see are fir trees thats what youre supposed to see tracy said i still dont prescott stared down through the plexiglas working the choppers controls roberto pressed a button see anything now no icareful if you go any lower youll crash into the trees good god cavanaugh wasnt in a position to see what prescott did nonetheless he knew what was happening what seemed to be a section of the forestthirty square yards of itstarted moving all of a sudden concrete appeared what the prescott said the best camouflage net available duncan said even as low as we came its hard to distinguish the illusion from the real thing the helicopter settled onto the concrete landing pad after roberto shut off the engine the group unbuckled their seat belts opened hatches and stepped down careful cavanaugh said feeling the wind from the stillrotating blades he made prescott stoop the group went to the left toward a closed electrical box on a post among the trees at the side of the landing pad duncan unlocked and opened the box we have to wait a few moments for the blades to stop or else the downdraft will suck the camouflage net into the blades then duncan pressed a switch and a motor hummed prescott watched in wonder as the net an eerily realistic painting of the thick evergreens as seen from above resumed motion this time in reverse held up by sturdy poles that moved along motorized rails in the ground the net shifted over the group shut out the sky and concealed the helicopter in winter when it snows duncan explained a sensor causes the net to retract automatically to keep the weight of the snow from damaging it heat coils in the concrete melt the snow when the storms over the net returns to where it was the snow on the trees melts swiftly so the net continues to look like its surroundings roberto added the flight plan i filed with the controller at teterboro lists private property in these mountains as our destination one valleys pretty much the same as another the description isnt specific enough for anybody to be able to use the flight plan to follow us here even visitors like you wouldnt know which valley this is if you wanted to come back here from the radar we know we werent being followed tracy added and nobody can see the chopper from the air chad said so you can relax this is as secure as you can be but what about the helicopters heat signature prescotts question made everyone in the group look at one another in surprise you know about heat signatures cavanaugh asked what do you expect from a scientist every object gives off heat an aircraft with sophisticated infrared sensors can detect that heat isolate its shape and know whats hidden under trees or a camouflage net or in the dark thats military or lawenforcement hardware chad said anybody capable of equipping an aircraft with stuff like that is capable of equipping it with other fancy hardware like machine guns and rockets tracy said prescott frowned is that supposed to reassure me what theyre getting at cavanaugh said is while youre worrying why not worry about napalm and missiles prescott didnt understand duncan stepped toward him its a basic rule of protection that we match our security to the threat level the client faces escobar has a lot of money and resources but his operation isnt sophisticated enough to be able to rig an aircraft with that kind of equipment in the little time his team had to try to follow us theres no such thing as a totally secure location even the military command center in cheyenne mountain would be vulnerable if somebody managed to smuggle a suitcase nuclear weapon inside but under the circumstances given the threat youre facing what chad said is true duncan put a reassuring hand on prescotts arm this is as secure as you can be prescott glanced around continuing to look uneasy where do we stay over there tracy said where all i see are trees look harder that hill is there a cabin or something behind it sort of cavanaugh guided prescott through the trees ill join you in a minute roberto said i need to refuel the chopper he headed toward a pump next to a camouflaged equipment shed at the side of the landing pad you mean you have fuel here prescott sounded amazed an underground tank every six months we send a truck up here to refill it the setting sun cast shadows a cool gentle breeze smelled sweetly of fir needles the groups footsteps were cushioned by the soft forest floor the hill they approached was about thirty feet high with scrub brush and outcrops of boulders leading prescott to it cavanaugh passed one of the boulders and indicated a recessed concrete passageway this is the cabin sort of duncan stepped into the passageway and came to a metal door next to which was an electronic number pad a motion sensor triggered a faint light in the number pad as duncan reached for it blocking the pad from prescotts view he pressed a sequence of buttons with a solid thump the doors lock was released electronically as duncan opened the door an alarm system began beeping if the alarm isnt deactivated in fifteen seconds cavanaugh told prescott the intruder gets a dose of knockout gas duncan turned to an interior control panel again blocked it from view and pressed a further sequence of numbers the beeping stopped motion sensors turned lights on within the structure welcome to your safe site prescott entered slowly with even greater wonder than when hed seen the camouflage net retract to reveal the helicopter pad a hallway led to a large living area on the right the floor was polished oak the furnishings were leather the walls were an offwhite covered with bookshelves impressionistic paintings and a large fireplace this is a reinforcedconcrete dome covered with earth duncan said we squared off the domes interior walls for convenience because of the buildings strong insulating structure the temperature tends to be a uniform seventytwo degrees in both summer and winter with a little help from a fireplace in each room solar panels and batteries provide the electricity chad said a backup generator kicks in if necessary the drinking water comes from a well under the bunker so it cant be poisoned on top sunlight comes through a ventilation shaft and gets reflected by a system of mirrors that distribute the sunlight so the rooms seem to have windows tracy said its one of the most energyefficient buildings imaginable but with the entrance controlled electronically if the power fails well be trapped prescott said theres a manual override on the door plus a second way out duncan pointed toward a metal door at the end of the corridor it has a knob and a lever for a deadbolt lock but on the outside theres nothingno knob no key slot no way to pick the lock and get in prescott breathed a little easier is anybody hungry chad rubbed his hands together that depends tracy said whos doing the cooking you none other in that case im starved chad had a reputation for being an impressive cook mr prescott are you a vegetarian do you have food allergies i can eat anything cavanaugh silently concurred remembering the shelves of carbohydraterich food at the warehouse beef stroganoff coming up chad said easy on the cream this time tracy said hey if youre going to put restrictions on a genius at work im trying to watch my figure im watching your figure too can you believe the way this guy talks to me while they sort this out duncan told prescott why dont you get settled if you enjoy tobacco we have a room with various smoking materials no prescott looked horrified by the thought in that case your roomsmokefreeis the third on the left in this corridor i imagine a hot shower and some clothes that fit you would be welcome theres a bar satellite television a sauna youve been through a lot perhaps you can relieve the strain enough to take a nap what do you think of him duncan asked after he and cavanaugh watched prescott enter his room letting chad and tracy go ahead with their various duties the two men crossed the living room toward a door to the right of the fireplace it led to an office he doesnt have much of a personality but hes an ideal client cavanaugh said he did exactly what i told him hes overweight and out of shape but he sucked it up and did what was necessary sure he almost lost his lunch from being afraid but he trusted me and never panicked to the point of losing control everything considered he kind of impressed me anything else hes smart of course hes a biochemist likes to learn asks a lot of questions my arrangement with him was via telephone and an electronic transfer of funds duncan said he insisted that he couldnt meet me in person now we know why cavanaugh paused at the entrance to the offices as duncan went in why didnt he tell me on the phone what his problem is duncan eased his tall slender frame into an aeron chair behind a desk maybe he didnt know if he could trust us cavanaugh said he wanted to wait until he assessed one of us facetoface duncan thought about it but he trusted us enough to tell us where he was hiding that isnt consistent not necessarily since he couldnt come to us he didnt have a choice about letting one of us come to him cavanaugh said besides at the warehouse he used tv cameras to study me if anything looked suspicious all he had to do was shut down communications and i still wouldnt have known where he was do you think he understands what it truly means to disappear is he prepared to accept the consequences hes got plenty of incentive cavanaugh said as one of his attackers told me on a cell phone theyll keep coming in fact im sort of the quarry now too oh the man on the phone almost made it personal between him and me duncan thought another moment and picked up a phone ill speak to my contacts at the dea and get more details about prescotts situation while youre making your calls yes at the warehouse some homeless people helped prescott and me get away i promised them a truck of food and clothes would be delivered there tomorrow maybe some sleeping bags duncan smiled ill make it like the ritz cavanaugh had his handgun apart in addition to gunpowder residue hed found rainwater on some of the interior parts and was cleaning it on a towel on the living rooms coffee table seeing movement he looked up as prescott entered did you get some sleep cavanaugh asked prescott nodded i surprised myself i felt so tense i expected just to keep lying on the bed staring at the ceiling was the sleep any good when i woke up i felt wonderful for a second then prescotts voice dropped he looked awkward in jeans and a denim shirt evidently more accustomed to suits and ties but unlike the coveralls hed worn on the helicopter at least the clothes fit his heavy frame duncan prided himself on keeping various sizes at the bunker where is everybody prescott asked cavanaugh wiped gun oil on the sigs various parts which were laid out neatly on the towel in front of him duncans making phone calls tracys in the control room control room similar to what you had in the warehouse this place is surrounded by security cameras tracys watching the monitors and a radar screen thatll warn us if any aircraft are in the area robertos maintaining the helicopter chads cooking the smell of beef stroganoff drifted pleasantly into the room what about you prescott surveyed the jeans and denim shirt that cavanaugh now wore were you able to rest i had a report to write and then some chores to do like this prescott indicated the disassembled weapon after action the first thing i was trained to take care of is my equipment cavanaugh put the barrel into the slide then secured the recoil spring and its guide rod into place when he compressed the spring he made sure to point it away from prescott and himself lest it catapult free and injure one of them what did you mean conditioned prescott asked cavanaugh shook his head confused prescott continued when i told you that what youd done to save me was one of the bravest things id ever seen you said youre not braveyoure conditioned cavanaugh slid the assembled slide mechanism onto the sigs frame and secured it he thought a moment people are brave when theyre terrified but force themselves to risk their lives for somebody else prescott nodded listening intently why do you care about this cavanaugh asked my specialty is how the human brain functions how it releases hormones and controls our behavior prescott said epinephrinewhats commonly called adrenalineis one of the hormones associated with fear the speeding and contraction of the heart the feeling of heat in the stomach the jitteriness in the muscles how someone like you overcomes the hormones effects interests me but i dont overcome its effects i dont understand in delta force i was trained to use those effects to treat them as positives instead of the negatives people associate with fear prescott kept listening intently put a parachute on someone and tell that person to leap out of a plane at twenty thousand feet hes going to be terrified its a potentially lifethreatening activity and one thats totally unfamiliar but train that person in small increments teach him how to jump off increasingly high platforms into a swimming pool then teach him how to jump from even higher platforms wearing a bungee harness that simulates the feel of a parachute then show him how to jump from small planes at reasonable altitudes gradually increase the size and power of the planes and the height of the jump by the time he leaps from that plane at twenty thousand feet hes going to feel the same speeding and contraction of the heart the same burning in the stomach the same jitteriness in the muscles as before this time though hes not terrified he knows how to minimize the risk and hes experienced hundreds of similar activities what he feels instead of fear is the sharp focus of an athlete ready to spring into action his adrenaline is affecting him the same way it always did but his mind knows how to control it and to appreciate its constructive effects constructive the speeding and the contraction of the heart cause a greater output of blood to reach muscles and prepare them for extreme action the faster breath rate causes more oxygen to get to muscles the liver creates glucose increasing the amount of sugar in the blood at the same time more fatty acids circulate both the sugar and the fatty acids become instant fuel creating greater energy and stamina correct prescott said you had excellent instruction i was trained to welcome adrenaline to appreciate what it does to help keep me alive i was also trained to think of gunfights and car fights and all the rest of what happened today as being not exactly normal but i know what to expect i know how to react i can honestly say that not once today did i feel whats conventionally called fear cavanaugh paused not once he asked himself what about the strange moment at the warehouse when i went up the stairs to meet prescott a powerful surge of adrenaline cavanaugh said but not fear and thats why i dont think what did today has anything to do with bravery youre the one whos brave prescott blinked me brave thats preposterous for the past three weeksand especially todayive been terrified thats my point cavanaugh said you cant be brave unless youre frightened to begin with what you survived today was violent enough to unsettle even some experienced operators i can only guess at the strength of character you had to muster to overcome the fear raging through you you didnt freeze you didnt panic even though you must have felt that way you promised me youd be compliant and you were youre a prefect client selfconscious prescott glanced down at the hardwood floor evidently he wasnt used to compliments you might not feel afraid but you still risk losing your life for strangers why do you do that cavanaugh put on cotton gloves and began inserting mm rounds into the pistols magazine in manhattan at the warwicks bar jamie had asked a similar question because its what i know how to do and im good at it no other reason prescott asked its something i dont talk about with most people because most people cant understand maybe you will because of your research into addiction id like to try alcohol cocaine heroin methamphetamines people can get addicted to a lot of things some specialops soldiers cant bear a quiet everyday life after they leave the service they become mercenaries or contract operatives for the cia or security specialists or protective agents cavanaugh spread his hands in a gesture of selfadmission its like a racecar driver who isnt happy unless hes on a track jockeying for position with other cars at two hundred and thirty miles an hour the rush of adrenaline to get it he has to put up with periods of intense inactivity before and after each race thats the way most protection assignments are intensely inactive even the inactivity the constant waiting for trouble has a rush to it though as much as i hate to say this im addicted hate to say it any addictions a weakness the room became silent from a door opposite the one that prescott had used to enter the living room chad appeared wearing a white apron that contrasted with his red hair and looked slightly ridiculous on so muscular a man he tried to sound like a butler in the movies dinnah is served cavanaugh couldnt help grinning ill get the team as chad returned to the kitchen prescott looked puzzled at the cotton gloves cavanaugh wore why did you put gloves on when you loaded the magazine cavanaugh shoved it into the sig and worked the slide on top of the pistol inserting a round in the firing chamber he pushed the decocking lever this kind of handgun ejects empty cartridges after discharging the bullets i dont want to leave my fingerprints behind for somebody to identify them another way of being invisible if i had a coat of arms be invisible would be my motto what you said about addiction being a weakness prescott said it isnt always some things cant be controlled i believe in willpower cavanaugh said sometimes that isnt enough the substance i discovered for example is stronger than anyones will i dont want anybody complaining because the only boneless sirloin had was frozen and needed to be thawed in a microwave chad said the group minus tracy who continued to watch the monitors in the control room sat at a long table in a kitchen filled with stainlesssteel appliances the plates before the group had halfinch strips of beef in a beige sauce studded with mushrooms and onions on top of green noodles a bowl of salad was next to each plate with a napkincovered basket of freshly baked bread in the middle and i dont want anybody complaining because the green noodles arent homemade but came out of a box i cant imagine anyone complaining prescott said it looks and smells wonderful with the right attitude like that ill cook for you anytime chad said the teams on duty duncan told prescott and cant have wine but that doesnt mean you cant i can offer what im told is a fine chianti classico prescott nodded in approval roberto stuck a napkin into the top of his shirt highlighting his dark goatee man i havent had goulash in ages its not goulash its beef stroganoff chad said it was invented by a french chef who worked for a russian aristocrat in the late nineteenth century the aristocrats name was count paul stroganoff as usual the guy with the power got the attention while nobody remembers the chef who created the dish did you ever think about getting an honest job and running a restaurant cavanaugh asked all the time chad said but i know id miss the smell of gun oil delicious the enthusiasm with which prescott ate was impressive theres something a little extra here that i cant quite place the mustard and the sour cream of course but chad watched with interest as prescott savored a mouthful oyster sauce is that what im tasting oyster sauce two tablespoons you know your food heres your wine duncan showed prescott the bottle then set a glass next to him prescott let the dark liquid drift over his tongue assessing it i telephoned my contacts at the dea to learn more about escobars tactics but its sunday evening so i couldnt reach them duncan said ill try again tomorrow meanwhile we have a number of issues to discuss he looked at cavanaugh who set down his fork and started the briefing you need to understand there are four stages involved in arranging for you to disappear cavanaugh said the first is a new identity and new documentation for it especially a birth certificate and a social security number you want to be confident that the government wont question your social security number one way to do it is to assume the identity of someone whos been dead for quite a while someone without any close living relatives to contradict your claim to be that person you meet these requirements by searching old newspapers for an item about an entire family that died in a fire or a similar disaster you then learn the social security number of a child in that family whod be your age now if he had lived many parents get a social security number for their newborns hospitals often include the applications with their regular paperwork in some states death certificates include that number and death certificates are easy to obtain a matter of public record assuming someone elses social security number is illegal of course duncan said as a consequence we never perform that service for any of our clients we only teach them how to do it i understand prescott said cavanaugh continued for a moderate threat level its a fairly secure way to assume a new identity not foolproof though roberto wiped his mouth with his napkin and joined the conversation sometimes the government gets curious about a social security number that hasnt been used for years and now suddenly shows up on tax returns which means that in addition to whoevers hunting you youve got the government on your back charging you with a federal crime exactly cavanaugh said and escobars threat level is too serious for us to allow you to get exposed in any way what were going to suggest duncan said is expensive greater than the hundredthousanddollar fee you and i negotiated over the telephone you want to raise the price prescott set down his knife and fork given what happened today duncan said i dont have a choice raise it how much prescott frowned an additional four hundred thousand prescott didnt blink you did a background check on me i did you know that my biotech patents made me a millionaire many times over i do thanks to protective services im not in escobars hands in fact given everything cavanaugh and the rest of you have done so far not to mention all this prescott gestured toward his surroundingsa half million dollars sounds like a bargain tomorrow morning ill arrange an electronic transfer to your account one hundred thousand dollars of that money duncan said shouldnt go anywhere near our account once we teach you how to hide the electronic trail i want the hundred thousand transferred directly to someone else duncan slid a piece of paper across the table to prescott the paper had numbers and a banks name written on it to a specialist who has a way to get you a brandnew previously unassigned number cavanaugh said doesnt a similar problem still exist prescott asked new numbers go to young people wont the government question the number when it suddenly starts showing up on tax returns for a man my age new numbers also go to immigrants who get green cards duncan said prescott gave him a significant look brilliant im assuming this specialist will invent a background for you that says youre from canada great britain south africa australia or new zealand some country that would account for your anglosaxon features duncan said shell give you she youll find karen quite personable shell give you a detailed backgroundwhere you supposedly grew up and went to school and so onwhich youll need to memorize until it seems it really is your background shell also give you photographs of these places and information about them that anyone whod been there would be expected to know youll get a new name of course which youll need to internalize until its second nature to you a drivers license with a picture id a passport credit cards sometimes even a library card all of them perfect cadillac treatment very expensive duncan concluded prescott looked fascinated but how does she manage to do this if i asked her im sure shed refuse to answer or else shed lie to me duncan himself was lying cavanaugh knew the truth was that karen had once worked for the branch of the state department that supplied undercover intelligence operatives with documents for false identities the main thing is she does exceptional work duncan continued shes already preparing the documents all you need is to have her take your photograph so she can put it on your new drivers license and passport tomorrow well take you to albany and complete the process by nightfall youll be a new man you said there were four stages in arranging for me to disappear prescott said what are the other three duncan looked at cavanaugh nodding for him to continue eventually youll want to change your appearance some of it can be easily done since you have fair hair it makes sense to dye it black youre cleanshaven so it makes sense to grow a mustache or a beard you dont wear glasses so why not get a pair that has noncorrective lenses all thats fairly obvious and in moderaterisk situations would be sufficient but in your case some form of surgical change is advisable well take you to a plastic surgeon we use not even your mother will recognize you after hes finished with your nose and chin my mothers dead prescott said sorry to hear that but on the other hand that partly solves the biggest problem youre going to have cavanaugh said which is ill come to it in a moment after i deal with the third stage in your disappearance which is arranging for you to have access to money in many cases the person whos disappearing has to give up a job in his or her new life money becomes a significant issue fortunately that wont be an issue for you because youre wealthy duncan slid another piece of paper across the table to him tomorrow after the final details of your new identity have been arranged youll transfer your money to this numbered bank account that weve established for you in the bahamas youll note that the password is phoenix i couldnt resist the rebirth idea as soon as you activate the account change the number and the password so youre confident the money is secure even from us youll need to establish another bank account this one conventional in your new name at your new place of residence cavanaugh said periodically youll transfer funds to that second bank preferably in amounts less than ten thousand dollars because transactions larger than that have to be reported to the government but dont make it too close to ten thousand dollars because the dea uses that pattern to identify drug traffickers seven to eight thousand would be a reasonable figure one that wont attract the governments attention youll need a story to tell your banker to explain your income duncan added perhaps you receive periodic installments from a trust fund perhaps you retired early after selling a business and for tax reasons you preferred a schedule of payments rather than a lump sum whatever fabrication feels comfortable to you prescott took another sip of wine and the fourth stage the one that presents the most problems cavanaugh looked around the table everyone glanced down uneasy initially a new life sounds tempting cavanaugh said an escape from your enemies a fresh beginning the chance to correct mistakes and start over the trouble is you have to make a complete break with your past do you have a family mr prescott no no exwife no children in college no my work kept getting in the way of marriage and establishing a family a lady friend no a boyfriend im not gay prescott said with annoyance thats remarkable ive been protecting people for several years and this is the first time ive dealt with someone who had no serious social connections you said your mother was dead what about your father dead also in other words theres no one in the world wholl miss you if you drop out of sight more or less uncomfortable prescott glanced down yes that makes it easier cavanaugh said because a clean break with the past means youd never have been able to contact your parents if they were alive or other relatives or your friends if youd wished a wife and children could have gone with you to your new life but theyd have had relatives and friends theyd have missed and eventually you or someone in your family would have been tempted to get in touch with people you cared for in your past in most cases if your enemy manages to find you thats how its done by keeping a close watch on the friends and relatives you left behind by checking their mail and tapping their phones and watching for any change in their routine fortunately thats not going to be an issue here do you have any fantasy spot where youve always wanted to live duncan asked when you decided to disappear was there a place you had in mind no looking more abandoned prescott stared at his wineglass good duncan said because if you had you probably would have mentioned it to people you worked with or did business with casual conversation chad said gosh wouldnt it be great to live in aspen and ski whenever i want in the winter so you disappear and move to aspen and the next thing escobars men come crashing through your back door do you subscribe to any scientific journals cavanaugh asked several not any longer duncan said escobar will find out which journals publish articles in your specialty hell manage to get his hands on the subscriber list hell make a note of which subscribers recently moved and which people subscribed after you disappeared and the next thing you know roberto said echoing chads earlier comment escobars menll come crashing through your back door do you like to play golf cavanaugh asked yes its one of the few forms of exercise that not any longer you cant ever go near a golf course again escobar will find a way to learn your habits if he somehow manages to figure out where youve moved hell arrange to have someone watch the golf courses waiting for you to show up on and on cavanaugh said do you understand what were trying to tell you prescott gulped the last of his wine and poured another full glass when you say a new life you mean it literally i have to make a complete break from my past with no exceptions cavanaugh emphasized the kind of clothes you like the music you like the food you like youre going to have to change all of it the books you like back at the warehouse you had the collected poems of robinson jeffers and a couple of books about him from now on jeffers is one author you cant ever be caught reading you make it sound prescotts voice faltered depressing for many it is once the people who disappear finally understand the full implications duncan said you have to prepare yourself and confront the problem now how much are you afraid of escobar are you ready to do everything thats necessary no matter how isolating in order to keep him away from you prescott took another long swallow from his glass im tired of being afraid yes his expression hardened im ready to do everything thats necessary good duncan said tomorrow well take you to meet karen in albany get your photograph taken and receive the documents for your new identity tracy suddenly entered the room maybe not why duncan frowned three helicopters are headed this way helicopters duncan came to his feet at the same time cavanaugh did followed by chad and roberto they hurried with tracy out of the kitchen along a corridor and into the control room various television monitors were stacked in rows along a wall receiving greentinted nightvision images from cameras positioned around the helicopter and the bunker but what the team focused its attention on was a radar screen which showed three blips heading north approaching the area roberto studied them yeah the speed and the formation are consistent with helicopters whats happening prescotts strained voice asked behind them we dont know yet cavanaugh said it might not be anything to concern us the moment they appeared on the radar heading up the hudson tracy said it was obvious they were following the flight plan we filed at teterboro coincidence duncan asked maybe chad said there are a number of small airports up the hudson not to mention the one at albany they might land at one of them and go to a corporate retreat or something hell maybe these are politicians flying to the state capital maybe tracy said and maybe not what are we going to do prescott asked no one turned from the radar if its escobars men trying to follow us roberto said the destination on the flight plans too vague to bring them here there are a lot of mountains and valleys even in daylight those choppers could search forever and not find this place look tracy pointed toward the screen where the three blips separated moving west from the river theyre heading into the mountains chad said splitting up cavanaugh said saving time searching one to a valley but even with nightvision equipment theyre not going to see anything that tells them where we are roberto said for all they know we landed at a farm and our helicopters in a barn it would take weeks for them to search all the farms in this area plus if they flew here from teterboro theyll have to refuel in an hour or so cavanaugh said look tracy pointed again on the screen the three blips moved back and forth over separate areas systematically searching duncan said but theyre doing it awfully fast cavanaugh said even with nightvision equipment theyd need to move slower to make sure they dont miss anything on the screen the three blips shifted rapidly to three other areas holy nobody can do a visual check of a valley that fast not even in daylight tracy said unless thats not how theyre checking chad said what do you mean not visually the rest of the group abruptly understood what chad meant they swung to look at prescott his pale face contrasted with his dark eyes which were wide with apprehension as he too realized what was happening cavanaugh stared back at the radar screen infrared sensors thermal sensors the blips moved swiftly to three other areas dies roberto said that explains it theyre looking for the helicopters heat signature the engines cooled but a thermal scanner makes metal look different from wood or dirt theyll be able to distinguish the shape of the helicopter from the trees around it plus tracy said the landing padll still retain heat from the sunlight the concrete absorbed all day but wont heat from the houses and farm equipment confuse them prescott demanded no duncan said a house or a truck would have an entirely different heat pattern besides this valleys so rugged there arent any farms around here the heat signature of the landing pad will be especially distinctive in the middle of a forest prescott pushed through the group and stared at the radar how long before they get here at sufficient altitude with magnifiers on the sensors they can cover a lot of miles in a hurry at the rate theyre searching theyll be here in ten minutes tracy said this cant be duncan said what do you mean cant be prescott sounded more panicked its happening right in front of your eyes even with all his money escobar doesnt have the resources to suddenly get his hands on three helicopters with thermal sensors duncan said thats special equipment you need to make plans to have it available and escobar had no reason to expect a helicopter chase so where the hell did he get thermal sensors chad asked it doesnt make sense unless what roberto asked those arent escobars men duncan swung again toward prescott is there anybody else youre afraid of who else would be chasing you nobody if those helicopters arent escobars i have no idea whose they could be on the radar the blips moved relentlessly to three other areas proceeding closer to the center of the screen where the bunker and the helicopter were situated whoever they are theyre sophisticated duncan said what else do they have in those choppers maybe its time to worry about those rockets we talked about earlier chad said moment of truth tracy said we have to decide whats she talking about prescott asked stay or go tracy said if we stay we dont know whether they can blow their way in here but if we go we cant leave by helicopter roberto said if theyve got heat sensors we have to assume they also have radar theyll know if our chopper takes off but what if mr prescott isnt in it duncan asked what if you take off and act as a decoy they still might shoot me down roberto said no cavanaugh said they wont shoot not if they think prescotts aboard they want him alive when they chased me on the highway they could have shot me but they didnt they didnt want the car to crash and kill prescott its safe for you to distract them the rest of us could leave in the jeep chad referred to one of two vehicles in the bunkers adjacent underground garage both jeeps tracy said we could use one of the cars as another decoy some of the helicopters will scan for other heat signatures and follow us theyll have to separate and go in three directions if we can get to the highwaythe new york state thruway is twenty miles to the easttherell be so much traffic they wont be able to decide which car theyre hunting on the radar the blips kept moving toward the center of the screen the group stared at duncan if we go they wont shoot at us because they want mr prescott alive if we stay theyll have him trapped does that about sum it up duncan asked the group kept staring at him move duncan said they didnt need to discuss what they had to do next although they continued to wear their pistols theyd taken off their kevlar vests now with disciplined speed they shifted from the control room and entered a room adjacent to it there in the bunkers arsenal their vests were on a table youll need this cavanaugh put a vest on prescott in case a bullet intended for one of us heads in the wrong direction after buckling on their vests the team grabbed ar assault rifles from a row of weapons that included shotguns and more handguns in theory the ar which was the civilian version of the militarys m could be fired only on a semiautomatic setting one shot with each pull of the trigger complying with federal gun laws but these had been modified so they could be fully automatic numerous rounds rapidly discharging with a single pull of the trigger if lawenforcement officers were about to examine the weapons the automatic function could be disabled by turning a small lever on the side and pulling the lever out an interior springloaded plug would then slip into place thus making the weapon legal while at the same time concealing that it had been tampered with looking ashen prescott reached for one no chad said leave the fireworks to us you might shoot yourself in the foot or one of us tracy said but what if i have to defend myself i should at least know how to use one of those things if the situation gets that desperate god help us roberto said dont touch a rifle unless were down and theres no other choice brace the stock against your shoulder point the barrel at your target pull the trigger if a shell gets stuck yank back this knob on the side to free it the ar likes to kick up cavanaugh said if youre not careful all you do is shoot toward the sky keep forcing the barrel down toward your target can you remember all that i hope i dont have to chad ran to the kitchen to make sure the stove and oven were off everybody grabbed windbreakers to cover their kevlar vests at the exit duncan opened the door as the group hurried along the echoing concrete passageway toward the cold mountain night cavanaugh heard the whump of the approaching helicopters getting louder good luck roberto tracys blond hair shone briefly in the light that spilled from the closing door theyve got less than an hours fuel and my tanks full i can outrun them roberto backed to the left moving into the murky forest adios come on prescott his kevlar vest feeling bulky on him cavanaugh headed to the right hurrying through the darkness toward the underground garage the entrance to which was recessed into the hill stay close to me he reached the garage and glanced toward the shadows behind him prescott holding their ars duncan chad and tracy glanced back also all cavanaugh saw were the indistinct outlines of trees and bushes prescott the helicopters thundered closer what happened chad asked whered he go the last time i saw him was duncan stared back toward the entryway dont tell me hes still inside ill get the jeeps tracy said prescott cavanaugh yelled the concrete passageway prevented the helicopters from seeing the faint motiontriggered light that came on when duncan rushed to the number pad next to the door prescott cavanaugh scanned the dark trees behind him he heard a muffled motor that tracy activated raising the garage door at the end of the passageway another light appeared as duncan hurried into the bunker maybe hes in the bushes chad said he got awfully upset when he saw those radar blips it could be hes so scared his bladder went crazy or his bowels cavanaugh said or he got sick cavanaugh moved through the dark bushes checking prescott behind him he heard tracy drive the first jeep up the ramp from the underground garage as the helicopters rumbled nearer cavanaugh suddenly realized that he hadnt heard roberto take off with the chopper move roberto he thought if you dont lift off soon you wont have a chance of getting ahead of them prescott scraping branches chad continued to search through the undergrowth as tracy got out of the jeep and ran back into the garage now that his eyes were accustomed to the night cavanaugh could see to avoid obstacles in the starlit darkness while he rushed past the bunkers entrance and made his way through evergreen branches hurrying toward the helicopter pad prescott at once cavanaugh saw that the camouflage net hadnt been retracted and the dark dragonfly silhouette of the helicopter still sat on the pad its motor silent its blades unmoving his nostrils contracted from the sharp smell of aviation fuel the night air was saturated with it turning to run he missed seeing a shadowy log and tripped over it falling careful to keep the ars barrel from jamming into the dirt he rolled his shoulder and his back absorbing the impact he used the momentum of his roll to rise to a crouch but not before he saw that what hed tripped over wasnt a log roberto lay motionless a halfmoon providing enough light for cavanaugh to see robertos stark open eyes and the black pool of blood where the rear of his head had been bashed in simultaneously the darkness exploded into an eyesearing glare as the aviation fumes ignited the flames reflected off the fuel pumps hose which lay on the ground spewing liquid through the forest a long wall of fire burst up through the bushes and trees the force of the heat thrust cavanaugh backward before he ran he saw the blaze envelope the helicopter the camouflage net vanishing in a crackling flash the light from the flames was so intense that he saw individual needles on tree branches the texture of bark on trunks sprinting toward the bunker he heard his footsteps crush dead needles and then a roar as the fire erupted farther through the forest chasing him prescott although the power of the fires roar overwhelmed what cavanaugh shouted it wasnt loud enough to obscure the din of the rapidly approaching helicopters racing harder cavanaugh saw the two jeeps that tracy had driven from the underground garage holding their ars she and chad stood next to the vehicles staring in surprise at the rapidly spreading flames the next instant tracy and chad disintegrated as something streaked from one of the helicopters and hit the two jeeps the detonation spewing chunks of metal and body parts in every direction the shock of what cavanaugh had seen in combination with the force of the blast almost knocked him to the ground his sanity felt threatened the enormity of what had happened overwhelming him but then he saw duncan race from the bunker and his conditioning took control tightening his grip on his assault rifle he hurried in a crouch toward where duncan gaped at the flames spreading quickly through the trees prescotts not inside duncan swung to stare at the crater where the jeeps had been chad and tracy took that hit son of a bitch the outrage on duncans face changed to alarm at the sound of something else shrieking from one of the helicopters toward the flames charging along the bunkers entryway they dove through the open door a moment before a second explosion struck near the bunker shrapnel and chunks of burning trees filled the space where theyd been standing duncan slammed the door shut i thought escobar wanted prescott alive the bunker shook from another explosion how can he be sure he wont kill prescott along with us robertos dead too cavanaugh rose to his feet and ran toward the control room what holding his ar duncan rushed after him his skulls bashed in what the christ is going on they hurried into the control room and faced its monitors although tracy had left the electronics on some screens were blank the fire having destroyed the cameras linked to them as cavanaugh studied the remaining active screens some of those went blank also but enough cameras remained undamaged for him to see that the fire had spread fast enough to have enclosed a third of the area around the bunker on the side where the landing pad and the helicopter had been one camera showed the three helicopters coming into view in the distance something stung cavanaughs nostrils do you smell smoke from the ventilation system duncan flicked a switch there its shut off the outside air and the smoke cant get in weve got enough air in here for a couple of days cavanaugh nodded we wont need to stay inside that long those choppersll soon be forced to leave to refuel they wont come back not after the fire and the explosions send the state police and emergency crews up here they cant hope to get away unnoticed i dont understand why escobars acting this desperately what you said earliermaybe you were right cavanaugh kept staring at the greentinted images some of the outside cameras were having trouble adjusting their nightvision lenses to the fierce brightness of the spreading flames on a few all cavanaugh saw was a glaring green tint maybe this isnt escobar then who else haze in the room irritated cavanaughs throat i thought you sealed the ventilation system you saw me do it then whats causing this smoke thicker haze drifted from a ventilation panel in the ceiling smell aviation fuel cavanaugh pushed duncan ahead of him charging toward the corridor outside the control room at the same moment flames burst from the ventilation panel and ripped along the ceiling cavanaugh felt the heat at his back as he and duncan reached the corridor in the ceiling smoke and flames erupted from a second ventilation panel pressed down by the heat duncan coughed the fire must have come down the ventilation shaft before i blocked it no look in the control room the top left monitor despite the haze and the fire on the ceiling they managed to get a halfdistinct view of the screens the one on the top left showed the earth on top of the bunker the fire hadnt reached the bushes up there and yet smoke spewed from the ventilation shaft how the hell did aviation fuel get down the ventilation shaft cavanaugh asked more smoke spread along the ceiling we cant go out the front way coughing duncan pointed into the control room toward the hazeenveloped screens a monitor on the top right showed an image from a camera that was aimed along the inside of the entryway toward what should have been forest all the screen showed now were flames but the screen next to it showed the back exit where the trees and bushes remained untouched the fire not yet having spread that far stooping cavanaugh hurried through the smokefilled kitchen and living room he and duncan reached the front corridor and ran to the right along the wall of doors that ended at the bunkers rear exit duncan twisted the lever on the deadbolt lock and pulled the door open ready with his assault rifle cavanaugh rushed with duncan along an exterior concrete passageway toward cool air and notyetburned trees but the wind from the approaching fire whipped branches and the forests shadows were pierced by the rippling reflection of flames crackling nearer on the right suddenly duncan slammed backward into cavanaugh the two of them falling the roar of an automatic rifle filling the passageway muzzle flashes like strobe lights as bullets ricocheted off concrete duncan screamed with equal abruptness the shooting stopped amid the smell of cordite weighed down by duncan cavanaugh groaned from a pain in his left shoulder from the trees he heard a scrape of metal that sounded like someone trying to free a shell stuck in an assault rifles firing chamber the approaching blaze dispelled shadows astonishingly it revealed prescott crouched among bushes glancing wildly toward the fire prescott held an ar presumably robertos and furiously worked to pull back the knob on the side duncan cavanaugh managed to say no answer the pain in his shoulder intensifying cavanaugh squirmed out from under duncans weight he smelled the nauseating coppery odor of blood duncan move he hoped desperately that duncans wounds werent serious but then he saw duncans mangled face where at least half a dozen highpowered rounds had made him unrecognizable duncan forced to drop his rifle cavanaugh dragged his friend back toward the bunker he struggled to get inside before prescott freed the jammed cartridge the closer cavanaugh got to the doorway behind him the more heat pressed against his back the scrape of metal ended no with one last desperate effort cavanaugh pulled duncan through the doorway another furious volley sent bullets zipping above cavanaughs head they struck the corridors ceiling and cracked against the concrete above the door cavanaugh slammed the door shut just before prescott corrected the barrels upward tug forcing down his aim as cavanaugh had taught him sending bullets walloping against the metal door duncan cavanaughs left shoulder ached worse coughing from the smoke and the heat he concentrated on duncan feeling for a pulse but it was obvious he would never find one duncan anger fought with grief too busy raging to fear for his life wanting only to hammer prescotts face until it was as unrecognizable as duncans cavanaugh scrambled back after one last look at his friend he ran in a crouch toward the living room he couldnt go out the rear door the passageway was like a shooting gallery funneling bullets toward the target as long as prescott keeps his aim down i dont have a chance cavanaugh thought the only reason cavanaugh was alive was that duncan had been ahead of him and had taken almost the full force of the barrage racing through the living room cavanaugh fought not to choke on the smoke a round had hit an exposed area at the top of his left shoulder between the vests strap and his neck as he charged bent over through the kitchen his hand came away smeared with red from where hed touched the meaty portion between his collarbone and his neck blood welled he dropped to his knees and gasped whatever relatively smokeclear air was near the floor stung by the heat from the burning ceiling he hurried to the munitions room to leave the bunker he needed to use the front exit but as the camera in that passageway had shown the burning trees and bushes out there blocked his way the arsenal had a trapdoor that led to a concrete tunnel connected to an exit near the landing pad but since that was the area where the fire was most intense cavanaugh wasnt sure he could use the tunnel as an exit amid spreading smoke and heat he shoved away the table on which the kevlar vests had been piled he kicked away a carpet exposed the tunnels trapdoor and lifted the handle wafts of smoke drifted up confirming his suspicion that the tunnel wouldnt protect him if he tried to avoid the flames by climbing down there the fire would suck out the tunnels oxygen asphyxiating him before it cooked him cavanaughs shoulder was stiff with greater pain he felt lightheaded need to stop bleeding need to do it fast cavanaugh thought he lurched toward a shelf that contained several redcolored pouches pro med trauma kits favored by emergency service organizations among other things each kit contained a fistsized gauze wad called a blood stopper because it could soak up as much as a pint of blood but as the fire worsened cavanaugh didnt have time to open a kit pull out a blood stopper apply it and tape it down all he had time for was the tape not surgical tape instead he grabbed a roll of silvercolored tape that was next to the trauma kits and was considered part of the firstaid supplies duct tape the gunfighters friend he couldnt count the number to times hed seen wounds sealed with duct tape he ripped his collar open and used his right sleeve to wipe blood from the meaty part where his shoulder met his neck he tore off two sections of tape and pressed them crossways onto the wound then he pressed them harder wincing from the pain but feeling the thick tapes sticky underside grip his skin and adhere to it staying closer to the floor cavanaugh ran from the arsenal and into a farther smokefilled rooma bathroomwhere he climbed into the tub and turned on the shower dousing his hair and his clothes he soaked a towel and tied it around his head dripping he scrambled into the kitchen where he grabbed a fire extinguisher from under the sink the bunkers lights flickered then failed as he ran into duncans office and grabbed another fire extinguisher from a corner of the room staggering now he crossed the living room which was lit only by flames and managed to reach the corridor at the bunkers entrance he set down the fire extinguishers and took a third one from a closet as with the rear exit the front door had a knob and a lever for a deadbolt lock after freeing the lock he tested the knob and jerked his fingers back when he felt heat on it wavering he tugged down his jacket sleeve and protected his hand as he again tried the knob still feeling heat but no longer caring desperate to escape from the bunker he pulled the door open and stumbled back aware of the intense heat behind him but unable to resist the backward motion because of what faced himhell the roar of the flames blocking the passageway was matched by the howl of the wind they created the heat was intense enough to suck the remaining oxygen from the bunker causing a fierce wind from the interior that stopped cavanaughs reflexive backward motion and instead pushed him forward now as a boy in oklahoma cavanaugh had once seen a fire on an oil rig that his father had worked on cavanaugh had never forgotten how high the flames had gushed and how powerful the heat had been the fire had started at sunset and had raged all night making the area around the oil rig shimmer like noon in august it had resisted the full force of five highpressured water hoses until finally cavanaughs father dressed in a fireretardant suit complete with a head covering had driven a bulldozer close to the upwardsurging blaze the bulldozers blade had been raised to try to protect cavanaughs father from the heat a metal pole had extended from the blade a container of explosives dangling from it asbestoscovered wires leading back from it cavanaughs father had dumped the explosives near the heart of the gushing flames had hurriedly backed the bulldozer away and then had leapt down taking cover behind the bulldozer as someone else had pushed a plunger that detonated the explosives the wallop of the blast had nearly knocked cavanaugh down even from a distance the din had made his ears ring for hours although his hands had been clamped over them but most impressive of all most amazing the explosion had blown out the fire because of the vacuum the blast created because it sucked air away from the blaze cavanaughs father had explained cavanaugh threw the first fire extinguisher into the flames beyond the entryway frantic using all his strength he hurled the second extinguisher much farther he had no idea how long it would take the intense heat to rupture the tanks but he couldnt afford to wait not daring to think feeling heat behind him about to boil his wet clothes knowing that hed die if he didnt move he picked up the third extinguisher and ran toward the inferno the shock wave from the first explosion hit him like a punch continuing to run he hurled the third extinguisher ahead of him the next explosion stunned him nearly knocking him down but he couldnt relent couldnt hold back he entered the roaring flames or what had been roaring flames for the explosions and the retardant they spewed had caused a vacuum in the fire then the third extinguisher detonated ahead of him and he found himself racing breath held through an empty corridor in the fire a wall of flames ten feet on each side of him he crashed through unburned undergrowth and lost his balance tumbling down a wooded slope the motion putting out flames on his jacket and pants while with a mighty whoosh the blaze recombined behind him he realized that the throbbing in his legs arms and back must have come from rocks hed rolled over he didnt care pain was life pain urged him forward along a deep gully hed lost the drenched towel hed tied over his head not that it mattered for the fire had quickly dried the towel and the heat on his head was from smoldering hair which he swatted with his hands and sleeves he fell again rolling he came to his feet and staggered onward into darkness he heard the crackle of the blaze spreading behind him but he also heard the thunder of the three helicopters moving toward the side of the bunker that hadnt yet been enclosed by the fire staring up cavanaugh saw the flamereflecting unmarked choppers descend to the treetops saw ropes drop from each chopper saw blackclad men with compact submachine guns slung over their shoulders fling themselves from a hatch in each chopper and rappel to the groundone two three four five men from each hatch they slid smoothly expertly relentlessly down they wore helmets with earphones and radio microphones then they disappeared among the trees and cavanaugh stumbled onward along the dark gully but hed seen enough to conclude that no drug lord not even escobar would have quick access to that many men who looked that well trained the only place men got that kind of training was the military but not just any branch of the military the men whod rappelled from those choppers were obviously specialoperations personnel just as he had belonged to special operations heart pounding furiously he saw the choppers rise and separate moving to equidistant points near the fire making him realize that he was far from being safe for the hunters who remained in those choppers had to be using thermal sensors to search for anyone trying to escape from the flames he didnt dare run the moment the sensors detected a humanshaped source of heat whoever was in charge up there would radio directions to the assault team on the ground the gunmen would converge on that sector of the forest to save himself cavanaugh realized he had to go back to put himself as close as he could risk to the edge of the blaze so that his heat pattern would be disguised by the fires he turned and stumbled up the gully toward where trees and bushes erupted into flames ahead of him the noises they made were like small explosions and gave him hope that when the fire extinguishers had detonated theyd been noticed only as a seemingly natural part of the fires progress he felt the scorched air envelop him and tried to take heart from the thought that he was now invisible to the thermal sensors above him but the heat was so fierce that he couldnt possibly survive if he got any closer to it the fire moved faster forcing him to retreat with increasing speed as bushes in the gully burst into flames and gave the impression of chasing him in that calculated ontheedgeofdeath pattern cavanaugh shifted with the fire moving as it moved his vision blurred his skin felt parched hed never been so thirsty but he couldnt think about any of that for in addition to keeping pace with the fire he had to concentrate on the edges of the blaze to his right and left watching for the gunmen he assumed that they had separated to form a perimeter around the fire keeping pace with it as he was except theyd maintain a safe distance while they hunted for anyone the thermal sensors in the choppers failed to notice pursued by fire as further trees and bushes burst into flames cavanaugh reached a more uneven part of the gully his knees bent he forced them to straighten his chest fought to take in the little air available his knees bent once more and this time he lost his balance toppling no longer rolling smoothly in the shadows at the bottom of the gully he banged his side against a boulder winced and started to come to his feet only to tense making himself motionless as a man holding a submachine gun emerged from trees ahead on cavanaughs right following the edge of the fire a sharp crack of blazing wood made the gunman spin to look behind him in that instant cavanaugh dove to the side of the gully toward a narrow space between the boulder he had banged against and the gullys dirt slope he pressed himself down desperate to merge with the terrain hoping that the soot blackening his clothes and face would make him appear no more than another boulder or a rotting tree trunk if youre hiding never look directly at a man whos searching for you cavanaughs instructors had warned the hunter might notice the glare of your eyes or else the intensity you radiate might make him sense rather than see hes being stared at keep your gaze slightly away from him study him from the side of your eyes use your peripheral vision to keep track of his movements cavanaugh did that now staring toward the opposite side of the gully while concentrating his peripheral vision on the right he saw the blur of the gunmans silhouette descend into the gully the gunman paused as if studying the progress of the fire cavanaugh braced himself to shoot if the man showed any interest in the boulder cavanaugh tried to hide behind the man paused a moment longer too long cavanaugh was just about to pull the trigger when the man climbed from the gully and continued along the edge of the fire the flames got closer pressed down by the accumulating heat cavanaugh squirmed forward past other boulders straining to gain some distance from the fire behind him but unable to proceed with any speed lest the gunman glance back into the gully and notice movement the heat became so intense that as cavanaugh breathed through his mouth trying to get as much air as he could his tongue and throat felt burned above him the three helicopters remained spread out like the points of a triangle continuing to search for the humanshaped thermal pattern of any fleeing survivor feeling heat on the soles of his shoes nearly overcome by the close flames behind him cavanaugh squirmed faster through the boulders he was too low to be able to see if other gunmen approached the gully all he could do was try to solve one problem at a time and at the moment his biggest problem was how not to get burned to death he came under an outcrop of earth which past storms had formed when flash floods raged along the gully and tore a hollow along its side abruptly dirt trickled onto him from the roof the earth of which was held together by roots his muscles compacting cavanaugh again stopped moving and imagined a gunman above him aiming his weapon scanning the edge of the approaching fire he worried that the mans weight would collapse the roof that his hunter would drop on him more specks of dirt fell as the man shifted his weight the specks pelted the back of cavanaughs head fighting not to cough from smoke drifting toward him cavanaugh prepared to shoot if the man descended into the gully then the smoke became so thick that cavanaugh had to hold his breath but the man above him had to be holding his breath also cavanaugh knew the smoke would soon force the man to move the question was would the man move before cavanaugh had to during the arduous training cavanaugh had received in delta force he had once held his breath for four minutes in a room filled with tear gas but that had been years earlier and no matter how determined he was now he doubted that he could hold his breath that long plus he didnt know if the man above him wore some kind of mask that filtered the smoke seeing the flames get nearer almost overpowered by the heat cavanaugh realized that in a very few seconds if the man didnt move he was going to have to roll from his hiding place and shoot then run farther along the gully so hed be able to breathe and then what would other gunmen hear the shots and rush toward this sector even if they didnt hear the shots the man would be expected to use the radio microphone on his helmet to maintain regular contact with the helicopters and the other members of his team when the man didnt report on schedule the other hunters would become suspicious and head in cavanaughs direction so would the helicopters as cavanaugh kept holding his breath spots beginning to swirl in front of his eyes it seemed that the helicopters were already heading in his direction so suddenly loud did they become they were descending toward the trees the man standing above cavanaugh said something cavanaugh couldnt distinguish the man was evidently speaking to his radio microphone his tone urgent the next moment cavanaugh heard heavy footsteps pounding the earth rushing away more dirt fell the thunder of the helicopters became even louder cavanaugh couldnt hold his breath any longer the spots before his eyes thickening he bolted from the hollow scrambling to escape the dense smoke he passed one boulder and then another reaching clear air and filled his lungs despite its warmth the air was cooler than any hed drawn in since hed left the bunker his vision became focused enough for him to see the orange ripple of flames within the smoke that hed left but what he concentrated on aiming his weapon were the rims of the gully toward which he prepared to shoot if any gunmen showed themselves none did to his right the close roar of the helicopters made him peer warily over the slopes rim the fire showed the helicopters a hundred yards away above the trees the gunmen seemed to be magically levitating toward hatches in the choppers although they were actually being drawn up by powerdriven cables it was one of the smoothest extractions cavanaugh had ever seen in what felt like no time at all each of the helicopters raised five men and even before the hatches were closed the helicopters pivoted veering past the fire heading west toward the denser sections of the mountains their thunder receding they vanished into the darkness then the only sound was the roar of the blaze which cavanaugh was now free to get as far away from as he could staggering away reaching cooler air he heard explosions that rumbled from the direction of the bunker obviously the fire had detonated the munitions inside he plodded past more boulders over fallen tree limbs through dense bushes and intersecting evergreen boughs his loss of blood made him so weak that he was tempted to sit and rest but he had to keep moving had to muster all his discipline to put more distance between him and the fire a new sound now intruded in the distance he heard a faint shrill highpitched wail that gained volume coming nearer an approaching siren no he told himself several sirens no doubt the state police and emergency crews from a narrow paved road that went through the nearest town eight miles away theyd be rushing up the barely noticeable treeflanked dirt lane that led to the bunker which they didnt know existed but which theyd have no trouble finding now because of the fire the idea of plodding toward those sirens of reaching the lane and waiting for the headlights of the emergency vehicles was powerfully tempting a chance to rest to get his injuries treated to gulp waterhow thirsty he was his tongue so dry that it felt swollen hed done nothing illegal he had every reason to go to the police and get help but then he imagined all the questions the police would ask him theyd keep him in protective custody which from cavanaughs view meant no protection at all theyd try to guard him at a hospital and then at police headquarters or at their own version of a safe site which wouldnt be safe theyd probably suspect him of being part of the massacre and proving his innocence would take more time causing further delays before he was released putting him at greater risk prescott had wanted him and the rest of the team dead the son of a bitch until cavanaugh had a chance to clear his mind and get his thoughts straightwho were the men in the helicopters were they military as he suspected what did they have to do with prescott the most cautious thing he could do was to make prescott and the men in the choppers believe that every member of the protection team was dead including him otherwise if they learned that he was still alive they might make another attempt although cavanaugh had no idea why the hell they wanted the protection team dead duncan chad tracy roberto the litany of lost friends made cavanaugh want to scream his head pounded harder from too many questions he couldnt answer all he knew for sure was that until he understood what was happening he had to make it seem that he had in fact died im a corpse he thought a walking corpse no not walking staggering he needed all his discipline and strength to place one foot in front of the other and keep moving the ducttaped wound in his shoulder kept aching the skin on his hands face and scalp smarted from having been too close to the flames nonetheless he mustered every residue of energy he could straining to walk straighter and with more control pretend youre at boot camp he thought attempting a joke or betterand this wasnt a jokepretend its your first day of delta force training as he recalled deltas isolated compound at fort bragg a powerful flood of nostalgia seized him make your instructors proud he thought and walked more firmly the sirens approached on cavanaughs right keeping a distance from them using them to determine his direction cavanaugh continued working through the dark forest im going to need help he thought i look like a war atrocity the instant i show myself somebodys going to scream and call the police whos going to help me he thought of the man whod initially been part of the extraction team eddie the gumchewing punmakingthese piecesll soon be in pieces in a sewerdriver whod taken the black car away wary of a possible location transmitter hed intended to abandon it far from the airport cavanaugh had worked with him several times as soon as eddie learned what had happened he would drop everything and come to get cavanaugh as quickly as possible but something about that plan didnt feel right suppose prescott andor the men in the helicopters had an informant in protective services suppose they knew that eddie had been an initial member of the team to assure themselves that cavanaugh and everybody else had been killed theyd maintain surveillance on eddie a phone call that summoned eddie to a town near the destroyed bunker would be an obvious indication that not everyone on the protection team had died cant take the chance cavanaugh thought need to be invisible then who in gods name am i going to ask no matter how he calculated it he always came back to the same answer the one person in the world he didnt want to contact and the only one he could part three threat identification warwick hotel the male receptionists voice sounded sleepy room five oh four please in the darkness cavanaugh used his cell phone keeping his voice low he was hunkered behind rocks and trees a quarter mile past the lights of the town hed spent the previous four hours working toward and then passing hed waited to get this far before calling because there was always the risk that the area around the fire was being monitored by a cellphone scanner a military version could operate from miles away in an effort to learn if thered been any survivors but near a town someone using a cell phone even at this hour wouldnt seem unusual moreover by now emergency personnel would be making numerous cellphone calls which meant that a scanner could isolate a particular conversation only if it was calibrated to identify key words such as dead attack global protective services or cavanaughs name he intended to be as vague as possible youll have to speak louder sir i can barely hear you room five oh four its awfully late are you absolutely certain you wish to disturb my wifes expecting my call the receptionist exhaled wearily ill put you through pressing the phone against his right ear cavanaugh listened to the repeated buzz on the other end uh hello jamies voice was thick with sleep its me cavanaugh sank lower among the trees the phone felt cold in his hand hello i cant its me the phrase was their signal that jamie could trust what he said that no one was forcing him to make the call hed taught her never to use names over the phone he hoped that she remembered same here that completed the signal why are you what time is it that shed absorbed what hed taught her made him relax a little late my god its almost four he imagined jamie brushing back her dark hair and squinting toward the numbers on the digital bedside clock he wanted to tell her immediately what he needed but the conversation had to sound normal in case someone was eavesdropping yeah i know but youve got an early flight and i wanted to make sure i reached you before you checked out and left for the airport i couldnt sleep until we patched up the argument we had argument cavanaugh imagined her frowning saturday afternoon at the hotels bar im sorry you got pissed when i decided to go back to work youre right we should spend more time together he imagined her frowning even harder remember you said you had more money than i did and you wanted to take care of me howd you like to spend some of that money and take care of me now jamie paused a moment evidently trying to figure out where the conversation was going love to good this morning check out of the hotel the same as youd planned but instead of flying home alone why dont you go by car with me well see some country and enjoy ourselves sounds perfect jamie continued to hide her confusion where am i going to get the car rent it go over to the west side and buy it were due for a new one anyhow i never liked the way the old one handled me neither its about time we replaced it what kind should we get a ford taurus is nice nothing too flashy how do you feel about dark blue or dark green my favorite colors jamie still sounded husky from having been wakened it made him wish that he could hold her now get the highend model that one had a twohundredhorsepower engine cavanaugh knew fifty more than in the standard models the extra horses wouldnt win any grand prix speed records unlike the serious racing engines that global protective services put in its tauruses but they definitely added pep and anyway given the millions of tauruses on the road anonymity was now more important to him than massive strength since were going to be traveling for a while i could use more clothes he continued his suitcase had been in the trunk of the taurus that had exploded at the warehouse slacks a sport coat shoes jeans a pullover a pair of rockports you remember my sizes how could i forget nothing gaudy god forbid anything else underwear i love it when you talk sexy socks toothbrush razor a firstaid kit you never know what might happen on the road cant be too careful you have no idea cavanaugh said bring some sandwiches and water plenty of bottled water the phone was silent for a moment while jamie tried to understand the significance of that itll take a while i figured thats why youll need an early start where should i meet you im not sure yet ill call you at noon cant wait to see you same here sorry i woke you hey you can wake me anytime its better if youre next to me though cavanaugh pressed the button that broke the connection he switched off the phone to conserve its battery as well as to prevent it from ringing and attracting attention then he returned the phone to his windbreaker and glanced warily behind him listening for the sounds of emergency vehicles at the town hed passed the fire was close enough that the state police had begun evacuating the inhabitants he had barely been able to sneak across the road and into the continuation of the forest without being noticed in the frequent coming and going of headlights hed seen trucks arriving dropping off men with shovels and chain saws a team that looked ready to use the road as a perimeter from which to try to establish a firebreak other bigger trucks had brought bulldozers he instinctively crouched when he heard a propellerdriven airplane drone overhead no doubt the plane was with the firefighters spotters in it would direct the effort to contain the blaze he assumed and yet he couldnt stop irrationally worrying that the plane might somehow have a thermal sensor and be another part of the effort to hunt him sometimes youve got to have faith he thought using the sounds of the vehicles to guide him he moved lower through the forest five minutes later he heard an approaching helicopter and again crouched before assuring himself that the assault team would never be foolish enough to return to the attack area this helicopter has to be part of the firefighting effort also he told himself perhaps its going to drop water or fireretardant chemicals but even though he was convinced of his logic he felt naked as he continued through the trees a halfmoon provided enough light for him to make his way past murky stumps and evergreen boughs his goal was the next town along the road about five miles farther to the east where a northsouth road intersected with one that came west from the new york state thruway the latter road continued west to the town hed just left it was the route the emergency personnel were using to get to the fire he was certain the state police would establish a blockade at the town he was approaching theyd want to prevent civilian traffic from heading into the fire zone thus jamie wouldnt be able to pick him up unless he found a rendezvous site beyond the blockade soon the gray light of dawn allowed him to increase speed the sun hazed by smoke had been up for a couple of hours when he glimpsed a gray clapboard house through the trees immediately he sank to the ground and peered through the bushes he saw a freshly cultivated vegetable garden a shed a small garage painted the same gray as the house what mostly attracted his attention was a hose on a faucet at the back if i can just crawl over there and get a drink he imagined how cool and sweet the water would taste as it trickled over his lips and down his parched throat he almost weakened and emerged from the bushes a good thing he didnt for five seconds later a slender young woman in work boots jeans a sweatshirt and gloves came out she would definitely have seen him reacted to the dried blood all over him and told the authorities instead she frowned toward the smoke in the sky picked up the hose and called toward the house hey pete i cant tell if that fire they told us about is headed this way but since youre determined to defend the old homestead maybe youd better put down that beer can grab the other hose and give me a hand soaking the roof too dehydrated to sweat in the days heat cavanaugh crept back deeper into the trees at a cautious distance he skirted the house and several others avoiding the town at the northsouth road he descended into a culvert it was cool sandy and dry on the opposite side he reentered the forest but now he took strength from the knowledge that he would soon be able to rest he angled toward the eastwest road that came from the main highway crept to bushes at the edge of it and peered westward toward the crossroads seeing that sure enough the state police had established a blockade but that it was beyond the crossroads within the town itself fine he thought he returned to the trees near the culvert when he looked at his watch he was startled to see that the time was ten minutes past noon he pulled out his phone turned it on and pressed numbers jamies phone buzzed only once before she answered sounding worried yes its me he kept his voice low same here when you didnt call at noon everythings okay youre sure thingsll be even better when you pick me up he heard voices in the background where are you buying the car youd think a cash offer and no haggling would make it go quickly but the paperwork went on and on finally theyre about to give me the keys he held the phone tighter speaking of cash how much do we need at least two thousand in twenties ill bring three tell the bank clerk youre going to atlantic city when you get everything together head north on the new york state thruway about fifty miles past the exit to kingston youll come to a turnoff for a town called baskerville cavanaugh had no choiceat this point he had to mention the name of the town he assumed that it would be referred to in so many cellphone messages between emergency personnel that it would never be a word that a scanner would pick to isolate a conversation follow the road west he continued in about ten miles when you get to baskerville stop at the crossroads and turn right a hundred yards outside town youll see where a dry streambed follows a culvert under the road stop and get out as if you think one of your tires might be leaking and you need to check them crossroads turn right culvert got it thats where youll be thats where ill be he looked up through the trees as another helicopter rumbled overhead a huge canister presumably containing water dangled from its belly unless the forest fire gets worse forest fire when he didnt answer jamie said you really know how to have a good time ill be there as soon as i can call me when youre close ill leave my cell phone on are you honestly okay i will be thanks for helping thanks for asking i never expected you would cavanaugh put the phone in his jacket having finally accomplished everything that needed to be done he glanced around the forest finding a depression in the ground he covered it with dead branches satisfied himself that the camouflage looked natural and crawled beneath the branches into the shadowy hollow there amid the notunpleasant smell of earth he leaned back against the slope he had a temporary sense of relief now all i have to do is wait for jamie he thought despite the shade of the branches spread over him the day became warmer conscious of how awkward the kevlar vest felt he removed it only then did he become aware of the shrapnel embedded in it fragments from one of the fire extinguishers that had exploded he frowned at the shrapnel for almost a minute then he tested the duct tape on his wound which throbbed where his shoulder met his neck the thick silver strips continued to provide a tight seal no blood escaping the swelling made it painful for him to turn his neck he stretched his legs or tried tono sooner had he extended his legs than they retracted bending toward him here it comes he thought it was happening much sooner than he anticipated as long as hed been in motion working to get away from the fire making arrangements with jamie finding a safe haven his adrenaline had been his friend fueling his weary body spurring him on but now that he had nothing to do for the next few hours adrenaline no longer served a purpose it made him jittery not only did it cause his knees to bend toward him but it also made his arms want to fold over his chest already he felt the urge to yawn partly because he lacked sleep but mostly because his muscles needed to release tension you want the high of action you pay the price he thought he hugged himself and shivered waiting for his body to still itself he assumed something like a fetal position which was fitting because he often thought of adrenaline withdrawal as a preparation for rebirth and birth couldnt happen without pain his eyelids felt heavy close to drowsing he adjusted his cell phone so that it would vibrate instead of ring he placed it under his jacket then withdrew his handgun and held it in one of his crossed hands finally all preparations complete he drifted into sleep the tremble of the phone against cavanaughs stomach brought him immediately to consciousness years of discipline had trained him to clear sleeps fuzz from his mind and become instantly alert he felt the phone tremble a second time as he crawled up the hollows slope listened for any threatening sounds and then peered cautiously from beneath the carefully arranged branches the phone trembled a third time while he sniffed the smoke in the air but there wasnt any haze and he concluded that for now he was safe sliding back into the hollow he holstered his handgun and answered the phone taco bell that was another of their codes good youre open jamie said completing the sequence when you didnt answer right away just taking a snooze with the phone pressed to his ear he glanced at his watch the hands of which were close to where are you approaching town i see the crossroads you werent kidding about the fire the mountains covered with smoke theres a roadblock in town cavanaugh hoped that it hadnt been moved lower yes in town a policemans turning away a couple of cars ahead of me you can make the turn at the crossroads yes ill be waiting he broke the connection put the phone in his jacket and grabbed the kevlar vest after another cautious look past the branches that covered the hollow he squirmed up into the forest reached the bushes at its edge and studied the northsouth road above it as jamie had said the mountain was covered with smoke the fire seemed to have headed westward instead of toward town a helicopter flew over the smoke dropping water when a van with an unflashing emergency light went past he stayed low waiting until the noise of its engine receded then he peered toward the road again saw nothing to alarm him and shifted into a grassy ditch following it to the culvert once inside he listened for the echo of a car stopping above him a minute later one did stop someone opened a door and shut it he heard footsteps on pavement and then gravel someone circling a car as if checking for a flat tire where are you jamie asked quietly he moved to the culverts edge look up and down the road anybody watching not a soul get back in the car wait until i slip into the rear seat then drive away cavanaugh listened to jamies footsteps returning to the drivers door his heart pounded faster the moment he heard her open the drivers door he left the culvert rose from the ditch toward the dark taurus opened the door threw in the kevlar vest and climbed in after it lying flat on the seat he closed the rear door jamie wore a tan linen jacket her glossy dark hair was silhouetted against the windshield as she put the taurus into gear she glanced back her green eyes widened at the sight of the dried blood all over him at his torn clothes the dirt the soot his singed hair and the duct tape on his shoulder oh christ she said she made him proud by overcoming her shock turning forward and stepping on the accelerator keeping the vehicle at a speed that was reasonable enough not to attract attention how bad tense she kept her gaze on the road it looks worse than it is his words were like stones in his throat he saw a flat of bottled water on the floor shrinkwrapped plastic covered it mouth dry tongue swollen he yanked at a tab that allowed him to peel off the plastic are youshe took a breathshot yes he grabbed a bottle and untwisted its cap then how could it be worse it wasnt center of mass only my shoulder staying low cavanaugh dumped water into his mouth some of it spilling over his lips then onto his jacket and the seat his tongue was like a sponge absorbing it jamies voice became agitated is that like saying its only a flesh wound what is that duct tape dont leave home without it you patched yourself up like youre a leaky pipe for gods sake you could die from infection im taking you to a doctor no cavanaugh said quickly no doctor but a doctor would have to report a gunshot wound to the police i dont want the police involved i dont want the authorities to know im alive doesnt protective services have doctors yes then i cant let anybody there know im alive either what the hell is going on cavanaugh gulped more water he was so parched he could feel it flow down his throat and into his esophagus next to the flat of bottled water he saw a small styrofoam cooler his wounded shoulder aching he pulled off the coolers top and looked inside pastrami on rye jamie said potato salad and coleslaw therere a couple of dill pickles in there too cavanaugh bit off a chunk of sandwich and chewed it hungrily with the first swallow though he suddenly felt ill he lay back staring at the ceiling which seemed to waver as he felt the smooth vibration of the car youre serious no doctor jamie asked no doctor where do you want me to take you back to the highway head north albanys about an hour away check us into a motel one of those places where you can park outside the room let me guessnothing fancy right on the seedy side where its not unusual to pay cash and people dont like to phone the police i can tell this is going to be charming did you bring a firstaid kit something in your voice made me think i should get a big one its with those bags of clothes on the floor cavanaugh sorted among the bags and found a plastic firstaid kit the size of a large phone book his wound aching more he pried the kit open and sorted among bandages ointments a pair of scissors finding several twocapsule packets of tylenol he tore a couple of packets open and swallowed their contents downing them with water drink slowly he warned himself dont make yourself sick ive been patient jamie said ive asked you only once you want to know whats going on gosh how did you guess ive never told you about my assignments thats right jamie kept driving but this time you will yes cavanaugh said if youre going to risk your life to help me you have a right to know what youre getting into this time ill tell you the albany motel called the days end inn was on a side street five blocks off the highway in a cutrate district away from the holiday inns and best westerns two bars a transmissionrepair shop and a hamburger joint were typical of the adjacent buildings with the lowering sun casting shadows the transmission shop was closed a few men got out of pickup trucks and went into one of the bars otherwise there was hardly anybody on the street en route cavanaugh had used some of the bottled water to rinse blood and soot from his face hed put on the sport coat jeans and pullover that jamie had bought for him concealing the duct tape on his shoulder a baseball cap that jamie had thought to include covered his singed hair allowing him to sit up without attracting attention he studied the drab street while jamie went into the office to rent a room holding a key attached to a large yellow plastic cube she returned to the car you paid cash he asked yes i told the clerk our credit card had been stolen as good an explanation as any hes probably used to couples paying cash maybe he thinks were having an affair jamie drove off the street heading toward the back of the motel i understand why you dont want me to use a credit card no paper trail but in theory no one knows about me right in theory cavanaugh said i never told anybody at protective services not even duncan in a flash of memory cavanaugh saw duncans mutilated face his grief and rage intensified jamie parked near a dumpster at the nexttolast unit then arent you being more careful than necessary she shook her head i know what youre going to say theres no such thing as being too careful despite how he felt he managed a smile jamie got out of the car went over to the motel units door and unlocked it simultaneously cavanaugh opened the cars rear door picked up several packages which would distract anybody glancing in his directionpeople love looking at packagesand walked as steadily as he could into the shadowy unit two regular beds had faded covers a table had scratches a small television was bolted to the wall the carpet was thin the mirror over the bureau had a crack in one corner you said you wanted seedy jamie said the room smelled faintly of cigarette smoke there werent any nonsmoking units jamie said its fine cavanaugh set the packages on a table eased onto the bed and sank back closing his eyes hoping for the unsteadiness in his head to lessen a good place to hide you did great ill get the water and the rest of the stuff from the car after jamie finished she shut the door and locked it on the bed keeping his eyes closed cavanaugh sensed her studying him should i leave the lights off she asked yes what can i do for you bring me more water give me more tylenol is the wound infected he swallowed the capsules and the water i guesshe man aged to rouse himselfwed better find out the hot shower cascaded over cavanaugh drenching his bowed head and his back then he tilted his head up letting the water pour over his face and chest he was so unsteady he had to sit the shower curtain was pulled open silhouetted by the light from a makeup mirror outside the shower stall jamie lowered the lid on the toilet seat she sat put her elbows on her knees and watched him although the light out there hurt his eyes it allowed him to see the blood dirt and soot swirling down the drain as he shampooed his head bits of singed hair followed them youve got bruises on your legs and chest she said during the drive north he had haltingly told her what had happened again she had made him proud by listening not interrupting with outbursts instead swallowing her emotions and asking occasional necessary questions must have been when i rolled down the gully he said you could have been an operator you know that you learn fast i dont know where you got them but you have the right instincts her solemnity straining her beauty jamie said the instincts come from hanging around with you she rolled up her sleeves and soaped his back so why did prescott want your team dead and who were the guys in the helicopters they handled themselves the way military special ops teams do cavanaugh said what about the assault team at the warehouse they had hardware but their tactics were conventional they werent as disciplined as the guys in the helicopters when they stormed the stairs at the warehouse they hung back almost as if they were afraid he turned off the shower as the water dripped from him neither he nor jamie moved for a moment i guess its show time he said you remember what needs to be done you were very clear okay cavanaugh took a deep breath reached his right hand to his left shoulder pried up the edges on the duct tape exhaled took another deep breath and started to pull the strips away the pliant tape had a sticky underside that parted slowly from his skin he couldnt do it quickly because he wanted to avoid tearing and widening the wound each second prolonged the pain with the tape off blood now flowed but not as much as when hed first been shot clots having formed in the meantime immediately jamie pressed the soapy washcloth onto it swabbing quickly but gently cleaning away dirt and puss he grimaced done she said he leaned forward to turn on the shower rinsing i cant move my head enough to see it its a gouge across the top of your shoulder the good news is as much as i can tell the bullet went through felt like it whats the bad news the gouge is two inches long cavanaugh nodded as blood flowed down the drain he turned the shower off and braced himself for what jamie was going to do next before checking into the motel theyd made a quick stop at a drugstore to buy a bottle of hydrogen peroxide jamie opened the bottle and poured it over the wound as the liquid bubbled and foamed in the long deep gouge the pain felt like razors and fire combined he gritted his teeth and grabbed the side of the tub rinse it jamie told him his vision shaking he turned on the shower again more blood mixed with foaming liquid swirled down the drain when he leaned back from the spray jamie poured another stream of hydrogen peroxide again the long deep gouge erupted in bloody foam christ almighty cavanaugh murmured he leaned into the spray as more bloody foam swirled down the drain he turned off the shower and slumped over the side of the tub feeling jamie towel the wound his jaw muscles hardened the skins red jamie said the tape must have irritated it no this is a different kind of red it looks like the wounds infected jamie soaked up more blood in a rush while the gouge was temporarily dry she opened a tube of antibiotic cream squeezed half of it along the gouge pressed a wad of gauze over that and sealed everything with several strips of firstaid tape he took a deep breath can you stand jamie asked he slipped when he tried jamie grabbed him before he could fall water from him sticking her blouse to her chest she sat him on the toilet lid and used the last towel a big one to dry his arms chest head and back avoiding the area of the wound the thick bandage on it now pink with blood im going to pull you up jamie said off balance cavanaugh felt her move the towel over his legs privates and hips apart from the pain in his shoulder his sensations came from a distance as if his body didnt belong to him hang on jamie hooked his arm around her neck and guided him into the shadowy bedroom easing him onto the nearer of the two beds you feel hot do you think you have a fever before he could answer he started shivering as his chills became more violent jamie took off her slacks got under the covers and held him you need a no cavanaugh managed to say between shivers his eyelids felt heavier the shadows in the room darkened she held him closer a tug at cavanaughs shoulder woke him blinking from faint light filtering through curtains he managed not to wince when jamie removed the bandage from his shoulder her green eyes narrowed assessing the wound how does it as red as last night she said he felt something inside him tighten but at least you dont feel as hot thats encouraging dont you think the wound crusted over see what i mean encouraging she applied more antibiotic cream covered it with another wad of gauze and taped the wound securely whats the time reflexively cavanaugh looked at the bedside clock and frowned at red numbers that told him more troubled he pointed toward the curtains how can it be light this early in the morning its afternoon what you slept all night and most of the day dont you remember i fed you more of the pastrami sandwich and some of the potato salad from the cooler no this morning no a couple of times i helped you into the bathroom cavanaugh looked blankly at her when the maid came to clean the room i went outside to talk with her jamie said i told her you were sick from eating sandwiches that had spoiled in the car i said i didnt want to leave you alone then i gave her money to give to the desk clerk to rent this room for another night i called the front desk and she did pass the money along no problem the clerk said yes youve definitely got the instincts of an operator you need to eat again not hungry that doesnt matter you wont heal if you dont eat cant stand the thought of pastrami and potato salad theyve probably gone bad by now anyhow name something pizza we can have it delivered he started to object she made him proud by anticipating i take that back no deliveries lousy security right right then ill have to go out and get something theres no alternative tell me what sounds good fried chicken a milk shake anything cavanaugh had to make her think he had an appetite otherwise she might be more tempted to get a doctor the chicken help me to the bathroom afterward she handed him shaving soap and a new razor scraping off his three days of beard stubble made him feel cleaner nonetheless he was exhausted by the time he got back in bed will you be all right while i go out jamie asked if the assault team knew where we were theyd have broken in by now a sheet and blanket over him cavanaugh propped himself up on pillows put the do not disturb sign on the knob outside and hand me my pistol you wouldnt think you needed the gun if you didnt suspect there might still be a threat force of habit right she said skeptically i cant wait for that chicken right she added more skeptically then left hearing her test the door to make sure it was locked cavanaugh glanced at the bedside clock which read there was something he needed to know he reached stiffly for the televisions remote control on the bedside table and pointed it beyond the foot of the bed switching on the television and looking for a local station on channel the live at news was starting as cavanaugh had expected the fire was one of the initial stories he concentrated on what the reporter said while watching shots of exhaustedlooking firefighters working with chain saws shovels and hoses to keep flames away from the first town hed reached the previous afternoon swooping through smoke a helicopter dropped fireretardant chemicals on the blaze the fire was ninety percent contained by midafternoon one of the local news anchors assured her audience and then switched to a story about a political scandal in albany involving a state senator whod been arrested for driving drunk and hitting a teenaged bicyclist breaking her legs baffled cavanaugh stared at the television and then moved up through the channels stopping at channel where a story about the fire was just ending stunned he listened to a male reporter tell him that by late afternoon the fire had been fully contained he went back to channel so troubled that he barely paid attention to the images on the screen at another edition of the local news came on and now the story about the allegedly drunkdriving senator got most of the attention the firefully containedgot only a half minute of attention he switched to channel where the story about the contained fire came on just before the weather report he frowned at six oclock as yet another edition of the local news started cavanaugh heard a rap on the door then a triple rap followed by a key in the lock just in case jamie had an unwelcome companion cavanaugh put his handgun under the covers and aimed it toward the door jamie entered carrying paper bags marked kentucky fried chicken cavanaugh loosened his grip on his pistol any trouble she asked just something i saw on television jamie locked the door and removed cardboard cartons from the bags what did you see that bothered you its what i didnt see she shook her head puzzled take a look cavanaugh said she sat next to him while the local news continued the political scandal was again the top story followed by a report about a series of gasstation holdups as on channel the story about the contained fire came just before the weather report there were just a few shots of firefighters see what i mean cavanaugh asked i hardly saw anything if id blinked id have missed the story jamie turned from the television and frowned at him four people killed a secret bunker helicopters with rockets and all we see on the news are some firefighters with axes in their hands and dirt on their faces the earlier reports were longer but basically the same cavanaugh said maybe the fire crews havent been able to get to where it started so they havent found the bodies maybe he said but the area where the fire started would have been the first to stop burning due to the lack of fuel spotter planes would be able to see the destroyed helicopter and the two destroyed jeeps chad and tracy were blown apart anger made his voice hoarse but robertos body was intact even burned it would still look like a body and surely somebody in a nearby town heard the three helicopters and the explosions i bought the albany times union jamie went over to the bureau its this mornings newspaper so it wont have uptotheminute developments but maybe itll tell us something she took the paper from next to the bags and brought it to the bed the story about the fire was at the bottom of the first page it had a photograph of a haggard firefighter partially enveloped by smoke the story carried over to page eight where it was again at the bottom there jamie pointed toward a paragraph at the end somebody in a nearby town heard explosions from propane tanks cavanaugh couldnt believe what he read she quoted the passage authorities theorize that the fire detonated propane storage tanks when it reached cabins higher on the mountainside there arent any cabins near the bunker so theyre just guessing about what caused the explosions jamie said or somebodys lying did you notice that bit about a special team being brought in to investigate what caused the fire youre thinking of a coverup it wouldnt be impossible cavanaugh said somebody with influence puts pressure on the local authorities and arranges for the firefighters to keep a distance while a special team goes to where the fire started the sites remote enough that it could be easily sanitized no one would see helicopters coming in to remove bodies and wreckage somebody with influence youre talking about the government i dont know who else would be powerful enough to keep everybody away from the site cavanaugh said but what on earth did prescott have to do with the government when cavanaugh shrugged he wished he hadnt the motion causing pain in his wounded shoulder his lab was hired by the dea to do research on ways of stopping addiction that doesnt explain why a special ops military team would be involved jamie said or why anybody would want your team dead at the warehouse the attackers wanted prescott alive it certainly looked that way they had several chances to kill the two of us instead they tried to trap us but at the bunker they suddenly wanted to kill everybody cavanaugh nodded again what made them change their mind or was the protection team the real target and prescott was bait tricking us to go with him to the bunker where he arranged for us to be trapped but why would anybody want to kill your team can you think of anything you learned on a past assignment that would make you and the rest of the group targets as far as i know ive never seen or heard anything so serious that a former client would feel threatened because id learned about itcavanaugh said anyway chad tracy and roberto hadnt worked on the same assignment with duncan and me in the past six months even if they had there wasnt any way for the attackers to know whod be on this assignment duncan didnt know until the last minute this is just an idea but jamie hesitated he waited while you were sleeping i had a lot of time to think about this suppose the assault teams were not in fact related to each other keep talking suppose the first group wanted to capture prescott just as their tactics indicated jamie said and the second group wanted to kill him exactly as it seemed cavanaugh asked kill prescott you and your team were only secondary targets you were simply in the way but that doesnt explain why prescott wanted to kill us all his behavior doesnt make sense if he wasnt working for the guys in the choppers who looked like a special ops team from the military jamie said you told me you saw them being hoisted back up into the choppers yes you saw all of them yes i had to make sure all of them were gone did you see prescott being hoisted up with them no doesnt that strike you as odd if he was one of them maybe he was killed in the fire and they didnt take his body not if they couldnt get to it that would be one of the things this special unit the newspaper referred to would want to take out of there jamie glanced down at the worn carpet or maybe the facts are exactly as they seem the first group wanted prescott alive the second group wanted him dead he was scared to death of both of them and your team did have information that absolutely had to remain a secret immediately cavanaugh felt coldnot from chills as a consequence of his fever but from the sudden intuition that jamie was onto something jesus information that made you a threat jamie said the plans for prescott to disappear agitated cavanaugh sat up wincing from the pain this caused his wound the son of a bitch it was clear to him now that prescott had realized who was in the helicopters and that hed been certain this group unlike the first one wanted to kill him hed known that the assault team would destroy any vehicle attempting to leave the bunker just as hed been sure the attackers would have sufficient armaments to blast their way into the bunker and overwhelm the protection team seconds away from being killed hed panicked deciding the only way he could escape was by creating a diversion for the helicopters hed started the fire desperately believing it would give him a chance to slip away as opposed to waiting for the certain death speeding toward him but he couldnt stop worrying that a member of the protection team would somehow survive the attack and be captured i think killing us was prescotts intention from the start cavanaugh said he had to guarantee that no one would ever know how wed arranged for him to disappear that way he could be sure his secret was totally safe he wouldnt have to lie awake night after night fearing that his enemies had tortured one of us into revealing his new identity and where hed gone but how did he hope to escape the fire hes extremely calculating he asks questions he watches he learns i avoided the assault team by staying close to the fire so the thermal sensors in the choppers wouldnt detect my heat pattern if i could figure that out why couldnt somebody as smart as he is theres a big difference you had me to call for help but a man that desperate wouldnt trust anybody to come and get him you said hes overweight hed be able to walk only so far how did he expect to leave the area maybe he did call somebody cavanaugh said as soon as he was taken to a safe place he would have killed the person who helped himto keep that person from revealing where he was jamies eyes darkened or maybe he reached the nearest town and forced somebody to drive him or maybe a sudden realization caught cavanaugh by surprise he cant let anybody know how hes going to disappear the agitation of cavanaughs emotions made him lightheaded again he managed to stand where are my clothes jamie looked alarmed youll fall on your face what are you trying to i just realized where prescott went he grabbed his cell phone pressing numbers on the other end the phone buzzed quick help me get dressed ill need my kevlar vest the phone buzzed again answer answer he pleaded to the person he was calling the phone buzzed a third time we have to get to her her jamie asked the phone buzzed a fourth time a recorded female voice said leave a name a number and a message ill return your call as soon as possible cavanaugh canceled the transmission hurry theres a woman here in albany i think prescotts going to kill as jamie drove quickly through albanys sunsettinted streets cavanaugh needed all his energy to explain we gave prescott the name and phone number of a bank along with an account number after he laundered his money he was supposed to wire a hundred thousand dollars to a document forger who lives here in albany following cavanaughs directions driving as fast as the speed limit allowed jamie rounded a curve and entered a park the motion increased cavanaughs dizziness but he didnt let jamie suspect for fear that shed reduce speed nothing mattered except reaching their destination the forger had a social security number a passport a drivers license a birth certificate credit cards an entire identity kit and new name ready for him cavanaugh took another deep breath all prescott had to do was decide how he wanted to change his appearance dye his hair or shave it put on a fake mustache while he grew one whatever once he made a preliminary attempt to alter his looks the forger was going to take his photograph for the passport and the drivers license and prescott would be ready to start his new life wed planned to take him to her yesterday morning who karen atherton ive been trying to remember if any of us mentioned her name to prescott i think duncan did only her first name but that the name and phone number of her bank and her account number would be all prescottd need to find her reducing her speed a fraction below the limit jamie passed a police car at the side of the road as she left the park how could her account number help him find her prescotts hideyhole at the warehouse was filled with electronics im guessing hes as skilled with computers as i am with weapons knowing the banks name armed with an account number cavanaughs voice faltered are you okay just getting my second wind cavanaugh forced himself to keep talking armed with an account number a hacker wouldnt take long to get karens name and address off the banks web site but theres another way continuing to follow cavanaughs directions jamie entered an upscale residential district of spacious yards with towering trees in front of remodeled nineteenthcentury homes how hes one of the most natural elicitors ive ever come across jamie was familiar with the term someone with the essential tradecraft ability to draw information from people without seeming to pretend you work at the banks accountinformation department cavanaugh said ill pretend to be prescott phoning you he made himself sound impatient this is about account number five five seven six three my wife and i got married three months ago she called your department to change her name and address but we havent gotten any statements since then i contacted the bank several times about this damn it cant anybody down there help the account should be for karen washburn jamie took a second to realize what the intimidated bank clerk would probably say no sir karen atherton that was her name before we got married the address is four four four crestview lane no sir two five six morgan avenue thats where she used to live thats why her bank statements havent been getting to us would you make sure the changes get made cavanaugh lapsed out of the impatient tone see how easy it is prescotts shrewd enough to manipulate people that way hell he manipulated me what makes me feel especially foolish is i kind of liked him at the warehouse he was scared to death but he never allowed himself to lose control he did everything i told him to at the bunker he wouldnt have started the fire unless he felt absolutely cornered its difficult to imagine the amount of courage he needed to try to kill us courage jamie looked confused you sound almost as if you admire him admire him i hate him more than ive ever hated anybody in my life the weight of cavanaughs statement made them go quiet for a moment the house is just around the corner he said jamie turned onto another street with big yards stately trees and majestic old homes a lawn mower droned there cavanaugh said that victorian it had two and a half stories with peaks gables and a long wide porch painted white the trim gray park down the street cavanaugh eased down so he wouldnt be noticed far enough away that if prescotts in there he wont see the car why is there a ramp next to the porch steps jamie asked as she passed the house karens in a wheelchair shes crippled from a car accident and yet she chooses to live in a twoandahalfstory victorian actually the house suits karen fine it has a reconditioned elevator that dates back to the s she gets from floor to floor with no trouble shes even able to use the toilet and climb in and out of the bathtub by herself which is why the answering machine bothered menormally shes able to answer the phone unless shes out of the house a possibility but what if she isnt call the police tell them you think a neighbors in danger the police have a sophisticated caller id system theyd trace the call to your cell phone even though youve got the number blocked if somethings wrong in there theyd link you to it then use a pay phone how seriously would the police treat that cavanaugh asked would they decide the call was a prank would they hurry over or would they wait until a patrol car was in the neighborhood if they didnt get an answer would they barge inside to make sure everything was okay and if everything was okay but they got a look around they might start wondering what karen did with the hightech printing equipment and the blank documents no karen might be in danger right now theres no time to try to convince the police i have to do this you make her sound more important to you than just someone you work with shes the sister of a friend i had in delta force jamie looked as if that wasnt a compelling reason his name was ben cavanaugh said he bled to death while i carried him back from a mission jamie studied him karen was his only family i promised id take care of her then wed better make good on your promise jamie executed a uturn at the end of the block and parked facing the house she and cavanaugh got out of the car you cant come with me his kevlar vest felt heavy under his shirt and sport coat but if prescotts in there things could turn ugly fast i can help if we had a pistol for youcavanaugh had taught jamie how to use onemaybe you could but i cant let you risk your life when you dont have a way to protect yourself ill be so preoccupied that i cant protect you either the best thing you can do is stay in the car with the cell phone in your hand if i call and yell for help ill floor the accelerator and get to the house if i have to ill drive up onto the porch good cavanaugh smiled and held her careful with his shoulder you were talking about bravery a minute ago i dont understand how arent you afraid going in there afraid for karen shes all im thinking about the sun cast long shadows cavanaughs concentration made karens house seem bigger than the othersmore so the closer he came there wasnt a lane behind it only the backs of other housesno place for him to try to sneak up from behind without attracting suspicion from the neighbors who would probably phone the police about him thus his only choice was to go in through the front as if visiting he noticed that despite the approaching dusk there werent any lights in the house that could be a bad sign or it could mean karen wasnt at home that a friend had come to drive her somewhere to a movie perhaps that would explain why karen hadnt answered the phone but then wouldnt karen have left some lights on or have put them on timers so that the house wouldnt be dark when she returned he wondered he reached the front of the house and proceeded up the sidewalk passing the carefully mowed lawn on his way to the wide porch at the sight of any suspicious movement beyond the front windows he was prepared to draw his weapon and take cover mounting the porch steps he felt naked but because he knew he wouldnt be able to live with himself if he didnt honor his promise to his dead friend he forced himself to keep going putting his right hand under his sport coat resting it on his pistol he peered through the glass that formed the top third of the front door all he saw were the shadows of a corridor on impulse he turned the knob and pushed surprised to find that the door swung open did it make sense that a woman in a wheelchair would leave her door unlocked he drew his pistol and eased inside his wounded shoulder hurt as he raised his weapon with two hands and sighted along it checking the dusky corridor the stairs that flanked it a room on the right and a room on the left careful to minimize noise he reached behind him and closed the door holding his breath he listened but heard only silence the house felt empty but that impression meant nothing where to start cavanaugh needed to think for only a moment before knowing the room he had to check first he started slowly along the corridor taking small steps that allowed him to be sure of his balance all the while aiming with both hands he focused his vision so that the wide notch in the sight over the pistols hammer framed the post on top of the barrel that post had a luminous tritium dot that glowed green in the dark invisible from in front of the weapon the dot was vivid to cavanaugh and without hampering his night vision it helped him line up the sights in the deepening shadows he passed a closed door on his rightthe entrance to the elevator hed told jamie aboutreached the end of the corridor and scanned a kitchen that included a brick fireplace and a modern stove that imitated an oldfashioned castiron one turning to a door on his left he stayed out of the line of fire twisted the knob hating the slight scrape of metal and pulled the house became quiet again remaining to the side cavanaugh inhaledone two threeheld his breathone two threeand exhaledone two threeworking to control his heartbeat and his breath rate at once he pivoted into view and pointed his weapon down the stairs to the basement the shadows below were darker than in the kitchen but seemed to remain constant knowing that karen kept a flashlight in a drawer to the right of the corridor cavanaugh quietly pulled it out he crouched and used his left hand to raise the flashlight above his head pointing it down the stairs when he turned on the light anyone down there would be tempted to fire at its beam assuming it was center of mass meanwhile cavanaugh would be able to shoot at the muzzle flash but no one fired again he listened again the house became silent when he started down he made a step creak the sound sent a spark along his nerves inhaleone two three hold itone two three exhaleone two three he continued down unexpectedly cavanaughs leg felt unsteady then his stomach began to feel jittery just athletic reflexes getting ready for action he told himself just my heart pounding out more blood but at the same time a vaguely pungent smell pinched cavanaughs nostrils seeming to make his heart race even faster it was somehow familiar but he couldnt remember where hed encountered it before and he didnt dare distract himself by trying to jog his memory he had to concentrate on whatever he might find beyond his flashlight beam at the bottom of the stairs halfway down moving with greater care to keep his balance he felt his legs become more rubbery the pungent smell was a little stronger his hands shook making it difficult to sight along his weapon adrenalines my friend he told himself my legs are jittery because theyre ready to spring into action my hearts racing so my muscles will have plenty of blood my stomachs hot because of all the chemical changes my bodys going through the glucose and fatty acids my livers working to produce so ill have instant energy my lungs are heaving so ill have plenty of oxygen when i need it he knew that what he felt was a socalled fight or flight response but flight meant panic and never once in his life especially when hed been in combat had he ever felt the urge to flee except now whats happening to me cavanaugh thought reaching the bottom of the stairs as the pungent smell made his nostrils contract even harder a deep part of his mind squirmed and shouted urging him to race back up the stairs to get out of the house before before what inhaleone two three hold itone two three exhale one two three but cavanaugh couldnt maintain the rhythm no matter how strongly he tried his breath rate became so rapid that it verged on being out of control he felt lightheaded flashlight wavering he aimed it and his pistol along the dark corridor that matched the one above him he remembered a light switch on his left but he didnt turn it on wanting the flashlight to blind anyone he might confront in the darkness his wounded shoulder ached while he kept his left hand the one with the flashlight outstretched from his body so that if anyone shot at it he wouldnt take the bullet in a vital area because his position was reversed relative to the upstairs corridor his unsteady flashlight revealed that the closed elevator door was now on his left another closed door awaited beyond itand two closed doors on his right the pungent smell increased with each unwilling step he took along the corridor his stomach now felt so jittery that he feared he would vomit his legs wanted to buckle his body threatened to sink to the floor his back to the wall his knees to his chest his arms around them trembling appalled by how his emotions wanted to betray him he mentally cursed himself sweat soaking his clothes he strained to remember every insult his instructors had barked at him every command every painfully acquired lesson damn it adrenalines my friend forcing his mind to focus on karen on the promise hed made cavanaugh took another hesitant step along the dark corridor abruptly he recalled why the pungent smell was vaguely familiar to him the warehouse hed come across a less noticeable form of it in the abandoned building where prescott had been hiding when hed sensed it on the stairs leading up to prescotts hideyhole misgivings had tempted him not to go any farther and to return to his car instead his uneasiness had been modest compared to the apprehension with which he now struggled if not for his training and willpower he wouldnt have been able to continue up the warehouse stairs prescott the bastards been here cavanaugh smelled something else searching for its source he angled his trembling flashlight toward the floor ahead of him the farther door on the left led to a storage room on the right the farther door led to a bathroom the one immediately on his right led to karens workroom where she kept her digital cameras her computers and special printers it was toward the bottom of the latter door that cavanaugh tilted the flashlight sickened by the sight of smoke leaking from its bottom and a slight flicker beyond it he touched the doorknob which felt slightly warm a panicked part of his mind screamed run but another part shouted karen and made him shove the door in the fire almost blinded him but that wasnt what cavanaugh stared at flanked by flames that leapt among photographic equipment computers and printers karen faced him slumped in her wheelchair the once pixielike redhead was motionless her hands to her chest her eyes as wide as any cavanaugh had ever seen her features contorted in horror her cheeks were so pale that her freckles appeared scarlet she was only forty years old but the twisted expression on her face made her look twice that cavanaugh shoved the flashlight into a sportcoat pocket and rushed toward her but the flames reached her before he could get near enough to pull her away not that it would have mattered if hed reached her karen remained motionless in her wheelchair unresponsive to the blaze that consumed her dead but how cavanaugh thought backing from the fire hed seen no injuries no traumas to her face no blood from a bullet wound no bruising or swelling at her throat from having been choked the fierce way she clutched her chest it was as if shed had a heart attack the flames strengthened stumbling back into the corridor cavanaugh saw that the strongest part of them came from a corner behind the photographic equipment from the bottom of the wall as if a short circuit had started a small fire that had accumulated behind the wall until the flames gained enough power to burst through and fill the room prescott must have rigged something in a wall socket to make it seem that the fire had broken out accidentally cavanaugh hadnt smelled smoke when hed entered the house because it had taken a while for the blaze to erupt from the wall how prescott loved to use fire as a weapon lungs irritated by smoke cavanaugh raced along the corridor and charged up the stairs inexplicably he felt an overwhelming urge to stop the apprehension that had seized him earlier gripped him even more powerfully his heart pounded faster than hed ever felt it his chest heaved so quickly that he feared his lungs would burst fight or flight he wanted nothing more than to run from the blaze but while he hesitated on the stairs almost paralyzed with alarm he stared upward and at last understood why his instincts had warned him not to rush higher the door at the top had been open when hed descended now it was closed prescott had stayed to make certain the fire would spread cavanaugh was certain of that just as he was certain that the door would be locked when he climbed to it he coughed from smoke and felt heat behind him get up there and break the door down he thought and what if prescott stays until the last minute what if he still has robertos ar he wants to make this look like an accident but if he has to hell shoot cavanaugh stumbled back down the stairs turning he saw the blaze spread from karens workroom he yanked open the elevator door relieved to find that the burnished oak compartment was on the basement level like anyone whose legs were functional and who was in a hurry prescott had used the stairs cavanaugh took the flashlight from his sport coat and frantically studied the elevators ceiling feeling a surge of hope when he saw the twofootsquare maintenance hatch that he recalled being there unlike elevators in todays commercial buildings this compartment was modest in size with a ceiling that cavanaugh could touch he prayed that the noise from the fire was loud enough to muffle the sound he made when he lifted the hatchs cover and tilted it back as the fire stretched toward the elevator he pulled the door shut and closed the metal gate no matter how much he tried to move the gate softly its bars jangled and all he could do was pray that the roar of the fire had muffled that sound also in the small enclosure cavanaughs harsh rapid breathing echoed loudly sweat poured off his face elevators he hated elevators he never knew when something would go wrong to stop them or what threat would face him when the door opened smoke squeezed under the door and began to fill the compartment in something like panic an emotion that had never seized cavanaugh until this moment he pressed a button marked if the fire had caused the houses electrical breaker box to trip off if the elevators motor didnt work he wanted to scream the impulse wedged in his throat when the elevator jerked unlike highspeed office elevators this one was designed to rise slowly shaking he holstered his pistol he reached up set the flashlight on top of the hatch cover then grabbed the hatchs rim and flexed his arms to raise himself agony racked his left shoulder the elevator vibrating as it inched higher he heard a tear on his shoulder as the bandage yanked free from his skin pulling himself up he felt warm liquid on his shoulder as his wound reopened but he didnt care about the blood and he didnt care about his pain all that mattered was getting out of the elevator while it rose languidly higher smoke continued to fill the compartment heat seeped in blood trickling down his chest soaking his shirt and jacket he felt a panicdriven surge of more strength than seemed possible never not even on the most harrowing of missions had he known visceral power of this magnitude his pain became nothing the weakness in his shoulder disappeared replaced by impossible energy that urged him up through the opening as the floor that hed been standing on began to smolder breathing raspily cavanaugh stared down through the opening past the smoke toward the glowing embers of the floor at once he heard a muffled poppoppop the crack of wood splitting bullets piercing the elevators firstfloor door and slamming against the back wall as the elevator continued rising inching past the door a more rapid poppoppop sent more bullets into the compartment chunks of wood bursting from the door the shots were too muted to be heard outside the house which meant that prescott had to be using a sound suppressor but sound suppressors couldnt be purchased legally where had he managed to find one where would i have found one cavanaugh thought the answer was immediate if i had to id empty a plastic water container and jam it over the barrel but ive been trained to know these things how would prescott know that answer too was immediate prescott had yesterday and today to consider the problem cavanaugh thought its his business to understand physics and one other thing maybe hes a natural at this as the elevator labored higher the shooting stopped cavanaugh imagined prescott listening to the elevator rise past him then charging along the corridor toward the stairs that led to the next floor his heavy footsteps pounding upward even overweight prescott could reach the next level before the elevator stopped there above him cavanaugh heard wheels creaking a motor working the cable that lifted the elevator below the floor of the elevator burst into flames at the same time cavanaugh heard another poppoppop bullets shattering the secondfloor door riddling the compartment if prescott had used a plastic bottle as a sound supressor the bullets would have blasted it apart by now he must have switched to something else maybe wrapping a jacket around the mouth of the barrel but the jacket would be quickly blown apart also and cavanaugh guessed that from now on prescotts shots would be loud enough for someone outside to hear them the wheels stopped creaking the motor ceased droning the elevator quivered to a stop the only sound became the crackle of flames on the elevators floor the rising heat was powerful enough that cavanaugh had to move his face away from the opening then another sound caught his attention or maybe he only imagined it amid the crackling flames the subtle scrape of hinges cavanaugh shut off the flashlight the elevator door was slowly being opened prescott would stand to the side cavanaugh was certain of that certain that prescott wouldnt frame himself in the doorway wouldnt make himself a target from the side through the slightly opened door prescott would see the flames would he open the door farther or would he take for granted that the bullets hed shot into the elevator combined with the fire in the compartment would have done the job cavanaughs pounding heart shook his ribs feeling increased heat through the open hatch he stared up toward a third elevator door one that led to the attic the elevator wasnt designed to rise that high nor was the door up there intended to let passengers in and out half the size of the doors on the other levels this one was intended to allow maintenance personnel into the top of the shaft to grease wheels and cables the door below suddenly flew all the way open from a wary angle prescott would see that cavanaughs body wasnt crumpled on the floor because it wasnt possible for someone in the basement to cause the elevator to rise unless that person was inside the compartment with both the door and the gate closed prescott would take very little time to realize that cavanaugh must have climbed up through the maintenance hatch all prescott needed to do was tilt his rifle upward toward the opening and needing both hands free cavanaugh shoved the flashlight into his sport coat his wounded shoulder throbbed as he grabbed the elevator cable and strained to pull himself up at the level of the attic door he clung to the cable with his right hand while he stretched his bleeding left arm toward the door desperate he pushed it open grabbed the edge of the doorjamb almost screamed from the pain in his shoulder and pulled himself into the dark attic the effort dislodged the flashlight from his pocket a moment after it clattered a roar of gunshots tore chunks from the elevators ceiling bullets rammed into the top of the shaft as cavanaugh rolled across the attic floor jolting against what felt like a trunk frantic he pushed the trunk toward the open door and shoved it into the elevator shaft its impact on the elevators roof might trick prescott into thinking that cavanaugh had been hit and had fallen but those shots hadnt been muted by a sound suppressor the neighbors would have heard them and phoned the police cavanaugh thought it was the first mistake prescott had made even if there hadnt been a fire prescott couldnt take the risk of staying much longer with the fire he had to leave immediately or be trapped the neighbors had probably seen smoke coming from the house and called the fire department despite the noise from the fire cavanaugh thought he heard faintly approaching sirens another reason for prescott to want to leave as fast as he could lying on the dusty floor rubbing his back where hed banged it cavanaugh gulped smokefree air although the air would soon change he knew to slow that from happening he shut the elevator door cutting off the flickering light in the shaft hed become so accustomed to the glare of the flames that he wasnt prepared for the almosttotal darkness of the attic at each end the gray of dusk struggled through tiny windows he couldnt possibly squeeze through them the only way out was the attic door but would prescott be waiting for him down there ready to shoot beyond the windows the distant sirens seemed closer ive got to believe he decided hed killed me and left cavanaugh thought if i stay up here any longer the firell trap me his night vision improved sufficiently for him to see bulky shapes that he guessed were large boxes a human silhouette was a dressmakers mannequin he knew that the entrance to the attic was a swingdown door at the top of the secondfloor stairs orienting himself he calculated where that door would be as smoke seeped from cracks in the elevators wall he crept around it feeling his way through dust he suddenly touched foldedup wooden stairs that rested on the hinged door now all he had to do was push down and what about prescott what if im wrong and hes waiting for me cavanaugh sweated behind him he felt heat he turned and saw flames through the cracks in the elevators wall he heard the approaching sirens prescotts gone he has to be gone cavanaugh shoved down on the trapdoor nothing happened he shoved harder no result i must be pushing the wrong end he thought im pushing where the hinges are he scuttled to the other end and shoved down harder the door continued to remain in place almost choking on dust that hed dislodged he stared from one end of the door to the other the flames through the elevator walls were now bright enough to reveal that the first end of the door that hed tried to shove down had in fact been the one without hinges those hinges showed clearly mounted on parallel beams panicked he scurried to the end without hinges and pressed down with all his strength but the door refused to budge there had to be a latch on the other side that prevented it from opening accidentally smoke drifted over it he stomped down trying to smash a hole in the trapdoor so he could reach down and free the latch the thick wood remained in place he spun and scanned the boxes the mannequin another trunk anything that might help him he bent over coughing maybe can unscrew the hinges he thought how where am i going to find a screwdriver or something to his eyes watered smoke from the shaft obscured the light from the flames in the elevators compartment i could fumble around up here until i drop he thought already he was off balance from the lack of oxygen no matter how much strength panic had given him his body had reached a limit if he inhaled more smoke then dont breathe he told himself his lungs protesting when he held his breath he drew his handgun and aimed toward the wood next to a hinge the barrel was five inches away from it tilted so the bullet would plow under the hinge and damage the screws to keep flying splinters from his eyes he turned his head before he pulled the trigger the roar blasted his eardrums continuing to hold his breath he readjusted his aim this time toward another spot next to the hinge and again looked away as he pulled the trigger the recoil jerked his unsteady hands up the roar made his ears ring his pistol held eight rounds in the magazine one in the firing chamber afraid hed pass out he kept pulling the trigger chunks of wood flying he emptied the magazine replaced it with a full one from the pouch on his belt and fired eight more bullets this time into the wood next to the other hinge he replaced that magazine with the remaining full one on his pouch and continued to shoot at the hinges saving his last round in case prescott had stayed down there despite the fire cavanaugh holstered his pistol and stomped on the door he heard wood protest stomped again heard wood shriek the hinges separating from it stomped it a third time and fell the trapdoor giving way he and it plummeting toward the landing dropping he grabbed the edge of the opening dangled saw flames eating through the elevator door below him and released his grip hitting the smokefilled landing he rolled the impact sent a shock wave through him that punched air from his protesting lungs and compelled him to inhale smoke he wanted to reach a bedroom at the top of the stairs but when he pawed across the floor he felt only open space and realized that he was headed in the wrong direction about to tumble down stairs toward flames that blocked the front door his eyes stinging he turned to make his way on hands and knees through thick smoke toward the bedroom but his arms didnt want to work his knees wouldnt push him forward lack of oxygen made him feel paralyzed a blanket seemed to float down over him smothering him abruptly hands grabbed him he felt himself being dragged into shadows away from the blaze consuming the elevator door something slammed a door behind him blocking the smoke the hands grabbed him again pulling him past a murky something that was probably a bed toward an open door onto the balcony that hed been struggling to reach outside the glare of flames at groundfloor windows showed him the tense face above the hands that dragged him jamie her green eyes fiercely reflected the fire as she pulled him to the left side of the balcony onto a railedin motorized platform that had allowed karen to lower her wheelchair into the backyard he heard jamies strident breathing then the sound of a motor as the platform descended sirens wailed the platform jerked to a stop the fire must have burned the electrical wires cavanaugh realized he peered over the edge seeing ripples of reflected flames on the lawn five feet below him jamie opened the platforms gate squirmed over the side and let go she landed then braced herself and reached up as cavanaugh squirmed over she grabbed him as he dropped the two of them sprawling on the lawn the fire reached the back windows as the sirens wailed louder jamie pulled cavanaugh to his feet and tried to keep a distance from the burning house guiding him along the right side no cavanaugh murmured the back what backyard gate the relatively clear air chased the grogginess from his mind while he stumbled away from the house heading through the backyard jamie kept pace with him holding him up at the front of the house firefighters shouted engines roared ladders and other equipment banged and rattled the backyard was spacious past two hulking trees the shadows were thicker the glare from the flames would soon reach this far but for the moment they had the cover of darkness as they came to a gap in a hedge a high white wooden gate filled the space karen had it installedcavanaugh breathedso the kid in the house behind hershe breathed againcould bring a mower through and cut her lawn what if its locked we try climbing abruptly the gate swung open a man woman and teenaged boy rushed to help them what happened are you all right visiting karen cavanaugh managed to say looks like started behind a wall spread so fast barely got out what about karen in the basement cavanaugh kept stumbling across their backyard his sport coat hid his pistol couldnt get to we heard shots paint cans exploding tell the firefighters to try to get karen silhouetted by the burning house the man and the teenager rushed into karens backyard the woman lingered save your house jamie said what spray water on your roof so sparks dont set it on fire the woman turned pale she ran toward a hose connected to an outdoor tap as she sprayed water toward her roof neighbors crowded into the backyard shoving ignoring cavanaugh and jamie trying to see the blaze cavanaugh did his best to walk straight and not look injured as he made his way along a dark street two blocks over headlights turned the corner behind him coming from the direction of the fire worried that it might be a police car he stepped among bushes but instead of the distinctive rack of emergency lights on a police cars roof cavanaugh saw the anonymous silhouette of a taurus approaching at moderate speed he returned to the sidewalk when jamie stopped he got in and slumped on the passenger seat she drove away at an equally moderate speed any trouble getting the car cavanaugh asked on the contrary the police were glad to see me move it so they could have room for another fire truck how bad are you hurt i reopened the wound neither of them spoke for several moments you could have been killed trying to save me cavanaugh said i didnt think about that you werent afraid only for you cavanaugh looked down at his shaky hands tonight i felt afraid driving jamie glanced from where her headlights illuminated the darkness she gave him a quick stare you just had a lot to react to it was more than that something happened to me in that basement cavanaugh trembled for the first time i found out what fear is he felt more blood oozing from his wound i was hoping we wouldnt have to do this we passed a walmart on the way from the motel walmart jamie asked bewildered were going to need some things trash bags a hotplate a saucepan a part four threat confrontation the hotplates coil glowed through steam escaping from the open bathroom door cavanaugh could see the unit on the counter in front of the makeup mirror a vague outline of a saucepan was visible on top of it the pan contained boiling water a curved sewing needle and fishing line cavanaugh was slumped in the tub while the hot shower sprayed smoke and grime off him youve got more bruises jamie said by morning youll have trouble walking i wont need to walk were spending tomorrow in the car and maybe part of tonight cavanaugh turned his head and studied her youre as quick a learner as prescott except i dont go around setting fires we cant stay here much longer correct correct theres always a neighborhood busybody who notices unfamiliar cars on the street he or she will remind the police about it one of the policemen will remember the attractive woman who moved the car after the fire started meanwhile the neighbors behind karens house will tell the police about the injured man and the attractive woman who ran out of the house and disappeared itll take the police a while to get organized but before midnight theyre going to be looking for a man and a woman in a dark blue taurus time to hit the road jamie glanced toward the pan on the hotplate think its boiled enough she asked ten minutes if the germs arent dead by now turn off the shower jamie blotted the wound with surgical gauze then coated it with betadine germicide that shed bought from walmart the gouge looked clean enough that there wasnt a need to put cavanaugh through the pain of more hydrogen peroxide quickly she applied antibiotic cream then she hurried to the pan and used tongs which she had swabbed with rubbing alcohol to take the needle and fishing line from the boiling water she set them and disinfected scissors onto antiseptic pads at the side of the tub you should have been a nurse cavanaugh said yeah thats always been my ambition to sew up gunshot wounds youre absolutely sure you need to do this the wound has to stay closed and the bandage isnt working we could always try barbed wire and a staple gun funny keep laughing jamie knelt beside him at the tub no matter how gentle i try to be thisll hurt cavanaughs face felt as taut as his nerves ive had it done to me before i imagine but the guy doing it wasnt as goodlooking as you flatterys great tell me more sweet things while i do this youre tough so are you jamie pushed in the needle cavanaugh woke to the rhythm of the car as headlights flashed past he found himself lying on the backseat on a blanket one of the items that jamie had bought from walmart then he was alert enough to see the imitation sheepskin covers on the front and rear seats which jamie had bought from walmart as well and which concealed the bloodstains hed left the car was brandnew but already it was on its way to being trashed somehow he found that amusing where are we he murmured i thought i heard you moving back there were south of poughkeepsie did you sleep okay yes he slowly sat up the headlights passing on the opposite side of the highway hurt his eyes hows the shoulder stiff i passed out you passed out and you said i was tough are you thirsty the bottles of water are on the floor back there cavanaugh peered down and saw them in the shadows he opened one hungry jamie asked for a thin woman you sure think a lot about food just for that you cant have any doughnuts doughnuts chocolatecovered you cant expect me to drive all night without something to eat to keep me awake what time is it around one did you have any trouble cleaning the motel room nope i did what you told me and put all the bloody towels and clothes into the garbage bags i got from walmart i threw the bags in a dumpster at a construction site the towels dont have the motels name on them so nobody can trace them to us fingerprints i wiped the room clean and left the key along with a tip just the way you told me cavanaugh studied the sporadic traffic tired getting there find a place where we can switch places ill drive for a while are you able to i can steer with my right arm once we get into new jersey well find another motel and then as soon as i get organized im going after prescott good god what happened to this car the automobile paint shops owner said the question was rhetorical red and green dayglo paint had been sprayed over most of the taurus damned kids cavanaugh said although he himself had done the spraying i leave it on the street for a half hour and this is what i find when i get back the whole thingll have to be repainted dont i know it and the dealership says vandalism isnt covered under the warranty they want a fortune to repaint it the owner got interested how much cavanaugh named so high a figure that the guy would make out like a bandit even if he gave a discount how does a hundred and fifty cheaper sound the owner asked better than i was going to have to pay but i need the job done in a hurry sure sure what color do you want the original dark blue from the day i chose that color my wife hated it she says i she wants gray sam murdock cavanaugh told the philadelphia bank clerk sign here mr murdock cavanaugh did the clerk compared the signature with the one that the bank had on file and entered a date next to where cavanaugh had signed i see its been a while since you came here last year too bad i always say when you have to go to your safedeposit box youve got trouble the clerk gave cavanaugh a sympathetic look obviously attributing the scrapes on cavanaughs face to the trouble he referred to may i have your key cavanaugh who wore a suit and tie and whod gotten his hair cut short to get rid of the singe marks gave it to him will you be needing a cubicle yes the clerk led cavanaugh and jamie down marble steps to a barred metal gate which he unlocked beyond in a brightly lit vault were walls of small gleaming stainlesssteel hatches the clerk glanced at the number on the key cavanaugh had given him he went to a wall on the right put the key in a tenbytwelveinch hatch near the bottom inserted another key this one from a group he carried on a ring and turned both keys simultaneously after opening the hatch he pulled out a safedeposit box and handed it to cavanaugh the cubicles are just outside thank you cavanaugh randomly chose the second on the right and went inside with jamie closing the door in the process without seeming to he checked the walls and ceiling for hidden cameras doubting there were any but maintaining his habits all the same he set the box on a counter and leaned over it as did jamie so that their backs concealed the boxs contents the raised lid revealed two thick manila envelopes and a blue cloth pouch the bulging halves of which were zipped together cavanaugh put everything in a briefcase that hed bought in a store down the street a few minutes before entering the bank jamie opened the door managing to hold the briefcase in his left hand without indicating that his arm was compromised cavanaugh returned the safedeposit box to the clerk who put it back in its slot in the vault closed the hatch rotated the keys to their original positions and gave cavanaughs key back to him thank you cavanaugh said in a cashnotunusual motel cavanaugh waited while jamie closed the blinds then he put the contents of the briefcase on the bed the first stuffed manila envelope contained five thousand dollars in twenties i see youve been saving for a rainy day jamie said the second manila envelope contained a birth certificate credit card passport and pennsylvania drivers license for samuel murdock the drivers license and passport had cavanaughs photograph a present from karen five years ago memories of her made him pause as she reminded me you never know when another identity might come in handy im on the eastern seaboard a lot so its easy to come to philadelphia once a year i take the credit card from the safedeposit box and use it to buy a few things so the account remains open i also renew the drivers license why philadelphia its convenient halfway between new york and washington cities where i often work where do you get the bills for the credit card theyre sent to a private mailboxrental business here in philadelphia which forwards them to a private mailbox you rent in jackson hole under the name of sam murdock but that you never told me about jamie said because of his stitched shoulder cavanaugh resisted the urge to shrug a benign secret i just love getting to know you better does global protective services know about this other identity nobody does whats in the pouch a present for you gee cavanaugh unzipped the pouch jamie picked up what was inside whats that joke you once told me about the compliment men most like to hear from women oh honey i just love it when you tinker with engines and bring home electronics power tools and firearms the object jamie held was a match to cavanaughs sig sauer mm pistol like cavanaughs it had been modified its factoryequipped sights had been replaced with a wideslotted rear sight and a front sight with a green luminous dot that made aiming easy all the interior moving parts had been filed and then coated with a permanent friction reducer to discourage jamming the exterior had been comparably smoothed so there werent any sharp edges to snag on anything a flat black epoxy finish prevented light from reflecting cavanaugh watched to make sure that jamie followed the precautions hed taught her because the sig didnt have a safety catch care was all the more necessary holding it with her right hand keeping her index finger out of the trigger guard and the barrel pointed toward the bed she used her left hand to ease back the slide on top checking to see if the weapon had a round in the firing chamber it did she pressed a button at the side and released the magazine from the grip grabbing the magazine as it dropped nice catch cavanaugh said after setting down the pistol jamie picked up the magazine and inspected the holes on the side that showed how many rounds were in it seems to be full but you never know until you check right right cavanaugh said it can be downright embarrassing if you assume an unfamiliar pistol has a full magazine and it turns out youre a round short when you absolutely need it jamie thumbed every round from the magazine counting eight she said confirming that for the model the magazine had indeed been fully loaded some other types of mm pistols held more ammunition but their consequently large grips made them impractical as concealed carry weapons in addition pistols with a large magazine tended not to fit the averagesized hands of most shooters making aiming difficult careful you dont break a fingernail giving him a caustic look jamie reinserted the rounds into the magazine verifying that the spring in the magazine was functional then she picked up the handgun and pulled the slide fully back to eject the round in the chamber she tested the slide several times to make sure it moved freely could use a little breakfree she said referring to a type of pistol lubricantcleaner it ought to cavanaugh said its been in that safedeposit box for five years the family that cleans firearms together stays together jamie shoved the magazine into the sigs grip racked a round into the firing chamber and pressed the decocking lever on the side that meant there were now seven rounds in the magazine to make up the difference she released the magazine picked up the round that shed earlier extracted from the firing chamber pressed it into the magazine and reinserted the magazine into the grip giving the pistol its maximum capacity for a moment jamie looked as if she thought she was done and that worried cavanaugh because she wasnt but then she picked up the spare magazine from the pouch stripped the rounds from it said eight and thumbed them back into the magazine youll notice that not only didnt i break a fingernail but at no time did my fingers leave my hands should i mention that we ought to get replacements for both magazines after having been fully loaded for several years their springs will have metal fatigue an aplus cavanaugh said lets go shopping great idea jamie said you do the driving cavanaughs shoulder still felt stiff where to he showed her addresses and a map from the phone book a hardware store an autosupply place and a gun shop fabulous at the hardware store they bought duct tape a hammer a screwdriver electrical wire a toggle switch gloves coveralls a section of plumbers tubing and an assortment of screws and clamps whats all this stuff for a better mousetrap cavanaugh said at the autosupply place they bought an air filter two fog lights and four chamois cloths studying the cloths jamie asked were going to wash the car no that cant be right the dirtier the car the less noticeable in the gun shop cavanaugh took her to a rack of gun belts it has to look like an ordinary belt but be sturdy enough to support the weight of the pistol the strongest kind has two leather strips sewn together with the grain on one strip going in the opposite direction from the other the belt should fit so the stem on the buckle goes into the second hole which one looks good to you jamie chose softlooking black with a square buckle that looked silver goes with the studs on my pearl earrings and for an accessorycavanaugh turned to the bearded clerkdo you have any kydex holsters he referred to the sturdy plastic material that his own holster was made of he liked kydex because it wasnt affected by rain or perspiration and because it was thin enough to be easily concealed what kind of pistol cavanaugh told him nice the clerk reached under a glass counter heres a new model from fist inc slightly shorter than the length of jamies hand the nonreflective matteblack holster had an open top allowing the pistol to be drawn quickly and a tension screw at the side which kept the pistol secure they call it the dave spaulding cavanaugh recognized the name of one of the nations best firearms instructors anything else two magazines for the sig jamie said and a cleaning kit and a hundred and twenty rounds of magsafe millimeter cavanaugh added this type of ammunition had an epoxy resin tip with shotgun pellets embedded in it when the tip struck a target the resin fractured and released the pellets the destructive force was considerable with the added advantage that the tip and its pellets wouldnt go through a target and hit a bystander as in any good gun store the clerk didnt ask why the customer needed so much of a type of ammunition that was never used in target practice noticing fishing equipment in back cavanaugh told him i could also use a dozen lead sinkers at the motel they unpacked the various purchases surveying the objects on the bed jamie said apart from the pistol equipment none of this makes any sense to me whered you put the scissors needle and fishing line cavanaugh asked in the firstaid kit dont tell me your stitches are coming loose instead of answering cavanaugh took jamies blazer from a hanger at the back of the room puzzled she watched him reverse the jacket so he could examine the lining along its right side hey she objected as he used the scissors to cut the thread that attached the lining to the hem he took three lead sinkers and sewed them under the lining then he sewed one of the chamois cloths to the waist level of the lining any bulges you could have been a tailor ive got all kinds of skills youd be surprised about after she put on the belt and the holster cavanaugh removed the magazine from the pistol ejected the round in the firing chamber so there wouldnt be any accidents and shoved the pistol into the holster jamie put on the blazer he walked around her assessing good i cant tell the pistols there why did you alter the blazer do you remember how i showed you to draw a pistol you made me practice often enough then i bet you can figure out the answer a patient sigh its a good thing my wellesley sorority sisters cant see me now she flipped back the right side of the blazer and drew the pistol as she raised it her left hand joined her right her thumbs over one another pointing along the side of the barrel knees slightly bent for balance and leaning slightly forward she aligned the sights aiming at an imaginary target across the bedroom love your style cavanaugh said the lead sinkers give the side of the blazer a little weight so itll stay back when i flip it the chamois cloth helps the blazer glide over the holster another aplus cavanaugh picked up her windbreaker and began to modify that as well i can do that no this is work i can manage with my injured shoulder you have your own work jamie eyed him suspiciously what work are you talking about wearing the gloves and coveralls theyd bought at the hardware store jamie sat behind the taurus attaching fog lamps to the back if i could get down there and do that without pulling these stitches id gladly take your place cavanaugh said somehow you dont sound convincing fog lamps are supposed to be on the front why am i putting them here these arent ordinary fog lamps theyre onehundredwatt quartz halogens with a candlepower of four hundred and eighty thousand well run the wires to a toggle switch well put on the dashboard once we get the lamps pointing up toward eye level we can blind any driver coming after us he opened the hood and removed the air filter that had come with the taurus the standard filters okay but this k and n improves pickup he used the plumbers tubing along with hose clamps to alter the intake system thisll get more air to the engine and add horsepower i phoned a specialty carparts store in daytona beach and ordered a highspeed computer chip to replace the one the car came with anything else we have to do get heavyduty shocks rig the ignition so we can start it easily if we dont have the key but first you have to crawl into the trunk cavanaugh said what that wasnt a kinky proposal we just need to get some measurements actually doing it in the trunk sounds intriguing not with this shoulder i wasnt planning to do it with your shoulder what are the measurements for a halfinch plate of steel to stop bullets from going through the trunk and into the car hold still your hands are cold cavanaugh said quit complaining and relax thisll be over before you know it you never said that to me before reminds me of the teenaged girl in a sexeducation class sexeducation class yeah the teacher said dont ruin your life for fifteen minutes of pleasure and the teenaged girl asked fifteen minutes how do you make it last that long stop moving jamie said there how was that didnt feel a thing see im getting good at this using sterilized scissors and tweezers jamie snipped and removed another stitch looks clean no sign of infection she cut and took out another stitch youll have a scar to add to your collection beauty marks after removing the final stitches jamie surveyed her work damn im good the wounds still healing heres a bandage to remind you to be careful oh ill be careful it had been ten days since the fire at the bunker there had been many things to do but mostly cavanaugh had allowed himself to rest and heal the effort testing his patience despite his banter with jamie which he felt he owed her his mood had been dark in his dreams and often while awake he suffered vivid mental images of robertos bashedin head of chad and tracy being blown apart of duncans bulletmutilated face he remembered gaping at karen in her wheelchair her hands clamped against her chest her face contorted in the rigid aftermath of a death frenzy the cause of which he was still powerless to explain but this much cavanaugh knew beyond question prescott was to blame were as organized as were going to get its time to come back from the grave the sturdy black man rounded a curve and jogged faster along a straightaway through the suburban washington park he wasnt alone at am other joggers were out preparing themselves for the days stress because of a slight chill in the air the man wore navy leggings and a sweatshirt the white man who jogged up next to him wore a similar outfit except the color was gray they passed bushes and trees and ducks in a pond when it was obvious that the white man stayed next to him longer than was usual for a stranger the black man looked over and almost broke his stride am i having a religious experience the black man asked his name was john rutherford hed been raised as a southern baptist seeing visions receiving visitations from the dead seeings believing cavanaugh said yeah but thomas still doubted he wasnt satisfied until he put his hand in the wound in christs side i hate to disappoint you but i dont know you well enough to let you get that familiar anyway i dont have a wound in my side the almosthealed wound in cavanaughs shoulder ached from running on concrete but by keeping the sway of his arms to a minimum he avoided tearing it i heard you were missing rutherford said probably dead these pesky rumors whered you hear this one as cavanaugh kept pace with rutherford sweat slicked his forehead the second in command at protective services told me we were going to offer an assignment to your firm cavanaugh nodded the government had several superb protectiveagent organizations including the secret service the us marshals service and the diplomatic security service but sometimes personnel shortages required that outside organizations be brought in seems you duncan and three other operatives dropped off the face of the earth along with a client rutherford said one of your safe sites was destroyed did the second in command tell you which client and which safe site no way rutherfords breath was slightly labored as he and cavanaugh rounded another curve if hed told me that much i wouldnt have trusted your firm to work for us i think the only reason he told me as much as he did was to find out if id heard anything and had you a dark stain formed on cavanaughs sweatshirt not a whisper they came near the pond again and passed more ducks so whats the story rutherford asked can you keep a secret if i couldnt the bureau would have booted me out a long time ago the question was rhetorical the answer expected cavanaugh wouldnt have risked meeting with rutherford if their history hadnt proven that rutherford could be trusted provided it isnt illegal and it wont destroy my career ill keep any secret you want the rumors are right im dead cavanaugh told him you never saw me you never talked to me rutherford didnt reply for a moment sweat dripped from his chin as they reached a straightaway what about duncan and the others if you see them you are having a visitation killed a couple of times over who were the other protectors chad tracy and roberto god help them rutherford said i worked with them all i knew i could trust them with my life what happened to your client thats the problem cavanaughs anger rose hes the reason duncan chad tracy and roberto are dead he got careless he forced you to expose yourselves needlessly he turned against us rutherford slowed left the path stopped among bushes and waited for cavanaugh to do the same they faced each other the man you were protecting deliberately attracted the bad guys to us then he bashed robertos head in and shot duncan after chad and tracy got blown up he left me to die in a burning building rutherfords chest heaved as he caught his breath and tried to make sense of the unthinkable he worked for the bad guys no he was running from the bad guys then why did he because we showed him how to get a new identity and disappear he figured if he got rid of us his escape plan was safe one less chance of the bad guys finding him theres a special place in hell for a man like that whats his name daniel prescott never heard of him he owns de bio lab never heard of that either the drug enforcement administration had a contract with him he was doing research on the physical basis for addiction instead he found an easily manufactured substance that causes addiction rutherford looked mystified i work closely enough with the dea id know about this jesus escobar got wind of what prescott had discovered and tried to grab him when a dea protective team couldnt keep escobar away prescott came to us for help rutherford looked even more mystified impossible escobar got killed two months ago his cartels in disarray theyre not organized enough to go after anybody cavanaugh felt as if the ground were swaying beneath him it must have been another cartel that wanted prescott cavanaugh said not believing it the ground seemed more unsteady his shifting sense of reality making him dizzy id know about that too rutherford said a second group wanted prescott they handled themselves like special ops the military why would they be involved in this i was hoping you could help me find out while jamie idled the car cavanaugh pressed numbers on a pay phone at the side of a shopping malls parking lot the setting sun cast his shadow on the other end the phone rang three times hello rutherfords deep voice said this is the peking duck restaurant im calling to confirm that someone at your phone number just ordered a hundred and twentysix dollars worth of takeout cavanaugh said the msg you put in that stuff gives me a headache rutherford sounded as if he had one makes me feel bloated cavanaugh said the exchange was the allclear signal theyd agreed upon theres absolutely no indication that prescott or his lab had anything to do with addiction research for the drug enforcement administration thats not even something they normally get into its national institutes of health stuff traffic noises in the parking lot forced cavanaugh to press the phone harder against his ear you think nih is where i should go next no go to the source if youre talking about prescotts lab i spent the day at george washington universitys library i couldnt find anything about the lab in print or on the internet i did there wasnt any indication of what it does but its at a pickup truck with a noisy muffler went by what i didnt hear the next part i said the labs at a place called baileys ridge in virginia wheres that rutherford gave him directions then added sorry i couldnt have helped more you helped plenty thanks ill send over that chinese food dont bother i wasnt kidding about msg and headaches ill call you tomorrow by then ill have more questions fine with me same number same time cavanaugh hung up the phone wiped his prints from the receiver and got into the taurus learn anything jamie asked yeah somebody had a gun to his head get us out of here before a bunch of cars rush toward this pay phone looking for us we had a prearranged code a signal to let each of us know the other was okay cavanaugh said apprehension made his veins feel swollen as he studied traffic behind them jamie listened tensely as she drove a joke about a chinese restaurant and msg at the start of the conversation we both said what we were supposed to at the end though when i told john i was going to send him chinese food he was supposed to say dont bother ive already got plans for dinner instead he complained about the msg again did he give you information jamie checked the rearview mirror yes the location of prescotts lab weve got to assume its a trap somebody forced him to do it no question cavanaughs hands sweated but john knew he wasnt betraying mebecause he warned me by not supplying all of the code will whoevers holding him prisoner kill him cavanaugh felt his breath rate increasing once the trap was set theyd have no further use for him but i managed to buy him some time how i told him id call him again tomorrow the same hour the same number with more questions whoevers got him will keep him alive for a while longer nowin case the trap doesnt work so they have a way to stay in touch with me jamie looked over at him assessing ive got a lot to learn from you look we need to talk cavanaugh peered down at his hands working to keep them steady we always talk not about everything now here it comes youre going to tell me this is getting too dangerous and you want me to go back to wyoming where ill be safe dont bother you opened the door on this you invited me in and im not leaving i proved i can help i proved im dependable that ive got the right instincts and wont fall apart if you want to keep this relationship thats the price you pay no more secrets no more separations two years ago id have been killed if not for you i owe you and by god i intend to pay you back agreed what you dont owe me anything but i wont argue with the rest of what you said im not asking you to leave then i need to warn you about something warn me i told you something happened to me in karens basement in the fire puzzled jamie waited for him to continue i lost control anybody would have you had a lot to deal with no cavanaugh said stress has always been second nature to me it made me feel alive except his mouth felt dry maybe now it doesnt jamie looked at him more closely for five years in delta force and another five with protective services i thrived on action cavanaugh said physical sensations most people find terrifying were a pleasure to me i couldnt wait for my next hit of adrenaline i loved the rush cavanaugh worked to keep his breath rate under control i once protected a fortune five hundred executive who was a nicotine and caffeine junkie he smoked two packs of unfiltered cigarettes and drank fourteen cups of strong coffee each day he called the cigarettes and coffee rocket fuel he said the speed they gave him made him think better and faster and clearer he loved the high they gave him one morning in brussels while i was standing watch outside his hotel suite i heard a noise as if something had fallen and broken i had another protector working with me so while he radioed for backup and kept guarding the corridor i hurried into the suite where i found the client on the floor the noise id heard was a breakfast cart hed upset when he fell was he dead cavanaugh had the eerie feeling that with each sentence he was speaking a little faster at first i thought he was but then i saw he was blinking his pupils were huge i ran to the phone and called a doctor we had on retainer then i hurried back to the client i didnt think hed been poisonedthe threat he was afraid of was kidnapping not assassination but i had to ask him anyhow do you think youve been poisoned he thrashed his head no do you think youre having a heart attack i asked again he thrashed his head no stroke he said dizzy rooms spinning floors tilting i felt his pulse a hundred and fifty so then i knew what was wrong with him although i waited for the doctor to tell me for sure and what was wrong with him cavanaugh felt throbbing at his temples a massive nicotine and caffeine overdose hed been supercharging himself for so many years that eventually his body reached a limit to the speed it could take the doctor had to give him a downer and ordered him into a detox program did the detox work it probably saved his life but the damage had been done his body had established its stress level thereafter if he was even in the same room with someone who smoked if he inhaled just a few puffs of secondhand smoke he went into overdrive and nearly collapsed if he had just a sip or two of someone elses coffeedecaffeinated mind you which is never totally decaffeinatedhis heart started pounding like a jackhammer jamie frowned where are you heading with this adrenaline cavanaughs legs felt more jittery right now its flying through me before i went to karens house id have welcomed it but now his mouth had become so dry he had trouble speaking what i need to tell you to warn you about whatever happened to me in karens basement he could hardly say it would never have imagined that hed say it maybe i cant do this anymore jamie didnt react for a moment do you want to go back to wyoming no i yes cavanaugh said i want to go back to wyoming jamie looked surprised im so confusedthe word surprised himso afraid of whats changing inside me i want to go back to jackson hole and never leave but if i give in and hide ill never be any good to you or me or anybody else how can i pretend to be close to anyone if i let john die he wouldnt be in this mess if it werent for me if he gets killed we wont let that happen thats right by god but im not sure how youre going to feel being around someone who shows signs of fear signs of being human you mean ill try to be as dependable as youve been cavanaugh breathed deeply working to concentrate on what needed to be done is anybody following us jamie checked the rearview mirror traffic looks normal head over to the park where i met john this morning whats at i phoned him at his condo his wife died last year he lives alone thats where they held a gun to him when he talked to me thats the logical spot for him to be held prisoner they left the taurus in a parking garage and followed the shadowy jogging path to the opposite edge of the park there concealed by trees they peered across a busy street toward a brightly lit condominium building the sixth floor cavanaugh said on the right the fourth unit from the end jamie adjusted her gaze lights in one window thats the living room john loves his view of the park not tonight the curtains are closed the window next to it on the rightany lights in his bedroom the curtains are closed there also but no lights any other bedrooms no cavanaugh wished they could get in the car and drive away after johns wife died he sold their house and moved here wanted a simpler life he said became kind of a hermit reading his bible when he wasnt hunting bad guys whats the arrangement of the rooms past the front door theres a corridor that leads into the living room talking about what he knew helped distract him from what he was feeling as you go along the corridor theres an archway on the left leading into a small kitchen an arch on the other side of the kitchen goes into the living room to the left of the living room is the door to the bedroom bathroom off the bedroom on the left cavanaughs attention quickened as a shadow moved beyond the closed curtains in the living room how many people are watching him do you think jamie asked at least two so one can sleep while the others on guard the details of tradecraft continued to help distract him from his emotions hell be tied up in a chair in the living room that way the bedrooms all theirs so they can spell each other and take naps but how do we get him out as jamie spoke a man and woman approached the buildings entrance and went into the gleaming lobby visible through floortoceiling windows a security guard stood behind a counter he spoke to the couple picked up a phone said something into it nodded and pressed a button that unlocked a gate on the right allowing the couple to go farther into the lobby and reach a bank of elevators for that matter jamie added how do we get into the building the law says there have to be other exits in case of an emergency we can always go around to the back find one and pick the lock which you havent shown me how to do yet ive been remiss admit but we dont have time to make up for that now anyway in this busy neighborhood theres always a chance well be noticed we cant help john if were in jail why dont we walk up to that corner store and buy some cigarettes cigarettes what are you talking about you dont smoke i used to when i first joined protective services duncan put a stop to that i can still hear him scolding me how can you hope to protect somebody when youre fumbling around trying to light a cigarette and now youre going to start smoking again the condo buildings entrance was thirty feet from the street shrubs flanked a walkway half a dozen stone benches provided a further friendly appearance cavanaugh chose the bench nearest the street motioned for jamie to join him and opened the pack of cigarettes smoke he asked whats gotten into you give it a try be daring itll help pass the time he handed her a cigarette and lit it managing to keep his hand steady i havent the faintest idea how to hold this she said doesnt matter cavanaugh lit a cigarette for himself jamie coughed hey i didnt say to inhale the thing just puff on it a little and blow out the smoke not so quickly tastes awful doesnt it though i wonder what i ever liked about this two women passed them and glanced away in disapproval these days with so many nonsmoking areas its the most natural sight imaginable for two people to be huddled outside a building awkwardly puffing on cigarettes cavanaugh said we look like we were visiting somebody in the building and got banished down here so we wouldnt stink up the living room when we absolutely had to get a nicotine fix a man and woman shook their heads in pity the next couple actually looked sympathetic as if on occasion theyd been forced to smoke outside also all right so you found a way to make us an acceptable presence outside the building jamie said now what do what prescott does listen and learn people came and went their conversations filled with references to domineering bosses newly discovered restaurants cheap plane tickets to the bahamas and women who ought to stop flirting with other peoples husbands five minutes passed gosh i cant believe were done with those cigarettes so quickly wed better light up again cavanaugh said if i get yellow stains on my fingers jamie said cavanaugh gave her another cigarette struck a match for her and pretended to ignore two taxis that stopped at the curb each cab discharged four welldressed people after lighting a new cigarette for himself he glanced up at the night sky pretending to ignore the eight people hurrying past what time is it a woman asked urgently almost ten thank god we made it sandy said she and tedd be home from the movie by tenfifteen hows she going to manage that a man asked pretend shes sick so they dont go to dinner isnt she clever her sisters going to let us in imagine the look on teds face when we all shout surprise they crowded into the lobby several of them speaking at once to the security guard who made a phone call nodded and buzzed them through poor ted jamie muttered as she blew out smoke through the windows cavanaugh was able to see the console above the elevator the group used numbers flashed indicating the floors the elevator passed he was too far away to read the numbers but he could count the times the console flashed seventeen on the eighteenth the number remained steady add another number for the ground floor he told himself theyre on nineteen flicking ashes from his cigarette he noticed a car with a dominos pizza sign stopping in the buildings delivery zone a gangly bespectacled driver got out lugging an armful of pizza boxes in an insulated wrapper lets see where these pizzas are going cavanaugh told jamie as the driver came closer cavanaugh stood put on a convincing smile and said hi we thought wed come down for a smoke and head you off at the pass unit six twentyeight that was the number of johns unit sorry these are all for somebody else all cavanaugh looked at the stack must be that party on the seventh floor thats one of the reasons we came down here theyre making so much racket nope this bunch goes tothe delivery guy squinted through his spectacles toward a piece of paper taped to the insulated wrappernineteen eleven lucky them jamie said guess well just have to wait and have another cigarette shouldnt be long the driver said sorry we bothered you cavanaugh said no problem balancing the pizza boxes the delivery guy walked up to the glass door at the entrance just as somebody came out and held the door open for him jamie stubbed out her cigarette what was that about did you really believe those pizzas would be going to johns apartment maybe not this time but eventually pizzas or chinese or some kind of food will probably be delivered there how can you be sure because ive seen guards make that mistake too many times before roundtheclock watchdog duty is tedious if the guys on the security team dont have any discipline they keep thinking about eating they could scrounge the cupboards and cook but most of them arent good at it except for chad who could make anything taste delicious cavanaugh thought sorrow blindsiding him they start fantasizing about pizza or egg rolls and chicken chow mein if this is part of the bunch that tried to grab prescott at the warehouse they have a few rough edges that suggest theyre the type to give in and have food delivered we could wait for hours if its going to happen itll be sooner rather than later my call to john was less than an hour ago before then they were too preoccupied to think about food but now theyre getting a routine established wont the buildings guard get curious about us hanging around out here he cant see us why the last time i was here i noticed that the lobbys more brightly lit than this outside walkway the glare in there reflects off the inside windows the guard cant see out but what about the camera above the door you spotted that its pointed toward the area in front of the door not toward the street when we get john out of there im going to tell him to move to a building with better security is that a mind trick you use with your clients mind trick when we get john out of there you put me in the future and made me believe everythings going to be fine its very reassuring another car stopped at the buildings delivery zone this one marked pizza hut my turn jamie looked grateful for something to do to control her nerves as the driver pulled pizza boxes from the car she approached him rubbing her hands together in hungry anticipation hi we decided to come down for a smoke and save you the trouble of going upstairs unit six twentyeight were starved the pimply teenager looked starved as well but for something other than food he nearly dropped his boxes at the sight of the attractive woman standing next to him um he said um lemme see he studied a delivery slip taped to a box yep six twentyeight wonderful two mediums one pepperoni and black olives the other deluxe exactly they smell delicious how much do i owe you jamie added a tip and took the two boxes see you next time yes maam the kid blushed thank you he looked flustered as he got in the car and drove away two medium pizzas enough for two husky guards jamie said seems that way to me cavanaugh said unless theres only one guard and hes being generous to his prisoner which i doubt that they ordered food means theyre feeling comfortable right right they assume nobody knows theyre keeping john prisoner so what happens now jamie asked we go back to the park find somebody sleeping in the bushes and donate these pizzas all we need are the boxes jamie looked puzzled i need to tear off the top of one box and the bottom of the other so i can stack them together to hold my kevlar vest cavanaugh said the guard looked up from the counter as jamie held the door open and cavanaugh carried the pizza boxes into the lobby it took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the glare of the lights hi were with the surprise party for ted up in nineteen eleven cavanaugh said the guards face was stern a bunch of pizzas went up about twenty minutes ago i knew we should have brought ribs french fries and coleslaw jamie said you really do think a lot about food cavanaugh said trying to sound humorous in spite of the tightness in his chest tell them to make sure to keep the noise down the guard said we dont want complaints from the neighbors mums the word cavanaugh said the guard pressed a button that caused a waisthigh gate on the right to buzz and unlock thanks they went through and reached the elevators where jamie pressed the up button after a short wait that felt interminable one set of doors made a ding and opened hating elevators cavanaugh entered as jamie reached to push the button for the sixth floor he murmured stop whats the matter the guard will watch the numbers above the elevator to make sure we go to the floor we said we wanted ooops jamie pushed the button for the nineteenth floor the doors closed cavanaughs legs felt heavy as the elevator rose he watched orange numbers on a console go from one to two to three it seemed to take a long time to reach nineteen enough for him to repeat instructions hed given to jamie before theyd entered the building youre sure theyll open the door jamie asked for a pimply delivery kid theyd keep a chain on the door hand money through the crack and tell the kid to hand in the pizzas sideways but after they get a look at you through the peephole believe me theyll open the door undo your blouse excuse me the top three buttons what kind of girl do you think i am jamie undid them good cavanaugh silently told her keep making jokes it tells me youre in control and what about me cavanaugh wondered am i in control ding the doors opened his breath rate increasing he stepped out onto a newlooking beige carpet in what smelled like a freshly painted white corridor that had bright overhead lights and no one in view a quick look each way showed them a door marked stairs on their right they pushed through and found themselves in a dank concrete stairwell even more brightly lit than the corridor as jamie shut the door cavanaugh checked for security cameras but saw none they listened for noises and heard none their footsteps echoed as they descended in a cautious hurry to the sixth floor outside the door they paused can you manage this cavanaugh kept his voice low ill be right there next to you just do everything exactly as i explained jamie hesitated its not too late to back out he said sure it is she said ill never be able to force myself to go this far again maybe you shouldnt go this far at all can you save john without me cavanaugh didnt answer then give me the boxes jamies pupils were large cavanaugh watched her react to the weight of the kevlar vest in them she arranged the boxes so they pushed up slightly under her breasts widening the gap where shed opened the buttons theyll think theyd died and gone to heaven cavanaugh said before you knock on their door close your eyes for a few seconds thatll make your pupils smaller so you wont seem on edge remember if you hear a tv it means theyre careless good watchdogs keep the room quiet so they can hear noises outside jamie took a deep breath and nodded toward the door open it the sixth floor had the same type of newlooking beige carpet and freshly painted white walls as on the nineteenth tense cavanaugh followed jamie along the corridor as hed anticipated after pm no one was in it its still not too late to back out he kept telling himself sure it is if i back out i might not get another chance to save john unit was on the right pressing himself against the wall next to it cavanaugh heard the muffled sounds of an explosion followed by gunshots sirens and pulsing music an action program on television he gave jamie a reassuring look and drew his pistol jamie stood in front of the doors peephole and closed her eyes when she opened them a few seconds later her pupils were a normal size in no way suggesting she was under stress but cavanaugh was he made a sudden decision that he should never have allowed her to be part of this he motioned to her that they were leaving jamie ignored him and knocked on the door cavanaugh motioned even more forcefully paying no attention jamie knocked again and this time the tvs sound went off were in it now cavanaugh thought he marveled at how bored jamie made herself look in front of the doors peephole the pizza boxes propping up her breasts with a loud scrape a lock was disengaged cavanaugh pressed himself closer to the wall keeping far enough away that he couldnt be seen as he expected whoever was in there opened the door only as far as a chain would allow you ordered two medium pizzas jamie looked at the piece of paper taped to the top box pepperoni and black olives the other deluxe usually its a kid who delivers the man had a european accent no shit jamie said my husband and i own the business three delivery kids didnt show up tonight lucky me here i am the man chuckled how much she raised the boxes tighter to her breasts while she leaned down to read him the price on the piece of paper hang on a second the man closed the door the moment the door swung shut and the man couldnt see what was in front of it cavanaugh hurried from where he was pressed against the wall he rushed the door and ducked below the peephole shielding jamie he heard the scrape and rattle of the chain being freed as the door came open all the way cavanaugh charged toward the surprised man obeying instructions jamie upended the pizza boxes so the kevlar vest inside protected her the man was the same skinhead cavanaugh had taken the black car from at the shopping mall almost two weeks earlier gaping the skinhead fumbled to draw a pistol cavanaugh whacked his sigs barrel hard across the mans hairless skull stunned the man fell backward pinning his gun arm cavanaugh leapt over him and entered the living room aiming to the left toward the area across from the television a mustached man who looked about forty sat petrified in a chair not knowing which way to looktoward cavanaughs pistol or the one that jamie aimed from the kitchen archway the mans own pistol was on a coffee table before him rutherford was bound and gagged in a chair in the far left corner blood on his face contrasted with his black skin his eyes bulged in surprise but cavanaugh didnt have time for him now he grabbed the pistol off the table as he passed the mustached man he whacked him over the head as well then he pressed himself against a wall leading into the shadowy bedroom after aiming in toward the side of the room that he was able to see he darted over to the other wall and aimed in toward the opposite side of the room when nothing alarmed him he lunged in shoved a bureau against the closet door checked under the bed and then made sure the bathroom was clear when he returned to the living room the mustached man lay on the floor moaning cavanaugh hurried to the front door locked it then aimed toward the skinhead on the floor he searched him for weapons removed a pistol tucked at the back of his belt and used the belt to secure the mans hands behind his back he did the same to the mustached mans hands then checked that the front closet was empty only then did he run over to rutherford removing the gag from his mouth did we get them all yes cavanaugh untied rope from rutherfords ankles and wrists how bad are you hurt he assessed the bruises and gashes on rutherfords face lost a tooth rutherford pointed toward his swollen left cheek they might have cracked some ribs he winced as he took a breath cavanaugh saw a box of tissues on a side table he grabbed several and gave them to rutherford cough deeply and spit into these rutherford did lord almighty that hurt cavanaugh inspected the spit in the tissue no blood lie down on the sofa cavanaugh helped him over to it and then pressed gently against rutherfords abdomen and chest i dont feel any swelling have you got any pain youre suspicious about its been long enough if they broke anything inside me id have passed out by now rutherford massaged his wrists where the blood circulation had been almost cut off wheres your firstaid kit under the sink in the bathroom when cavanaugh returned with the kit and a soapy washcloth rutherford was making an effort to sit up you havent introduced me to your friend meet jennifer jennifer this is john jamie showed no reaction to being introduced by a false name pleased to meet you mighty glad to be alive to have the pleasure rutherford said cavanaugh opened the firstaid kit and paused when he found three syringes among the bandages and ointments he held them up and then realized why they were there from when your wife was alive shed been a diabetic and had injected herself daily with insulin cavanaugh knew ironically a car accident had been what killed her i gave away a lot of debs clothes to the church i threw away a lot more stuff old shoes and things that she knew werent worth keeping but shed hung on to anyhow except for a few of her favorite dresses which i kept i didnt have any trouble parting with most of it but somehow those syringes made me think of her more fondly than anything else i couldnt bring myself to throw them out cavanaugh put them back in the firstaid kit and began to clean rutherfords face you got my warningmy second msg remark rutherford asked nicely done id have let them kill me before id have sent you into a trap i know cavanaugh said the people i asked about prescott and his lab said theyd never heard of him hours of having been gagged made rutherford sound raspy ill get you some water jamie said when she returned rutherford took several deep swallows wetting the dried blood on his lips and causing it to trickle then i searched our computer database another swallow i came up with nothing then how did these guys must have an informant in the bureau either that or they hacked into our computer system looking for anybody whod made inquiries about prescott when i left my office to go home they were waiting near my car in the parking area wincing rutherford fingered the side of his jaw where his tooth had been knocked out somebody called my name from the next row i turned to see who it was all of a sudden a van stopped next to me while it screened me from view three guys grabbed me from behind and shoved me inside the man who shouted the three men who grabbed you the vans driver a total of five cavanaugh asked no rutherford swallowed more water theres a sixth guy the one who runs the show he calls himself kline i recognize your two guards they were with the first group that went after prescott rutherford frowned past cavanaugh jennifer you look sick cavanaugh turned toward her youre pale youd better sit what i had in mind was kneeling she went through the bedroom and into the bathroom a moment later cavanaugh heard the muffled sounds of her throwing up her first time on an operation rutherford asked yes she did good cavanaugh nodded when she came back he held her i didnt let you down jamie said you didnt let me down and i didnt let you down he added silently as the mustached man moaned on the floor jamie stepped over him easing into a chair across from rutherford dont mind me go on with what you were saying while i try to convince myself that im still alive cavanaughs hands had been steady as long as hed had something to do now he had to concentrate to keep them from shaking yes what happened next after these guys worked me over enough to prove they meant business they put a gun to my head and gave me a choiceeither id tell them why i wanted prescott or theyd kill me rutherford held the wet washcloth to his bruised cheek i explained i didnt want prescott a friend of mine did they gave me the same choicetell them who my friend was or theyd kill me i didnt use your name all i said was a man whod been part of prescotts security cavanaugh nodded that got them extremely interested rutherford said they couldnt wait to get their hands on you sure they thought i might know where prescott had gone i told them you were trying to find him too that you didnt know anything more than they did but they didnt buy it cavanaugh asked no way they put the gun to my head again and ordered me to tell you prescotts lab was at a place called baileys ridge in virginia and now four of them including kline are at baileys ridge arranging a trap for me they left as soon as your phone call was over rutherford said jamie leaned forward when nobody shows up theyll wonder what went wrong theyll come back here and hope you make contact again as you promised yes cavanaugh said theyll want to set another trap rutherford reached for the phone hey what are you doing cavanaugh reached to stop him getting help no but the bureau can we dont know who else is involved in this rutherford hesitated you said kline might have an informant in the bureau cavanaugh said suppose kline got word we were waiting for him thisd be the last place hed come near when the intercom buzzed cavanaugh waited a few seconds then pressed the button yes the security guards voice was tinny mr kline and another gentleman to see you send them up cavanaugh released the button and went back into the living room two of them rutherford said the other two must have stayed at baileys ridge in case you showed up jamie glanced at her watch just past noon earlier than you expected after being on a stakeout all night kline must really be annoyed that i didnt do what i said i would now he wants another hearttoheart with john are we ready for guests cavanaugh directed his question toward the skinhead and the mustached man who were tied to chairs it had taken the men an hour to regain consciousness insistent questioning had revealed only that they were contract operators and knew nothing about why prescott was important on two occasions the skinheads cell phone had rung kline angrily checking in cavanaugh had rehearsed with the two captives making sure they knew exactly how to respond if either of their cell phones rang with his pistol to the skinheads temple cavanaugh had watched the mans eyes as he spoke into his phone if cavanaugh had detected even the slightest attempt to warn kline hed have shown keen displeasure the skinhead now wore a baseball cap to hide his gashed scalp i asked youcavanaugh tapped the capif youre ready to receive guests the skinhead winced and nodded ill see you in a few minutes jamie said following instructions that theyd worked out earlier she left the apartment rutherford locked the door cavanaugh nervously imagined her moving along the corridor opening the door to the stairwell near the elevator and waiting behind it when jamie heard the ding of the elevator she would count to twenty the length of time they had calculated it took to walk from the elevator to rutherfords condo then she would open the door and step from the stairwell fumbling in her purse for what was presumably the key to her unit never once looking down the hallway at the two men outside rutherfords door the men would notice her but with no reason to be suspicious of a trapafter all they were the ones setting a trapthey would soon be distracted by what happened when rutherfords door opened jamie had looked steady as she left having used the intervening time to practice visualization techniques that cavanaugh taught her imagining possible variations to the scenario they had planned replaying them in her mind preparing herself not to be surprised to give her more confidence she wore the kevlar vest under her blouse and jacket it made her look overweight her clothes too tight but her appearance was the last thing she was worried about okay cavanaugh told the skinhead aiming his pistol at him be a good host rutherford had already freed the mans ankles and wrists now he untied the ropes that held the hostage to the chair remember cavanaugh told the man youll be the first one in our line of fire he motioned for him to cross the living room following he watched the man go down the corridor and pause at the front door now all you have to do is make sure you dont give us a reason to shoot you cavanaugh said rutherford took his position in the kitchen ready with a pistol sweat trickling down his sides cavanaugh waited fifteen seconds thirty fifty cavanaugh recalled how slowly the elevator had seemed to rise that the men hadnt yet knocked on the door didnt mean something was wrong he tried to assure himself be patient everythings going to be knock knock pause knock knock that was the pattern john had heard the team agree onthe code that signaled it was okay to open the door cavanaughs stomach constricted as he motioned for the skinhead to let them in at that point the start of a carefully rehearsed sequence cavanaugh stepped back into the living room out of sight of the doorway the skinhead would be very aware that rutherford was aiming at him from the kitchen having opened the door the skinhead would say he hasnt called then turn and walk toward the living room directly into cavanaughs line of fire meanwhile rutherford would have taken cover beside the refrigerator only when the men came inside and started along the corridor would rutherford again show himself aiming at them through the kitchen archway the second man would notice rutherford about the same time the first man noticed cavanaugh in the living room simultaneously jamie would have come up behind them drawing her pistol saying into the living room which she did now caught by surprise in a threeway vise their weapons beneath their jackets the men had little choice but to comply on the floor rutherford said hands behind your head now cavanaugh said the skinhead did what he was told sinking chestdown onto the carpet the other two hesitated only briefly before they imitated him putting their hands behind their heads jamie stepped in locking the door was anybody else in the hallway cavanaugh asked aiming at the men did they see your pistol two people got off the elevator as i came in here my pistol was next to my purse nobody saw it cavanaugh felt a measure of relief john had assured him that the people who lived in the building were mostly professional types not likely to be home early in the afternoon on a weekday even so someone coming along the hallway at the wrong time had been a liability cavanaugh couldnt plan for cute the first man said peering up from the carpet he was of medium height wiry with a thin face and militarystyle hair cavanaugh recognized the sandpapery voice weve spoken before on this guys cell phone cavanaugh meant the skinhead after i took the car from him outside the shopping mall you figured out the phone contained a homing device like the skinhead the man had a european accent we followed it for hours until we realized youd thrown it into the back of a passing pickup truck hey if you cant take a joke a thought occurred to cavanaugh you followed the truck why did you bother if you already knew wed used a helicopter to leave the area helicopter i dont know what youre talking about the mans confusion looked spontaneous enough to be convincing reinforcing cavanaughs suspicion that the team whod tried to grab prescott at the warehouse had not been the same team that had used helicopters to attack the bunker while he and jamie continued to aim at the men on the floor rutherford tied their ankles and wrists cavanaugh removed a mm beretta from beneath the second mans loose pullover he felt beneath the first mans black leather jacket and found a mm browning hipower he also found a folding knife clipped to the inside of his pants pocket only the clip showed on the outside by pulling upward on the clip the owner could draw the knife instantaneously from concealment a small ribbed projection on the back of the blade allowed it to be thumbed open onehanded in the same motion as the knife was being drawn when open it was almost eight inches long knives had once been considered inferior weapons dummy you brought a knife to a gunfight but a graphic selfdefense video released in the s surviving sharpedged weapon attacks had shown lawenforcement and security personnel that an assailant with a knife could race across a distance of twenty feet and cause lethal wounds before someone with a concealed handgun could overcome his startle reflex draw and fire now some operators considered a knife as prudent a backup weapon as a pistol and carried as many as three the knife cavanaugh held had a nonreflective flatblack surface and had been manufactured by one of the best selfdefense instructors and knife makers ernest emerson it was called the cqc the initials representing closequarter combat its weavepatterned epoxy handle was designed not to be slippery when covered with water sweat or blood its serrated steel was hard and sharp enough to punch through a car door cute cavanaugh said echoing what the first man had said he closed the knife and clipped it into his pants pocket he sat crosslegged on the floor at the first mans eye level youre using the name kline its as good as anything tell me about prescott kline didnt answer ill tell you what i know about him cavanaugh said feel free to chime in any time you feel like it cavanaugh told kline what had happened after the car chase the arrival at the bunker the instructions to prescott about how to disappear the fire the helicopter attack and the other fire at karens house so you see i want him as much as you do probably worse wed accomplish more if we worked together but our purposes conflict im sure we can work around our differences cavanaugh studied him you look like your arms are starting to hurt why dont i make you more comfortable kline frowned puzzled as cavanaugh brought a captains chair from the kitchen kline frowned even more when cavanaugh raised him to his feet and thumbed open the emerson knife im going to cut the rope on your wrists cavanaugh said if you make any move against me my friend herecavanaugh indicated rutherfordwhos in a world of hurt and a really foul mood because of the beating your team gave him yesterday will shoot you rutherford had gone into the kitchen and returned with an empty plastic softdrink bottle shoved over the barrel of his pistol as a sound suppressor i want my tooth back it was a tactic that he and cavanaugh had rehearsed and it had its intended effect especially the rigged sound suppressor causing klines eyes to narrow but why invite trouble cavanaugh asked were having a pleasant conversation we want to cooperate with one another cavanaugh stepped behind kline cut the rope on his wrists and told him sit kline obeyed cavanaugh retied klines wrists this time to the arms of the captains chair comfy cavanaugh asked good i honestly think wed have a better chance of finding prescott if we worked together its your turn tell me what you know kline looked away for starters cavanaugh said why do you want him so much he told me a story about addiction research he was doing for the dea he was supposed to find a way to block the physical mechanism that causes people to become addicted instead he claimed he found an easytomanufacture substance that causes addiction he said jesus escobar somehow found out and tried to grab him to get the formula he said you guys worked for escobar but all that turned out to be a bunch of hooey the dea never heard of prescott and escobar was killed two months ago so who do you guys really work for kline finally looked back at cavanaugh tension made his european accentslavic or possibly russianmore pronounced you know i cant tell you that maybe i should make you some coffee while we consider the problem coffee kline tilted his head puzzled yeah theres nothing like a chat over coffee john where do you keep it above the fridge he and jamie looked as puzzled as kline did the grinders next to it the percolators next to the toaster on the counter percolator what i had in mind was instant coffee cavanaugh said uh in the cupboard to the right of the stove cavanaugh turned klines chair so kline could watch then cavanaugh went into the kitchen and opened the cupboard finding a small box that had packets of various kinds of instant coffees lets see hazelnut roast vanilla roast chocolate roast any of that appeal to you he asked kline no answer john youve got to lay off this sweet coffee cavanaugh said youll put on so much weight you wont be able to run it off havent you got anything with some heft to it wait a minute whats this mocha java now that sounds like a manly brew cavanaugh opened two packets of it and dumped the powder into a small transparent juice glass he put very little water in a kettle and set the kettle on the stove turning the burner to high wont be long now he assured kline theres nothing like hot rich caffeinated coffee to promote conversation are you sure you dont want to give me some tidbits right nowabout why you want prescott and about who else would be after him kline continued to look stubborn ah well cavanaugh said i certainly respect your principles youre definitely not a blabbermouth the kettle whistled cavanaugh poured what amounted to an ounce and a half of boiling liquid into the juice glass there was barely enough water to dissolve the two packets of coffee crystals he gave it a stir letting kline see how dark and thick the mixture was nothing limpwristed about this stuff itll put fire in your eyes and hair on your chest kline looked even more perplexed you expect me to drink that what the hell good will that do to make me talk id probably throw it up drink it the farthest thing from my mind and believe me you wont be throwing it up cavanaugh opened rutherfords firstaid kit and removed one of the syringes klines eyes got bigger cavanaugh inserted the syringe in the thick coffee mixture and pulled back the plunger filling the tube then pushed the plunger to remove air from the syringe he started humming fly me to the moon hold it kline said youre not seriously thinking about cavanaugh interrupted him by ripping klines shirt open fully exposing his neck now he was humming black coffee as he angled the tip of the syringe toward klines jugular vein for christs sake stop kline tilted his body toward the opposite side nearly overturning the chair watch your language rutherford the southern baptist said seriously all right all right just stop kline told cavanaugh you cant expect me to believe youre crazy enough to expand your mind along with your arteries and your vital organs cavanaugh said im going to set your heart racing and blow your brains out from the inside i figure by the time your pulse gets up to about a hundred and eighty you might even start to levitate except youll be tied to that chair now if youll hold still cavanaugh put a firm hand on klines shoulder and readjusted the syringes trajectory no kline tilted his body so far to the side that this time the chair did topple with a thump he landed on the carpet hey have some consideration for the neighbors cavanaugh said that stuffll kill me kline said kill you itll get your metabolism racing so fast youll probably selfcombust cavanaugh pushed klines head against the carpet and slanted the syringes tip so that it pressed along klines jugular kline whispered trying to minimize his neck movements sounding as if hed swallowed ashes if you kill me i cant tell you anything you know what part of me doesnt care running into you twice was running into you twice too often im pissed about my friends being dead im pissed about prescott trying to kill me im pissed about what you and your men did to john i want to get even with somebody and if you dont intend to cooperate with me the way i cooperated with you at least ill get the satisfaction of this cavanaugh pierced klines artery enough to draw blood kline winced and looked as if he was trying not to shudder but he didnt succeed his involuntary movement causing a little more blood to leak from his artery the drugaddiction story was a cover prescott worked for the us military i want specifics a branch of it devoted to specialweapons development kline licked his lips which suddenly looked very dry i might need to cough better not the syringell go all the way in a subsection of a subsection kline lowered his voice even more trying not to move his neck the kind of research they dont report to the secretary of defense or the kind the pentagon itself doesnt know about like the lsd experiments in washington in the s or the nervegas experiments in utah in the s kline licked his dry lips again yes our tax dollars at work so what was this experiment about fear the word seemed to linger in the air it was so unexpected that cavanaugh didnt react to it at first he was certain he hadnt heard correctly fear cavanaughs muscles tightened and his palms became moist as he felt a premonition about what kline was going to tell him next fear kline whispered hoarsely repulsed by the pressure of the syringes tip against his artery prescott was in charge of biochemical research designed to create fear in any opponent the us military confronted my neck kline tensed youre shoving harder prescott tell me about prescott klines brow was beaded with sweat he created a synthetic hormone that triggered adrenaline in such massive doses that panic was an immediate result prescotts lie about trying to stop addiction and instead discovering how to increase addiction had been partially based on truth cavanaugh now realized all that needed to be done was to substitute the word fear for addiction his mind flashed back to the stairs in the abandoned warehouse and the pungent odor hed smelled as hed gone up to meet prescott hed become more and more uneasy as hed mounted the stairs his body more jittery with each step prescotts military controllers were thrilled unable to turn his head kline strained his eyes sideways toward where the syringe pricked the artery in his neck sweat dripped from his face if the synthetic hormone could be modified into a gas and delivered in canisters dropped from planes or via rockets it would render opposing armies helpless during an attack politicians tend to get a little nervous when they hear about chemicalweapons research but why should that hold back a good idea cavanaugh said barely containing his anger he recalled how klines men had suddenly panicked when theyd invaded the warehouses stairwell responding to an unseen threat they had fired uncontrollably up the stairs unable to force themselves higher prescott must have had canisters of the gas concealed in the stairwell traces of it had escaped which explained cavanaughs jittery reaction he recalled something elsehow prescott had worked dials on a panel when klines team invaded the stairwell but as frightened as klines men had become their reaction had apparently not been strong enough for prescott had murmured in alarm to himself as if something was wrong perhaps the canisters had developed a slow leak so that by the time klines team attacked the full force of the weapon wasnt available prescott experimented with it on animals kline said rats went berserk cats and dogs became so afraid of each other they cowered in corners on one occasion it drove a dozen goats into such a panic that they raced around the walls that contained them until they dropped in shock and died cavanaugh thought of karens basement of the pungent smell that he now realized had caused him for the first time in his life to suffer fear the effects of which continued to linger he thought of the panic that had almost destroyed him in the fire he thought of seeing karen slumped motionless in her wheelchair her hands clamped to her chest her face contorted rigidly with horror now he understood what had killed her wanting to avoid a wound or a strangle mark that would alert a medical examiner to karens murder prescott had used the hormone to terrify her to death her heart and arteries must have ruptured from the massive force of terror the syringe your hands shaking again kline said tell me everything eventually the temptation became too great prescott tried it on humans innercity gangs ran in panic when a lone victim wandered onto their turf and defended himself from their attacks by throwing a small hissing canister at them then there must be a neutralizer cavanaugh said otherwise the person throwing the canister would become terrified also yes kline cringed from the pressure of the syringe against his neck prescott must have used the neutralizer on himself when he was in karens house cavanaugh realized otherwise the hormone would have overpowered him without the neutralizer they couldnt have managed what happened at the world trade organization riots in st louis kline said all cavanaugh remembered about the riots was that after three days of chaos the authorities had finally overwhelmed the rioters and forced them into the mississippi the tear gas contained the fear hormone kline shut his eyes in an attempt to relieve his tension the gas masks supplied by the military had the neutralizer in their filters the experiment was a success except that only a few military officers and prescott knew what had really happened cavanaugh said and a few powerful civilians with strong ideas about how your country should protect itself they decided to try another secret test on humans this time on a group trained not to respond to fear a team of us rangers on a training exercise in a swamp in florida cavanaugh recalled being troubled by a recent report about fifteen rangers who had drowned in florida sweating kline kept his eyes shut maybe the hormone had the wrong strength or maybe men trained to use weapons do just that when theyre overwhelmed with panic they started shooting at anything and everything most of them didnt drownthey were hit by cross fire sickened cavanaugh found himself leaning back taking the syringe from where hed pressed it against klines jugular except for klines labored breathing the room became silent it took several moments before klinepale taped to the chair lying sideways on the floorseemed to realize that the syringe had been removed slowly apprehensively he opened his eyes evidently not believing that cavanaugh sat across from him the syringe next to him on the carpet keep talking cavanaugh said two things happened kline tried to raise his head so he could look at cavanaugh straight on first my employer learned about the experiments how one of prescotts researchers was an informant for us and the second thing the informant wasnt cautious about the way he spent what we paid him prescotts controllers became suspicious interrogated the man and discovered that the research had been compromised that an unfriendly foreign government wanted the weapon in tandem with the dead rangers in the failed experiment that security lapse made the military officers decide it was too risky to continue before anyone in your government could learn about the research and make trouble about it they aborted the program kline let the implication hang in the air youre suggesting prescotts controllers worried about him about whether they could trust him cavanaugh asked our informant knew the nature of the fear hormone but not how to produce it only prescott had all the details he was synonymous with the research to shut down the program fully prescott had to be eliminated cavanaugh said especially because his controllers knew we wanted to get our hands on him he suspected the danger he faced he fledwith us and his controllers after him one group trying to capture him the other trying to kill him we managed to track him to that warehouse then you showed up and here we are kline said but how did prescotts controllers learn where we were taking him cavanaugh asked abruptly the answer seemed evident they must have followed you to the warehouse we were careful perhaps one of your men informed on you then why did it take so long for prescotts controllers to try to get him kline asked they made their move only after you became involved cavanaugh felt his face turn cold i was followed someone at protective services told them we were helping prescott your firm protects the rich and powerful it makes sense that various intelligence agencies would keep tabs on your companys activities again cavanaugh began to lose focus on reality he didnt know what to think what to depend on then he looked at jamie whose beautiful yet worried gaze was directed toward him and he knew very definitely what to depend on to hell with it cavanaugh raised kline from the floor and pulled out the emerson knife what are you doing kline flinched johns going to phone the justice department and have your companions picked up for a hearttoheart chat about unfriendly foreign governments kline stared at the knife but whats going to happen to me were going sightseeing what a quiet drive in the countryside with you kline looked pleadingly toward rutherford cant you see this guys crazy hell take me out to the woods god knows what hell do to me there no onell ever find my body rutherford studied cavanaugh can i talk to you a minute keep your pistol aimed at kline cavanaugh told jamie he followed rutherford into the bedroom rutherford closed the bedroom door are you serious i need him to show me prescotts lab maybe something there will tell me where prescott went its the only direction i can think to go cant let you rutherford said klines an fbi prisoner now i havent heard you read him his rights you will in about thirty seconds rutherford said how about in a couple of hours what are you trying to once klines officially in fbi custody and the bureau puts him in a government facility the pressures off him he wont feel threatened he wont tell you anything more kidnapping a federal agent can put him in prison for life rutherford said hell tell us anything we want to know in exchange for a plea bargain but plea bargains take time cavanaugh said meanwhile prescotts trail gets colder i need everything kline knows now cant rutherford repeated if the bureau found out i let a prisoner go id lose my job you wont be letting him go cavanaugh said then why are we having this conversation im taking him what wait two hours then phone the bureau tell them there was another prisoner but that i took him before the situation was under control tell them we went to prescotts lab send a team out there by then ill have learned everything i need from kline you are crazy lets just say things are happening inside me i need to stop i dont understand cavanaugh held up his shaking hand prescott gave me a dose of the fear hormone kline talked about rutherford didnt say anything for a moment god kline said there was a neutralizer prescott has it i need it cavanaugh opened the door and went into the living room where kline looked apprehensive lets go no rutherford said cavanaugh thumbed open the emerson knife freed kline from the chair tied his wrists in front of him and draped klines leather jacket over his hands well use the stairs and go out through the emergency exit jennifer get the car meet us in back i cant let you do this rutherford said two hours john dont make me stop you what are you going to do shoot me rutherford stared at him part five threat escalation while jamie drove kline sat next to her cavanaugh was in the back his pistol under a newspaper on his lap ready to shoot through the rear of klines seat if kline did anything to justify it a hundred miles west of washington the virginia countryside was lush and hilly with fewer towns and more fields and wooded areas as they went along occasional farmhouses stone fences and ponds were visible along the treelined twolane road the prevailing impression though was of large estates and horses grazing at four in the afternoon there was little traffic as jamie guided the taurus into a hollow up a slight rise and into another hollow cavanaugh asked kline how far another five minutes youre certain the two men you left here to watch for me have gone you heard me phone and tell them to leave you made it clear youll shoot me if you catch even a glimpse of them i assure you theyve gone i gave them no warning jamie drove past a sign that read baileys ridge wheres the town i dont see any buildings its not a town kline said then what is it a site where a civil war battle occurred past the sign a plaque showed a map and an historical note jamie stopped next to it the map was in basrelief dramatizing the contour of the wooded hills in the area arrows indicated where union and confederate soldiers had fought one another in a battle that had destroyed most of a farm owned by an irish immigrant samuel bailey killing his wife and daughter the battle had concluded when bailey put on a fallen union soldiers jacket grabbed a rifle and led a company of northerners across a ridge above his farm outflanking their opponents bailey went on to receive a field commission as a captain and to fight in numerous other battles eventually dying from diphtheria never again seeing his farm and the graves of his wife and daughter well thats enough to ruin my day cavanaugh said mine already was ruined kline said his wrists remained tied together beneath his leather jacket two hollows from here theres a lane on the right jamie drove on went up an incline and descended into the first hollow take this lane cavanaugh told jamie no thats not the one kline said i told you two hollows i know what you told me cavanaugh said but were trying this one jamie pulled off the road flanked by dense bushes and trees two shadowy weedchoked ruts in the dirt were blocked by a wooden gate the white paint of which had faded to the color of dirty chalk what attracted cavanaughs attention was that the weeds in the lane looked crushed as if a vehicle had recently gone over them i dont see a lock jamie said after a cautious glance around she got out of the car and unhooked a rusted chain from the gate swinging it open she drove through stopped and took another wary glance around before she returned to the gate and shut it behind her its so flimsy jamie said getting back into the car if we have to when we come back we can always ram through it park where the undergrowth conceals us from the road well walk cavanaugh said after warning kline to be quiet cavanaugh made him lead the way up a potholed lane that twisted through trees and bushes he had his pistol out following kline at a careful distance overhead branches shut out the sun then the branches opened and the steep rise brought them to kneehigh grass in a clearing where old weathergrayed picnic benches looked down on a valley half a mile wide the area down there was completely devoted to pasture no shade trees anywhere which was odd if the pasture was intended for horses cavanaugh thought but not odd if the trees had been leveled to create an unobstructed line of fire and to remove places in which an intruder might be able to hide a wooden sign attached to a post had faded yellow letters that might once have been orange welcome to baileys ridge looks like one of the locals tried some kind of tourist thing several years ago cavanaugh said he glanced down at indentations in the long grass where a vehicle had recently been parked then he motioned for kline to walk along a furrow in the grass toward the picnic benches a trampled area around one of the benches attracted his attention as did cigarette butts the paper of which looked fresh this was where your men watched for me right cavanaugh asked he peered down at the paved road that went through the pasture from here they could see pretty much everything that happened down there yesterday what made you think id use the next lane its the only area where the trees have been cut back from the road until a month ago a chainlink fence used to be there the dirt was disturbed when they ripped the poles out the sanitizers tried to smooth the dirt and put in bushes but its obvious the landscapes been changed every other lane that seems to go nowhere is made of dirt and has weeds and potholes that lanes as smooth and weedfree as can be beyond the trees it becomes paved how did prescott and his controllers get permission to block off a historic site cavanaugh asked prescott didnt need permission this propertys historic but it isnt owned by the government its his is it safe to go down there nobodys around the lab was abandoned as soon as the project was terminated but wheres the lab kline pointed toward the valley i dont see anything except a burnedout farmhouse cavanaugh said the first time baileys farmhouse was destroyed was in kline explained as they drove along the road through the pasture approaching the burned structure after your civil war the new owneran industrialist whod made a fortune selling munitions to the governmentbought most of the land around here and had a mansion built where baileys house had stood the original cellar was incorporated into the design stones from the original house were used in the walls you should have been a historian my father was klines voice was filled with regret they reached the scorched collapsed building and got out of the taurus despite the devastation of the burned timbers and the blackened stones from the fallen walls cavanaugh was able to get an idea of how impressive the mansion had been in its heyday he imagined pillars and two long porches one above the other people standing on them waving as horsedrawn carriages brought brightly dressed visitors its a shame prescotts controllers had to destroy it they didnt destroy it kline said prescott did cavanaugh and jamie looked at him prescotts controllers confined him to the mansion when they terminated his project kline said a man doesnt devote himself to researching fear unless he identifies with it if hes paranoid hes going to become more so when he sees signs all around him that people consider him a liability fears his primary emotion cavanaugh agreed and now thanks to him its mine he added silently to protect himself prescott did something his controllers could never have anticipated given how proud he was of this property kline said one night when his fear became especially intense and he was certain he was about to be killed he burned the mansion down because he looked so heavy and out of shape his controllers had misjudged him putting a few guards on him while the majority were devoted to keeping intruders such as myself off the property in the confusion caused by the flames he was able to slip away into the darkness the fire was only half of his tactic however he also released the hormone as the mansion burned under its influence the guards panicked and shot at what they thought were attackers coming through the flickering shadows several got killed by their own menanother mess that had to be cleaned up the shots brought the guards from the perimeter meanwhile prescott stole one of their vehicles and smashed through a fence at the back of the property he abandoned the vehicle in a nearby town where he had a car stored in a garage that hed rented under another name just goes to showparanoias a survival trait jamie said wheres prescotts lab cavanaugh asked in back kline said they rounded the jumble of scorched timbers and stones and approached a similar ruin but this one looked as if it had been a barn the fire prescott set didnt spread this far kline said a few days later his controllers were responsible for this one it was part of their sanitizing an efficient way to get the job done the labs underground under the barn kline pointed toward where blackened wreckage had been moved to form a path across the barns concrete floor he indicated a hatchlike slab thats the entrance you and your men cleared this werent you afraid of being caught by whom i told you the property had been abandoned theres no reason to guard this place theres nothing here for prescotts controllers to worry about kline suddenly groaned as cavanaugh gaped jamie screamed seeing blood fly from klines forehead a faraway shot echoing kline toppled faceforward into the dirt it happened so suddenly and so unexpectedly that cavanaugh was momentarily controlled only by his startle reflex until now after the tension of what had happened in rutherfords condo he had managed to keep his nervousness at bay this was supposed to have been a factfinding mission not a confrontation now the unaccustomed fear that prescotts hormone had created in him and that he had struggled to subdue took possession of him again but his fear for jamie was even greater his muscles responding like tightly wound springs abruptly released he dove toward her pushing her down with him next to the barns wreckage a bullet kicked up dirt beyond their heads but this time the shot was close and loud almost simultaneous with the bullets impact a second shot tore up dirt near their feet cavanaugh felt the sharp vibration through the ground at the mansion charred boards scraped against each other shifting creating gaps blackened rocks toppled the ruin had seemingly come to life portions of it able to move assuming independent shapes one by one blackclad figures rose from ashes soot and grime their faces streaked with carbon they aimed assault weapons one of the camouflaged men fired a burst at the ground next to jamie dust flew the ground shook the roar was overwhelming then the shooting stopped and in the sudden silence which was broken only by the ringing in cavanaughs ears he managed to control his trembling arms and raise them in surrender pale breathing rapidly jamie imitated him slowly unsteadily they came to their feet if they wanted us deadhis mouth dry his words like paste cavanaugh murmured doing his best to assure her theyd have shot us by now he hoped he was convincing that his voice didnt sound hollow heat seared his stomach stepping from the mansions ruin the dark camouflaged figures continued to aim their weapons which cavanaugh recognized now as mp submachine guns like the men whod rappelled from the helicopters the night of the attack on the bunker these men obviously had specialoperations training one of them stared past cavanaugh prompting cavanaugh to glance apprehensively in that direction from the woods at the back of the valley the speck of a vehicle emerged as it sped closer crossing a field it threw up dust then it reached the paved road the dust drifting in the breeze and even with the ringing in his ears cavanaugh could hear its engine getting louder the vehicle was now close enough for cavanaugh to recognize it as a big fourwheeldrive suv a ford explorer with the sun angled in its direction he saw the shapes of two people beyond the windshield a broadshouldered driver and a tall blond woman in her thirties whose oval face and high cheekbones might have been attractive if her eyes hadnt been the coldest hed ever seen as the explorer skidded to a halt the woman got out she was around five ten the same as jamie her face had an athletes tan and no makeup her hair was like an athletes also too short to be combed back her eyes were the blue of a glacier she wore sturdy walking shoes khaki pants a matching jacket and a beige shirt that gave her a military appearance while the camouflaged figures approached with their weapons the woman told her driver who was built like a weight lifter search them the muscular man enjoyed his work prodding cavanaugh more forcefully than necessary then pawing jamie youll pay for that cavanaugh thought trying to use anger to balance his fear the driver found their pistols under their jackets and nodded at their nonreflective flatblack coating evidence of the expert gunsmith work that had been done on them the way he put them into his baggy hiking pants it was obvious he intended to keep them as his own he took their extra magazines and cavanaughs cell phone he undipped the emerson knife from the inside of cavanaughs front pants pocket approved of that weapon also and clipped it into his own pocket he also took jamies car keys your names the woman said sam murdock cavanaugh gave her the name on the id karen had manufactured for him jennifer jamie said using the false name cavanaugh had assigned her at rutherfords condo her id was with her purse which shed left under the tauruss front seat sam murdock the woman studied the wallet the driver tossed to her that might be what it says here but your professional name is cavanaugh i dont know what youre with global protective services youre the one who went to the warehouse to get prescott so kline was right cavanaugh thought somebody at protective services betrayed me i was followed to the warehouse prescott cavanaugh frowned what are you talking about the woman nodded to her driver who plunged a fist into cavanaughs stomach gasping cavanaugh sank to his knees his breath had been so knocked out of him that his vision turned gray for a moment as he struggled to inhale you came here to see the lab the woman said fine ill show it to you she took what looked like a pager from her belt and pressed a button behind cavanaugh a motor droned he turned in that direction hydraulic poles tilted the concrete slab up revealing steps that descended into darkness the shots will attract attention cavanaugh found enough breath to say not around here prescott owns most of the land the locals have been told he enjoys target shooting now go down to the lab or else edgar will throw you the woman said ill take the first option thanks cavanaugh managed to stand nodding to jamie who looked paler and searched his eyes for assurance he went down the steps with her we stripped this place clean the woman said voice echoing totally gutted it the armed men removed surefire flashlights from their equipment belts a little longer and thicker than a heavyweight boxers index finger the compact black tubes gave off an amazing amount of light for their size revealing a long concrete corridor that had numerous openings on each side the air was stale we destroyed all the scientific equipment the computers and the files the woman said we carted away the furniture we disassembled the heating and airconditioning systems we even removed the lighting fixtures the sinks and toilets the carpeting the false ceilings the doors and the wall panels taking a flashlight from one of the men the woman aimed it at the ceiling where insulated wires dangled from holes in which fluorescent lamps had presumably once been anchored she pointed the flashlight in a different direction and showed wires projecting from small rectangular holes in the wall where light switches had been it doesnt get cleaner than this no one could possibly guess what these rooms were used for hell if the barn was still standing you could put hay or animals down here then why would you care if anybody wandered onto the property cavanaughs voice reverberated theres nothing here to bother anybody and get you in trouble thats exactly right theres nothing here but bare rooms im not sure you get the point the woman said the armed men stepped closer aiming the flashlights at cavanaughs and jamies eyes backing them into the room were not here protecting anything my men havent been lying motionless under that rubble merely to demonstrate their skill and patience weve been waiting cavanaugh didnt react but not just for anybody cavanaugh still didnt react for you now cavanaugh did react but not in a way that the woman expected relying on his training he said i need to know your name what if were going to reach an understanding it helps me to know your name to relate to build a position of trust amazing the woman replied in that case i bet i can guess your last name grace in darkness pierced by flashlight beams the woman became silent for a moment when she finally spoke again she sounded annoyed yes all our research says youre good at using words to manipulate situations in fact thats what i want from you talk a lot of it about prescott how did you know wed come here teach him not to change the subject edgar blinded by the flashlights cavanaugh couldnt see where the fist was directed he expected another punch to his stomach and braced his muscles there but this time the blow struck his face knocking him to the floor stunned briefly seeing more flashlight beams than were aimed at him he spat blood again anger helped neutralize his fear we thought prescott was dead but we didnt find his body on the mountain after the fire grace said you punished me but i still won cavanaugh thought youre answering my question so we decided to keep tabs on our rivals she said they were still trying to find him and they were very interested in anybody else who was trying to find him yesterday we saw them kidnap an fbi agent then four of them including the dead man outside set up surveillance on a nearby ridge obviously expecting somebody important to arrive we hoped it would be prescott although we couldnt figure why hed come back but then two of the men went away when the final two started to leave this afternoon we interrogated them and learned about you and your interest in this place so we did our own watching for a while why did you shoot kline was that his name grace shrugged if he knew anything he wouldnt have been so eager to get his hands on you i didnt need him except to make a point about how serious we are but you need me so you wont kill me cavanaugh said meaning how can we make you afraid enough to talk why doesnt edgar have a hearttoheart with your friend here maybe thatll make you talk the threat was like a hot needle piercing cavanaughs chest still dazed by the blow to his face he tried to think quickly to distract grace from fixating on jamie my team and i taught prescott how to disappear then he killed everybody but me what cavanaugh said was only partly true he deliberately didnt mention that a rocket from graces team had blown up chad and tracy maybe he could keep grace from realizing that he hated her side almost as much as he hated prescott i risked my life for that son of a bitch he killed the people whod pledged to protect him my friends tried to kill me i want him as much as you do then tell us where to find him grace said on the floor cavanaugh raised his left arm trying to shield his eyes from the glare of the lights more blood dripped from his mouth you think if i knew where to find him id have come to his lab you just told me you helped teach prescott how to disappear graces voice boomed everything but the final step his new identity cavanaughs swollen mouth made it difficult for him to talk wed arranged for him to go to a forger whod supply him with a new name and documents for it prescott got there ahead of me took the documents and killed the forger theres no way to find out the name and background the forger created for him where did prescott intend to live i have no idea we hadnt decided that yet edgar grace said this time it was a kick to cavanaughs side that made him groan trying to absorb the impact he rolled but not fara corner blocked his way as the reverberation of the impact ended cavanaugh heard i jamies nervous breathing we told him to pick a spot where hed never been where hed be least expected to go a place hed never spoken to anybody about youre not making a very good case for yourself grace said why should we let you live if theres no way you can help us i understand him you understand him grace mocked he worked for us for ten years and nobody here understood him except that hes paranoid cavanaugh said and hes arrogant youre not telling me anything i dont know i think edgar needs to have that hearttoheart with your friend to get you to be more generous with your information cavanaugh heard jamie stop breathing grace ill tell you the most important thing you need to know about him he said quit calling me that if youre trying to pretend youre delirious it isnt going to prescott believes hes smarter than everybody else cavanaugh said so what im betting he thinks he knows how to disappear better than i taught him im betting he thinks he can break the rules and be clever enough to get away with it the idea which had suddenly occurred to cavanaugh began to seem more than just a stalling tactic be specific cavanaugh squinted past the nearly blinding flashlights toward where graces voice came from the darkness on his left we asked prescott if he had a place in mind where he wanted to start his new life he told us no which we said was goodcavanaugh wiped blood from his mouthbecause people who have a place in mind often make inadvertent comments about it he took a painful breath later somebody might remember those comments and tell the wrong people he shifted where he lay on the concrete floor feeling its chill creeping into him ive been trying to remember if prescott made any inadvertent slips like that and did he he liked wine thats not a bulletin either he liked fine cooking he could analyze it the way a chef would thinking of prescotts praise for chads beef stroganoff cavanaugh felt a mounting fury about chads death about how it wouldnt have happened if not for graces team and the fire prescott had started hating grace he hid his emotions by concentrating on the pain edgar had inflicted on him his aching stomach muscles and his mangled lips he said the only exercise he enjoyed was golf so prescott went to napa valley or the new york wine district or the bordeaux region of france where he eats gourmet meals when hes not playing golfis that the news flash youre giving me grace asked if you dont start telling me something useful edgar and your friend are going to start dancing while hes at it hell step on your toes a little more let me finish cavanaughs swollen lips throbbed when i met him at the warehouse he had some books and videotapes on a shelf not many but hed been in that hideyhole for three weeks it stands to reason that the few things he had with him were extremely important to him enough to keep him amused for that length of time cavanaugh paused hoping to sink the hook or to satisfy his fantasies fantasies about the ideal life he was planning about the dreamedof place he was going to see with his brandnew identity what were the books and the videos thats the problem ive been trying to remember but i cant think of the titles again cavanaugh was partly lying he definitely remembered prescotts fascination with the poet robinson jeffers he was trying to give grace enough information to retain her interest while he bought time in the hopes that he could find a way to get jamie and himself out of there he had a porno book another book about geology i saw an odd mix of videos a clint eastwood thriller a teenage romance starring troy donahue titles grace said i told youi cant remember you will grace said she snapped her fingers footsteps scraping the group backed away gripping the wall to get support to stand cavanaugh felt jamie help him to his feet he shambled from the room and watched the group climb the concrete steps toward sunlight that hurt his eyes at the top grace had a cell phone to her ear somebody bring dr rattigan i dont care what hes doing get him here now the group disappeared into daylight with a drone the concrete door descended blocking the sun three feet two feet cavanaugh cherished the final sliver of light then with a hollow thump as the door closed he and jamie were enveloped by darkness the gloom and the isolation were so total that the air felt denser and smelled staler he heard jamie breathing next to him whos dr rattigan her voice was unsteady the complete lack of light caused the echo to seem louder cavanaughs injuries plus his fearweakened muscles made it hard for him to keep his balance in the darkness my guess is somebody with a satchelful of syringes and chemicals to help me remember how hard did he hit you my smile isnt as winning as it used to be the joke wasnt much but cavanaugh had to try to do something to lift jamies spirit what about you are i need to im sorry but i have to cavanaugh heard jamie feel her way along a wall and into a room an urgent tug on a buckle was followed by a zipper being pulled down slacks being dropped urine hissing on the floor sorry she said sorry for what its worth if he hadnt been determined to rouse her spirits he wouldnt have admitted that his own pants were wet when edgar kicked me my bladder let go and thats something else he and grace will pay for cavanaugh thought fabric made a brushing sound as jamie readjusted her clothes i dont know if i ever told you when i was a kid some friendsif i can call them thatlocked me in a closet i dont like the dark im not crazy about it either i have trouble in places that make me feel closed in maybe i can make the space seem larger the luminous dial on cavanaughs watch showed the rising motion of his hand as he remembered something in the upper pocket of his jacket scrape a match flared jamies surprised face appeared in the flickering light whered you get from when we pretended to be smoking outside johns building one of the few benefits anyone ever got from lighting up jamie said edgars not half as good at searching people as he thinks he is he also left us our belts what good are the spike on the buckle can be a weapon cavanaugh felt heat as the match burned closer to his fingers his trembling hand made the flame waver finally he had to drop it step next to me he said hold my jacket the sound of cloth being torn echoed in the darkness what are you doing jamie asked ripping off my shirtsleeves why would to make torches cavanaugh tugged at the fabric which was stronger than hed expected finally he had both sleeves off his bare arms felt a chill that radiated from the concrete around him quickly he put his coat back on my turn jamie said she gave him her blazer the finer material of her blouse made it easier for her and cavanaugh to tear the sleeves off she shoved them into a pocket well be able to see for a while jamie said but we still wont be able to get out of here imagine youre prescott cavanaugh removed his belt and shoved the spike on its buckle through the end of one of his tornoff sleeves suspicious as he is he wouldnt like feeling closed in any more than we do that concrete door comes down and the hydraulics could fail jamie said everybody could be trapped and suffocate prescott definitely wouldnt like to think about running out of air right cavanaugh struck another match and applied the flame to the end of his sleeve like many fabrics it had been treated with a fire retardant that wouldnt stop the cloth from catching fire but it would prevent the fire from spreading quickly which was what cavanaugh needed he set the sleeve on the floor and pulled it with his belt that way he wouldnt risk burning his hand his buckle clattered along the concrete meanwhile the shimmering light caused jamies face to lose a little of its tension a tunnel that goes to prescotts mansion she said exactly the buckle continued to clatter as they moved toward the steps leading up to the door next to the steps on the right the burning sleeve revealed a corridor they followed the narrow passageway only to be stopped by a door the door was locked cavanaugh folded up his jacket collar and removed his lockpick tools he set the belt on the floor tried to steady his hands and went to work can you see to do it jamie asked most of this is feel giving jamie the lesson hed promised hoping to distract her and distracting himself in the process cavanaugh explained what he was doing applying torque with the end of one pick he inserted the second pick into the key slot the lock was solid and had six pins each of which he nudged in fifteen seconds despite his trembling fingers cavanaugh had disabled the lock but when he pulled the door open the dwindling flames revealed a solid plug of fallen stones and scorched timbers a sight that made jamie moan itll take hours to clean out this much debris assuming we can do it at all cavanaugh said the flame weakened not to mention the noise wed make would attract attention on the surface wed have a dozen submachine guns pointed at us if we managed to crawl out the flame died what are we going to do jamie asked without an answer cavanaugh attached another torn sleeve to the buckle and lit it hurrying he led the way back along the tunnel what did grace say about all this what did she mention they took out of here the airconditioning and the heating systems maybe we can use the ductwork jamie said quickly maybe theres a ventilation shaft that leads to the surface they reached the main corridor at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the concrete door cavanaugh glanced toward the ceiling finding a twofootsquare gap where a ventilation grille had been removed crouching he interlaced his hands and made them into a stirrup when jamie stepped onto them he straightened lifting her she was tall enough that she had no trouble reaching the gap in the ceiling she eased her head up through it see anything cavanaugh asked i cant fit through it so i guarantee you cant damn it in the movies the airconditioning ducts are always big enough for andre the giant as cavanaugh lowered her the burning sleeve began to dim smoke rose what else did grace say what else did they take out of here the plumbing fixtures the lights the we know theres electricity cavanaugh glanced at the wires protruding from small gaps in the walls otherwise the system that raises the concrete slab wouldnt work what switch would have activated the door from the inside jamie headed toward wires in a gap to the right of the steps plastic caps covered the ends of the wires cavanaugh pulled the caps off and studied the bare tips of the wires the switch that was here was the closest to the steps if i press these wires together will they make a circuit and cause the door to open in the dimming light jamie looked hopeful then the spirit in her eyes faded therell be guards outside theyll see and hear the door move maybe not if i only tap these wires together therell be sound and movement just for an instant maybe not long enough for anybody to notice at least well know if these wires control the door but what good will that do well still be trapped in here until later cavanaugh said until we think the timings better then we can open the door all the way is that before or after dr rattigan fills you full of chemicals to refresh your memory cavanaugh didnt know what to answer weve got to try something he thought as he was about to tap the wires together the door moved seemingly on its own the hydraulic system droning the door rising sunlight revealed the silhouettes of grace edgar and half a dozen armed men cavanaugh stepped on the burning sleeve to extinguish it then grabbed his belt and pulled jamie into the shadows of a room he didnt know what he hoped to accomplish but anything was better than standing in the open he removed the matchbook from his pocket and tore off several of the matches along with a quarter inch of the abrasive paper putting them in a different pocket then he crushed the matchbook inside his fist heavy footsteps indicated that the armed men came down the steps first grace and edgar followed show yourselves grace said if you make us search for you well throw flashbangs into each room the threat of ruptured eardrums was enough to persuade cavanaugh to emerge into the corridor jamie coming with him i smell smoke grace glanced toward the ashy remnants of the burned sleeve on the floor for light cavanaugh said howd you set fire to the clothing matches grace gave edgar a look of disgust there was enough light spilling through the entrance for cavanaugh to see that the gunmen didnt have the distinctive bulky look that came from wearing kevlar vests under their shirts they wore utility belts with twoway radios beretta pistols extra ammunition and flashbang canisters cavanaugh shifted his gaze toward edgars baggy pants pockets something heavy weighed down the right side presumably one of the pistols that edgar had taken the clip on the emerson knife was secured to the outside of edgars other pocket toss the matches over grace said cavanaugh obeyed what did you do run over them with a car looking disgusted grace picked them up their mutilated appearance making the missing quarter inch of abrasive paper seem normal ive got a computer in the car and access to the internet grace gestured with several computer printouts before the good doctor gets here maybe youd like to refresh your memory the easy way troy donahue the sunlight behind grace allowed her to read from one of the pages tall blond blueeyed teenage heartthrob known for his wooden acting peak of popularitylate fifties early sixties major hits a summer place susan slade parrish rome adventure palm springs weekend do any of those sound familiar all i saw was the box for the video cavanaugh said i have no idea what the movie was about the female costars name was on the box mention some actresses grace frowned at the page connie stevens sandra dee suzanne pleshette stefanie powers sandra dee cavanaugh said knowing he had to keep grace patient by giving her something the one with sandra dee a summer place grace read the plot summary love at a resort town in maine maybe prescott was planning to go to maine she looked at another printout clint eastwood movies you said thriller it definitely wasnt a war movie or a western dirty harry no magnum force the enforcer the dead pool no the eiger sanction play misty for me thunderbolt and lightfoot tightrope no with a rush of emotion cavanaugh suddenly remembered the title of the movie he managed to keep his face blank concealing his reaction youre starting to annoy me the gauntlet the rookie in the line of fire no a perfect world absolute power true crime blood work no definitely annoying me end of list end of discussion the doctorll be here in thirty minutes itll be a pleasure watching him do his magic on you grace turned angrily and left edgar and the armed men followed the concrete door again descended again cavanaugh savored the last moments of light again total darkness surrounded them this time the blackness was so palpable that it seemed to squeeze them jamie sounded as if she was having trouble getting enough air cavanaughs legs were so unsteady he wanted to lean against a wall and sink to the floor he struggled to resist one things in our favor i cant imagine what jamie said they still didnt take our belts his attempt at bravado failed as he felt his way into the room where theyd tried to hide he brushed his shoes along the floor and found where hed dropped his belt give me the sleeves we tore from your blouse what good will that do grace took your matches weve got no way to set fire to the sleeves actually theres another thing in our favor cavanaugh hoped he sounded confident i didnt give grace all the matches he removed one from his jacket and scraped it against the quarterinch of abrasive paper nothing happened jesus maybe i didnt tear off enough of the paper he thought heart pounding he tried it again and this time the match flared providing enough illumination for him to see the near panic on jamies face which the faint light only partially alleviated she pulled the sleeves from her blazer pocket he attached one to his belt buckle and put the match to it as if it were the flickering of their lives they watched the fabric start to burn thirsty she said me too something else to blame adrenaline for my mouths so dry if only i could get a drink of water if only they hadnt removed the plumbing fixtures suddenly even in the dim light cavanaugh saw jamies eyes flash as if she realized something what he asked where would the bathroom have been she moved haltingly along the corridor cavanaughs buckle scraped its echo emphasizing the dark closeness of their confinement as he pulled his belt and the burning cloth what are you thinking she told him maybe he said we might be able to do it but it all depends on water jamie said desperate they checked the rooms along the right side of the corridor finally coming to the nexttolast room where pipes projected from the walls the vestiges of sinks and urinals that had been removed damn it theyre capped jamie said i hoped for valves that could be opened this couldve worked it still can work in the dwindling light from the burning sleeve cavanaugh studied a pipe that was bigger than the others its screwon cap was squareshaped but we dont have a wrench to loosen it take off your belt what good will even as jamie questioned him she took off her belt and gave it to him thankful to have the distraction of doing something cavanaugh lit the end of jamies other sleeve then used its light to examine her belts double layers of leather the grain on one strip going in the opposite direction from the other lets see how strong this really is he put the tip of the belt through the buckle and made a noose then he slipped the noose over the square cap on the pipe and tightened the belt when the leather firmly gripped it he pulled on the belt putting torque on the cap the leather dug into his hands his arms strained his feet had trouble keeping a purchase on the floor the cap wouldnt budge jamie grabbed the belt with him they pulled the cap made a highpitched sound budging a little they braced their feet tugging and suddenly leaned back as the cap twisted freely in a rush cavanaugh released the belt and used his hands to untwist the cap he hoped water would start dripping but even when the cap came fully away the mouth of the pipe was dry theres got to be a main water valve jamie said its turned off where the water comes into the building dragging the burning sleeve cavanaugh followed her to the shadows of the final room on the right there in what was evidently a gutted utility room the flame revealed a large pipe that came up from the floor and connected to a network of smaller pipes leading into a wall the main pipe had a valve jamie turned it but even when it was opened as far as it would go the pipe didnt vibrate with the flow of water nor was there any sound of splashing from the pipe theyd opened in the next room the waters been turned off somewhere else cavanaugh pivoted frantically toward the wall behind him the panel on an electrical breaker box had been removed except for a switch on the upper right which presumably supplied power to the front entrance all the other switches had been removed also various colored wires dangled this place probably uses a well cavanaugh said which needs a pump but the water isnt flowing because the pump isnt getting electricity they shifted toward the wires and tried to figure out which went with which a few moments study made cavanaugh suspect that the wires hung in vague pairs holding two wires by their rubber insulation he joined their exposed tips nothing happened he pressed another two together nothing jamie desperately did the same how much time do we have left less than fifteen minutes shadows thickened as the flame weakened cavanaugh pressed another pair together and saw a spark when they connected but the flow of electricity had no obvious effect on anything around him he separated the wires but bent them back in such a way that hed have no trouble finding them again faster jamie said her raspy breathing echoed when cavanaugh could barely see the wires he was trying to match he took off his jacket and tore his shirt along its seams the chill of the concrete making him shiver after setting fire to a section of his shirt he rushed back to the wires only to hear something droning under the floor and water vibrating through the intake pipe i did it jamie said i found the right pair from down the hall they heard water splashing out of the opened pipe in the bathroom trying to control his emotions cavanaugh noticed an outline on the floor where a furnace had been he focused on hooks projecting from the wall next to the breaker box the hooks must have had something to do with supporting the furnace ducts he realized pressured by time he returned his attention to the wires in the breaker box theyve got to be longer jamie pulled two wires from a gap in the wall stretching them as far as they would go she and cavanaugh bent them back and forth rapidly to create enough friction to break them meanwhile the pump kept droning spewing water from the pipes in the next room as cavanaugh used his teeth to pull the insulation off the tips of each wire the flame got smaller jamie attached another section from cavanaughs shirt and pulled the fire into the corridor i dont see any water on the floor she said in alarm they hurried toward the water splashing into the washroom and found that only the central part of the washrooms floor was covered with it my god theres a drain jamie said she yanked off her blazer and pushed it onto the drain trying to create a plug cavanaugh left the burning cloth in the corridor and hurried in next to her adding his jacket as well pushing it onto the drain tense they watched the water collect feeling lightheaded cavanaugh realized he was holding his breath the plug worked the water began to spread as it reached the entrance to the corridor cavanaugh got to the burning cloth and pulled it back to the utility room he heard a frenzied splashing sound and realized that jamie was kicking water along the corridor trying to make it spread as far and fast as possible at the breaker box he grabbed the wires that hed bent back earlier the ones that had made a spark keeping them separate he extended them to their maximum length from the box and connected them to the wires that he and jamie had taken from the gap in the wall twisting them together the tips reached the floor jamies bare arms flashed in the light from the burning cloth as she appeared at the entrance to the utility room the waters spreading we have to get it to here he ran into the corridor with her and had just enough light to see that the murky floor was covered with a film of water he helped kick it as far as it would go guiding it toward the utility room before it got there he hurried back and raised the wires off the floor keeping them separate suspending them over the hooks next to the breaker box the water entered the utility room jamie get your belt simultaneously cavanaugh separated the burning cloth from his belt and dipped its buckle in the approaching water cooling the metal he put the belts tip through the buckle and cinched it making a circle jamie did the same with hers he looped his belt over a hook so did jamie as the water spread toward the burning cloth near them they waited in silent tension for the light to be extinguished just before the fire made a hissing sound in the last of the light cavanaugh separated the wires that controlled the water pump the underfloor droning stopped so did the splashing the flame went out plunged into darkness again they waited the chill of the water added to that of the concrete cavanaugh shivered harder now that his upper torso was completely exposed in the blackness he listened to jamies nervous breathing he tried to distract her when this is over ill have to teach you about neurolinguistic programming whats that a way of using language to control what youre thinking and feeling when this is over youre doing it to me again making me think well get out of this we will get out of this cavanaugh hoped he sounded confident visualize whats going to happen and what you need to do dont let yourself get surprised by something you havent imagined im visualizing sunlight which youll see very soon the future tense is wonderful isnt it though a rumble from along the corridor indicated that the concrete door was being opened the sound of numerous footsteps came down the steps echoing along the corridor flashlights glared high enough that they didnt reveal the film of water on the floor ive brought your doctor grace said in the utility room cavanaugh and jamie remained quiet where are you grace demanded no response where are you damn it get out here i warned you what would happen if you tried to hide no reply flashbangs you want flashbangs you get grace said fabric rustled cavanaugh guessed that the team was putting on ear protection he felt for jamies hands pressed them over her ears then quickly protected his own ears that would help against flashbangs detonated a distance away but if any were thrown into the utility room the nonlethal concussions would be so great that hands over ears wouldnt relieve the agony in his imagination cavanaugh heard the clatter of a flashbang hitting the floor of one of the rooms a muffled blast compressed the air around him reverberating off the concrete the roar was something he felt as much as heard another distant blast shook him and another coming closer cavanaugh pressed his hands harder against his ears when yet another flashbang detonated jamie leaned against him trembling the blasts were in rooms close enough that cavanaugh could see the fierce glarethe flash of the immobilizing devicereflect off the corridors walls he assumed that grace and her team were shielding their eyes the next roar was even closer the flashlights revealed the shadows of men with submachine guns moving along the corridor as much as cavanaugh could tell grace and her team were at the water their earplugs would prevent them from hearing the faint splash of their footsteps but any second now they would look down and notice what they were standing in in fact they already had when another flashbang didnt go off within the interval cavanaugh expected he eased his hands away from his ears whats all this water grace demanded where the hell did it come from cavanaugh tapped jamies shoulder feeling her respond to the signal theyd agreed on she shoved an arm through where her belt was looped over the hook above her hanging she lifted her shoes out of the water check these last two rooms grace ordered in a rush cavanaugh shoved his right arm through where his belt was looped over a hook he raised his knees hoisting himself off the water the next instant he lifted the wires from the hook where theyd been suspended and dropped them into the water if this doesnt work he thought hed expected to see sparks when the wires struck the water but he saw nothing and immediately knew that he and jamie were doomed im sorry jamie he thought an eerie noise made him frown uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhh it came from the corridor low wavering guttural several similar sounds joined it uuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhh cavanaugh abruptly understood that he was hearing men groan as electricity shot through them crack bang then a clatter submachine guns dropped echoing harshly flashlights fell their glare rolling across the watercovered floor their tight seals preventing them from taking in water and being extinguished uuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh in the grotesque shadows created by the lights pointing along the floor men collapsed their silhouettes twitching in the water the stuttering roar of a submachine gun tortured cavanaughs ears but he couldnt cup his hands over them had to keep his right arm through the belt holding himself above the water as the weapons kept firing bullets ricocheted along the corridor men screamed cavanaugh couldnt tell if a gunman was aiming at an imagined threat or if the electricity jolting through the man had caused him to convulse his finger squeezing the trigger empty cartridge casings hit the water some jangling on top of one another then the submachine gun clicked on empty and another loud clatter indicated that it too had fallen to the floor uuuuuhhhhh the thrashing shadows in the corridor began to subside uh the corridor became eerily quiet dangling by his right hand cavanaugh used his left to raise one of the wires from the water and twist it around the hook interrupting the electrical circuit now he told jamie they dropped to the water when they rushed into the corridor the glare of the lights on the floor revealed ten bodies cavanaugh grabbed a submachine gun and prepared to shoot in case anyone was faking he saw the contorted body of a man in a business suit a doctors valise next to him he saw edgar lying facedown in the water and reached into the mans baggy pants pockets removing the emerson knife and the sig sauer hed expected to find there he gave the handgun to jamie and shoved the knife in his own pocket grace damn it where was grace hurried footsteps directed cavanaughs attention toward the end of the corridor silhouetted by sunlight a figure darted up the steps toward the entrance cavanaugh fired bullets struck the steps but grace had already vanished through the opening ducking to the left evidently she had pressed the remote control on her belt the concrete door began to descend cavanaugh raced toward the steps wondering how the hell grace had survived she must have been standing away from the water perhaps shed been wearing rubbersoled shoes the concrete door sank lower cavanaugh heard jamie charging behind him but all he concentrated on was reaching the steps and lunging up them the gap of light was only two feet high now he dove sideways scraping his bare shoulders and back when he rolled his body and then his shoes cleared the door a moment before it thudded into place in eyestabbing light he caught a glimpse of four startled men as he rolled upward and pulled the trigger muscle memory controlling the length of time he pressed his finger against it tap tap tap three and four rounds at a time burst from the mp one man lurched back blood spurting from his unarmored chest before he could raise his weapon another man did manage to raise his weapon the wallop of bullets into his face deflecting his aim toward the sky as he fired and then dropped the third and fourth men scurried toward the rubble of the collapsed barn at the same time cavanaugh raced toward what remained of the burned mansion he dove behind the remnants of a stone wall just before the two men opened fire bullets ricocheting he hurt his bare chest when he landed on stones but he didnt careall that mattered was surviving killing whoever blocked his way and getting jamie out of there but to open the door he needed the remote control on graces belt where was she cavanaugh hadnt noticed her when hed shot and run for cover shed disappeared to the left of the entrance which was now on cavanaughs right her ford explorer was in that direction was she using it to hide a dark green station wagon presumably the doctors was in front of the explorer grace might be inching along them trying to outflank me cavanaugh thought peering through a gap in the stones he didnt have a vantage point that allowed him to see under the vehicles where the movement of graces shoes might tell him what she was doing likewise the ringing in his ears prevented him from hearing faint sounds that might have warned him of what grace or the two men were up to his heart pounded furiously as he realized that hed landed in a trough that one of the gunmen had made when the assault team had hidden among the rubble to his left were similar troughs where wreckage had been removed he crawled through them over rubble following the length of the collapsed stone wall trying to make as little noise as possible he searched for a gap in the stones a place through which he could study the ruins of the barn and perhaps get a better view of the vehicles to his right he examined the mp in his hands its magazine was capable of holding thirty rounds of mm ammunition he tried to judge how many rounds he had remaining hed fired three bursts hed been trained to release approximately four rounds per burst but perhaps hed fired more assuming hed shot sixteen rounds that left fourteen in the magazineif it had been fully loadedand one in the firing chamber if the gunman had inserted a round there before attaching the magazine be conservative he thought assume youve got only twelve rounds he flicked the selection lever from automatic to the singlefire position he extended the butt from a slot in the mps frame trying to make it aim like a rifle when he raised himself to peer through the gap in the stones he saw movement in the barns rubble to the right and left of the closed door but before he could shoot bullets struck the stones near his head forcing him down his forehead stung liquid trickled from it when he touched his brow his finger came away with blood from where a chunk flying off the stones had grazed him he picked up a charred piece of board and tossed it underhand toward where hed first landed behind the wall he hoped that the clatter would make the gunmen think that hed returned to that position peering quickly through the gap hed just used he saw the man on the right raise his head from cover aiming toward where hed thrown the board cavanaugh fired hitting the mans shoulder knocking him down immediately he ducked below the gap as a volley from over there blasted the area through which hed been peering more chunks of stones flew dust rising he felt little elation that hed hit one of the men the wound hadnt been center of mass it wouldnt have been incapacitating the man was still a threat jamie he thought shell go out of her mind down there maybe some of the gunmen arent dead maybe shell have to fight stop thinking he squirmed farther to the left along the collapsed wall snaking over wreckage scraping his chest more severely he came to the edge of the ruins and realized that the men at the collapsed barn couldnt see him if he stayed low when he shifted along this far side if he could reach the front and creep along to the opposite side hed have a chance of surprising his hunters he would also have a chance of surprising grace if she was behind the explorer and the station wagon to the right of the collapsed barn when cavanaugh reached the front of the wreckage he found the taurus where jamie had parked it not that it did him any good without the ignition key he couldnt start the car unobtrusively enough to be able to use it as a surprise weapon in front the rubble was high enough for him to run in a crouch blood oozed from the scrapes on his chest his tongue felt thick he peered around the next corner seeing the station wagon and the suv near the ruins of the barn their sides were angled toward him concealing what was behind them but from this vantage point he could hug the ground and see under the vehicles beneath the explorer graces sturdy walking shoes were visible near the front tires he saw the cuffs of her khaki slacks she knew enough to crouch behind the engine the only spot where a highpowered bullet couldnt go all the way through then cavanaugh saw movement just above the hood near the windshield blond hair showed as grace raised her head slightly to peer toward the collapsed wall at the back of the mansion the angle of her gaze prevented her from noticing where cavanaugh studied her from the front corner the mp had a range of yards in contrast the explorer was about seventyfive yards away but under the circumstances the distance was considerable cavanaugh wondered if his aim would be accurate enough to hit so small a targetthe top of her head showing above the hoodwith a weapon whose barrel was short and whose sights he hadnt calibrated after everything hed been through his hands felt unsteady his nervous breathing would also be a liability making it difficult for him to keep his arms still if he missed the shot hed have exposed his position all grace and the two men would need to do would be to separate and make a wide circle toward the front catching him in a pincer movement changing his mind he pressed his bare stomach to the ground in this position propping the mp against the dirt he had a better chance of keeping the weapon steady with both eyes open he aligned the front and rear sights keeping them in focus while he aimed under the explorer toward graces shoes and shins although her feet were apart for balance the angle from which he viewed them made them seem together giving him a better target than the top of graces head he held his breath braced his arms and flexed the trigger the crack of the shot was so loud that he couldnt hear the bullets impact but he did hear a scream from behind the explorer staring under the vehicle he saw grace fall to the ground her paincontorted face near one of the suvs front tires to readjust his aim he had to peer farther around the corner grace saw his movement and pointed a handgun under the explorer in his direction he rolled back an instant before a bullet tore away a chunk of burned wood the bastards on this side grace shouted at the front cavanaugh rose to a crouch and hurried along the front of the ruins going back the way hed come toward the left side of the mansion nearly sick with the shock of the fightorflight hormones rushing through him he relied on all his training all his years of combat experience all the nerve that he could muster and charged past the corner a shocked gunman froze having responded to graces shout and rushed from the barn the man was halfway along the left side of the mansion when cavanaugh shot him with two quick bursts tearing the mans chest apart cavanaugh kept charging reached the fallen man verified that he was dead and grabbed the mans weapon he had no idea how much ammunition remained in its magazine but at least it gave him more than he already had carrying both he reached the left rear corner of the mansion the remaining man over there was wounded and wouldnt emerge from cover unless he had a good reason grace was wounded also and could move only by hobbling or crawling she would want to remain behind the explorer until she knew what was going on neither of them had any way to tell the outcome of the shots they had heard logically the man over here would have yelled to them if hed been victorious but if hed missed and was stalking cavanaugh hed have maintained battle silence so the lack of a triumphant shout didnt necessarily mean that grace and her partner would conclude the man over here was dead cavanaugh decided to wait to let them bleed a while longer before he risked showing himself then despite the ringing in his ears he heard a drone frowning he told himself that the sound wasnt possible that it indicated the concrete door was opening but he couldnt imagine how that could be the drone continued jesus had grace used her remote control to open the door was she trying to lure jamie out to use her as a hostage reasoning that the last place either grace or the gunman would look for him was at the very bottom of the corner at ground level he dropped to his chest and peered around a rock squinting toward the ruins of the barn he saw that the concrete door was indeed opening he looked behind him suddenly not trusting his position wondering if grace was raising the door in order to distract him was she hoping to hobble around the wreckage of the mansion and sneak up on him while he concentrated on the barn on keeping jamie from showing herself at the open door after another quick look behind him cavanaugh once more peered around the bottom rock at the corner of the collapsed wall the door was fully open now amid the darkness beyond it something moved jamie dont come out cavanaugh ducked back as he shouted it the next instant gunfire shattered several stones at the mansions corner fragments flew dust spewing some of the shots had been bursts from a submachine gun but others had been single shots from a pistol telling cavanaugh that grace was still behind the explorer do you hear me jamie dont come out this time cavanaughs voice didnt attract shots presumably because grace and the gunman were saving their ammunition i hear you jamies voice was faint im staying where i am if you show yourself theyll shoot you or grab you as a hostage thats why grace opened the door grace didnt raise the door i did what cavanaugh thought those wires you were going to press together the ones you thought might raise the door you were right they do stay down how many are out there grace and one of her men cavanaugh shouted where are they grace is to your left behind the explorer where you saw her park it the mans in the wreckage behind the door to the lab for gods sake dont come out is the man to my right or left he was on your left but he might have moved im telling you dont try to come out im not jamie shouted but ive got an idea when i tell you get ready to shoot whatever youre thinking dont do it its too risky give me twenty seconds what the hell is she going to try cavanaugh wondered wary he looped the strap of his mp over his left shoulder then he gripped the mp that hed taken from the man hed shot his rationale for using the dead mans weapon was that the man wouldnt have risked leaving cover and stalking along the side of the mansion unless hed had an acceptable amount of ammunition but there wasnt time to remove the magazine and make sure cavanaugh backed from the corner that was where his shouts had come from it was where grace and the gunman would expect him to show himself certain that his heart would burst from the rate at which it was pounding he shifted back twenty feet from where hed been there the wreckage remained low enough that if he stood he could shoot over it yet again he glanced warily behind him if grace did decide to try outflanking him how long would it take her to crawl or hobble around the mansion jamie shouted from the open door get ready whatever shes planning it had better work cavanaugh thought count to five jamie shouted now baffled cavanaugh did so one two he set the submachine guns selection lever to semiautomatic fire three four two explosions startled him they came from the direction of the barn christ theyre throwing grenades at the open door cavanaugh thought furious he surged up and fired at the wreckage to the right and the left of the door two more blasts went off the fierce bangs accompanied by eyesearing flashes not grenades cavanaugh realized jamies throwing flashbangs over the back of the door two further detonations shook the rubble smoke rose so did the wounded gunman who clutched his ears and rushed to get away cavanaugh steadied his aim and shot three times the bullets were all aimed at center of mass but while one hit the mans back the other went wild and hit his neck the third missed entirely no matter so much blood flew from the mans neck cavanaugh knew hed bleed to death within seconds hes down cavanaugh shouted to jamie bang bang bright eartorturing explosions on the far side of the barn told cavanaugh that jamie was now throwing flashbangs toward the explorer bang cavanaugh raced toward the front of the mansion and tried to control his frenzied breathing as he peered around its corner then he raced along the front and reached the corner on the right side of the mansion again he checked carefully before he risked showing himself bang even at a distance of seventyfive yards the flashes of the detonations around the explorer were punishing to cavanaughs eyes reasoning that grace must surely be immobilized by them cavanaugh took the chance of racing into the open staying wide of the ruins trying to get a view of the other side of the explorer the drivers door was open he saw grace lurching inside her left leg bleeding he fired at the door but instead of punching through and hitting her the bullet made the walloping sound of a projectile hitting armor grace yanked the door shut her short blond hair and high cheekbones were vivid behind the windshield as she rammed a key into the ignition and started the engine cavanaugh fired at the windshield but only starred it realizing that the glass was bulletresistant he fired again as grace floored the accelerator and steered from behind the station wagon rocketing the explorer toward him he fired a third time starring more glass cavanaugh knew that most bulletresistant glass couldnt withstand five rounds within an eightinch radius after that the glass would disintegrate allowing bullets to penetrate it so he held his ground and fired a fourth time but now grace was racing so close to him that her glacial blue eyes seemed intensely huge when cavanaugh pulled the trigger a fifth time he felt the firing pin click on empty he cursed hurled the weapon at the windshield and dove to the side an instant before grace would have struck him as the explorer roared past throwing up dust he rolled across the dirt feeling the mp strapped to his shoulder dig into his bare skin instead of speeding along the lane toward the road from which cavanaugh had entered the valley grace twisted the steering wheel sharply and curved back in cavanaughs direction surging to his feet he unstrapped the mp from his shoulder but grace was too close for him to have time to shoot he darted to the left grace steered in that direction he darted to the right grace pursued him at the last moment cavanaugh feinted to the left then dove to the right feeling the rush of air from the explorer speeding past him he struck the ground winced and came to his feet expecting grace to turn sharply and come at him again instead the explorer sped toward the rear of the valley as its roar diminished cavanaugh heard something else an approaching rumble gaining in intensity it made a rapid whump whump whump sound a helicopter grace had used her cell phone to call for reinforcements cavanaugh thought then he realized no shed stay if the chopper was one of hers shes trying to get away from whoevers in it cavanaugh ran to the taurus grabbing a rock along the way on recent american cars the steeringwheel locks were sturdy enough that he couldnt break them by pressing his shoes against the steering column and tugging on the wheel as he had when hed rescued prescott from the warehouse now he was forced to yank the unlocked door open unclip the emerson knife from his pocket thumb the blade open and shove it into the ignition slot using the rock to hammer the butt of the knifes handle ramming the tip of the blade solidly into the slot he closed the knifes handle halfway and twisted violently gaining torque from the ninetydegree position of the handle the blades metal was extraordinarily hard designed for this kind of brutal use after one more fierce twist cavanaugh felt the ignition lock break freeing the wheel moving faster he reached under the dashboard and pulled down a hidden radio shack switch box that hed installed when he and jamie had modified the taurus a standard precaution in case they didnt have the ignition key the switch box was connected to the starter wires a press of a button and the engine started the passenger door banged open cavanaugh raised the emerson knife to defend himself only to lower it when jamie dove inside go she yelled go cavanaugh floored the accelerator feeling the tires bite into dirt racing after the explorer as jamie slammed the door cavanaugh saw the explorer disappear among trees ahead have you still got the pistol i took from edgar cavanaugh asked wouldnt be without it jamies breathing was rapid loud roll down your window watch for places where grace might ambush us as the taurus rushed past trees and dense shadowy undergrowth jamie said a lot of choices the lane crested a wooded ridge leaving the valley at the bottom it twisted then straightened ending at a tintersection with a gravel road dust swirling on the right showed where grace had turned cavanaugh veered onto the gravel and hurried after her light filtered through the haze reflecting off it making it harder for him to see he drove as quickly as he could and still have time to stop if an obstacle blocked his way a breeze thinned the dust allowing him to go faster then the air was clear enough for him to see that he approached an intersection with a paved road where the gravel road continued there wasnt any dust cloud grace must have turned right or left onto the pavement but an equal number of dusty tire tracks went each way and made it impossible to follow her trail pick a direction cavanaugh said left jamie said checking for oncoming traffic cavanaugh skidded left onto the pavement and pressed hard on the gas pedal urging the taurus up to a hundred trees and fields became a blur cresting a hill he was forced to reduce speed so he wouldnt be caught by surprise if grace tried to ambush him on the other side at the bottom of the hill he stopped at another intersection here the road was paved in all four directions pick a direction left again jamie said any particular reason not much then left we go at the next paved intersection with the explorer nowhere in view cavanaugh stopped at the side of the road his hands were so tight on the steering wheel that it took him a few moments to unclench them sweating he stared straight ahead next to him jamie trembled just as he trembled you did good back there he finally said jamies voice was hoarse thanks kept cool he felt sick didnt panic wanted to i know the feeling sweating more cavanaugh kept staring straight ahead a neat trick using the flashbangs i was so furious i just told myself i wasnt going to die down there angers a good motivator cavanaughs hand shook as he wiped his gritcovered mouth especially when it comes to dealing with fear brought you a present jamie said oh dazed cavanaugh glanced down next to the sig sauer shed placed on the seat was an equipment belt that she must have removed from one of the dead men in the corridor the belt had a holstered beretta and an extra magazine filled with ammunition thoughtful the way to my loved ones heart who has the other sig grace probably cavanaugh said and the car keys and my cell phone and my wallet with the id karen made for me reach under the seat puzzled cavanaugh did what he was told and held up jamies purse ill be damned the purses zipper remained closed jamie checked inside doesnt look like they got to it yet i still have my wallet and cell phone behind them the sound of the helicopter descended into the valley jamie glanced in that direction cant be reinforcements for grace otherwise she wouldnt have run cavanaugh nodded im betting its john and a team from the bureau jamie looked relieved then lets hurry back and tell them what we know cavanaugh didnt move whats the matter if we dont go back theyll issue arrest warrants for us jamie said hell they probably want to arrest us as it is we took kline away from john and now klines dead so are all those men back there and the doctor weve got to explain what happened cant go back what cant trust the fbi somebody there worked for kline somebody informed against john if i tell what i know i might be helping the wrong people get their hands on prescott but johnll find the informant how long will that take and what if he doesnt i need the antidote for that matter even if john does find the informant even if it is safe to tell the fbi what i know that doesnt solve anything either prescott wont be punished i dont understand the government would protect him sure theyd be appalled by the illegal research prescotts controllers would be quietly and severely punished but not prescott since the weapon exists and the damage has been done the defense department would want to know everything about it just to have it as an option in the name of national security theyd hide him some place comfortable where theyd have access to his information prescott would get a new identity a new life everything he wanted in the first place jamie stared at him whats the matter he asked when we first started this people were after you jamie said they wanted to kill you i figured that if i helped you find whoever was hunting you we could get free of it all we could go back to wyoming we could have our lives back believe me thats exactly what i want with everything in me i want to go back to the way things used to be then why cant we karen duncan chad tracy roberto they wont be prescotts last victims hes paranoid enough that hell kill again and again if he thinks anybodys looking at him wrong if he fears his safetys being threatened he has to be stopped both of them were silent now the only sound was a pickup truck clattering through the intersection ahead youre going to need plausible deniability he finally said what we didnt take kline i did i forced you to go along with me thats your story play the victim you think anybodys going to believe that jamie asked make them believe it get yourself out of this youre telling me go back split up jamie asked you almost got killed because of me i cant let you risk your life anymore im here because i want to be but i cant go after prescott and worry about you ive handled myself very well yes cavanaugh said you have im staying cavanaugh peered down at his unsteady hands another pickup truck clattered through the intersection he nodded so what does that nod mean where does that leave us jamie asked somewhere near west virginia not funny ive run out of jokes cavanaugh studied her grimy arms and blouse then pressed the trunkrelease button their suitcases were back there wed better put on some fresh clothes youre going to need more than fresh clothes jamies intense gaze made him look down at himself he was covered with soot from head to foot his pants were in rags his chest was a chaos of scratches blood and sweat mingled with the soot weve still got some bottled water in the backseat ill wash my face then put on a cap a shirt and pants to hide the rest of this until we reach a motel you reek of cordite jamie said some people think its sexy part six threat reprisal the motel on the outskirts of harrisburg pennsylvania was two hours north far enough that if rutherford ordered a search for them it wasnt likely to be successful especially since rutherford didnt know jamies name or the kind of car they drove harrisburg the state capital had another advantage it was large enough to have numerous videorental stores the clint eastwood movie whose title cavanaugh had remembered but kept secret when grace had read the list of eastwood thrillers wasnt hard to find but the troy donahuesandra dee film was another matter after cavanaugh and jamie checked into the motel they needed to visit almost every one of harrisburgs video stores before they got their hands on a tape of a summer place starcrossed lovers at a resort town in maine jamie read from the back of the vhs box after they returned to the motel cavanaugh put the tape into a player that theyd rented prescott isnt exactly a romantic kind of guy so theres got to be another reason he thinks this movies important maybe grace was right maybe he wanted to move to maine jamie said the tape was so old and worn that it colors were faded and its image had speckles obviously intended for a wide screen the panoramic scenery looked cramped when trimmed to fit a standardsize tv it didnt help that the screen was only twenty inches musics not bad jamie said thats about all that isnt while adults had affairs donahue and dee were warned that their own love was forbidden richard egan acted almost as woodenly as donahue ponderous scenes were punctuated by waves pounding a gorgeous pinerimmed beach interesting house in the movie a low sleek modernistic house occupied a rocky point in a bay made of stone the structure resembled the prow of a ship as waves crashed against its base reminds me of houses by frank lloyd wright jamie said amid soaring music and scenerychewing performances the film mercifully ended cavanaugh pressed the rewind button maine and now for our second feature jamie picked up play misty for me and read what was on the back of the box female stalker pursues disc jockey clint eastwoods directorial debut filmed in his hometown of carmel she studied the picture on the front of the box jessica walter and a knife good slasher movies are my favorite actually its fairly well made i saw it so long ago i barely remember a thing about it but i do recall thinking eastwood did a decent job its nice and tense cant have enough tension jamie said california maine prescott certainly had trouble making up his mind well pop in this beauty jamie said and lets see why prescott likes it so much the movie began with a long overhead helicopter shot that moved along a rugged coastline with waves smashing against rocks and windblown pine trees hugging the bluffs thirty seconds into it cavanaugh and jamie both leaned forward from where they sat on the bed holy shit cavanaugh said a summer place was supposed to take place in maine but it was actually filmed in carmel jamie said they watched raptly as clint eastwood drove his sports car along the craggy coast he and his girlfriend later took long walks along a beach thats the same beach thats in a summer place jamie said the curved shape of the bays so distinctive i cant imagine theres another like it look for the frank lloyd wright house cavanaugh said it never showed up but that didnt matter by the time the movie was over cavanaugh and jamie were convinced play misty for me and a summer place had used the same location what else did you notice when you first met him you mentioned books jamie said about photographyone looked like some kind of sex book and geology and robinson jeffers the harrisburg library had a dark curved glass exterior and a spacious reference area with numerous computer stations cavanaugh and jamie roamed the stacks bringing various volumes to a table in an outoftheway area listen to this jamie whispered the bay at carmelbythesea as the towns really called is at the tip of a huge underwater gorge that rivals the grand canyon geologists are fascinated by the place that explains one of the books cavanaugh said also the towns famous for its writers artists and photographers despite the emphasized word jamie managed to keep her voice low ansel adams lived there so did edward weston i know who adams is but whos you said you thought the photography book prescott had was pornographic it had a kind of sexy name and a nude on the cover passion what could the book have been called forms of passion take a look jamie slid the book across the photographers name was edward weston the cover had been removed but when cavanaugh flipped through the pages he came to the most beautiful nude hed ever seen this was on the cover he said a slender young woman sat with her head bowed her forehead resting on an upraised knee she was naked and yet no private part was exposed her sensuous pose reminded cavanaugh of an earlier photograph of a pepper that looked like two people making love another page showed a magnificent seashell with the same erotic contours passion cavanaugh stared at the photos for everything then cavanaugh came to landscapes of what the book said was point lobos near carmel page after page showed the same beautifully rugged seacoast that had been in a summer place and playmistyfor me is there any doubt prescott was crazy about this area jamie asked a librarian going by didnt seem to notice cavanaughs bruised face but she did give jamie a stare for talking looking apologetic jamie peered down at the books as soon as the librarian was gone she whispered you said prescott had an interest in golf pebble beach is one of the most famous golf courses in the worldits slightly north of carmel you said he had a gourmets taste for food according to this carmel has more great restaurants per block than just about anywhere to nail down the connection all we need to do is figure out how robinson jeffers fits in ive already done that cavanaugh slid his notes across to her jeffers and his wife una visited carmel in and were so struck by the area that they stayed there the rest of their lives jeffers bought land hauled chunks of granite from the beach and spent years building a stone house and a fortyfoot tower he called the place tor house after some rock formations in england he and una died there cavanaugh showed her a book of jefferss poems drawing attention to two lines i built her a tower when i was young sometime she will die prescott and i discussed those lines about the tower when i first met him but i had no idea what they referred to cavanaugh said now you do now i do they drove because of increased security at airports due to terrorist threats cavanaugh was leery about trying to get to carmel by air at the numerous checkpoints he would have had to show a picture id but edgar had taken the fake drivers license and credit cards that karen had created for him moreover rutherford and the fbi presumably had an alert out for persons resembling jamie and him everything consideredthe ease of traveling with weapons was another factordriving had a lot to recommend it plus it gave cavanaugh a further chance to heal to passing drivers the taurus seemed just another car on the road with an ordinary couple inside although injuries to the mans face indicated that he had recently been in some sort of accident those injuries probably explained why the man was letting his beard grow interstate took them through ohio indiana illinois and iowa in nebraska studying the flat open countryside cavanaugh said reminds me of oklahoma oh i spent a couple of years there as a kid curious jamie glanced at him my father had the bad luck to drill oil wells after the boom was over he hesitated i had a dog nothing fancy a mutt about the size of a miniature collie jamie studied him waiting for him to continue my dad and mom and i moved around a lot while my dad looked for work sometimes the only job he could get was the most dangerous once when i was a kid i saw him put out an oilwell fire he wore a suit that made him look like an astronaut he used a bulldozer and dynamite afterward he got drunk he did that a lot he came home that night and argued with my mom when i tried to keep him from hitting her he hit me then my dog starting barking so my dad showed everybody who was boss and kicked the dog to death the only sounds became the drone of the engine and the hum of the tires my mom left him after that cavanaugh said it took a lot of courage for her to face up to his anger she and i were even poorer than when wed been with him but somehow she made do found a decent man even managed to send me to pretty good schools i think my mom and my stepfather expected id be a lawyer or something but i had too much anger in me i wanted to get even for all the beatup moms and kickedtodeath dogs in the world so i joined the army and went through specialoperations training i had plenty of chances to put terrorists and other bullies out of business but i realized i eventually had to plan ahead theres not much a specialops soldier can do with his skills in civilian life become a mercenary work for the cia join law enforcement or get into private security when one of my former delta force instructors offered me a job as a protector i jumped at it i guess its not hard to understand why ive got a thing about victims im still trying to help my mother im still trying to protect my dog jamie finally spoke thats the longest ive ever heard you talk about your past in fact its one of the few times youve ever talked about your past prescott pretended to be a victim and turned out to be a bully because of him now im afraid of bullies i wont let him get away with it driving through wyoming neither of them commented when they passed an exit that would have taken them north to the teton range to jackson hole and their home after four days interstate brought them to san francisco they followed the pacific coast highway south to carmel and spent the night in a motel but cavanaugh had trouble sleeping too preoccupied with what needed to be done where do you want to look first jamie asked the next morning over a ham and cheese omelette in the motels diner cavanaugh had only coffee how can you eat so much and stay so thin ive got a high metabolism besides when im worried i need to eat were safe for the moment thats not what i mean they were at a corner table their backs to a wall the nearest tables were empty a television droned behind the counter even so she lowered her voice youre not being hunted any longer this isnt following orders in combat this isnt selfdefense it isnt protecting a client youre the hunter now if you get what you want im worried about how itll change you prescott raised a similar issue jamie looked puzzled after i rescued him from the warehouse we nearly got trapped at a shopping mall the team chasing us left a car outside i managed to sneak up on it and shout to its driver to run away the driver was too startled to move i had to shoot through the cars roof before he got his legs to work later prescott asked me why i hadnt just killed the man and what did you answer that the man hadnt given me a reason that i was a protector not a jamie didnt need to say anything further to make her point i wonder if prescotts counting on that cavanaugh said bitterly he cant be sure i died in the fire at karens house i wonder if the son of a bitch is betting that my personalitys essentially defensive that i wont come after him for betraying me and my friends jamie stayed silent hell have changed his appearance cavanaugh said hell probably wear glasses now hes had enough time to grow a mustache or a beard he might even have had some plastic surgery his heaviness will be hard to disguise though troubled jamie started eating her omelette again cavanaugh glanced at the television behind the counter a commercial for a weightlosing product showed before and after photographs of a formerly bulky man who was now amazingly thin he turned toward jamie when i first met prescott he had shelves of the most carbohydrateheavy calorierich foods imaginable macaroni and cheese lasagna ravioli potato chips candy bars chocolates classic coke that would put the pounds on all right suppose he went on a crash diet jamie looked up its been almost three weeks since i last saw him cavanaugh said if he starves himself if he drinks tons of water to flush his system a man as determined as prescott jamie nodded it wouldnt be healthy but i bet he could lose a pound or two a day jesus cavanaugh said at that rate hed soon be unrecognizable but even with that beard youre trying to grow to disguise your appearance youll be very recognizable jamie said prescott could blend with a crowd and see you coming not you though cavanaugh said what do you mean he doesnt know youre with me he could look straight at you and not be aware youre hunting him hunting him is what youre doing jamie said ocean avenue was the only carmel street that went directly from the highway down to the water steep and several blocks long it was separated by a median of shrubs and sheltering trees quaint shops and relaxedlooking tourists flanked it while jamie drove cavanaugh scanned the people on the sidewalk wondering if hed get lucky and see prescott it didnt happen at the bottom of the hill they came to waves pounding a picturepostcard milelong crescentshaped beach of amazingly white sand sections of bedrock protruded cypresses spread fernlike branches two surfers in wet suits rode the whitecaps dogs frolicked through the waves while their owners strolled behind them gulls soared but cavanaughs attention was focused on the people along the beach none of whom reminded him of prescott jamie steered left and followed a scenic road along the water rustic homes were enclosed by trees some of which were monterey pines their guidebook said while others showed the distinctive twisted trunks of windcontorted live oaks jamie pointed toward an outcrop on the right theres the house from a summer place it still reminded cavanaugh of the prow of a ship but the constant crashing of waves had not been kind to it looks deserted he said giving it only a moments notice before continuing to concentrate on people walking along the beach or the side of the road prescott wasnt any of them they stopped on a quiet narrow treelined street that hadnt existed when robinson jeffers and una had settled in carmel after walking up a brick driveway they opened a wooden gate and entered a compound cavanaugh had read so much about the place about the gauntcheeked lanky irishmans epic struggle to build it that hed expected something on that epic scale instead he was surprised by how intimate it felt colorful flowers and shrubs reminded him of an english rural garden on the left was the fortyfoothigh stone structure that jeffers had called hawk tower with its chimney staircase battlement and turrets to the right was the low stone house with its gently sloped shingled roof and stone chimney a brick walkway led to a door where an elderly gentleman explained that he worked for the foundation that maintained the property would you care for a tour he asked very much have you been in an accident the whitehaired man asked sympathetically noticing cavanaughs face a fall im taking some time off from work recuperating carmel is a fine place to do that inside the rooms that jeffers had painstakingly built were small and yet somehow spacious from the weight of the structure the air felt compressed a slight chill came off the paneled walls in the living room cavanaugh studied the stone fireplace on the right and the piano in the far corner windows provided a view of the ocean the guide took them through the guest room kitchen and bathroom on the main floor and the two attic bedrooms one of which jeffers had used for writing robin as we liked to call him built the house on a small scale the elderly man explained to withstand ocean storms he and una had twin sons and you can imagine how much they all loved one another for them to be able to live happily in such cramped and isolated circumstances they deliberately didnt have electricity installed until after theyd lived here thirty years cavanaugh felt a curious tightening in his throat notice the poetry that robin etched into this beam the guide said theyre not his words however theyre from one of his favorite works spensers faerie queene sleepe after toyle port after stormie seas ease after warre death after life does greatly please now cavanaugh felt hollow if youll follow me to hawk tower the elderly man said considering jefferss somber themes of human frailty as opposed to the abiding strength of nature cavanaugh was surprised by the humor that jeffers had put into the tower intended as a retreat for una and a playhouse for his sons it had a dungeon and a secret interior staircase in which the children could hide from a lookout on top and from several narrow windows the sea was always in view una died in robin in she from cancer he from a variety of ailments the guide said robin had bad lungs and hardened arteries from smoking but since he never recovered from unas death ive always assumed that what really killed him was a broken heart she was sixtysix he was seventyfive still too young to go some would say and yet what a full life i dont tell this to the children whose teachers bring them here for tours but ill tell you in their youth at night robin and una would send their children up to sleep in one of the attic bedrooms then they wouldthe elderly man hesitated only slightlymake love in the guest room downstairs before going up to the other attic bedroom the bed that they made love in is the bed that they each later waited to die in their ashes are buried together in that corner of the garden on the street car doors were opened and shut cavanaugh looked past the flowers and the wooden fence toward a family getting out of a van here are some samples of robins verses the guide gave cavanaugh and jamie a few photocopies if you have any questions actually i do cavanaugh glanced toward the approaching family satisfying himself that the father wasnt prescott but its not about robinson jeffers the guide nodded and waited im looking for someone im almost certain he came here recently hes a robinson jeffers fanatic the guide nodded again as if it was only reasonable that everyone should be a robinson jeffers fanatic his names daniel prescott cavanaugh doubted very much that prescott would use his real name but there was no harm in trying doesnt ring any bells hes in his early forties around six feet tall wears glasses he has a mustache but he was thinking about growing it into a beard cavanaugh wanted to cover several possibilities sorry i cant help you the guide said that description could fit a lot of men i see so many people they become a blur sure he was also pretty overweight under a doctors orders to drop a lot of pounds have you seen anybody in his forties who looks as if he lost a good deal of weight recently how would i know loose skin around the face and especially under the chin that doesnt ring any bells either but if i do see somebody like that do you want me to give him a message for you no cavanaugh said the truth is im a private detective and im trying to find him the guides eyes widened hes got three wives and twelve kids when he gets tired of his domestic arrangements he runs changes his name doesnt pay child support a real sleazebag we think he moved to the carmel area and plans to start yet another family lord knows when hell abandon his next wife ive been hired to find him and get him to accept some responsibility for his actions the joke is hes a fanatic about robinson jeffers but he never learned a thing about the devotion jeffers wrote about in his poetry the guide looked troubled that anybody could fail to learn the truth about jefferss work if this joker comes by try to notice his license plate number or get a name from him or something cavanaugh said dont make him suspicious though ill be as subtle as possible and for heavens sake dont tell him im around wouldnt dream of it ill get him cavanaugh said i certainly hope so pebble beach was just to the north they took a roundabout route through carmels sleepy streets always on the lookout for anyone who even remotely resembled prescott no one did at a toll gate jamie paid to get onto the areas famous mile drive a picturesque route that bordered the extensive golf course allowing a view of its greens ponds sand traps and the ocean in the background deer roamed freely cypresses and monterey pines flanked multimilliondollar properties cavanaugh ignored it all watching for prescott at pebble beachs lodge jamie drove through the entrance and parked in an outoftheway spot from where cavanaugh could watch guests arriving and departing then she went inside only to come back ten minutes later looking puzzled whats the matter cavanaugh asked if prescott had visions of playing golf at pebble beach all the time he was in for a big surprise unless youve got influence you need to make an appointment to play here a year in advance a year and if youre with a group its two years if youre right and hed been planning this for a long time he might have made an appointment quite a while ago somehow finding a way to keep his controllers from knowing what hed done a big risk cavanaugh said and he wouldnt have known his new name back then he wouldnt have had a credit card to go with it to reserve the appointment so unless he found a way to get influence here which is hard to do in a couple of weeks jamie said you can come back in about a year and see if you recognize him i had in mind a little quicker timetable cavanaugh said there are at least a dozen golf courses in the area some of them might not have as long a waiting list what did you plan to do go from one course to the next find a spot near the links and use binoculars to watch the players in case someone who reminds you of prescott shows up if thats what it takes a lot of time too many chances to miss him the fbi has enough personnel to watch all the golf courses simultaneously no fbi cavanaugh said they also have the resources to run background checks on guests who havent played here before jamie said no fbi cavanaugh repeated sheltered by a cypress cavanaugh sat at the northeast rim of carmels beach close to where the shore rose to the grass of the pebble beach links he was far enough inland that he blended with the trees and shrubs behind him the air was balmy the afternoon sun reflecting so brightly off the water that he had to wear sunglasses all roads lead to rome jamie asked and everybody in the area ends up going to carmels famous beach as much as the golf courses and mile drive this is the big attraction cavanaugh studied the long crescent of white sand hundreds of people were on it reading in beach chairs splashing in the surf strolling jogging or tossing frisbees to dogs i cant imagine that prescott would live in the area and not come down here at first hed be apprehensive about showing himself hed probably stay close to wherever hes living but eventually hed begin to loosen up he might even come down here for exercise hell for all i know he got himself a dog the fbi could check everybody who recently bought property around here jamie said cavanaugh continued watching the people on the beach its just a thought jamie said i keep seeing roberto with his head beaten in duncan with his face full of bullet holes karen literally scared to death in her wheelchair the government might not be as lenient with prescott as you think instead of responding cavanaugh glanced down at a map of the shops in town the big bookstore is in the carmel mall we could keep a watch on the place since prescott likes books theres a good chance hed eventually show up there unless he buys books off the internet theres nothing like a real bookstore though in that case he might decide to make the short drive north to monterey jamie said cavanaugh gave her a look just trying to investigate alternatives she said which brings us back to sitting here on the beach and watching for him fine with me ill get a beach chair and a book i can use the rest jamie said after dark well stake out the best restaurants and see if he shows up i was sort of hoping we could eat in those restaurants not watch them given how little hes probably eating these days hell want the small portions he allows himself to be exquisite only the top two or three restaurants in town will be acceptable to him unless he eats at home cavanaugh gave her another look a jogger sprinted to their end of the beach turned and ran back in the opposite direction weight loss jamie said you thought of something im going to hate myself for being honest itll take more than dieting for prescott to lose weight fast hell need exercise hours and hours of it cavanaugh waited in an art gallery while jamie found a break in traffic and crossed to the opposite side where a walkway led to what their map indicated was a warren of shops in the center of a block theyd learned that one of the exercise clubs they wanted to check was on the second floor of a building over there affiliated with a nearby hotel the time was now although there wasnt any guarantee that prescott would use an exercise club let alone that particular club at that particular moment cavanaugh couldnt risk entering just in case prescott might in fact be present because prescott didnt know jamie existed the safer course was for her to go in alone and look around if no one aroused her suspicion she was to tell an instructor that she was writing a healthmagazine article about overweight people whod lost a remarkable amount of weight in a short time thanks to their determination then shed ask if any of the clubs members fit that description pretending to appreciate the gallerys paintings cavanaugh often glanced through the front window toward the other side of the street the lateafternoon sun put some of the doorways in shadow as tourists went in and out of the mews over there he checked his watch then feigned interest in more of the paintings thirty minutes later he was still pretending to be interested in the paintings he stepped outside and crossed the street pots of brightly colored flowers flanked the mewss entrance beyond them shifting among tourists he passed a walkway on his right according to what he and jamie had learned the exercise club would be along the next walkway on the right he turned a corner passed more flowers and came to steps that led up to the second floor a sign read the fitness clinic upstairs he scanned the lobby and the long bright exercise room beyond it jamie was nowhere in view staying to the side of the lobby he carefully assessed the people working the various machines none of them reminded him of prescott amid the hum of treadmills and the clank of weights he approached a muscular man in tight shorts and a tshirt who stood behind a counter im supposed to meet my wife here but im late cavanaugh said do you know if shes still around tall thin auburn hair goodlooking the instructor frowned is your name cavanaugh why is something wrong man im real sorry about what happened sorry after your wife fainted her two friends told me shes got some kind of low blood pressure problem cavanaughs hands and feet felt numb i wanted to call an ambulance the instructor said but they said shed had fainting spells a couple of times before nothing lifethreatening something about her electrolytes being low cavanaughs stomach turned to ice so i got them a bottle of gatorade from the machine over there the instructor said they gave her a couple of sips and helped her stand she was woozy but she could walk sort of if somebody put an arm around her friends cavanaugh could barely speak two women who came in behind her a good thing there were two of them the one with the crutches couldnt have handled your wife all by herself crutches the lobby seemed to waver because of a cast on one leg she said she knew youd be worried so she left a message for you the instructor reached under the counter and set down an envelope cavanaughs fingers didnt want to work as he fumbled to open it the neatly handprinted note inside made him want to scream tor house eight tomorrow morning grace cavanaugh thought he struggled to keep control despite the weakness in his legs and arms he drove at random through the area going around blocks making uturns and heading back in the direction from which hed just come he timed traffic lights so he got through them just before they turned red using every technique he could think of to make sure he wasnt followed cursing he realized that grace had made the connection between a summer place and carmel with no other direction in which to go she was searching the area as he and jamie had been doing sometime during the day their paths had crossed perhaps at tor house grace didnt know about prescotts fascination with robinson jeffers but that didnt matter tor house was one of the local attractions and had to be investigated perhaps grace had been approaching it when shed seen cavanaugh and jamie get in their car and drive away that would explain graces choice for a meeting place tomorrow or had it been on mile drive or at pebble beachs lodge or had grace seen cavanaugh through binoculars while she scanned carmels beach this much was certain grace had followed him had taken her chance to grab jamie and was probably following cavanaugh now inhaling sharply he realized that while hed been away from the taurus grace might have planted a location transmitter in the car making it easy for her to follow at a distance cavanaugh immediately stopped at a gas station and checked the obvious hiding places in and under the car he used a pay phone to call information and get the numbers for radio shack stores in the area oneto the north in montereywas open until nine oclock he discovered after asking directions about how to get there he drove the seven miles along highway as fast as he could without breaking the speed limit using an fm receiver that he purchased at the store he walked around the taurus several times slowly changing stations waiting to hear the beep beep beep of the location transmitter it would be set to one of the unused fm bands in the area on graces end the loudness or softness of the signal would tell her if cavanaugh was near or far but if grace had managed to get something more sophisticated something that used ultrasonic transmissions cavanaugh couldnt hope to find a comparably sophisticated device at radio shack to detect it after an hour in which he failed to discover a transmitter he got back in the taurus and resumed his evasive driving frequently checking his rearview mirror to see if any headlights took the same direction he did at last fatigue and frustration wore him down he returned to the motel room that he and jamie had rented grace might use chemicals to make jamie tell her the name of the place but as much as cavanaugh was tempted to spend the night somewhere else he couldnt let himself if jamie escaped she would phone the room or return to it looking for him he kept the lights out wedged the bureau against the door and sat on the floor in the corner next to the front window his knees drawn to his chest his pistol in his hand not daring to sleep ready to shoot if anybody crashed through fog made the morning like twilight arriving at am an hour early he parked a block away from tor house he shut off the headlights the windshield wipers and the engine then stepped out into the fog the cars heater had done little to warm him now the chill dampness made him tremble wanting to button his sport coat against the cold but needing to keep it open so he could draw his pistol he forced himself to move the fog thickened shadows deepening the echo of his footsteps made him shift to the side of the road where fallen pine needles provided a cushion as he approached the street on which tor house was located he wasnt sure what he hoped to accomplish by arriving early the fog prevented him from identifying any ambush sites what am i supposed to do when grace shows up he wondered shoot hope to wound her try to force her to tell me where jamie is grace wont let it be that easy and if this is an ambush she could just as easily shoot me pausing trying to assess the shadows of trees shrubs and houses before him cavanaugh realized that he should have listened to jamie and not gone after prescott then she wouldnt be missing and he wouldnt be standing here in the fog as afraid as hed ever been in his life no longer afraid for himself afraid for jamie he had difficulty making his legs work if in the past weeks anger had helped him to offset fear the need to protect jamie now proved to be an even greater force during the night hed considered doing what jamie had wanted and asking the fbi for help but with no time to coordinate a plan with the risk of a hastily assembled hostagerescue team giving itself away there was every chance that grace would have sensed the danger and not shown up destroying cavanaughs potentially single chance to save jamie as he passed murky trees and spectral homes shifting closer to where he estimated tor house was the fog chilled him to the core a sensation he would not have thought possible given the searing heat in his stomach because no one lived in tor house he was tempted to hide somewhere on the grounds possibly in hawk tower and hope that the fog would thin in an hour allowing him to watch graces approach for all i know grace is already hiding on the grounds he thought maybe shes in the tower bupbup the sound made cavanaughs heart lurch he stopped halfway through the fogshrouded intersection bupbup the sound came closer bupbup seeing motion in the fog cavanaugh drew his pistol bupbup a silhouette appeared at the edge of the fog the noises stopped in the distance the surf pounded you got here an hour early huh a voice asked graces trying for an advantage how come im not surprised cavanaugh couldnt speak im stepping closer grace said id appreciate it if you dont shoot me again bupbup graces tall trim silhouette emerged from the fog again she had a pseudomilitary look khaki pants a matching tuckin sweater and a photographers jacket the kind with numerous loops and pockets good for concealing a weapon but what cavanaugh noticed most were the crutches she held under her armpits the rubber pads on the bottom accounted for the noise hed heard on the pavement a cast covered her lower left leg a good thing its the left one otherwise id have trouble driving care to autograph the cast x marks the spot where you shot me again cavanaugh couldnt answer maybe later grace said after we finish our business the fog drifted around her short blond hair creating the illusion that the fog emanated from it her highcheekboned face might have been attractive if her expression hadnt been so disagreeable she frowned at the beretta in cavanaughs hand he holstered it somewhere in the fog a door banged lets go down to the beach before we wake the neighbors grace said she swung her feet forward set them down and moved the crutches one landed slightly later than the other bupbup shooting me is something i can understand she said but forcing me to watch all those troy donahue movies is unforgivable bupbup i couldnt tell if you were lying that the movie also starred sandra dee so i had to suffer through donahues greatest hits rome adventure with so many terrorist threats against americans in foreign countries someone as suspicious as prescott wouldnt go to europe for sure the tobacco farms in parrish arent prescotts thing even with all the sexstarved women the movie expects us to believe lurk among the tobacco plants palm springs weekend it has the golf course prescott wants but because he built his lab in a lush virginia valley i couldnt imagine him living in a desert that left a summer place and that amazing beach which turned out not to be in maine at all the fog parted enough to reveal that cavanaugh and grace had reached the scenic drive above the surf cold sweat beaded cavanaughs face but to find that out grace said i had to watch every clint eastwood thriller i could get my hands on as much as i enjoy watching clint shoot bad guys a steady diet of it can be a little much after a couple of days im not sure ill ever be able to make myself go to another movie of his thats something else i blame you for where did you spot us i concentrated on prescotts interest in golf i knew sooner or later youd look for him where every golfer dreams of playing pebble beach yesterday you showed up there cavanaugh didnt respond for a moment the surf kept pounding shit he said then i waited for my chance how did you manage to subdue jennifer spare me the disinformation the id in her purse says her real name is jamie i called in a favor from a friend my only friend i might add thanks to you the justice department is investigating prescotts lab and everybody associated with it at the moment my controllers would prefer that prescott and i both didnt exist my friend gave jamie a touch of this grace showed cavanaugh a small spray container it was sealed in a plastic bag the guy behind the counter seemed relieved that we got jamie out of there fainting isnt the best advertisement for an exercise club my crutches added sympathy nobody suspects that a woman with crutches is anything but a victim it seemed to cavanaugh that his heart pounded louder than the surf is jamie safe as much as can be expected but whether shes going to be depends on you have you had enough time to think about how much you miss her are you ready to do what youre told temples throbbing cavanaugh waited for her to explain i need prescott she said its the only way to keep my controllers from considering me a liability if i can get him if i can complete my assignment and deliver proof that hes dead they might trust me again enough that theyll let me disappear on my terms rather than theirs cavanaugh felt sick youre going to get him for me grace said you followed us around the area isnt it obvious i dont know where he is damn it i dont have any better idea of where he is than you do but youve got two good legs and because of you i dont if you want jamie back find him grace said find him by this time tomorrow tomorrow thats how much time youve got thats how much time ive got if the situation with prescott isnt settled by tomorrow my controllers will be so panicked so distrustful of me ill never be able to regain their confidence find him heres my cellphone number grace handed cavanaugh a piece of paper you want me to bring him to you bring him to me hell no i want you to kill him then show me the body cavanaugh couldnt help thinking that setting out to kill prescott was what had caused this mess here grace said maybe thisll help she gave him the sealed plastic bag containing the spray container that had made jamie faint it lasts a couple of hours she said the chemical works via skin contact be sure you wear a latex glove when you administer it as cavanaugh put the bag in his jacket pocket she added if i dont hear from you by this time tomorrow morning the next thing youll get from me will be jamies corpse they stared at each other the surf roared grace stepped into the gloom as the sound of her crutches receded the fog became colder shaking cavanaugh wanted to follow her in the hope that shed lead him to where jamie was being held but trying to follow grace on foot would be useless once she got in her car and drove away even if he managed to identify the make of the car and get a license number he didnt have a way to trace it moreover he had to assume that grace might have rented a car and would never be associated with it again the alternative was to hurry to the taurus and drive back to this street on the unlikely chance that grace would not yet have reached her car but in the fog hed be forced to use his headlights she was bound to see them if she felt he was a threat she might decide to cut her losses kill jamie and do her best to disappear no he thought i have to find prescott and then he wondered can i depend on grace to keep her word and let jamie go bupbup the sound of the crutches became fainter in the fog the dim headlights of an indistinct car swept past him on the scenic drive the cars engine became a murmur as the vehicle stopped a door was opened and then slammed shut the sound of the car receded into the distance he raced up the fogchoked street toward where hed left the taurus kill prescott he thought no way ive got to keep him alive thats my only hope of getting jamie back but first god help me i need to find him this is rutherford the deep voice said outside a gas station cavanaugh clutched a pay phone do you still hate chinese food rutherford hesitated only a moment that was quite a war zone you left us selfdefense youd be a lot more convincing if youd stuck around to explain what happened do you have any idea how many agents are looking for you how many laws youve broken i dont suppose youd like to tell me where youve been be glad to since your caller id system will tell you anyhow carmel nice to have the leisure for a vacation rutherfords voice thickened with sarcasm someday ill take oneseveral voices spoke chaotically in the backgroundwhen im not up to my ears helping investigate prescott and his lab the justice department thinks its identified prescotts military controllers but with the lab destroyed and prescott missing theres no way to connect them with the lab or to prove it was manufacturing an unsanctioned biochemical weapon the same goes for proving the weapon was tested illegally on civilians and military personnel maybe i can help get the proof cavanaugh said earlier in the week you had the chance to stick around and do that but you bugged out ive had a change of heart he gripped the phone with such force that his fingers ached how do you explain this miraculous turnaround my wifes missing trying to keep his voice steady cavanaugh explained what had happened to jamie and what he needed to do to get her back will you work with me on finding prescott and using him as bait work with you hey you wouldnt include us before so why should we include you now because thats what itll take for me to tell you where to look in carmel i already figured that much i can give you a lot more focus than that but listen to me if this isnt done right shell be killed the voices in the background presumably an office were all cavanaugh heard for several moments as rutherford thought about it so whats the right way rutherford finally asked check all the golf courses in the carmelmonterey area get the name of every golfer who contacted them within the past three weeks to make an appointment to play but that could be thousands then talk to all the realtors in this area get the names of everybody who bought or leased property around here in the past three weeks if prescott leased he might have done it through someone other than a realtor but weve got to start somewhere compare those names to the golf lists look for the common denominators rutherford became briefly silent again a lot of people to talk to thisll take time i dont have time this afternoon john ill call you back this afternoon he almost slammed the phones handset down in helplessness as he ran toward the car he couldnt help thinking that phoning rutherford was exactly what jamie had wanted him to do in the first place bob bannister cavanaugh extended his right hand in greeting vic mcqueen the instructor put a lot of manly sincerity and strength into his handshake cavanaugh let vic crush his fingers for a few seconds and then withdrew them i write for a new fitness magazine called our bodies our health its based in los angeles but thanks to email and the internet i didnt have to move from around here vic nodded in sympathy with anyone who might have been forced to leave the clean air of the carmel valley for the smog of la my editors are pretty wild about an idea i suggested cavanaugh said i want to write an article about how quickly people can get into shape if theyre really determined vic cocked his head in interest they sat across from each other in an office where shelves supported various fitness trophies and the walls had autographed photographs of vic with other wellbuilt incredibly healthylooking people in skimpy tshirts presumably celebrities in their field im talking about worst cases cavanaugh said people who huff and puff crossing a room whore overweight enough that they look like coronaries ready to happen an article that shows it doesnt matter what kind of wreck a person is with the proper motivation diet and instruction that person can get in shape can dramatically change his or her life in a relatively short time not the six months or a year you normally read about for people in really bad shape six months or a year is an eternity they dont want to imagine suffering for months and months they want quicker results whats that joke the trouble with instant gratification is it takes too long vic frowned how quick are you talking about a month i want to know if its possible to take a guy whos really overweight put him on a healthy lean diet teach him how to work the machines watch over him encourage him get him coming in here several hours each day start low and build his stamina vary his exercisescould he lose a lot of pounds in a month and start to look like you like me in a month hell no not like me but could he look dramatically in better shape itd be dangerous so is being a physical wreck cavanaugh said what i want to write is a before and after kind of article i want to show that a health club like this can work wonders in a very short time the hook for the piece is a person doesnt have to be patient to be fit as long as theres motivation vic debated with himself might work as long as you pointed out the risks of going too fast ill have you read the article before i send it in that way you can make sure ive got it right maybe we can get some photographs of you and a couple of the miracle cases youve worked with photographs of me sure and what about your club members do any of them fit the profile well we had a guy in here six months ago who i had in mind somebody who started recently so i can get pictures of him as he goes through the process nobody at the moment vic looked crestfallen does that mean you wont put me and the club in the article most of our members are in terrific condition from time to time we get remedial cases but not in the past three weeks we do wonders for people if they give us the chance but not in the past three weeks i might have just the guy the nordicgod fitness instructor said cavanaugh concealed his reaction this was the tenth exercise club hed visited having exhausted carmel pacific grove and monterey he was now ten miles to the east in the community of seaside on monterey bay near the former fort ord military facility working to seem calm cavanaugh poised his pen over his notepad and said really his names joshua carter not josh joshua hes very particular about that came in herethe instructor thought a momenta little under three weeks ago i remember because he looked so out of condition i doubted hed stick to the program but hes been coming here every afternoon since then i mean every afternoon stays four hours at the start i thought he was going to kill himself drop dead on a treadmill or one of the weight machines but he paces himself works at a steady rate doesnt overdo or strain afterward he sits in the sauna and sweats off more pounds cavanaugh somehow managed to keep his hand steady as he wrote on the notepad all the while his heart was on overdrive sounds like hed be perfect for my article only trouble is youre a little late for the photographs late hes so determined so strict about his workout and his diet he looks different from when he came in i almost didnt recognize him when i returned from a threeday camping trip i couldnt get over the rate at which hes improving himself the only before pictures youll get are ones he might have at his house well if he doesnt have any photos im wasting my time what are his phone number and address so i can ask cavanaugh phrased the question in positive terms that programmed the instructor to act upon it lets have a look the instructor pressed keys on a computer keyboard seventyeight vista linda thats one of those new streets that got built after the city took over the fort ord golf course the instructor wrote down the phone number you know something bothers me here ive got to be honest oh tensing cavanaugh wondered if the instructor had suddenly suspected he wasnt a magazine writer the more i think about it joshua might not be right for your article hes getting in shape so rapidly its not natural i sometimes wonder if its not just his determination and his diet and the help were giving him what do you mean cavanaugh anticipated the answer but made the pretense of a frown well i dont want to get you in trouble with your magazine if you write this article and they print it and down the road somebody finds out a lot of the difference joshua made in his body is due to steroids all that talk about weight lifters and professional football players using them the steroid scandals in the olympics the rumors about some of those women tennis players using them it gives the fitness industry a bad name some people look at me at all these muscles and say sure if you take steroids anybody can look like that i swear to god ive never taken steroids in my life they cause heart attacks and strokes theyre the opposite of every health principle that got me into this business steroids would be in keeping with prescotts biochemical background cavanaugh thought did you ask joshua about it he was shocked at the question he swore he had nothing to do with that junk but cavanaugh asked part of me cant imagine how else he could make such a quick difference in his body when i meet him if he agrees to help me ill make a point of asking him whats he look like around six feet tall early forties still a little puffy but not much hes getting more trim and solid all the time one of the reasons i didnt recognize him is while i was away camping he got his scalp shaved hes growing a goatee the reference made cavanaugh think of robertos goatee and that in turn made him think of robertos bashedin skull sounds like hes photogenic great for the article cavanaugh said with everything in him he wanted to see prescotts skull bashed in but he had to repress his anger getting jamie was all that mattered but to get her to force grace to return her he had to keep prescott alive what time does he usually come in around one cavanaugh glanced at his watch checking so many health clubs had consumed the morning the time was now time he didnt have much time joshua must have a night job or something if hes got so many free afternoons night job i dont think hes got any job the instructor said i dont understand he dresses real well has a gold watch a piaget or something like that i know its expensive because when he joined the club he made a big deal about whether the lockers were secure drives a brandnew porsche not a boxter a carrera lives on a fancy street i get the feeling hes got so much money he doesnt need to work a gold watch cavanaugh thought a porsche didnt prescott remember what told him about keeping a low profile money im sorry to hear that cavanaugh said what do you mean rich people are usually concerned about their privacy and dont like to have articles written about them theyre afraid it sets them up to be robbed or something do me a favor when joshua comes in dont tell him about this conversation let me approach him in my own way otherwise i might not be able to persuade him especially if he thinks youve been talking about him for that matter if he suspects you told me he might be using steroids he could get upset enough to sue you for slander jesus christ sue me maybe even sue the club rich people are like that dont worry ill leave you out of it just dont talk to him before i do man im out of this believe me a porsche huh yeah if i ever won the lottery id buy one red thats my favorite color joshuas is white at a white porsche drove into the parking lot to the right of the redwood and glass exercise club breathing faster cavanaugh watched from a starbucks across the street and scribbled the porsches license number on his stenographers pad pretending to enjoy a latte he sat a careful distance from the coffee shops windows he watched the porsche stop in a parking space near the club a tall only somewhat overweight man got out even from a distance it was obvious that the mans black loafers gray slacks and blue pullover were designerexpensive the mans scalp was shaved he had a goatee tan he wore sunglasses cavanaugh managed to seem calm as he set down his coffee concentrating fiercely on the man who called himself joshua carter if this was prescott the change was startling a puffy awkward pastyfaced man was becoming something else reshaping his body although he still had more volume to lose what he had already lost had modified the contour of his cheeks and jawline his goatee and shaved head altered his profile also giving him a burly masculine appearance in an odd way he was almost handsome beneath his comfortably loose clothing cavanaugh sensed the man was developing strength and power given the time frame that doesnt seem possible cavanaugh thought something like steroids had to be part of the selfimprovement mix or else an idea struck him had prescott developed some kind of hormone stimulant the man paused a moment scanning the parking lot and the area around him before he pulled a dark gym bag from behind the front seat was he checking for trouble or simply enjoying his surroundings his sunglasses prevented cavanaugh from seeing if carter glanced warily from side to side as he walked toward the front of the exercise club but before he opened the door there was no question that he looked behind him along the street fifty fiftytwo fiftyfour hands tight on the steering wheel cavanaugh drove along vista linda noting the house numbers the street consisted of elaborately landscaped milliondollar homes with magnificent views of what was called the bayonet blackhorse golf course a name left over from when fort ord had been active sixty sixtytwo sixtyfour even with the streets proximity to the golf course cavanaugh didnt understand why prescott had chosen to live somewhere in the monterey peninsula area other than carmel perhaps prescott was staying away from a spot that he feared might be associated with him but if he was being extra cautious why the hell was he wearing a gold watch and driving around in a porsche seventy seventytwo cavanaugh planned to learn what he could about the layout of prescotts house find a way in and use the knockout spray grace had given him to subdue prescott and arrange to trade him for jamie he would no doubt have to bypass a burglar alarm and it wouldnt be easy getting in without neighbors seeing him but he didnt have a choice seventyfour seventyeight was just ahead an imposing impressive twostory pseudohispanic structure with a tile roof and cavanaugh slowed staring at the for sale sign on the front lawn sorry to bother you cavanaugh said to the elderly wispyhaired man who answered the door but i couldnt help noticing the sign across the street from too much sun the mans leathery brown face had numerous creases his stern gaze deepened them my dads a surgeon in chicago wants to retire out here cavanaugh said hes crazy about golf so ive been driving around seeing what places are for sale the house across the street looks perfect but this is a newly built area and im wondering if theres something wrong with the place that its being sold so soon that godawful sign the man said excuse me i told her to put the house on the market privately what do we want with a sign like that making the neighborhood look junky and realtors and people who cant afford to live here coming around gawking cluttering up the street no respect the minute sam died his wife couldnt wait to sell the place sam jamison he and i moved here the same week two years ago he dropped dead on the golf course yesterday morning and that damned sign was sticking up in the yard by afternoon at the nearest gas station cavanaugh rushed to a pay phone he shoved a phone card into a slot and pressed numbers rutherford the deep voice said how are you coming with those lists speaking quickly cavanaugh was surprised by how breathless he felt weve got a dozen agents working the phones from washington we sent agents from san francisco and san jose down to liaise with the agent weve got in the carmelmonterey area but we still havent been able to contact a lot of the realtors and as for the golf courses i wish i had a dollar for everybody who wants to play there youve got to hurry check this license number its a california plate and goes with a new porsche carrera white cavanaugh dictated the number who owns the car are you at john recited the location and number of the pay phone cavanaugh was using your caller id systems damned good damned and good dont go together the southern baptist said stay where you are ill contact the california dmv and call you back in ten minutes make it as quick as you can ill be waiting the instant cavanaugh hung up he hurried to the taurus and drove away certain that in a very short while a police car sent by rutherford would arrive looking for him he went ten blocks and stopped at another gas station with an outside pay phone time having sped by now dragged agonizingly exactly when he was supposed to he shoved his phone card into a slot and pressed numbers his hand sweated on the phones receiver what did you find you were supposed to stay where you were what did you find the porsches leased what only for a month to someone named joshua carter the company he leased it from says he gave his address as seventyeight vista linda in seaside california the local police departments sending an unmarked car to check it out cavanaugh could barely speak tell them to forget it carter doesnt live there doesnt live there if you knew that why on earth did you ask me to i was hoping youd find a different address this is crazy i need you at the command center were setting up this time stay where you are right cavanaugh hung up and ran to the taurus jesus prescotts so paranoid he created a false identity within a false identity cavanaugh thought as he watched the exercise club from the starbucks across the street the son of a bitch probably did what we told him at the bunker checked old newspaper obituaries found the name of a child who if hed lived would now be the same age as he was knowing that most parents get social security numbers for their children at the time theyre born and that some states california among them include social security numbers on death certificates he went to the hall of records in the city where the child died and asked for a copy of the death certificate with the social security number from the death certificate he could get a drivers license and a bank account in the childs name pretending to read a magazine cavanaugh sat back from the windows the instructor had said that joshua carter usually stayed four hours the time was now five oclock presumably prescott was using his second false identity to test his surroundings if his remarkable transformation at the exercise club attracted the wrong attention he could abandon the easily dispensable joshua carter persona and go to ground relying on the absolutely dependable irreplaceable identity that karen had created for him when he came out of the club he would revert to that identity and drive to his actual residence i cant hope to catch him alone in the club subdue him and get him out of there without people trying to stop me cavanaugh thought but if i can follow him prescott stepped from the building pausing in the sunlight he stood a little straighter than when hed gone in his shoulders looked a little more broad his chest a little more solid his cheeks flushed from exertion seemed subtly thinner whatever chemical he was taking it worked remarkably in tandem with exercise and a strict diet he wore sunglasses and the same black loafers gray slacks and blue pullover as when hed gone in he carried the same dark gym bag as scalp glistening he scanned the street and turned to his left toward the clubs parking lot at the porsche he again looked around then got into the car the moment prescott drove from the lot cavanaugh hurried outside to where hed parked the taurus behind starbucks fifteen seconds later he followed that length of time was critical because hed tested both directions on the street and had concluded that fifteen seconds was a little less than the time it took at the speed limit to reach the stop sign at either end as cavanaugh emerged from the starbucks lot he saw the porsche reach the intersection on the right a moment later prescott turned left cavanaugh headed down to the intersection turned left and saw the porsche among the traffic a block away he knew he couldnt keep up with the sports car if prescott used its maneuvering abilities to weave in and out of traffic and turn corners with an efficiency that made up for staying within the speed limit but cavanaugh hoped that once prescott was away from the exercise club hed abandon the glitzy persona hed created and do his best to blend at least as much as he could with so expensive a car in keeping with that logic prescott drove conservatively along del monte avenue taking that main thoroughfare west into the adjoining city of monterey where he made two conservative turns in the congestion of five oclock traffic and entered a twostory parking garage next to an office complex the exit from the garage was next to its entrance but cavanaugh had to make sure there wasnt a second entranceexit and that prescott had not entered the garage only to leave it immediately on the opposite side in case anyone was following him the problem was while cavanaugh drove around the block checking for other exits prescott might leave through the exit that cavanaugh knew about but then cavanaugh noticed that so many drivers were leaving the garage at the end of the workday that a line of cars had formed inside waiting to reach the checkout booth enough cars that cavanaugh figured he had time to drive around the block before prescott could leave via this exit as he hoped there wasnt another exit returning to where prescott had entered cavanaugh drove into the garage and wound his way all through the dusky exhaustsmelling lower level but he didnt see the porsche continuing to the second level he found it in an area marked compact only along with other small cars next to a door that led into the office complex the location forced cavanaugh to reconsider his strategy in an ideal situation the porsche would have been away from a door and parked among larger vehicles preferably suvs behind which cavanaugh could have concealed the taurus and taken cover rushing prescott when he approached the sports car now cavanaugh was going to have to park a distance away he considered hiding in a dark corner near the porsche charging prescott before he could get in the car an alternative was to use the emerson knife to cut chunks from the seat covers that hid cavanaughs bloodstains if he shoved the chunks into the porsches exhaust pipes the engine wouldnt be able to function when prescott got out to see what was wrong hed be so distraded that cavanaugh would have a better chance of rushing him but would prescott be distracted cavanaugh wondered or would the cars sudden failure make prescott wary if prescott had a pistol if there was a gunfight i cant risk killing him cavanaugh thought then he realized that the best way to do this was to spray some of the knockout chemical on the porsches door handle when prescott touched it and collapsed cavanaugh could hurry over pick him up as if prescott were drunk and get him into the taurus cavanaugh put on latex gloves that hed purchased during the day he took the spray container from the plastic bag got out ofthe car and put his hands behind his back to prevent departing office workers from noticing the gloves thirty seconds later he was back behind the steering wheel after returning the container to its bag he cautiously removed the gloves careful to touch them only on their interior the taurus was in a shadowy area office workers entering the garage didnt notice him the sounds of car doors being opened and shut echoed throughout the garage vehicles pulled out of spaces and descended to the lower level fewer and fewer cars remained by six oclock the porsche was the only car against the wall next to the door and the taurus was one of only a handful across from it cavanaugh moved the taurus to a farther section of the garage blending with the remaining vehicles sixthirty a few more office workers departed seven when eight oclock came and the only vehicles in the area were the porsche and the taurus cavanaugh had a premonition somebodys got a brandnew porsche up there he told the kid with a ring in his nose who was in charge of the parking garages exit booth yeah cool huh is this place safe enough for a car that expensive somebody like mes always on duty nobodys tried to steal it so far so far the guy who owns it pays by the month weird though what do you mean the guy never takes the porsche out except in the afternoon halfpast twelve or so he leaves a little after five he comes back and walks away via the office building cavanaugh realized then he watches from down the street to see if anybody followed him he spotted me ive got to assume the bastard spotted me cavanaugh drove from the garage which he now realized was the dividing line between joshua carter and whatever identity karen had created for him as cavanaugh headed back to del monte avenue he was absolutely convinced that prescott had another vehicle near the garage something that didnt attract attention that blended in the way cavanaugh had taught him cavanaugh took care not to glance at his rearview mirror he couldnt risk doing even the slightest thing that might make prescott realize cavanaugh hoped he was being followed as sparks seemed to shoot through his nervous system he turned left and headed deeper into the historic part of monterey soon he discovered he was on cannery row where boutiques and cafes had replaced the fish factories from john steinbecks day but he paid no attention to his right the sun was low over the ocean he paid no attention to that either follow me cavanaugh kept hoping follow me he tried to imagine what was going through prescotts mind one temptation would be to flee the carmelmonterey area as quickly as possible but to the best of prescotts knowledge only his joshua carter persona had been uncovered if prescott concluded that cavanaugh was acting on his own which cavanaugh seemed to be doing would prescott decide to protect the false identity karen had created for him by eliminating the threat to it by going after cavanaugh it all depended on how much prescott enjoyed his new life on how much he hated to abandon it would he run or would he protect the identity for which hed already killed five people cavanaugh drove as steadily as possible making no attempt at evasion tactics cannery row deadended forcing him to make a left turn and then a right but otherwise he continued in a direct fashion following the edge of the ocean on his right the sun sank casting crimson over the whitecaps never once did cavanaugh look in his rearview mirror never once did he give an indication that he hoped he was being followed he passed several scenic stopping places and finally chose one that had few vehicles steering from the road he parked in an isolated area got out of the car and crossed the pavement heading toward the numerous boulders along the ocean there he did something that he realized with surprise could be considered brave although he didnt think that the act was anything remotely to be proud of as he despondently reminded himself if hed listened to jamie and gone home to jackson hole with her he wouldnt need to deny all his protective instincts now he selected two low boulders that were close enough to each other for him to sit on one while he propped his shoes on the other with his back to the parking lot he placed his hands on his knees and waited the sunset gleamed across the water he felt a cool breeze spray from the waves hitting the boulders in front of him but all he paid attention to was the sound of a vehicle pulling off the road and stopping in the parking area behind him the engine remained on a car door was opened and then closed despite the pounding of the surf cavanaugh heard footsteps crossing the pavement shoes crunched on pebbles as someone approached the boulder he sat on the footsteps halted behind his back fear insisted on a fightorflight response as cavanaugh maintained his defenseless position his central nervous system was on overdrive speeding pulsing demanding more oxygen and an even more urgent flow of blood how did you find me prescotts voice shook just as it had the first time cavanaugh had heard it a summer place and play misty for me cavanaughs palms sweated for several moments the only sound came from the surf and the idling engine observant and youre a quick learner in another life you could have been an operator appeal to his pride cavanaugh thought do you always speak highly of people you want to kill i dont want to kill you anymore cavanaugh stared straight ahead toward the sunsettinted ocean is that supposed to persuade me not to kill you you didnt come here to do that otherwise youd have pulled the trigger by now then why did i come here to talk to me cavanaugh struggled to control his breathing again the only sounds were the surf and the idling engine keep your hands on your knees keep looking at the water prescott said as the breeze strengthened cavanaugh heard footsteps on pebbles to his right a solidlooking figure appeared in his peripheral vision coming around to a boulder a careful distance from him prescott had a jacket over his hands concealing what cavanaugh assumed was a handgun you seem to be alone you had plenty of time to watch the garage you know i was the only person keeping tabs on the porsche what did you put on the cars handle you had that good a look at me i hid small video cameras at the top of various support beams in the garage theyre tiny batterypowered barely noticeable the internets crammed with advertising for them check up on your babysitter see your neighbors teenaged daughter sunbathing i watched the images on monitors in a van on the garages lower level then youre aware i dont have help what did you put on the cars handle a knockout chemical that works on skin contact why are you doing this alone why didnt you tell the government where youd found me because the government would make a deal with you in exchange for your testimony against the military officials who hired you to develop the hormone you learned about that i assume the only reason youre not using it on me now is that the breeze coming ashore would carry it away before it did anything to me who told you about it a man who called himself kline he led the team that tried to kidnap you i know who kline is prescotts voice hardened you dont need to worry about him anymore hes dead because of you no a woman i call grace was responsible for that grace five feet ten blue eyes short blond hair looks like she goes to the gym a lot could be attractive if she werent so disagreeable know grace also her real names alicia seems too feminine for her if youre a female trained in an experimental specialops program i suspect you lose some of your femininity the sun was almost gone as shadows turned to dusk cavanaugh understood why prescott had left his cars engine idling the headlights were on glaring at them prescott wanted to avoid depleting the cars battery shes the one who gave me the knockout chemical i put on your door handle im pleased you said that oh i doubt your skills extend to laboratories and formulas someone must have given you the knockout chemical it goes against your claim to be working alone im not working with grace believe me convince me i have with effort cavanaugh broke his rule of never revealing personal details a wife you told me you didnt have a family imagine that cavanaugh said normally i keep her away from my business but after what happened at the bunker she was the only person i could call for help she came to carmel with me yesterday grace kidnapped her if i dont deliver your corpse my wife willthe word caught in his throatdie a powerful incentive to kill me to the contrary spray from the surf sprinkled cavanaughs face but his cheeks were so fearnumbed he barely felt it if i delivered your body what motive would grace have to release my wife grace has every reason to hate me i crippled her and eliminated her team crippled her shot her leg put her on crutches her controllers have practically disowned her yes all of that would definitely have annoyed her prescott said so i suspect that if i deliver your corpse shell use my wife to pay me back for all the trouble ive caused her likely i want you to help me cavanaugh said the surf pounded the engine idled the headlights glared excuse me prescott asked i have a way to solve both our problems cavanaughs chest cramped keep talking my wife means more to me than anything else in the world more than your five dead friends more than anything if something happened to her i dont know how i could help me get her back and youll never have anything to fear from me ill never harm you ill never allow anyone else to harm you either youll be my protector again prescott scoffed and just how am i supposed to help you by solving your problem at the same time i solve mine i phone grace and tell her ive got you but that im keeping you alive until she releases my wife i arrange for an exchange you walk to grace while my wife walks to me what grace doesnt realize is youre not my prisoneryoure my ally why wont she suspect because she knows i came all this way to get you because she believes you and i are enemies and arent we not if you help me whats to keep her from shooting me the moment i step into view shell want the personal satisfaction of being close to you before she harms you but just in case youll be wearing a kevlar vest ive got in my car grace has seen you only when youre heavy because youve lost so much weight the bulk of the vest will make you look closer to the way you used to be it wont attract attention it wont make her suspicious ill pretend to rough you up before i shove you over to her ill subdue her suspicions even further by making it look as if your hands are tied but the binding wont be secure and the moment youre close enough do you know how to use that pistol youve got under your jacket every morning i practice at an indoor range in monterey cavanaugh didnt bother to point out that shooting a target was quite different from mustering the resolve to shoot a human being as prescott had repeatedly demonstrated he had no hesitation about killing the moment youre close enough to grace you break the bindings on your hands draw your pistol and shoot her easy to say but suppose she has help in fact she does one other operator she claims shes been so disowned that she cant find more help than that she could be lying we pick a tradeoff spot we can get to before they can that way we can watch for surprises no matter what happens youve got me to protect you youre actually serious about this prescott asked grace hates you so much shell never stop hunting you youll never feel safe youll always hear footsteps behind you if you want to keep your new identity youve got to stop her help me get my wife back and ill help you get rid of grace and afterward if were successful if you get your wife back you wont do anything to harm me thats right cavanaugh said in spite of what i did to your team thats one hell of a leap of faith give me a reason to believe you ill give you the best reason in the world cavanaugh said my word for the first time cavanaugh took his gaze away from the dark horizon in the glare of the headlights he turned and looked squarely at prescott at the almost unrecognizable mannish features the pronounced cheeks and jaw the goatee the shaved head and the developed shoulders i give you my word help me get my wife back and youll never have anything to fear from me your word prescott made it sound like a brandnew concept and my love for my wife how do i know this wife even exists how can i be sure this isnt some trick i could have shot you in the parking lot outside the exercise club i kept you alive because we need each other prescotts dark eyes reacted but if thats not good enough will you believe grace cavanaugh asked the phone at the motel where im staying has a speaker function when i call grace and you hear her voice when she talks about my wife will you believe me then his handgun aimed beneath the jacket in his hands prescott followed cavanaugh into the motel room then told him to lock the door and close the curtains cavanaugh moved carefully keeping his hands away from his sides even though he had left his pistol and his emerson knife in the taurus as prescott had instructed with the curtains closed prescott put his jacket on a chair revealing that hed followed cavanaughs example even to the extent that his pistol was the same kind hed seen cavanaugh carrying a sig sauer this is how we met cavanaugh said with you pointing a handgun at me the pupils of prescotts eyes were as huge and dark as theyd been at the warehouse remember the conversation we had about adrenaline cavanaugh asked prescott nodded drawing his tongue along his lips at the bunker i told you that someone who masters adrenaline who prefers the fight option cant be called brave but someone like you who somehow functions in spite of being afraid who wants to run away but instead faces his threats headon is brave dont flatter me all i want is to be free of my enemies cavanaugh pointed toward the bureau im going to open this drawer and show you something do it slowly using only the fingertips of his left hand cavanaugh pulled out the drawer bras panties i gave up crossdressing a long time ago what prescotts cheeks turned red in the bathroom youll find a womans toilet kit hair spray lipstick facial cream a dinky razor i dont want you to have any doubt that im traveling with a woman all right im convinced prescott said uncomfortable the question is has she been kidnapped from his shirt pocket cavanaugh removed the piece of paper grace had given him he went over to the bedside phone touched for an outside line touched the button to activate the phones speaker function then called the cell phone grace had said shed be using sitting on beds across from each other he and prescott who still had the pistol aimed at cavanaugh listened to a buzz a second buzz just as cavanaugh started to worry that grace would be out of touch a stern female voice answered hello cavanaugh looked at prescott as if to ask do you recognize it prescotts lips became pale the cell phone reception had some static good cavanaugh thought she wont notice the slightly hollow sound a speaker phone causes its me cavanaugh said i hope youre calling with good news ive got prescott dead i want to hear my wifes voice i asked you if hes dead and i said i want to hear my wifes voice cavanaugh heard more static then muffled annoyed voices in the background at once graces sharp voice returned saying tell him youre okay no response for christs sake tell him imjamies paintight voice made cavanaughs throat ache in sympathyall right there grace intruded shes fine now what about prescott what the hell have you done to her nothing that i cant make more painful cavanaugh had a sudden harrowing image of jamie with blood all over her face the sooner you get her back the sooner she gets tender loving care grace said in a mocking tone prescott you said you had good news is he dead no then that isnt good news at all why havent you killed him cavanaugh looked at prescott silently asking do you see i was telling the truth prescotts shaved head glinted with sweat because i want to make sure ill get my wife back cavanaugh said you dont trust me to keep my end of the bargain not if i deliver a corpse to you what motive would you have to give her to me now ive got something to trade when i see my wife you can see prescott when you let my wife go ill let him go after that you can do whatever you want with him damn it this isnt what we agreed but its the way its going to be the transmition became silent except for an electronic hiss i dont like being pressured grace said you ought to feel delighted you told me you had until tomorrow morning to regain the trust of your controllers this way youre ahead of schedule just give me my wife and you can have prescott both our problems are almost over grace lapsed into silence and finally let out an exhausted frustrated sigh where do you want to make the exchange for a third time cavanaugh looked at prescott on the way to the motel theyd discussed the logistics of the tradeoff if cavanaugh could convince prescott he was telling the truth and if prescott chose to go forward prescott who had spent a lot of time researching the carmel area had made the suggestion cavanaugh now told her about fifteen miles south of carmel on highway one theres a road that heads into the mountains a sign says historic site just what i need culture whats the historic site a stone chapel a hermit built in he was a banker whose family died in the san francisco earthquake most of the place collapsed a long time ago hardly anybody goes there and how exactly do you know about this place ive been to carmel before cavanaugh said lying once when i drove up from los angeles i saw the turnoff and decided to check it out and im supposed to feel confident meeting you there hey youre the one whos got help all i want is to get rid of this son of a bitch and get my wife back what you do with prescott up in the hills with no one to bother you is your business i thought youd appreciate the privacy another frustrated weary exhale graces suspicions fought with her need to regain the confidence of her superiors when an hour cant get there by then make it two grace broke the connection cavanaugh deactivated the phones speaker function and put the handset onto its cradle numb around his mouth he looked at prescott and the weapon prescott aimed at him so drawing an unsteady breath prescott seemed to perform an astonishing act of will mustering his resources somehow looking more compact and solid in the process he studied the numbers on the bedside clock shes lying about needing two hours to get there thats right shell get there as soon as possible prescott said to set up a trap and make sure youre not setting up one right again i keep telling you you missed your true profession there isnt much time prescott said so what are you going to do keep running always looking over your shoulder or end your problems tonight prescott stared at him or rather stared through him as if cavanaugh werent there as if prescott peered at a bleak horizon that consisted of unending days and nights of being hunted at last he stood the dark of his goatee contrasted starkly with the pallor of his cheeks sweat oozed from his scalp he looked as if the next two words were the hardest hed ever spoken lets go part seven threat elimination take off your shirt put this on cavanaugh reached under the cover on the tauruss backseat and pulled out the bulletresistant vest hed hidden beneath it your shirts loose enough that it wont be obvious youre wearing the vest then put on your jacket to conceal your pistol the taurus was parked in a shadowy area at the back of the motels parking lot using the car for concealment prescott did what he was told the brief glimpse that cavanaugh got of prescotts reduced stomach and developed chest muscles surprised him when prescott put on his jacket cavanaugh grabbed a roll of duct tape from the rear floor now get in front while i drive wrap this around your ankles prescott looked suspicious make it appear secure cavanaugh said then use this cavanaugh opened the drivers door and picked up the emerson knife from where prescott had insisted he put it along with his pistol near the cars pedals with his thumb against the tab on the back of the blade cavanaugh flicked the knife open and gave it to prescott cut the tape on the inside so the force of your legs can break it if you need to prescott continued looking suspicious this close to you dont you think i could have taken that pistol from you and killed you cavanaugh asked while youre with me youre safe wrap the tape around your ankles then use this knife be careful the blades sharp cavanaugh got into the car picked up the pistol on the floor holstered it and waited for prescott to join him prescott had to muster more resolve before he got in immediately cavanaugh drove two blocks to a brightly lit grocery store hed noticed when he and prescott had gone to the motel open til midnight its neon sign read he ran in and came back five minutes later with a paper bag which he emptied on the seat as cavanaugh drove away prescott peered down at four objects a bottle of colorless corn syrup a bottle of red food dye a plastic bowl and a large plastic spoon what are these for stir some of the corn syrup and food dye together in the bowl cavanaugh steered toward highway for gods sake why without a professional makeup kit thats the best way to imitate scabs and drying blood they joined headlights moving south on highway despite his impatience cavanaugh stayed exactly at the speed limit the dashboard clock showed needing to be at the rendezvous site as quickly as possible theyd already lost twenty minutes prescott finished stirring the mixture and reached into his jacket pulling out a gray metal tube cavanaugh tensed is that the hormone prescott nodded you were right i didnt use it on you at the beach because the breeze would have blown it away from you if i twist the cap theres a safety delay of twenty seconds then the pressurized contents are released you plan to use it at the rendezvous position us so the winds at our backs suppose thats not possible if i get a whiff of that stuff i wont be able to help you or what if grace and her partner react the way the rangers did in florida instead of running they might fire in panic jamie might get shot prescott didnt respond no cavanaugh said but put it on the seat prescott stared at him do it cavanaugh said leave it there prescott put the tube on the seat because of that stuff for the first time i understand what fear is cavanaugh said is there a neutralizer he hoped the question seemed casual of course otherwise even with the safety delay the weapon might affect whoever triggers it the antidote doesnt take away fear only the fear the hormone causes i want you to give it to me cavanaugh said i cant why i dont have the antidote with me prescott said but even if i could give it to you it wouldnt make a difference right now what are you talking about youd still be afraid for your wife once you love somebody you start fearing something might happen to that person fortunately thats one fear ive managed to avoid now youll get to find out find out what it takes to be brave they passed carmel moving farther south the headlights of traffic dwindling until there were only occasional vehicles as they reached the mostly unpopulated area around point lobos soon through the shadows of trees cavanaugh saw the lights of isolated houses whats this place carmel highlands its a small community of houses on a bluff above the ocean cavanaugh saw a road on the right leading into it headlights piercing the shadows he steered onto the road and parked among the trees he shut off the headlights i couldnt do this earlier because there was too much traffic a policeman might have seen your face and stopped us cavanaugh took the plastic spoon dug it into the mixture in the bowl and smeared the redtinted corn syrup across the left side of prescotts mouth onto his left cheek and temple and like a gash across his shaved skull exposed to the air the mixture had started to coagulate making prescott look as if blood had thickened on his face when cavanaugh switched the headlights back on the glow from the dashboard allowed him to study the effect it looks like you belong in the emergency ward but i can smell the corn syrup by the time youre close enough to grace for her to smell it shell be dead i have to be sure what do you mean do it for real i dont know what youre cut me prescott said what my scalp scalp wounds are terrific bleeders the coppery smell will disguise the corn syrup jesus cavanaugh said do it prescott flinched as cavanaugh raised the emerson knife cavanaugh could only imagine the control prescott needed in order to remain still while he cut a twoinch slit across the top of prescotts forehead blood streamed cavanaugh wiped the side of the knife over prescotts face and the drying mixture prescott now looked like the living dead hold out your hands cavanaugh said the hands shook as cavanaugh twisted duct tape around prescotts wrists inserting the emerson knife between prescotts wrists cavanaugh carefully cut the inside of the tape in front and back he made the tape look intact from a distance but weakened it so that prescott would have no trouble snapping it okay cavanaugh asked prescott tested the tape on his wrists almost pulling it apart his breathing trembled when he inhaled okay cavanaugh reversed direction and returned to highway continuing south on the right the moon cast a glow over the ocean on the left there were only occasional lights in the mountains except for the taurus the road was deserted around the next turn prescott said his voice strained you know this area fairly well when i started losing weight i avoided crowds until my appearance was sufficiently changed i spent a lot of time hiking around here as cavanaugh rounded the curve the tauruss headlights revealed the historic site marker he steered to the left onto a bumpy dirt lane that went up through murky trees the lane reached a moonlit meadow then zigzagged up through more trees a few times furrows in the lane caused the tauruss underside to bump across stones and dirt overhead branches blocked the moonlit sky bushes scraped the car soon therell be another meadow prescott said the chapels built against a slope on the opposite side not that theres much to see prescotts breathing was more rapid and strident except for a little tower with a cross on top everythings collapsed count to three slowly as you inhale what hold your breath for three counts then exhale for three counts keep doing that itll help now slump down before they see you pretend youre unconscious pale even in the darkness prescott obeyed cavanaugh listened to the exaggerated measured pattern of prescotts breathing simultaneously he felt each jounce of the car along the lane as if it were the lurching of his heart he turned a sharp corner and emerged from the dark trees into another meadow this one illuminated not only by moonlight but also by the sudden glare of headlights where prescott had said the chapel would be damn it shes here ahead of us cavanaugh said he didnt slow didnt react as if he was alarmed just kept following the lane heading toward the headlights ready he asked prescott on the floor its a little late to say i want to back out five minutes from now youll be safe ill have my wife and youll be free that trick with the future tense did wonders for me when you were rescuing me from the warehouse prescott said yes five minutes from now youll have your wife and ill be free hearing prescott say it cavanaugh felt some of the magic of the words lets see if youre as good an actor as you are a biochemist and lets seeprescott held his breath for three beatsif youre as good a protector as you promised to be the taurus came closer to the headlights grace stood on crutches next to a car whose popularity and hence ability to blend made it a favorite among security specialists a mercury sable behind the vehicle the cross on the chapels tower caught the glare of cavanaughs headlights collapsed walls lay below it he stopped eighty feet from graces car out of practical nighttime pistol range there was always the chance that she had someone with a rifle hiding among the trees but the shooter would need a nightvision scope to aim properly and cavanaugh doubted that grace could have gotten that sort of sophisticated equipment this late and so quickly besides the glare of both sets of headlights would interfere with most nightvision equipment which worked by magnifying the illumination from the moon and the stars and which would be overpowered by the headlightsin effect blinding a sniper cavanaugh left the engine idling and the headlights on as he got out the night was cold exaggerating the alreadycold feeling in his chest squinting from the lights trying to keep his voice steady he called to grace you got here early it reminded him of the start of their conversation at fogenshrouded tor house that morning his voice echoed off the surrounding wooded slopes you dont sound surprised any more than im surprised that you tried to get here early grace said open all your car doors cavanaugh did the only reason for grace to tell him to open the doors was for someone among the trees at the side to be able to see if anyone was hiding in the car he knew it made him worry that hed miscalculated that a sniper was indeed concealed on a slope and that the nightvision scope the sniper had was one of the few sophisticated enough based on heat detection rather than light magnification not to be compromised by the headlights sick he opened the left rear door rounded the back of the car opened the right rear door and then came forward to open the passenger door again he stood next to the headlights hoping that instead of revealing him they gave him cover but he suspected that his worst fears were about to come true that the plan wasnt going to work please god help me get jamie back he thought at once grace said something that changed everything and gave him hope wheres prescott why would she say that cavanaugh wondered with all the doors open prescott would be visible to someone on the side a sniper seeing the cars interior would use a walkietalkie or similar twoway radio setup to tell grace that cavanaugh hadnt brought help hes halfunconscious on the front seat the bit about opening the doors was a bluff cavanaugh realized his pulse speeding with hope she wants me to think theres a sniper in the trees but there isnt otherwise grace would have been told where prescott was and that he was the only person in the car drag the bastard out not until i see my wife looking impatient grace raised a hand from one of her crutches and motioned to someone hidden among the collapsed walls of the chapel two figures rose and emerged into the headlights one shoved the other the one doing the shoving was a solidly built woman except that her short hair was dark in contrast with graces blond hair she and grace looked remarkably similar in height and physique perhaps because they had both belonged to the same female specialops training group that prescott had referred to the person being shoved was jamie her hands were tied in front of her she lurched forward stooped as if in pain when she looked up cavanaugh saw blood on her face anger made his muscles feel on fire he wanted to scream drag prescott out grace said cavanaugh went to the passenger door and made sure that prescott had followed ordersthe metal tube remained on the seat when he hauled prescott from the car prescott landed so hard he moaned with equal force cavanaugh tugged him around to the front of the car in the headlights in full view of grace and the woman pushing jamie cavanaugh kicked him several times in the side feeling his shoe collide with the bulletresistant vest under prescotts shirt while the vest protected his vital organs prescott would nonetheless have felt the shock of the impact again prescott groaned he rolled with the fourth kick and came to a stop clutching himself on your feet cavanaugh said theres no way im dragging you all the way over there cavanaugh undipped the emerson knife from the inside of his pants pocket thumbed the blade open and slashed the duct tape around prescotts ankles freeing it the moment he folded the blade and reclipped the knife inside his pocket he yanked prescott upward prescotts head jerked from the force with which he was raised cavanaugh stood behind him holding his shoulders trying to steady him as prescott listed to one side and then the other you want him you got him cavanaugh told grace what do you think youre doing grace demanded thats not prescott the hell he isnt prescott doesnt look like he lost weight as part of his disguise ill prove its him hey jerkoff say something to her prescott kept swaying cavanaugh drove a kidney punch into the back of prescotts bulletresistant vest to save his knuckles he held back the force of the impact at the last second when grace wouldnt be able to see the blow prescott groaned and bent forward i told you to say something to her uh seeming in pain prescott raised his head hows it he coughed as if something inside him were broken hows it going al it is him grace said jesus look at his face what did you do to him gave him some payback for what he did to my friends now its your turn to give him some payback let my wife go ill let prescott go balanced on her crutches grace looked at her companion and nodded the companion pushed jamie past the car silhouetted by the headlights jamie stumbled forward your turn grace said cavanaugh shoved prescott ahead as if he were a marionette being manipulated by the strings of a spastic puppeteer prescott listed this way and that his legs barely able to support him jamie just a little farther cavanaugh watched her stagger toward him youre going to be fine all you have to do is reach me meanwhile prescott wavered toward jamie and her companion abruptly he collapsed to his knees cavanaugh went to him and yanked him to his feet keep moving damn it people are expecting you ive got better things to do than hang around waiting for you to put one foot in front of the other again he shoved prescott who seemed even more controlled by a spastic puppeteer as prescott tottered nearer to grace and her companion they seemed appalled by his grotesque appearance jamie stumbled closer her green eyes now distinct in the headlights for a second time prescott halted about to collapse move cavanaugh went to him once more shoving him they were now midway between the cars as prescott reeled forward jamie and prescott passed each other lips bleeding she looked horrified by the damage that had apparently been done to prescotts features almost over almost free cavanaugh thought praying for all he knew grace would shoot at him now that he seemed preoccupied with jamie everything depended on the next few seconds lets go home he told jamie about to put an arm around her he motioned for her to keep moving toward the car but activity beyond prescott caught cavanaughs attention balancing on one crutch grace raised the other crutch to strike prescott across the face as he lurched in her direction meanwhile graces companion aimed a handgun at prescott i gave my word cavanaugh thought as grace swung the crutch prescott fell to avoid the blow the crutch whistled over his head he hit the ground his hands out of sight beneath him now hes snapping the duct tape grabbing the pistol under his jacket cavanaugh thought grace balanced herself to swing the crutch again the moment prescott rolled to get away from it his movement much quicker than his presumed dazed condition would have allowed cavanaugh drew his pistol three shots from three different weapons were so near in time they were almost indistinguishable as graces companion shot prescott in the chest shuddering prescott shot grace in the head while the crutch hurtled toward him whacking the ground beside him cavanaugh heard screaming as his bullet hit graces companion in the chest jolting her backward a fourth shot this one again from prescott stopped the screaming when the bullet hit the womans face and dropped her the smell of cordite hung in the air wisps of it floating in the headlights ears ringings nerves on fire cavanaugh spun toward jamie relieved to see that shed dropped to the ground the moment the shooting started are you okay yes youre sure yes he spun toward prescott are you okay lying on the ground needing to catch his breath from the bullets impact against the kevlar vest prescott didnt answer right away presumably he also needed to adjust to the realization that the crisis was over that he didnt have to continue to be terrified yes i kept my word cavanaugh said i helped you i protected you because you helped me you have nothing to fear from me as much as i hate you ill never come after you again prescott nodded continuing to lie on the ground and catch his breath if you didnt remember to wipe your fingerprints from the cartridges before you loaded them find the empty shell casings and take them with you cavanaugh said i remembered use graces car to get away from here when you abandon it remember to wipe your prints from everything you touch i wont forget then our business is finished facing prescott continuing to hold his pistol cavanaugh backed toward jamie helped her to stand and continued backing toward the car are you okay he asked her again do you need a doctor prescott remained on the ground holding himself where the bullet had struck the vest and no doubt bruised him from behind cavanaugh and jamie the tauruss headlights cast their silhouettes its engine kept idling i dont think anythings broken jamie managed to say cavanaugh reached the taurus and guided her toward the passenger door suddenly jamie trembled harder against him cavanaughs legs felt weak a pungent smell coming from the car filled his nostrils and sent his heart racing his mouth became drier his breath rate soared the metal tube on the seat he realized prescott twisted the cap before i dragged him out of the car as the hormone spewed from the taurus cavanaugh grabbed the tube off the seat and hurled it toward prescott toward where prescott had been while cavanaugh had been distracted prescott had scrambled out of sight as cavanaugh spun toward jamie urging her into the taurus a shot from the darkness slammed her against him no the hormone crammed his lungs terror overwhelmed him unable to stop shaking he held jamie with one hand while he used the other to fire toward where hed seen a muzzle flash he thought he saw a blurred shadow ducking behind graces car exposed in the glare of its headlights he shot at graces car trembling missing the right headlight shooting twice more the lamp exploded the right side of the car going dark but before he could shoot at the other headlight prescott returned fire the bullet passing so close that it made a snapping sound over cavanaughs head aware that the open passenger door was useless as a shield against a bullet cavanaugh lifted jamie urgently into the passenger seat appalled by the blood spreading along the right side of her chest a bullet punched a hole in the windshield cavanaugh bent over her the tauruss engine now provided effective cover as he ripped her blouse open her lung wheezed the pungent smell of the hormone almost made him gag as he grabbed the roll of duct tape from where prescott had dropped it frantic trembling harder he tore off a section and pressed it over jamies chest sealing the entrance wound her lung stopped wheezing he tore off a second piece and pressed it over the exit wound on her back flinching from several more bullets whacking through the windshield he crawled over jamie and slammed the passenger door then he hunched behind the steering wheel yanked the taurus into reverse and tried to put strength into his legs flooring the accelerator as the tires spewed up grass and the car rocketed backward he released the accelerator and twisted the steering wheel a quarter turn the car pivoted degrees and suddenly faced away from prescott desperate cavanaugh yanked the gearshift into drive and sped away the force of his acceleration slamming the rest of the doors hunched to avoid making his silhouette a target he was so busy concentrating on his driving that he could barely fumble for the buttons that lowered the windows he managed to get some of them down a few inches starting to clear the air when a bullet blew a hole in the rear windshield as glass flew he hunched farther down shaking as if he had a fever then prescott lowered his aim his bullets hitting the trunk obviously he hoped that they would plow through both seats and strike cavanaugh instead they walloped against the sheet of steel that cavanaugh had installed against the back of the trunk speeding toward the dark trees at the end of the meadow cavanaugh felt no confidence from knowing that prescott had almost emptied his pistol prescott still had graces weapon and her companions looking in the rearview mirror cavanaugh saw the remaining headlight on graces car bob into motion the sable pursuing the son of a bitch cavanaugh thought fumbling to secure his seat belt i promised to protect him the tauruss headlights entered the trees revealing a sudden downward turn that cavanaughs impaired reflexes barely anticipated i gave him my word i wouldnt hurt him trees scraping the car cavanaugh struggled with the steering wheel and entered another sudden turn looking in his rearview mirror again he saw the occasional flash of a headlight through gaps in the trees the car sped closer with jamie wounded and the hormone shocking his nervous system cavanaugh knew that prescott had the advantage as if to prove the point a sharp downward turn almost toppled jamie off the seat cavanaugh had to reduce speed again so he could take his right hand off the steering wheel grab jamie and secure her safety belt the murky trees vanished the tauruss headlights illuminating another meadow in the rearview mirror the single headlight rushed closer cavanaugh heard the impacts of more bullets hitting the steel plate in the trunk racing across the gloomy meadow he fumbled for the toggle switch that hed clipped to the bottom of the dashboard instantly he squinted from a glare in his rearview mirror the fog lamps that jamie had installed in back blazing toward prescotts car onehundredwatt quartz halogens they were tilted up to blind a pursuing driver a candlepower of hitting prescotts windshield cavanaugh sped farther across the meadow checking his rearview mirror he saw the fog lamps gleaming so brightly toward prescotts car that its remaining headlight wasnt visible he imagined prescott raising a hand to shield his eyes reducing speed trying to regain his sight i lost him cavanaugh thought i need to get jamie to a hospital she moaned dear god please dont let her die another section of trees loomed at once the taurus shook as prescotts car slammed it from behind the force was so great and surprising that cavanaugh was thrust forward jerking against his safety belt jamies head jolted back and forth no instead of easing back because he couldnt see prescott had used the blazing fog lamps as a target his eyes almost useless able to see only the fog lamps at the back of the taurus prescott had rushed toward them colliding with the back of the taurus he was now so close that the fog lamps reflected off the front of prescotts car their light filled the inside of the taurus gleaming off the rearview mirror blinding cavanaugh cavanaugh flicked up the rearview mirror deflecting the glare fighting to control the steering wheel he felt prescotts car again strike the back of the taurus prescott evidently hadnt learned anything from the chase away from the warehouse the vehicle cavanaugh had stolen had been struck repeatedly from behindwith little effect bumpers got damaged passengers got jolted but the car remained capable of moving again prescotts car struck the taurus its closeness neutralizing the glare of the fog lamps or maybe hes trying to smash the lamps cavanaugh thought needing to reduce his speed to enter the looming dark trees cavanaugh felt the constant pressure of prescotts car against his and realized what prescott was doing jesus hes trying to push me so i cant control my steering hes trying to shove me into the woods despite the risk cavanaugh had no choice except to increase speed while he did the reduced glare behind him indicated that prescott had in fact managed to destroy one of the fog lamps then cavanaugh had time to think only about braking and steering through the trees skidding around the first turn he banged a fender a bullet blasted through a window others struck the steel in the trunk then one hit the remaining fog lamp and the glare behind the taurus vanished the only illumination back there was prescotts single headlight abruptly the trees opened and cavanaugh swerved to the right entering the darkness of the pacific coast highway his tires squealed as he pressed a trembling foot on the accelerator and sped north toward carmel jamie moaned again stay alive he begged behind him prescott skidded onto the narrow highway to cavanaughs left moonlight glowed off the ocean to his right treecovered hills receded into the distance no lights of cars or houses beckoned he raced around a curve and had trouble coming out of it the steering felt mushy as if something was broken then cavanaugh feared that the problem was his tires if prescott had managed to shoot one of them it wouldnt have exploded but it would have started leaking air going soft already prescott was gaining distance on him when cavanaugh entered another curve the faulty steering forced him to go slower rushing behind him prescott rammed the tauruss back end sending a shudder through jamie making her gasp cavanaugh didnt dare think about her all he could allow himself to focus on was trying to drive the mushy steering got worse passing the lights of houses cavanaugh hoped he had a chance on a straightaway he floored the accelerator attempting to gain distance but the softening tire kept the taurus from responding headlights appeared as a minivan sped past prescott again rammed cavanaugh backed off sped closer as if to ram him again then veered unexpectedly into the left lane about to come abreast of the taurus no cavanaugh thought as hed learned from cavanaugh prescott tapped his right front fender against cavanaughs left rear fender aided by cavanaughs faulty steering the socalled precision immobilization technique caused the taurus to spin to the left while prescotts car rushed safely onward cavanaugh found himself gaping in the direction from which hed just come headlights flashing the taurus hit a guardrail next to a low bridge broke through listed down a slope turned onto its side its roof its other side and righted itself as it dropped cavanaugh felt a sickening shock as the car struck water jamie shed been jerked against her seat when the car flipped and fell now she groaned beside him stunned cavanaugh tried to clear his mind as the taurus began to submerge the pressure of the water against the side made it impossible to open the door until the car was filled with water and the pressure was equalized during the chase hed managed to lower the windows a few inches now he touched the button that would take the drivers window down all the way hoping to shove jamie through the gap and then go after her he was dismayed when the window didnt budge cold water soaked his shoes as he undipped the emerson knife from inside his pants pocket and slammed its butt against the safety glass on the drivers side shattering the middle of the window into pellets he pounded the knifes butt against the rest of the window trying to clear its edges when a dark shape made him stop moonlight in combination with the tauruss fading headlights revealed that the dark shape was a boulder turning toward the passenger window cavanaugh saw a boulder on that side also the taurus had landed upright in the water in a trough between shelves of rock on each side there was no way to get out through a broken window no matter if in front or back kick through the front windshield cavanaugh thought instantly he became aware that when the car had rolled its roof had been pushed down crushing the windshield and the window over the trunk making the space too narrow for him to squeeze jamie through the cold water now reached cavanaughs knees as the taurus continued sinking the headlights and the lights on the dashboard flickered trembling from the cold cavanaugh pulled jamie into an upright position trying to give her air for as long as possible his feet felt numb doors blocked by boulders windows cant get through them the roof cavanaugh thumbed the emerson knife open slashed at the roofs liner and yanked it down the roof was buckled inward its support struts had widened creating enough space for someone to squeeze through provided a gap could be created in the roof itself gripping the knife so its blade pointed in the same direction as his thumb cavanaugh stabbed upward into the metal among operators the emerson knife had a worldwide reputation as a harduse tool its edge was razorsharp and chiselground its metal astonishingly strong its point engineered for maximum durability its serrations were designed to cut along metal it could pierce a car door and cavanaugh knew of instances in which it had struck through the fibers of a kevlar vest indeed its sharpness its strength and the force with which he hit the roof caused the blade to go through he sawed withdrew the knife pounded it into the roof again sawed and withdrew the knife straining to cut a hole as the cold water reached his groin he punched the knife into the roof again and again the impact of the blows jarring his arm and his shoulder radiating through his body he jabbed the knife through the roof yet again groaning from the pain it caused him alarmed he saw that jamie had listed sideways drooping toward the rising water which was now at his stomach in a frenzy he propped her upright again then pounded the knife at the roof straining to make a circle his breath echoed loudly he saw its vapor the water reached his chest again he stabbed the knife toward the roof but the resistance of the water robbed him of strength and this time the blade didnt pierce the metal the lights went out in darkness as the taurus sank farther cavanaugh inwardly screamed with the water restricting his movements and without lights to see where he was cutting he would never be able to get through the roof he felt jamie slide sideways toward the water and again propped her up he touched her face close to tears he thought im sorry if id loved you enough if id listened wed be home right now i didnt protect you well enough so sorry as the water rose past cavanaughs nipples a fierce anger possessed him god help me there has to be a immediately he pushed the trunkrelease button he kicked off his shoes squirmed over the seat and splashed into the back trembling from the cold he yanked away the seat cover and drove the emerson knife into the back support hacking at it tearing ripping he widened a hole and shoved at the steel plate that hed put against the rear of the trunk then he took a deep breath and swam underwater into the submerged trunk the weight of the water had kept the trunk from opening he pushed at the hatch but although hed used the trunkrelease button nothing happened the trunk must have been damaged when the car rolled he realized he pushed harder lungs aching he twisted the knife against the latch pried levered and felt something give shoving up with his back he forced the lid up breathe need to breathe desperate he swam back through the hole in the rear seat reached the cars interior and raised his head only to bump it in the darkness exhaling his lungs made a roaring sound amplified by the confined space he frantically estimated that there were barely five inches between the rising water and the roof without pause he inhaled as much air as he could then plunged under the water groping into the front seat finding jamie and raising her into the airspace her moan filled him with a hope you cant moan if youre not breathing he pulled off her shoes then he turned her to face him opened her battered mouth and breathed into it trying to fill her lungs to give her enough air that she could survive what he was now forced to do which was to pull her over the seat and swim with her through the hole in the backseat he tugged her into the trunk braced his feet against the floor and shoved upward clearing the open lid fighting to rise with the current he had a powerless disorienting sensation of being buffeted this way and that one thousand two thousand three thousand four thousand he seemed to hear explosions as he and jamie broke through the surfacethe impact of waves hitting rocks as jamie gasped he gripped her around the shoulders and kicked through the water using his free arm to fight to swim a flashlights glare almost blinded him it was aimed from a bridge about twenty feet above him from near the bluff over which the taurus had fallen prescott cavanaugh thought now hes going to finish it struggling to swim toward boulders cavanaugh waited for the bullet he would never feel which would blow his skull apart he knew that jamie would drown if prescott didnt shoot her first their corpses would be caught in the current and swept out to sea close we came so close you son of a bitch cavanaugh managed to yell what i cant hear you a mans voice yelled back not prescotts try to reach those rocks cavanaugh didnt have the strength to answer the flashlight kept blinding him when i saw the broken guardrail i stopped and spotted your car going under i called the police swim closer ive got a rope in my truck an oxygen mask over her face an iv blood line going into her left arm jamie lay on a gurney that two nurses wheeled urgently through electronically controlled swinging doors toward a brightly lit corridor flanked by operating rooms two surgeons quickly followed a clock on the wall showed it was watching the doors swing shut cavanaugh tightened his grip on the blanket wrapped around him i heard you stopped the bleeding with duct tape a voice behind him said cavanaugh turned toward rutherford whose husky dark features looked pale with fatigue like cavanaugh he still bore the marks of the beating hed received were going to have to start teaching that at the academy rutherford said cavanaughs hollowness made it difficult for him to speak good to see you again john hard to believe given how much trouble you took to avoid me when did you get in this evening as soon as it was obvious you were jerking us around again several of us decided to go sightseeing in carmel in fact i received your second phone call in a bureau jet somewhere over ohio you told the police to report any incidents involving people who matched our description it seemed a reasonable tactic trouble has a way of happening to you rutherford nodded toward the doors to the surgical area is she going to be all right cavanaugh glanced down at his hands they dont know im very sorry we could have tried to help you get her back tried a lot to coordinate no time to do it the government would have cared more about keeping prescott than helping me i couldnt risk it did the doctors tell you when theyd have word about her condition four to five hours a long time to wait rutherford said you can spend it in jail or you can spend it with us do you think youre ready now to help us get prescott the squad room in the monterey police station had two rows of desks at which wearylooking justice department and local lawenforcement officers sat listening to cavanaugh throughout phones rang each time one was answered cavanaugh tensely expected it would be word from the hospital it never was well get a sketch artist working on the description you gave us the airports along the coast have already been alerted rutherford said i dont think hell leave the area cavanaugh said the overhead lights were painfully bright to the best of prescotts knowledge were dead the possibility that jamie might in fact be dying at that moment made cavanaugh hesitate somehow he continued i told prescott that the government didnt know id tracked him to carmel he believed me after all if i was working with the government i wouldnt have been alone in his arrogance prescott might decide hed finally covered his tracks he might do the unexpected and stick close to home wheres the list i asked you to make he referred to the names of men who had bought or leased property in the carmelmonterey area within the previous three weeks and who had also made appointments to play golf at the best courses rutherford handed cavanaugh several sheets of paper this is what weve got so far it doesnt include men whove rented property without using a broker were checking past for rent ads in the local papers to try to contact property owners who made direct arrangements with new renters the overhead lights seemed harsher as cavanaugh studied the list therere more than i expected its a popular area how come there arent many names in carmel itself expensive real estate not many people can afford it the locations so prized very few sell cavanaugh kept scanning the names noting occupants in pacific grove monterey seaside carmel the carmel valley and the carmel highlands the list went on and on its going to take a lot of personnel to check all this cavanaugh said and a lot of time and effort not to make prescott suspicious if you get close to him we were hoping wed save some of that time and effort if any of those names caught your attention an fbi agent said when karen was preparing fresco its new identity cavanaugh said she wouldnt have picked an unusual name nothing that stood out and nothing that anybody would associate with prescotts former life the group looked more weary unless karen got a bad feeling about prescott cavanaugh said they glanced up if karen knew she was in danger cavanaugh said she might have chosen a name for prescott that meant something to me and led me to him you an agent asked she had every reason to expect id go after anybody who hurt her you and she were that close her brother and i were in delta force together he bled to death in my arms the group became silent sobered cavanaugh scanned the list his name was cavanaugh tapped his index finger on a name ben rutherford came over and stared at the name he indicated benjamin kramer the carmel highlands cavanaugh remembered steering onto a road that led to the highlands and asking prescott the significance of the name its a small community of houses on a bluff above the ocean prescott had said matteroffactly the bastard lives there cavanaugh thought without knowing it i was close to prescotts home how strongly do you believe theres a connection rutherford sounded like he wanted desperately to believe it could be a coincidence i didnt notice it at the start because ben never used the formal version of his name he was always just ben but prescott has a thing about nicknames he insisted that his first name was daniel not dan and when he created the joshua carter identity he was firm to the staff at the exercise club that his name was joshua not josh on this list some people used abbreviations to identify themselvessam steve in contrast benjamin seems awfully formal what about the last name kramer an fbi agent asked before karen had the car accident that put her in a wheelchair she was engaged to a guy named kramer as soon as the creep found out karen was permanently crippled he broke the engagement ben said the only good thing about karens accident was it kept kramer from marrying her lets find out where this address is whos familiar with the highlands rutherford asked my aunt lives down there a female detective grabbed a phone rutherford turned toward another detective does your department have detailed maps of the communities around here a computer program and a satellite image from the internet lets get a precise location of the house a phone rang as a detective answered it cavanaugh hoped but also dreaded that this time the call would be from the hospital but it turned out to be about another matter someone put a cdrom disc into a computer a layout of the few streets in the carmel highlands appeared on the screen the detective typed the address there at the end of this ridge directly over the ocean a magnified satellite image showed the tops of homes the patterns of vegetation and the contours of streets the detective zoomed in on the property they wanted to know about a big lot cavanaugh said in the highlands some of them are an acre and more sprawling house compared to the shadows these other houses give off it looks like it has only one level the female detective finished talking to her aunt and set down the phone everybody knows everybody down there when this guy moved in she took him a fruit basket to welcome him he was overweight gruff said he was dieting couldnt eat fruit because of the fructose in it thats the word he usedfructose the few times shes seen him since then hed slimmed down shaved his head grew a goatee she says she can see through the trees to his house the lights are on at onethirty in the morning an fbi agent asked maybe he leaves them on when hes not home or he could be packing rutherford said grabbing a phone in which case there isnt much time to trap him on edge from tension and lack of sleep cavanaugh stood behind one of the three police cars that formed a barricade at the entrance to the dark street increasingly worried about jamie hed phoned the hospital before hed arrived but there had still been no word about her condition next to him rutherford and his team used nightvision binoculars to scan the handful of shadowy widely separated houses and then concentrated on the one at the end of the block perched on a bluff its lowsprawling profile would have been silhouetted against the whitecaps of the ocean if not for the numerous outdoor lights that glared around the houses perimeter several of the windows were illuminated also i still dont see any shadows moving behind the curtains an agent said maybe prescotts gone and the lights are supposed to make us believe hes there someone else said despite dry clothes cavanaugh crossed his arms over his chest trying to generate warmth continuing to feel the chill of what had happened to jamieand another chill fear you dont see movement because its not in prescotts nature to go near windows movement attracted his attention figures emerging from trees and shadows policemen escorting a family up the street toward the protection of the barricade wakened with a phone call warned not to turn on their lights they had been directed to leave their house via a back door where the heavily armed officers had been waiting is that the last of them rutherford asked six houses six families all clear a detective told him behind the barricade next to an open van equipment made scraping sounds as shadowy blackclad figures put on twowayradio gear equipment belts armored vests nightvision goggles and helmets ten members of a swat team looking like starship troopers while they checked their pistols and assault rifles rutherford went over to them cavanaugh followed on the far side of the van a middleaged male civilian one of prescotts neighbors showed the swat commander a diagram hed made of the interior of prescotts house the muted red flashlight the commander used to study it couldnt be seen beyond the van how recently were you in there the commander asked five weeks ago just before the previous owner moved jay and i were very close its a damned shame he got sick any construction work since then workmen showing up that sort of thing none that i saw okay so weve got a living room past the front door the commander said media room spare bedroom and bathroom to the right to the left the kitchen two more bedrooms and bathrooms a home office friggin big house these are french doors leading off the living room yes theres a terrace in back a waisthigh wall looks over the cliff to the water whats this area in back of the garage laundry room and this next to it a darkroom jay and i like the man became more somber and corrected himself liked to take photographs until jay got sick the commander showed the diagram to his team and explained the procedures they would use to enter when there werent any questions he nodded to rutherford ready when you are i need to emphasize we want him alive rutherford said so the government intends to make a deal with him cavanaugh thought is he armed to the best of our knowledge he has an ar converted to full automatic he also has probably more than one millimeter pistol if he fires at us you have tear gas you have flashbangs if you absolutely need to defend yourselves do your best to wound him he also has a kevlar vest cavanaugh said the swat team turned toward cavanaugh and studied him as best they could in the shadows youre the bodyguard the commander asked cavanaugh ignored the reference ive had several runins with him hes extremely dangerous the commander looked toward rutherford you said the target was a biochemist thats correct a wannabe who thinks hes a runnerandgunner and whos killed five people that we know of cavanaugh said hes intelligent he has an aptitude for this dont underestimate him well toss him so many flashbangs he wont hear for a week were you told about the weapon he developed cavanaugh asked some kind of fear thing an aerosoldelivered hormone hormone the commander gave cavanaugh a get real look most of my teams been doing this for seven years a biochemist is almost a vacation after some of what weve rammed into weve sort of gotten accustomed to being afraid to handling it i mean i understand cavanaugh said the commander studied cavanaugh as if he couldnt possibly have a background that allowed him to understand what members of a swat team felt but unless youve experienced this thing you cant realize how powerful it is cavanaugh said if you smell something pungent itll be his bowels letting go when he panics at hell on earth storming into his house the commander said i think i should go in first cavanaugh said what rutherford asked i know what to expect cavanaugh dreaded the emotions he would feel when he confronted the smell of the hormone but he couldnt let these men go first they had no idea of what would happen to them ive got a better chance to look at yourself the commander said as messed up as you are youre in no shape to go in there this guy already beat you once tonight so what makes you think he wont do it again im sure youre a good bodyguard but this is a case where professionals should do the heavy lifting the commander turned to his men lets go as angry as cavanaugh felt he gave them credit when they separated into two groups and shifted past the barricade heading through the trees and shadows on each side of the street they looked as trained and experienced as any swat group hed seen in a very few seconds they were invisible slowly one by one the lights went off in prescotts house what the someone said maybe hes finally going to bed or the lights are on timers a detective said youve got to stop this cavanaugh told rutherford in the van a policeman with headphones murmured the commander says theyll wait ten minutes and see what else happens if the target is in fact going to bed all the betterprescottll be nice and sleepy when they burst in colder cavanaugh stared at the outdoor lights of the nowdark house he felt the apprehension hed have suffered if hed been with the swat team ten minutes passed at the man with the headphones leaned from the van theyre entering cavanaugh watched dark figures emerge from the shadows rapidly they reached the glare of the outdoor lights racing across the front lawn two of them carried a compact battering ram whose handles they gripped and crashed against the front door breaking it in cavanaugh assumed that the other half of the team was using a similar battering ram to smash in through the back weapons ready the helmeted men charged inside strobe lights flashed behind the curtained windows a siren blared the shooting and screaming started my god whats happening rutherford said whats that siren what are those strobes prescott cavanaugh said the shooting and screaming worsened call for backup rutherford yelled to the radio operator in the van he drew his pistol weve got to get in there weve got to help them theyre shooting each other cavanaugh said what anything that moves if you go in there theyll shoot you too but we cant just let the shooting stopped the screams diminished as the siren persisted the strobes continued to flash behind the windows their pulse so rapid that it made cavanaugh nauseated to look at them for gods sake dont go in there until i tell you he said somebody give me a pistol youre not authorized cavanaugh grabbed a flashlight from the van as he did he noticed a pumpaction shotgun lying on a table and grabbed it also hey the radio operator said before anyone could stop him cavanaugh hurried past the barricade he reached the rustic house on the right and moved from tree to tree through the darkness darting across the big lots toward a utility pole that prescotts outdoor lights illuminated against the night sky the pole was to the right of prescotts house and the closer cavanaugh came to the strobes and the siren the more he slowed when he reached the final house on the right he veered along its murky side and crept through its narrow backyard where a waisthigh stone wall separated him from a cliff that dropped to the ocean the siren almost overwhelmed the pounding of the surf as cavanaugh came to a tall redwood fence that separated this property from prescotts past the fence the utility pole stood next to prescotts house a large gray transformer capped it cavanaugh considered climbing the fence dropping to the ground and searching for the exterior breaker box which would usually be next to the electrical meter a switch inside the box would shut off the power to the strobes and the siren but the thought of raising his head over that fence and not knowing what might confront him made him hesitate besides he took for granted that the box would be locked and that prescott would have rigged some kind of device to incapacitate anybody who might try to open it and cut off power to his house given the time pressure there was only one choice he pumped a shell into the shotguns firing chamber aimed at the transformer on top of the pole and pulled the trigger absorbing the recoil against his shoulder with a roar a teninch gap appeared in the transformer buckshot reaming it but the siren and the strobes persisted he pumped out the empty shell chambered a full one and fired a second time the roar of the shotgun accompanied by a roar and flash from the transformer sparks falling as the strobes and the siren stopped prescotts house became totally dark wary cavanaugh shifted through shadows along the fence and crouched at its end peering around it toward the front of prescotts barely visible house hurried footsteps sounded along the street urgent voices came nearer suddenly rutherford crouched next to him okay since you know so much about this now what before anybody goes in we have to break all the windows break all the so the breeze from the ocean can clear the air inside get the smell of the hormone out of the house otherwise anybody who goes in will panic enough to start firing at shadows and anybody still alive in there will do the same two fbi agents joined them across the street police officers and other agents took cover among murky trees and bushes the only sound became the muffled pounding of waves at the bottom of the cliff a moan drifted out the front door tony rutherford shouted to the swat commander no answer tony can you hear me in there still no answer that didnt mean anything cavanaugh knew if tony was all right he might not want to give his position away by answering the shout again a moan drifted from the front door rutherford pulled a walkietalkie from his belt anything from their radios over the walkietalkie crackled nothing cavanaugh heard sirens in the distance anybody who isnt dead will bleed to death if we dont get them to a hospital and prescott can pick us off as we try to go in for them what rutherford said next seemed to come out of nowhere do you know what baptists believe cavanaugh assumed he was talking to calm himself no john tell me humans are sinful truth to that cavanaugh said our only hope is gods mercy truth to that also well god have mercy rutherford said he darted toward a pine tree in front of prescotts house cavanaugh wanted to follow but his legs unexpectedly resisted imagining the smell of the hormone he felt an impulse to back away to get as far from the house as possible rutherford said something into his walkietalkie as the sirens wailed closer the fbi agents and the police officers shifted toward the house god have mercy is right cavanaugh said hearing another moan through the open front door he bolted from the fence punishing himself for having almost been a coward he raced across prescotts lawn reached a space between two windows at the front of the house pressed himself against the stone wall and smashed each of the windows with the butt of the shotgun next to him he heard other windows being smashed the agents and police officers following his example using the butts of shotguns to shatter the glass while pressing themselves against the front wall a half minute later the windows in back were shattered as well as cavanaugh waited for prescott to shoot an ocean breeze drifted through the house fluttering curtains whats that smell a police officer said get away from the house an agent yelled take cover i saw something move dont shoot till youre sure of the target rutherford yelled a policeman raced from the front of the house two agents followed scrambling toward the barricade of police cars at the end of the block cavanaugh tried to hold his breath then he had to inhale the breeze carrying the pungent smell to him even diluted it shocked his brain instantly sweat burst from his body soaking him hed have run if panic hadnt paralyzed him with tortuous slowness the breeze took the last of the hormone from the house but even though the only smell was now one of salt and kelp from the ocean cavanaugh continued to tremble living rooms clear someone shouted from inside because the team in back had followed the breeze into the house the hormone hadnt overcome them media room clear guest room clear bathroom clear beyond the broken windows flashlights zigzagged moving through the house agents and policemen slipped in through the front more flashlights zigzagged second bedroom clear second bathroom clear office clear as the litany continued and the search team shifted toward other rooms cavanaugh eased through the front door in place of the hormones pungent smell the air was filled with cordite and the coppery odor of blood move the barricade get the ambulances down here rutherford yelled into his walkietalkie cavanaugh saw him hunched over a body on the floor a flashlight showed blood on a swat uniform the man had been shot in the face as cavanaugh moved from room to room he saw more bodies more blood thank god some of the men were squirming moaning their armored vests having saved them from centerofmass damage but the wounds to their arms and legs might still cause them to bleed to death through broken windows he saw the flashing lights of two ambulances approaching the house he shifted his attention to the array of strobe lights mounted at the corner of every room sirens next to them master bedroom clear master bathroom clear garage clear laundry room clear darkroom clear amid the glare of more flashlights ambulance attendants rushed into the house and hurried from body to body doing their best to keep the wounded alive you were right rutherford said they shot at each other cavanaugh pointed the way the strobes were set up the flashes probably looked like automatic gunfire maybe they even created a flashing image of somebody with a weapon the sirens would have engaged a startle reflex wherever those guys turned they couldnt tell the difference between a threat and their own men all it took was for one of them to panic because of the hormone and start shooting others would have followed suit scared beyond any extreme theyd ever experienced they cut each other down in a cross fire professionals rutherford said just like the fifteen rangers who lost control and shot at each other in the swamp damn it wheres prescott cavanaugh asked reinforcements arrived more flashlights filling the darkness as two dozen agents and police officers searched the house repeatedly no basement no attic rutherford said its a sloped roof thered be some kind of space under it cavanaugh said two agents checked every inch of it twice prescott isnt up there as the swat team approached the house he shut off the lights cavanaugh said he rigged a motion sensor for the strobes and the siren then he slipped out the back way rutherford said check the neighboring properties search the houses get squad cars on the streets and the highway if hes on foot he cant go far well thats the problem an agent said problem there arent any cars in the garage maybe hes got a vehicle hidden around here for the first time cavanaugh heard rutherford swear rutherfords walkietalkie crackled a voice cavanaugh recognized as belonging to the vans radio operator asked is that bodyguard with you over right next to me over tell him we just got a phone call from the hospital cavanaugh sat in a corner of a blindingly bright room in intensive care across from him jamie lay unconscious her face pale ekg electrodes attached to her chest a hospital gown and a sheet covering her an iv tube leading into her left arm a respirator tube going down her throat behind her pulse blood pressure and heart monitors flashed and beeped one of her surgeons a slender hispanic turned from examining her shes remarkably strong yes cavanaugh said ill know more in twelve hours but her vitals are encouraging weve got reason to be optimistic staring at jamie cavanaugh nodded shell have you to thank the surgeon said she probably would have died before she got to the hospital if you hadnt stopped the bleeding with duct tape no cavanaugh said she doesnt have anything to thank me for at all the doctor looked curious if id listened to her cavanaugh said she never would have gotten shot the heart monitor beeped can i stay in here cavanaugh asked normally we dont allow cavanaugh looked at him yes the surgeon told him the lights cavanaugh said squinting from their brightness can you put something over her eyelids as soon as were finished in here well dim the room what about for now ill have a nurse bring a washcloth thank you thirty seconds later cavanaugh was alone with her the respirator hissed wheezed and thumped jamies chest going up and down im sorry cavanaugh told her his muscles ached his eyes felt as if sand scratched them closing his lids to shield his eyes from the stark overhead lights he leaned back in the plastic chair and managed a fitful sleep even when nurses came in to check jamie and replace her iv ch around two in the afternoon cavanaugh drove a borrowed unmarked police car along highway and stopped at the side of the road just before the carmel highlands turnoff that would eventually lead to prescotts street he got out of the car and stayed close to the trees at the side of the road as he walked toward the turnoff the afternoon was pleasant with a gorgeous sky but cavanaugh paid attention only to the high branches on the trees just in from the turnoff he approached them slowly from an oblique angle craning his neck taking off his sunglasses to get a better look at the trees when he didnt see what he wanted he raised binoculars and scanned the branches continuing to remain carefully to the side he paid particular attention to where the branches met the trunks after ten minutes a high monterey pineon the left about forty feet in from the turnoffbecame the sole object of his concentration he focused the binoculars on a gap in the branches and nodded near the entrance to prescotts street cavanaugh stopped again got out of the car and stayed well to the side as he approached the turnoff now that his eyes were practiced he took only five minutes to find the miniature tv camera its lens about the size of a flashlights attached by a metal strap to the crook of a branch in a monterey pine about thirty feet in from the entrance the strap was painted the brown of the trunk the camera was the same type that prescott had said hed hidden in the parking garage to watch for anybody who might be following him the internets crammed with advertising for them hed said check up on your babysitter see your neighbors teenaged daughter sunbathing or watch the police stake out your house and try to catch you by surprise cavanaugh thought last night prescott saw every move we made from when we drove into the highlands to when rutherford set up the roadblock here to when the swat team snuck up on the house cavanaugh recalled how the lights in prescotts house had gone off a few seconds after the swat team had started to approach it sure he thought prescott hoped that a brightly lit house would be a deterrent and buy him some time but when he saw the police move toward it he proceeded to stage two shut the lights off set the motion detectors for the strobes and the siren then filled the house with the hormone staying out of the cameras sight cavanaugh returned to the car when he drove onto prescotts street he peered toward the end of the block and for the first time got a clear look at prescotts house which was low modernistic in design and made from flat sections of stone set on top of one another flanked by shrubs a curved driveway led up to the front entrance the door to the doublecar garage was open yellow tape with police crime scene do not cross on it went from tree to tree encircling the property other things caught cavanaughs interest on the right a large truck had a platform raised next to the utility pole two workmen replacing the electrical transformer cavanaugh had shot the night before in the driveway a bearded man in coveralls was removing sheets of plywood from a pickup truck half of the broken windows in front of the house had already been covered with the wood to the left parked along the street pointing in cavanaughs direction were two police cars and an unmarked car that cavanaugh recognized as the dark sedan belonging to rutherford and some of his fellow agents cavanaugh made a uturn in front of the house doing it slowly taking the opportunity to study the corners under the houses eaves without seeming to small boxes with peepholes might have been birdhouses or they might have been receptacles for miniature tv cameras hidden under the eaves after parking in front of the police cars and walking toward the house he saw rutherford come out and study him wearily is your wifes condition any better although rutherford had changed his suit and shaved he looked haggard the lingering bruises on his face made his black skin seem pale shes still unconscious cavanaugh made himself continue but the surgeon says her life signs are better than he expected were more hopeful good rutherford sounded genuinely relieved despite the betrayed tone in what he said next incidentally i just found out her names jamie not jennifer im sorry of course i figured if i kept her real name a secret in the long run she wouldnt be involved cavanaugh said but she got involved anyway didnt she yes cavanaugh said she got involved why are you here theres nothing i can do at the hospital the waiting unable to finish the sentence cavanaugh looked around i hoped you could use my help i dont see how prescotts long gone either he had a vehicle hidden in the area or he managed to steal one rutherford said weve got an alert out to every community north and south of here highway patrol airports marinas train depots bus stations name it weve staked out the car he left at the scenic lookout in pacific grove when he made contact with you were also watching the van he told you he kept in the parking garage where he stored the porsche as the repairman nailed a plywood sheet to another broken window cavanaugh nodded toward the open front door is the lab crew finished they didnt find anything useful we confiscated prescotts computer and all the documents he had maybe theyll point us in his direction entering cavanaugh heard voices from various rooms to the right and left fbi agents and detectives presumably making a final inspection of the house in daylight the buildings sprawl was dramatic its expensive modernistic furniture matched its architecture although bullet holes had destroyed most of the chairs sofas tables and lamps the walls and framed blackandwhite photographs of the carmel region had been similarly destroyed broken glass lay everywhere through the shattered rear windows an ocean breeze dispelled any lingering odor from the bloodstains amid the chalk outlines on the hardwood floor cavanaugh stared at the strobe lights mounted in a corner their variously colored compact bulbs had been discreetly arranged to look like an abstract artwork and wouldnt have attracted suspicion if seen through a window is the casualty count still the same he asked five dead five critically wounded in stable condition it looks like theyre going to pull through something to be thankful about cavanaugh crossed the living room heading toward the french doors then ducked under more yellow crimescene tape and stepped out onto a flagstone terrace that had shrubs and flowers in pots preoccupied he peered over the waisthigh stone wall toward where a fortyfoot cliff dropped sharply to the crashing surf spray rose toward him we have boats searching for a body in the water in case prescott was crazy enough to have tried climbing down there rutherford said its worth checking doing his best to seem casual cavanaugh turned from the cliff and glimpsed two more birdhouses mounted under the eaves one to the extreme right one to the extreme left they were angled toward the opposite corners if miniature tv cameras were in them as cavanaugh was certain their position would have allowed prescott to see anyone coming around either side of the house when cavanaugh reentered the house the repairman hammered another sheet of plywood over a broken window four detectives headed out the front door two fbi agents waited for rutherford well stay and lock up after the electricitys back on and the windows are sealed rutherford said cavanaugh nodded he checked the office the bedrooms and the bathrooms he went into the garage and inspected the laundry room and the photodeveloping room all the while rutherford followed him after cavanaugh returned to the front of the house and studied it some more he finally shook his head from side to side see i told you rutherford said at least you cant blame me for trying right this is one time i cant blame you i should have stayed at the hospital no sir no change the nurse said may i help you the sinewy mustached gunstore clerk asked i need a shotgun any specific kind a remington twelvegauge pump yeah thats certainly specific you wouldnt happen to be with law enforcement no what makes you ask just that most police departments prefer that model its also the shotgun of choice for us special operations is that a fact cavanaugh said i need the strongest hacksaw youve got and several blades for it cavanaugh told the clerk at the hardware store i need a wet suit cavanaugh told the clerk at the diving shop i need an inflatable boat thatll accommodate an outboard motor cavanaugh told the clerk at the militarysurplus store in the motel room cavanaugh stared at the makeup kit jamie had left on the bureau when he phoned the hospital he was again told there was no change he pulled the mattress off the bed and used clamps that hed bought in the hardware store to secure the shotgun to the bed frame stabilizing it so the barrel protruded then he picked up the hacksaw and started sawing four inches off the barrels eighteeninch length reducing it to the compactness that many police departments preferred the effort took him an hour and several blades but he wasnt conscious of the time passinghe had a great deal to think about after another phone call to the hospital no change cavanaugh opened two boxes of federal doubleaught tactical buckshot he liked that ammunition because the large pellets gave him a compact pattern over a long distance to make the pattern even tighter he thumbed open a new emerson cqc knife that hed bought at the gun store and used its blade to cut around the plastic shaft of each shell he chose a spot about twothirds down each of them at the dividing line between the gunpowder and the pellets that would be discharged when the gunpowder was ignited he had to be careful not to cut so deeply that the plastic cylinder would break in two while he worked on it at the same time his cut had to be deep enough that twothirds of the shell would break away when the shotgun was fired the blast would thus propel not only the pellets but the plastic shaft in which they were contained the consequence would be that the pellets would not spread but would remain in a tight clump causing nearexplosive force when they hit their target after dark cavanaugh drove along highway to a low bridge located just south of point lobos near the highlands the terrain there suited his needs it was also where prescott had forced the taurus into the water he parked along the side of the road waited for a break in the passing headlights of traffic then lugged the collapsed rubber boat down the slope to the water after using a pressurized canister to inflate the boat he anchored it to a rock and made two more cautious trips back and forth from the car bringing the small outboard motor and a buoyant waterproof bag containing his equipment he had put on his wet suit in the motel room now all he had to do was take off the sport coat that disguised what he was wearing rubber gloves and divers boots protected his hands and feet as he pushed off from the rocks he started the motor and headed out to the moonlit sea staying a hundred yards offshore following the contour of the bluffs of the highlands the speckled lights of houses guiding him when he came abreast of the bluff upon which prescotts house was positioned he shut off the motor and switched to a paddle heading in silently with the electricity restored several lights around the outside of prescotts house provided a beacon but the waves and the undertow made it difficult to control the boat sweating from exertion he had to alternate between port and starboard as he paddled closer to the cliff then he got so close to the surf pounding the rocks that the boat would crash and overturn if he went any nearer spray chilled his face after putting on the wet suits rubber hood along with flippers and a face mask equipped with a snorkel he gripped the buoyant bag that contained his equipment and eased over the side for an instant the water was shockingly cold nearly robbing him of the ability to move then the water seeped into his wet suit and formed a thin layer between the wet suit and his skin almost immediately his body heated the water to its own temperature so that only his face felt cold the undertow was frighteningly strong however using all the power in his arms and legs he struggled through the turbulent waves tugging his equipment bag via a strong nylon cord looped around his left wrist a wave lifted him threatening to smash him against the looming rocks his heart raced sickeningly fast making him almost change his mind and thrash back to the boat before the current could carry the boat away but he couldnt allow himself to back off couldnt give in to his fear if he did he knew it would be the first of many times when he would give in to it the surf took him under lifted him dropped him with a mighty exhale he blew water from his snorkel and stared through his waterbeaded face mask judging the surf he worked his legs and his arms straining to avoid rocks projecting from the ocean a wave slammed him against the cliff if not for the buffer of his wet suit the granite would have flayed his shoulder wincing from the impact he grabbed for an outcrop was swept away then was caught by another wave and again slammed against the cliff but this time as he groaned his gloved hand caught a fissure in the rock he gripped harder and pawed with his other glove finding a higher fissure he pulled himself up before the next wave struck his legs and almost tugged him off the cliff as he dangled above the thunderous water cavanaugh released one hand from the cliff and pulled off his face mask and snorkel breathing greedily he dropped the mask into the waves then kicked off his flippers and dropped them also he crammed his rubberprotected feet into a niche hung for a moment sucked more air into his lungs then slowly began his ascent through the darkness spray flew around him hed cut off the tips of his rubber gloves so that his fingers would be better able to grip outcrops but the remainder of the gloves interfered with his mobility he soon had to release his hands one at a time use his teeth to pull off each glove then drop them to the waves beneath him instantly his palms were cold but not enough to immobilize his grip his fingers continuing to grab and hold he pulled himself higher the cord looped around his left wrist was attached to a spool that had a release switch hed pressed the switch just before he reached the rocks allowing the cord to unwind as the waterproof bag floated in the crashing surf thus he could climb without the weight of the bag dragging him back higher he had the sense that his fingers were bleeding they didnt matter only not giving up mattered he reached for a handhold shoved his feet into another fissure reached again and touched the rock wall at the top gaining energy from knowing that this part of the ordeal was almost over the miniature tv cameras hidden under each corner of the eaves were aimed toward each other they could show someone creeping around either corner but the limited field of vision afforded through holes in the birdhouses made it impossible for them to provide a view of the waisthigh wall above the cliff cavanaugh raised himself balanced on the walls footwide rim and pulled the cord looped around his wrist hoisting his equipment bag water dripped from the bag as he set it down throughout he studied the back of prescotts house harsh lights illuminated the corners and the french doors across from him like the shattered windows the doors were covered with sheets of plywood a padlock secured the doors yellow crimescene tape was stretched across them a police department sign nailed to the plywood warned that trespassers would be prosecuted cavanaugh unzipped the waterproof bag and pulled out the sawedoff shotgun along with a nylon bag of shells that he hitched over his right shoulder he removed the emerson knife and clipped it to the neck of his wet suit he took out a pouch of his lockpick tools finally he threw off the wet suits hood and reached into the bag for nightvision goggles that hed found at the militarysurplus store while buying the zodiac boat he draped the goggles around his neck ready he dropped to the terrace sank to the flagstones and squirmed across them toward the french doors the bottom of which was another area that the angle of the tv cameras couldnt reach when he came to a crouch he at last risked being seen as he hurriedly picked the lock he opened the doors rushed into the dark house shut the doors put on his nightvision goggles and aimed the shotgun goggles gave the dark interior a faint green illumination as he checked the wreckage of the living room and then shifted left into the media room then the guest bedroom and bathroom these areas werent his main interest but he had to make sure they werent a threat satisfied he crept toward the opposite side of the house broken glass scraping under his rubberprotected feet the vague smell of cordite still lingered in the air at once cavanaugh knew that the tv cameras had at the last moment revealed him crouching to pick the padlock and enter the house because the smell of cordite was overpowered by the sudden pungent stench of the hormone until now cavanaughs wet suit had been comfortably warm now the sweat that squirted from his body raised his temperature so much that he felt as if he were in a sauna almost dizzy from the heat under his wet suit he risked taking his right hand off the shotgun for the few seconds he needed to pull down the wet suits zipper exposing his chest the effort made no difference in karens basement he had thought hed endured the full force of the hormone but now as the smell became almost unbearable he understood that he had no idea how powerful prescotts weapon could be his legs threatened not to support him his stomach felt simultaneously scaldingly hot and polarcold his pulse was so fast he came close to fainting part of him wanted to roll into a ball and pray for this nightmare to end another part compelled him to pivot in an increasingly rapid circle pointing his shotgun anywhere and everywhere his body heat misted the faint green images of his nightvision goggles surrounded by every imaginable threat seeing through fearnarrowed vision he spotted a man with a pistol aiming at him from the corridor that led to the master bedroom he came within a millisecond of pulling the trigger then realized that the man with a pistol was merely a shadow that this was how the rangers and the swat team had reacted cavanaughs only advantage was that hed suffered the hormones effects and knew what to expect even so as the pungent smell became strong enough to make him taste bile he heard unnerving noises that he realized were pathetic whimpers forcing their way from his throat the heaving bellows of his lungs made the whimpers come and go come and go each time stronger building to a scream that he repressed by racing along the corridor to the master bedroom charging inside he didnt dare think didnt dare hesitate or secondguess himself the huge bedroom had an arcade video game next to a luxurious reading chair a large flatscreen plasma tv was mounted to the wall at the foot of the bed a cabinet of electronics next to it to the right of the tv a sliding door led into a closet that afternoon cavanaugh had looked into the closet and seen prescotts designer jackets hanging on a rod cedar shelves of expensive tank tops tshirts and sweaters behind them now he shoved a bureau from the side of the room and rammed it into the closet so hard that he broke off the pole that supported the jackets he yanked down the electronics cabinet and the plasma tv shattering its screen with the closet blocked and the wall at the foot of the bed fully exposed he pulled earplugs from his bag of shotgun shells and put them on his shaky fingers could barely do the job the pungent smell was so overpowering that he came close to bending forward and retching cursing he stepped back raised the shotgun and fired at a spot three feet from the ceiling nearly knocked back by the recoil which his shuddering body could barely support he was gratified that the almostsevered plastic shell separated from its base when the gunpowder detonated like a miniature rocket the main part of the shell and the buckshot within it roared toward the top of the wall blasting apart on impact creating a fistsized hole through which the buckshot burst like shrapnel an eerie pale light was visible through the hole cavanaugh yanked the pump on the shotguns forward grip ejecting the remainder of the empty shell chambering a full one in a fury he fired just below the ceiling again aiming toward an area three feet to the left of the first hole another miniature rocket seemed to blast a fistsized hole in the wall and another each hole revealed more of the eerie pale light the remington held four shells in its magazine and one in the firing chamber cavanaugh rapidly discharged all five blasting more holes in the wall working his way downward the odor of cordite helped to mask the stench of the hormone as he fumbled for more shells and forced his trembling fingers to shove them into the slot under the shotgun despite his earplugs he heard muffled screams behind the wall just before he started shooting again he moved the pattern of the fistsized holes lower soon reaching five feet down from the ceiling prescott screamed more fiercely behind there as cavanaugh reloaded again and fired the holes showing even more of the light the bedroom was filled with a haze of gun smoke reload fire reload fire now cavanaugh lowered his aim to three feet above the floor prescotts screams came from down there where hed taken cover as the descending movement of the blasts pressed him toward the floor you had me believing youd gone cavanaugh shouted his fear and the earplugs caused his voice to sound as if it came from a disorienting distance then i spotted the miniature tv cameras outside the house cavanaugh pumped the shotgun and blew yet another hole in the wall keeping it three feet above the floor forcing prescott to huddle in panic down there wood and plaster flew more of the glowing light was exposed so many cameras cavanaughs shout was primal cameras need monitors so where the hell are the monitors as cavanaugh blasted yet another hole in the wall the hormone made his bladder want to let go wheres the walkin closet that ought to go with a bedroom this huge cavanaugh pumped the shotgun and fired the glow of the monitors streamed through the increasing holes revealing where they were stacked on shelves against the far left side of the enclosure away from his shots it couldnt have been hard to put up a wall inside the closet something you could pivot like a door and lock on the other side again cavanaugh pulled the trigger he knew that the neighbors would hear the shots and phone the police he didnt care by the time the police arrived his business would be finished what did you do use the van from the parking garage to bring in construction supplies again cavanaughs shotgun roared your neighbors wouldnt have realized you were dividing the closet shelves for the monitors a ventilation duct connected to the main system a cot preserved food a portable toilet like the first time i met you you were in a hiding hole then youre in a hiding hole now cavanaugh pulled the trigger and blasted the middle of the wall so much light from the monitors now glowed through the holes that it compromised his nightvision goggles forcing him to raise them to his forehead everybody was so impressed by the huge tv on the wall they didnt realize you were hidden back there a couple of days from now when the police stopped searching for you around here you could have left the house after dark you could have stolen a car and been in san francisco before anybody realized the car was missing nobody would have made the connection with you especially if you remembered to wipe your fingerprints the way i taught you cavanaughs hands and face dripped with sweat as he pumped out a final empty shell and started to reload abruptly he was stunned by a chaos of bullets erupting from the ravaged wall wood and plaster flew as an assault rifle fired an automatic volley from the other side robertos ar cavanaugh thought diving to the floor his earplugs only partially muffled the stuttering clamor chunks of the wall spewed across the bedroom bullets rupturing the headboard and the wall behind cavanaugh lamps and picture frames shattered amid the widening gaps in the wall and the increasing glow of the monitors cavanaugh saw the staccato muzzle flashes at once the shooting stopped cavanaugh thought he heard a curse the scrape of metal the struggle to release a jammed cartridge the next instant what was left of the wall burst apart prescott shrieking his muscular body ramming through the cluster of holes his upper torso was bare except for the kevlar vest hed pulled over it the glow of the monitors reflected off the sweat on his powerfullooking arms and shaved scalp even in the dim light his eyes blazed the sharp contours of his jaw and chin radiated the fury of a cornered predator throwing the assault rifle while he charged he leapt over the broken tv and dove toward cavanaugh the impact was so great cavanaugh felt air being slammed from his lungs the kevlar vests rigid structure reinforced the solidity of prescotts body stunning cavanaugh to the point that his mind turned gray then prescotts powerful hands clutched cavanaughs throat sending a further shock through his nervous system breathless cavanaugh felt the bones in his throat bending inward about to snap he slammed his hands across prescotts ears so hard that prescott screamed in pain and fell back gasping for air cavanaugh rolled toward where hed dropped the shotgun but prescott kicked his hands away and got to the shotgun first pulling the trigger even with the earplugs cavanaugh wore the noise of the shell rocketing past him was overwhelming the shell hit the arcade video game the cylinder of buckshot exploding on impact blowing the machine into pieces because prescott was unfamiliar with the mechanics of the shotgun he took too long to pump out what was left of the cartridge giving cavanaugh time to charge the collision sent the two men crashing against alreadyshattered french doors plywood nailed to the doors exterior gave way cavanaugh and prescott smashing through onto the brightly lit terrace the floodlights hurt cavanaughs eyes as prescott scrambled back and raised the shotgun it wont do you any good cavanaughs voice wavered fear coursing through him the strong cool ocean breeze surged into his mouth and up his nostrils had time to reload only one shell before you crashed through the wall right prescott said cavanaugh undipped the emerson knife from the top of his wet suit and thumbed open its blade he took several deep breaths the clear air wouldnt take away the effects of the hormone but it stopped them from getting worse dummy you brought a knife to a gunfight prescott said an old joke but im the one laughing prescott pulled the trigger nothing happened schools back in session cavanaugh said as prescott gaped at the empty shotgun cavanaugh removed the plugs from his ears he heard sirens in the distance howd you like to learn about knife fighting cavanaugh lunged with the knife prescott jumped back part of it has to do with balance cavanaugh lunged again prescott dodged to the side part of it has to do with dexterity with dizzying eyeblinking speed cavanaugh flicked the dark blade back and forth up and down prescott raised the shotgun as if about to swing a baseball bat and part of it has to do with knowing which areas of the body to cut depending on if you want a quick kill cavanaugh said or a slow one prescott stood his ground he inhaled violently unintentionally warning that he was about to act then he charged as prescott swung the shotgun cavanaugh ducked nicked prescotts right arm and skipped back before prescott could swing again prescott looked shocked that his arm was bleeding the sirens wailed closer when prescott glanced in their direction cavanaugh darted forward and nicked prescotts other arm furious prescott swung the shotgun again and gasped when cavanaugh ducked it then plunged the emerson knife through the kevlar vest into prescotts stomach weakkneed prescott stumbled back in shock staring down at the bloody knife cavanaugh pulled from the bulletresistant vest blood trickled from the bottom of the vest crimson spreading down prescotts sweatpants prescotts eyes widened in denial communicating that he couldnt believe what had happened was possible the wounds too shallow to kill you for a while cavanaugh said youve still got a lot of bleeding to do how did prescotts question was a gasp surely a smart guy like you can figure that out the vests made of polymer fibers its designed to resist only the blunt force of a bullet the knifes sharp enough to slip past the fibers you pass the quiz cavanaugh jabbed again but prescott had used the pause to regroup instead of lurching farther back he surprised cavanaugh by throwing the shotgun and charging pinning cavanaughs arms to his side before cavanaugh could do anything more than nick him again with his hands clasped behind cavanaughs back prescott flexed his muscles tightening squeezing cavanaugh felt as if metal coils were around him contracting ever tighter he couldnt move his chest couldnt work his lungs staring at prescotts frenzied eyes a couple of inches away from him he suddenly felt lightheaded the floodlights on the terrace seemed to dim his arms were so tight against his sides that he couldnt use the knife he was so close to prescott that he couldnt raise his knee to kick him in the groin in desperation he hooked his right leg behind prescotts left ankle and yanked as prescott toppled backward cavanaugh pushed landing on him knocking the wind from him prescotts arms loosened just enough for cavanaugh to pull free they rolled away from each other and scrambled to their feet cavanaugh jabbed with the knife prescott dodged back cavanaugh jabbed again prescott dodged farther back hit the waisthigh wall and went over no cavanaugh shouted rushing he grabbed prescotts left arm just before he would have dropped out of sight prescott dangled his shoes scraping against the cliff he could barely speak please dont let go my shoulder still hurts from when you shot me cavanaugh stretched over the wall clinging to him im not sure how long i can hold you prescott jerked his other arm up and grabbed cavanaughs hands far below the waves pounded the rocks scared i know cavanaugh said thanks to your hormone im so frightened im not sure i can control my hands as if demonstrating the point prescotts bloodstreaked arms began to slip through cavanaughs grasp for gods sake prescott said wheres the antidote what tell me where the antidote is sirens blaring cars stopped in front of the house doors slammed tell me where the antidote is ill let you live prescotts arms slipped farther cavanaughs trembling hands weakened prescott gasped wincing cavanaugh gripped tighter wheres the antidote put your hands where i can see them rutherford yelled from the side of the house aiming a pistol at cavanaugh i guess id better do what the man says cavanaugh made a motion as if to release his hands no wait prescott said the antidote where is it in the house keep talking cavanaugh clung with all his might where i was hiding behind a monitor in a red aerosol container it better not be bug spray or ill make you wish id dropped you pull him up rutherford rounded the corner accompanied by fbi agents and police officers all aiming pistols a similarly intense group rounded the opposite corner pistols and shotguns aimed still hanging over the wall clutching prescott cavanaugh asked whats going to happen to him john will the government make a deal not anymore too many people know what happened last night the newspapers and tv stations all along the coast are asking questions so are the cable news channels the networks the east coast papers if the government bargained with a multiple killer in exchange for what he knows thered be even more questions hell be punished whatever it is it wont be enough prescott listen to me cavanaugh said pulling him up in prison youd better let yourself go to pot again because a buff guy like you will attract a lot of romantic attention from the inmates or maybe youd better take a new batch of muscle stimulant and buff yourself up even more so you can fight off all their advances youre just beginning to understand what fear is in the mercilessly bright lights of the icu room cavanaugh sat sleeplessly next to jamie watching for the slightest flicker of her eyelids the slightest twitch around her mouth the respirator had been removed from her throat her chest rose and fell on its own the flashing beeping monitors for her pulse blood pressure and heart rhythms showed steady improvement twentyfour hours and no setbacks her surgeon said an excellent sign cavanaugh nodded hoping why dont you go away for a couple of hours and get some rest the surgeon suggested if its all right with you im staying at in the morning cavanaugh noted the time precisely jamies green eyes finally opened she looked groggy dazed in pain but when she recognized him her bruised face managed a look of affection can you understand me he asked she nodded almost imperceptibly the effort tiring her in case you dont remember ill tell you often cavanaugh said as soon as youre able were going back to wyoming were heading home were staying groggy she tried to study him if id agreed to go home when you wanted you wouldnt have gotten shot i dont know how to make it up to you but somehow i will with effort she asked prescott i found him worry clouded her eyes hes alive john has him in custody cavanaugh assured her the beeping of the monitors filled the silence between them i want to prove to you how sorry i am cavanaugh said youre more important to me than anything from now on theres nothing i wont do for you her eyelids weakened im sure thats too much for you to understand right now but ill be here the next time you wake up and ill tell you again ill keep telling you cavanaugh had trouble with his voice until you forgive me cavanaugh touched her hand jamies fingers nudged his almost too faintly to be noticed but it was enough ill be here cavanaugh said feel how steady my hand is the antidote was working ill watch over you she nodded her closed eyelids relaxing as she drifted back to sleep her bruised lips formed what might have been a smile about the author my father was killed during world war ii shortly after i was born in my mother had difficulty raising me and at the same time holding
