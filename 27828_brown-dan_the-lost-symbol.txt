dan brown the lost symbol for blythe my profound thanks to three dear friends with whom i have the great luxury of working my editor jason kaufman my agent heide lange and my counselor michael rudell in addition i would like to express my immense gratitude to doubleday to my publishers around the world and of course to my readers this novel could not have been written without the generous assistance of countless individuals who shared their knowledge and expertise to all of you i extend my deep appreciation to live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering about in a great library without touching the books the secret teachings of all ages fact in a document was locked in the safe of the director of the cia the document is still there today its cryptic text includes references to an ancient portal and an unknown location underground the document also contains the phrase its buried out there somewhere all organizations in this novel exist including the freemasons the invisible college the office of security the smsc and the institute of noetic sciences all rituals science artwork and monuments in this novel are real prologue house of the temple pm the secretis how to die since the beginning of time the secret had always been how to die the thirtyfouryearold initiate gazed down at the human skull cradled in his palms the skull was hollow like a bowl filled with bloodred wine drink it he told himself you have nothing to fear as was tradition he had begun this journey adorned in the ritualistic garb of a medieval heretic being led to the gallows his loosefitting shirt gaping open to reveal his pale chest his left pant leg rolled up to the knee and his right sleeve rolled up to the elbow around his neck hung a heavy rope noose a cabletow as the brethren called it tonight however like the brethren bearing witness he was dressed as a master the assembly of brothers encircling him all were adorned in their full regalia of lambskin aprons sashes and white gloves around their necks hung ceremonial jewels that glistened like ghostly eyes in the muted light many of these men held powerful stations in life and yet the initiate knew their worldly ranks meant nothing within these walls here all men were equals sworn brothers sharing a mystical bond as he surveyed the daunting assembly the initiate wondered who on the outside would ever believe that this collection of men would assemble in one place much less this place the room looked like a holy sanctuary from the ancient world the truth however was stranger still i am just blocks away from the white house this colossal edifice located at sixteenth street nw in washington dc was a replica of a prechristian temple the temple of king mausolus the original mausoleum a place to be taken after death outside the main entrance two seventeenton sphinxes guarded the bronze doors the interior was an ornate labyrinth of ritualistic chambers halls sealed vaults libraries and even a hollow wall that held the remains of two human bodies the initiate had been told every room in this building held a secret and yet he knew no room held deeper secrets than the gigantic chamber in which he was currently kneeling with a skull cradled in his palms the temple room this room was a perfect square and cavernous the ceiling soared an astonishing one hundred feet overhead supported by monolithic columns of green granite a tiered gallery of dark russian walnut seats with handtooled pigskin encircled the room a thirtythreefoottall throne dominated the western wall with a concealed pipe organ opposite it the walls were a kaleidoscope of ancient symbols egyptian hebraic astronomical alchemical and others yet unknown tonight the temple room was lit by a series of precisely arranged candles their dim glow was aided only by a pale shaft of moonlight that filtered down through the expansive oculus in the ceiling and illuminated the rooms most startling feature an enormous altar hewn from a solid block of polished belgian black marble situated dead center of the square chamber the secret is how to die the initiate reminded himself it is time a voice whispered the initiate let his gaze climb the distinguished whiterobed figure standing before him the supreme worshipful master the man in his late fifties was an american icon well loved robust and incalculably wealthy his oncedark hair was turning silver and his famous visage reflected a lifetime of power and a vigorous intellect take the oath the worshipful master said his voice soft like falling snow complete your journey the initiates journey like all such journeys had begun at the first degree on that night in a ritual similar to this one the worshipful master had blindfolded him with a velvet hoodwink and pressed a ceremonial dagger to his bare chest demanding do you seriously declare on your honor uninfluenced by mercenary or any other unworthy motive that you freely and voluntarily offer yourself as a candidate for the mysteries and privileges of this brotherhood i do the initiate had lied then let this be a sting to your consciousness the master had warned him as well as instant death should you ever betray the secrets to be imparted to you at the time the initiate had felt no fear they will never know my true purpose here tonight however he sensed a foreboding solemnity in the temple room and his mind began replaying all the dire warnings he had been given on his journey threats of terrible consequences if he ever shared the ancient secrets he was about to learn throat cut from ear to ear tongue torn out by its roots bowels taken out and burned scattered to the four winds of heaven heart plucked out and given to the beasts of the field brother the grayeyed master said placing his left hand on the initiates shoulder take the final oath steeling himself for the last step of his journey the initiate shifted his muscular frame and turned his attention back to the skull cradled in his palms the crimson wine looked almost black in the dim candlelight the chamber had fallen deathly silent and he could feel all of the witnesses watching him waiting for him to take his final oath and join their elite ranks tonight he thought something is taking place within these walls that has never before occurred in the history of this brotherhood not once in centuries he knew it would be the spark and it would give him unfathomable power energized he drew a breath and spoke aloud the same words that countless men had spoken before him in countries all over the world may this wine i now drink become a deadly poison to me should i ever knowingly or willfully violate my oath his words echoed in the hollow space then all was quiet steadying his hands the initiate raised the skull to his mouth and felt his lips touch the dry bone he closed his eyes and tipped the skull toward his mouth drinking the wine in long deep swallows when the last drop was gone he lowered the skull for an instant he thought he felt his lungs growing tight and his heart began to pound wildly my god they know then as quickly as it came the feeling passed a pleasant warmth began to stream through his body the initiate exhaled smiling inwardly as he gazed up at the unsuspecting grayeyed man who had foolishly admitted him into this brotherhoods most secretive ranks soon you will lose everything you hold most dear chapter the otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the eiffel tower was overflowing with tourists inside the cramped lift an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him you look pale son you should have stayed on the ground im okay the boy answered struggling to control his anxiety ill get out on the next level i cant breathe the man leaned closer i thought by now you would have gotten over this he brushed the childs cheek affectionately the boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears i cant breathe ive got to get out of this box the elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lifts articulated pistons and puddlediron construction far beneath them the streets of paris stretched out in all directions almost there the boy told himself craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform just hold on as the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck the shaft began to narrow its massive struts contracting into a tight vertical tunnel dad i dont think suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead the carriage jerked swaying awkwardly to one side frayed cables began whipping around the carriage thrashing like snakes the boy reached out for his father dad their eyes locked for one terrifying second then the bottom dropped out robert langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat startling out of the semiconscious daydream he was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a falcon ex corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence in the background the dual pratt whitney engines hummed evenly mr langdon the intercom crackled overhead were on final approach langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag hed been halfway through reviewing masonic symbology when his mind had drifted the daydream about his late father langdon suspected had been stirred by this mornings unexpected invitation from langdons longtime mentor peter solomon the other man i never want to disappoint the fiftyeightyearold philanthropist historian and scientist had taken langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago in many ways filling the void left by langdons fathers death despite the mans influential family dynasty and massive wealth langdon had found humility and warmth in solomons soft gray eyes outside the window the sun had set but langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the worlds largest obelisk rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon the foot marblefaced obelisk marked this nations heart all around the spire the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward even from the air washington dc exuded an almost mystical power langdon loved this city and as the jet touched down he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead the jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of dulles international airport and came to a stop langdon gathered his things thanked the pilots and stepped out of the jets luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase the cold january air felt liberating breathe robert he thought appreciating the wideopen spaces a blanket of white fog crept across the runway and langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac hello hello a singsong british voice shouted from across the tarmac professor langdon langdon looked up to see a middleaged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him waving happily as he approached curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat welcome to washington sir langdon smiled thank you my name is pam from passenger services the woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling if youll come with me sir your car is waiting langdon followed her across the runway toward the signature terminal which was surrounded by glistening private jets a taxi stand for the rich and famous i hate to embarrass you professor the woman said sounding sheepish but you are the robert langdon who writes books about symbols and religion arent you langdon hesitated and then nodded i thought so she said beaming my book group read your book about the sacred feminine and the church what a delicious scandal that one caused you do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse langdon smiled scandal wasnt really my intention the woman seemed to sense langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work im sorry listen to me rattling on i know you probably get tired of being recognized but its your own fault she playfully motioned to his clothing your uniform gave you away my uniform langdon glanced down at his attire he was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck harris tweed jacket khakis and collegiate cordovan loafers his standard attire for the classroom lecture circuit author photos and social events the woman laughed those turtlenecks you wear are so dated youd look much sharper in a tie no chance langdon thought little nooses neckties had been required six days a week when langdon attended phillips exeter academy and despite the headmasters romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia worn by roman orators to warm their vocal cords langdon knew that etymologically cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of croat mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle to this day this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles thanks for the advice langdon said with a chuckle ill consider a tie in the future mercifully a professionallooking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek lincoln town car parked near the terminal and held up his finger mr langdon im charles with beltway limousine he opened the passenger door good evening sir welcome to washington langdon tipped pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the town car the driver showed him the temperature controls the bottled water and the basket of hot muffins seconds later langdon was speeding away on a private access road so this is how the other half lives as the driver gunned the car up windsock drive he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call this is beltway limousine the driver said with professional efficiency i was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed he paused yes sir your guest mr langdon has arrived and i will deliver him to the capitol building by seven pm youre welcome sir he hung up langdon had to smile no stone left unturned peter solomons attention to detail was one of his most potent assets allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease a few billion dollars in the bank doesnt hurt either langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him the us capitol was a half hour away and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts everything had happened so quickly today that langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead arriving under a veil of secrecy langdon thought amused by the prospect ten miles from the capitol building a lone figure was eagerly preparing for robert langdons arrival chapter the one who called himself malakh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head sighing with pleasure as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh the soft hum of the electric device was addictive as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye i am a masterpiece the goal of tattooing was never beauty the goal was change from the scarified nubian priests of bc to the tattooed acolytes of the cybele cult of ancient rome to the moko scars of the modern maori humans have tattooed themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice enduring the physical pain of embellishment and emerging changed beings despite the ominous admonitions of leviticus which forbade the marking of ones flesh tattoos had become a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age everyone from cleancut teenagers to hardcore drug users to suburban housewives the act of tattooing ones skin was a transformative declaration of power an announcement to the world i am in control of my own flesh the intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted millions to fleshaltering practices cosmetic surgery body piercing bodybuilding and steroids even bulimia and transgendering the human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell a single bell chimed on malakhs grandfather clock and he looked up six thirty pm leaving his tools he wrapped the kiryu silk robe around his naked sixfootthree body and strode down the hall the air inside this sprawling mansion was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles the towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless italian antiques a piranesi etching a savonarola chair a silver bugarini oil lamp he glanced through a floortoceiling window as he passed admiring the classical skyline in the distance the luminous dome of the us capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky this is where it is hidden he thought it is buried out there somewhere few men knew it existed and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden to this day it remained this countrys greatest untold secret those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols legends and allegory now they have opened their doors to me malakh thought three weeks ago in a dark ritual witnessed by americas most influential men malakh had ascended to the thirtythird degree the highest echelon of the worlds oldest surviving brotherhood despite malakhs new rank the brethren had told him nothing nor will they he knew that was not how it worked there were circles within circles brotherhoods within brotherhoods even if malakh waited years he might never earn their ultimate trust fortunately he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret my initiation served its purpose now energized by what lay ahead he strode toward his bedroom throughout his entire home audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the lux aeterna from the verdi requiem a reminder of a previous life malakh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering dies irae then against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths he bounded up the marble staircase his robe billowing as he ascended on sinewy legs as he ran his empty stomach growled in protest for two days now malakh had fasted consuming only water preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways your hunger will be satisfied by dawn he reminded himself along with your pain malakh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence locking the door behind him as he moved toward his dressing area he paused feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror unable to resist he turned and faced his own reflection slowly as if unwrapping a priceless gift malakh opened his robe to unveil his naked form the vision awed him i am a masterpiece his massive body was shaved and smooth he lowered his gaze first to his feet which were tattooed with the scales and talons of a hawk above that his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars his left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated boaz and jachin his groin and abdomen formed a decorated archway above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the doubleheaded phoenix each head in profile with its visible eye formed by one of malakhs nipples his shoulders neck face and shaved head were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils i am an artifact an evolving icon one mortal man had seen malakh naked eighteen hours earlier the man had shouted in fear good god youre a demon if you perceive me as such malakh had replied understanding as had the ancients that angels and demons were identical interchangeable archetypes all a matter of polarity the guardian angel who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer malakh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head there within the crownlike halo shone a small circle of pale untattooed flesh this carefully guarded canvas was malakhs only remaining piece of virgin skin the sacred space had waited patiently and tonight it would be filled although malakh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece he knew the moment was fast approaching exhilarated by his reflection he could already feel his power growing he closed his robe and walked to the window again gazing out at the mystical city before him it is buried out there somewhere refocusing on the task at hand malakh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a base of concealer makeup to his face scalp and neck until his tattoos had disappeared then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening when he finished he checked himself in the mirror satisfied he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled it is out there he thought and tonight one man will help me find it as malakh exited his home he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the us capitol building he had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight and now at last his final pawn had entered the game chapter robert langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the town cars tires changed pitch on the road beneath him langdon glanced up surprised to see where they were memorial bridge already he put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the potomac passing beneath him a heavy mist hovered on the surface aptly named foggy bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nations capital of all the places in the new world the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society langdon gazed left across the tidal basin toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the jefferson memorial americas pantheon as many called it directly in front of the car the lincoln memorial rose with rigid austerity its orthogonal lines reminiscent of athenss ancient parthenon but it was farther away that langdon saw the citys centerpiece the same spire he had seen from the air its architectural inspiration was far far older than the romans or the greeks americas egyptian obelisk the monolithic spire of the washington monument loomed dead ahead illuminated against the sky like the majestic mast of a ship from langdons oblique angle the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea langdon felt similarly ungrounded his visit to washington had been utterly unexpected i woke up this morning anticipating a quiet sunday at home and now im a few minutes away from the us capitol this morning at four fortyfive langdon had plunged into deadcalm water beginning his day as he always did swimming fifty laps in the deserted harvard pool his physique was not quite what it had been in his college days as a waterpolo allamerican but he was still lean and toned respectable for a man in his forties the only difference now was the amount of effort it took langdon to keep it that way when langdon arrived home around six he began his morning ritual of handgrinding sumatra coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen this morning however he was surprised to see the blinking red light on his voicemail display who calls at six am on a sunday he pressed the button and listened to the message good morning professor langdon im terribly sorry for this earlymorning call the polite voice was noticeably hesitant with a hint of a southern accent my name is anthony jelbart and im peter solomons executive assistant mr solomon told me youre an early riser he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice as soon as you receive this message would you be so kind as to call peter directly you probably have his new private line but if not its langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend peter solomon was impeccably wellbred and courteous and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a sunday unless something was very wrong langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call i hope hes okay peter solomon had been a friend mentor and although only twelve years langdons senior a father figure to him ever since their first meeting at princeton university as a sophomore langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the wellknown young historian and philanthropist solomon had spoken with a contagious passion presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols it was not peter solomons brilliance however but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given langdon the courage to write him a thankyou letter the young sophomore had never dreamed that peter solomon one of americas wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals would ever write back but solomon did and it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship a prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage peter solomon came from the ultrawealthy solomon family whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation like the rothschilds in europe the surname solomon had always carried the mystique of american royalty and success peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father and now at fiftyeight he had held numerous positions of power in his life he currently served as the head of the smithsonian institution langdon occasionally ribbed peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a secondrate university yale now as langdon entered his study he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from peter as well peter solomon office of the secretary the smithsonian institution good morning robert i need to speak with you at once please call me this morning as soon as you can at peter langdon immediately dialed the number sitting down at his handcarved oak desk to wait as the call went through office of peter solomon the familiar voice of the assistant answered this is anthony may i help you hello this is robert langdon you left me a message earlier yes professor langdon the young man sounded relieved thank you for calling back so quickly mr solomon is eager to speak to you let me tell him youre on the line may i put you on hold of course as langdon waited for solomon to get on the line he gazed down at peters name atop the smithsonian letterhead and had to smile not many slackers in the solomon clan peters ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates influential politicians and a number of distinguished scientists some even fellows of londons royal society solomons only living family member his younger sister katherine had apparently inherited the science gene because she was now a leading figure in a new cuttingedge discipline called noetic science all greek to me langdon thought amused to recall katherines unsuccessful attempt to explain noetic science to him at a party at her brothers home last year langdon had listened carefully and then replied sounds more like magic than science katherine winked playfully theyre closer than you think robert now solomons assistant returned to the phone im sorry mr solomon is trying to get off a conference call things are a little chaotic here this morning thats not a problem i can easily call back actually he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you if you dont mind of course not the assistant inhaled deeply as you probably know professor every year here in washington the board of the smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters many of the countrys cultural elite attend langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite but he wondered if maybe solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless this year as is customary the assistant continued the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address weve been lucky enough to secure the national statuary hall for that speech the best room in all of dc langdon thought recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall it was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc surrounded by thirtyeight lifesize statues in a room that had once served as the nations original house of representatives chamber the problem is this the man said our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address he paused awkwardly this means we are desperate for a replacement speaker and mr solomon is hoping you would consider filling in langdon did a double take me this was not at all what he had expected im sure peter could find a far better substitute youre mr solomons first choice professor and youre being much too modest the institutions guests would be thrilled to hear from you and mr solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on bookspan tv a few years back that way you wouldnt have to prepare a thing he said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nations capital it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue langdon was not so sure if i recall that lecture had more to do with the masonic history of the building than exactly as you know mr solomon is a mason as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance im sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic i admit it would be easy langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk hed ever given i suppose i could consider it what date is the event the assistant cleared his throat sounding suddenly uncomfortable well actually sir its tonight langdon laughed out loud tonight thats why its so hectic here this morning the smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament the assistant spoke more hurriedly now mr solomon is ready to send a private jet to boston for you the flight is only an hour and you would be back home before midnight youre familiar with the private air terminal at bostons logan airport i am langdon admitted reluctantly no wonder peter always gets his way wonderful would you be willing to meet the jet there at say five oclock you havent left me much choice have you langdon chuckled i just want to make mr solomon happy sir peter has that effect on people langdon considered it a long moment seeing no way out all right tell him i can do it outstanding the assistant exclaimed sounding deeply relieved he gave langdon the jets tail number and various other information when langdon finally hung up he wondered if peter solomon had ever been told no returning to his coffee preparation langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder a little extra caffeine this morning he thought its going to be a long day chapter the us capitol building stands regally at the eastern end of the national mall on a raised plateau that city designer pierre lenfant described as a pedestal waiting for a monument the capitols massive footprint measures more than feet in length and feet deep housing more than sixteen acres of floor space it contains an astonishing rooms the neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo the grandeur of ancient rome whose ideals were the inspiration for americas founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic the new security checkpoint for tourists entering the capitol building is located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the capitol dome newly hired security guard alfonso nuсez carefully studied the male visitor now approaching his checkpoint the man had a shaved head and had been lingering in the lobby completing a phone call before entering the building his right arm was in a sling and he moved with a slight limp he was wearing a tattered armynavy surplus coat which combined with his shaved head made nuсez guess military those who had served in the us armed forces were among the most common visitors to washington good evening sir nuсez said following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone hello the visitor said glancing around at the nearly deserted entry quiet night nfc playoffs nuсez replied everyones watching the redskins tonight nuсez wished he were too but this was his first month on the job and hed drawn the short straw metal objects in the dish please as the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand nuсez watched him carefully human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped but it was an instinct nuсez had been trained to override nuсez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change keys and a couple of cell phones sprain nuсez asked eyeing the mans injured hand which appeared to be wrapped in a series of thick ace bandages the bald man nodded slipped on the ice a week ago still hurts like hell sorry to hear that walk through please the visitor limped through the detector and the machine buzzed in protest the visitor frowned i was afraid of that im wearing a ring under these bandages my finger was too swollen to get it off so the doctors wrapped right over it no problem nuсez said ill use the wand nuсez ran the metaldetection wand over the visitors wrapped hand as expected the only metal he detected was a large lump on the mans injured ring finger nuсez took his time rubbing the metal detector over every inch of the mans sling and finger he knew his supervisor was probably monitoring him on the closed circuit in the buildings security center and nuсez needed this job always better to be cautious he carefully slid the wand up inside the mans sling the visitor winced in pain sorry its okay the man said you cant be too careful these days aint that the truth nuсez liked this guy strangely that counted for a lot around here human instinct was americas first line of defense against terrorism it was a proven fact that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear in the world the gift of fear as one of their security reference books termed it in this case nuсezs instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear the only oddity that he noticed now that they were standing so close was that this toughlooking guy appeared to have used some kind of selftanner or concealer makeup on his face whatever everyone hates to be pale in the winter youre fine nuсez said completing his sweep and stowing the wand thanks the man started collecting his belongings from the tray as he did nuсez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore a tattoo the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown and the tip of his thumb bore that of a star seems everyone has tattoos these days nuсez thought although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them those tats hurt the man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled less than you might think lucky nuсez said mine hurt a lot i got a mermaid on my back when i was in boot camp a mermaid the bald man chuckled yeah he said feeling sheepish the mistakes we make in our youth i hear you the bald man said i made a big mistake in my youth too now i wake up with her every morning they both laughed as the man headed off childs play malakh thought as he moved past nuсez and up the escalator toward the capitol building the entry had been easier than anticipated malakhs slouching posture and padded belly had hidden his true physique while the makeup on his face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body the true genius however was the sling which disguised the potent object malakh was transporting into the building a gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what i seek chapter the worlds largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the worlds bestkept secrets it houses more pieces than the hermitage the vatican museum and the new york metropolitan combined yet despite its magnificent collection few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls located at silver hill road just outside of washington dc the museum is a massive zigzagshaped edifice constructed of five interconnected pods each pod larger than a football field the buildings bluish metal exterior barely hints at the strangeness within a sixhundredthousandsquarefoot alien world that contains a dead zone a wet pod and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets tonight scientist katherine solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white volvo up to the buildings main security gate the guard smiled not a football fan ms solomon he lowered the volume on the redskins playoff pregame show katherine forced a tense smile its sunday night oh thats right your meeting is he here yet she asked anxiously he glanced down at his paperwork i dont see him on the log im early katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking spot at the bottom of the small twotiered lot she began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror more out of force of habit than actual vanity katherine solomon had been blessed with the resilient mediterranean skin of her ancestry and even at fifty years old she had a smooth olive complexion she used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair unstyled and down like her older brother peter she had gray eyes and a slender patrician elegance you two might as well be twins people often told them their father had succumbed to cancer when katherine was only seven and she had little memory of him her brother eight years katherines senior and only fifteen when their father died had begun his journey toward becoming the solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed as expected though peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name to this day he still watched over katherine as though they were just kids despite her brothers occasional prodding and no shortage of suitors katherine had never married science had become her life partner and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be katherine had no regrets her field of choice noetic science had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it but in recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind our untapped potential is truly shocking katherines two books on noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field but her most recent discoveries when published promised to make noetic science a topic of mainstream conversation around the world tonight however science was the last thing on her mind earlier in the day she had received some truly upsetting information relating to her brother i still cant believe its true shed thought of nothing else all afternoon a pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield and katherine quickly gathered her things to get inside she was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang she checked the caller id and inhaled deeply then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call six miles away malakh was moving through the corridors of the us capitol building with a cell phone pressed to his ear he waited patiently as the line rang finally a womans voice answered yes we need to meet again malakh said there was a long pause is everything all right i have new information malakh said tell me malakh took a deep breath that which your brother believes is hidden in dc yes it can be found katherine solomon sounded stunned youre telling me it is real malakh smiled to himself sometimes a legend that endures for centuries endures for a reason chapter is this as close as you can get robert langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked on first street a good quarter mile from the capitol building afraid so the driver said homeland security no vehicles near landmark buildings anymore im sorry sir langdon checked his watch startled to see it was already a construction zone around the national mall had slowed them down and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes weathers turning the driver said hopping out and opening langdons door for him youll want to hurry langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver but the man waved him off your host already added a very generous tip to the charge typical peter langdon thought gathering his things okay thanks for the ride the first few raindrops began to fall as langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse that descended to the new underground visitors entrance the capitol visitor center had been a costly and controversial project described as an underground city to rival parts of disney world this subterranean space reportedly provided over a halfmillion square feet of space for exhibits restaurants and meeting halls langdon had been looking forward to seeing it although he hadnt anticipated quite this long a walk the skies were threatening to open at any moment and he broke into a jog his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement i dressed for a lecture not a fourhundredyard downhill dash through the rain when he arrived at the bottom he was breathless and panting langdon pushed through the revolving door taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain as he did he raised his eyes to the newly completed space before him okay im impressed the capitol visitor center was not at all what he had expected because the space was underground langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it a childhood accident had left him stranded at the bottom of a deep well overnight and langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to enclosed spaces but this underground space was airy somehow light spacious the ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted glow across the pearlcolored interior finishes normally langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture but with five minutes until showtime he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint and escalators relax he told himself peter knows youre on your way the event wont start without you at the security point a young hispanic guard chatted with him while langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch mickey mouse the guard said sounding mildly amused langdon nodded accustomed to the comments the collectors edition mickey mouse watch had been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday i wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously i dont think its working the guard said with a smile you look like youre in a serious hurry langdon smiled and put his daybag through the xray machine which way to the statuary hall the guard motioned toward the escalators youll see the signs thanks langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on as the escalator ascended langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts he gazed up through the rainspeckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated capitol dome overhead it was an astonishing building high atop her roof almost three hundred feet in the air the statue of freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteenandahalffoot bronze statue to her perch were slaves a capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes this entire building in fact was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a killer bathtub responsible for the pneumonic murder of vice president henry wilson a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in discovered general john alexander logans longdeceased stuffed horse no legends were as enduring however as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building the spirit of city designer pierre lenfant frequently was reported wandering the halls seeking payment of his bill now two hundred years overdue the ghost of a worker who fell from the capitol dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools and of course the most famous apparition of all reported numerous times in the capitol basement an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructures eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch three minutes he hurried down the wide corridor following the signs toward the statuary hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head langdon had to admit that peters assistant had been correct this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in washington dc by a prominent mason it was no secret that dc had a rich masonic history the cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full masonic ritual by george washington himself this city had been conceived and designed by master masons george washington ben franklin and pierre lenfant powerful minds who adorned their new capital with masonic symbolism architecture and art of course people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas many conspiracy theorists claimed the masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout washington along with symbolic messages hidden in the citys layout of streets langdon never paid any attention misinformation about the masons was so commonplace that even educated harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped conceptions about the brotherhood last year a freshman had rushed wildeyed into langdons classroom with a printout from the web it was a street map of dc on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes satanic pentacles a masonic compass and square the head of baphomet proof apparently that the masons who designed washington dc were involved in some kind of dark mystical conspiracy fun langdon said but hardly convincing if you draw enough intersecting lines on a map youre bound to find all kinds of shapes but this cant be coincidence the kid exclaimed langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of detroit the kid seemed sorely disappointed dont be disheartened langdon said washington does have some incredible secrets just none on this street map the young man perked up secrets like what every spring i teach a course called occult symbols i talk a lot about dc you should take the course occult symbols the freshman looked excited again so there are devil symbols in dc langdon smiled sorry but the word occult despite conjuring images of devil worship actually means hidden or obscured in times of religious oppression knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or occult and because the church felt threatened by this they redefined anything occult as evil and the prejudice survived oh the kid slumped nonetheless that spring langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled into harvards sanders theatre a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches good morning everybody langdon shouted from the expansive stage he turned on a slide projector and an image materialized behind him as youre getting settled how many of you recognize the building in this picture us capitol dozens of voices called out in unison washington dc yes there are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome an unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the s awesome somebody shouted langdon rolled his eyes wishing somebody would ban that word okay and how many of you have ever been to washington a scattering of hands went up so few langdon feigned surprise and how many of you have been to rome paris madrid or london almost all the hands in the room went up as usual one of the rites of passage for american college kids was a summer with a eurorail ticket before the harsh reality of real life set in it appears many more of you have visited europe than have visited your own capital why do you think that is no drinking age in europe someone in back shouted langdon smiled as if the drinking age here stops any of you everyone laughed it was the first day of school and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled shifting and creaking in their wooden pews langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews seriously langdon said washington dc has some of the worlds finest architecture art and symbolism why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital ancient stuff is cooler someone said and by ancient stuff langdon clarified i assume you mean castles crypts temples that sort of thing their heads nodded in unison okay now what if i told you that washington dc has every one of those things castles crypts pyramids temples its all there the creaking diminished my friends langdon said lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage in the next hour you will discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history and exactly as in europe all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view the wooden pews fell dead silent gotcha langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide who can tell me what george washington is doing here the slide was a famous mural depicting george washington dressed in full masonic regalia standing before an oddlooking contraption a giant wooden tripod that supported a ropeandpulley system from which was suspended a massive block of stone a group of welldressed onlookers stood around him lifting that big block of stone someone ventured langdon said nothing preferring that a student make the correction if possible actually another student offered i think washington is lowering the rock hes wearing a masonic costume ive seen pictures of masons laying cornerstones before the ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone excellent langdon said the mural portrays the father of our country using a tripod and pulley to lay the cornerstone of our capitol building on september between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty langdon paused scanning the class can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time silence what if i told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous masons george washington benjamin franklin and pierre lenfant the primary architect for dc more silence quite simply the cornerstone was set at that date and time because among other things the auspicious caput draconis was in virgo everyone exchanged odd looks hold on someone said you mean like astrology exactly although a different astrology than we know today a hand went up you mean our founding fathers believed in astrology langdon grinned bigtime what would you say if i told you the city of washington dc has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world zodiacs star charts cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times more than half of the framers of our constitution were masons men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world but that whole thing about the capitol cornerstone being laid while caput draconis was in virgo who cares cant that just be coincidence an impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up federal triangle the capitol the white house the washington monument were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition langdons gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes a number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes a hand in back went up why did they do that langdon chuckled the answer to that is an entire semesters worth of material if youre curious you should take my mysticism course frankly i dont think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer what the person shouted try us langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head toying with them sorry i cant do that some of you are only freshmen im afraid it might blow your minds tell us everyone shouted langdon shrugged perhaps you should join the masons or eastern star and learn about it from the source we cant get in a young man argued the masons are like a supersecret society supersecret really langdon remembered the large masonic ring that his friend peter solomon wore proudly on his right hand then why do masons wear obvious masonic rings tie clips or pins why are masonic buildings clearly marked why are their meeting times in the newspaper langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces my friends the masons are not a secret society they are a society with secrets same thing someone muttered is it langdon challenged would you consider cocacola a secret society of course not the student said well what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for classic coke theyd never tell you exactly in order to learn cocacolas deepest secret you would need to join the company work for many years prove you were trustworthy and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company where that information might be shared with you then you would be sworn to secrecy so youre saying freemasonry is like a corporation only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously my uncle is a mason a young woman piped up and my aunt hates it because he wont talk about it with her she says masonry is some kind of strange religion a common misperception its not a religion give it the litmus test langdon said who here has taken professor witherspoons comparative religion course several hands went up good so tell me what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion abc one woman offered assure believe convert correct langdon said religions assure salvation religions believe in a precise theology and religions convert nonbelievers he paused masonry however is batting zero for three masons make no promises of salvation they have no specific theology and they do not seek to convert you in fact within masonic lodges discussions of religion are prohibited so masonry is anti religious on the contrary one of the prerequisites for becoming a mason is that you must believe in a higher power the difference between masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power rather than definitive theological identities like god allah buddha or jesus the masons use more general terms like supreme being or great architect of the universe this enables masons of different faiths to gather together sounds a little farout someone said or perhaps refreshingly openminded langdon offered in this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of god is better one could say the masonic tradition of tolerance and openmindedness is commendable langdon paced the stage moreover masonry is open to men of all races colors and creeds and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way doesnt discriminate a member of the universitys womens center stood up how many women are permitted to be masons professor langdon langdon showed his palms in surrender a fair point freemasonry had its roots traditionally in the stone masons guilds of europe and was therefore a mans organization several hundred years ago some say as early as a womens branch called eastern star was founded they have more than a million members nonetheless the woman said masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded langdon was not sure how powerful the masons really were anymore and he was not going to go down that road perceptions of the modern masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dressup all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world the truth no doubt was somewhere in the middle professor langdon called a young man with curly hair in the back row if masonry is not a secret society not a corporation and not a religion then what is it well if you were to ask a mason he would offer the following definition masonry is a system of morality veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols sounds to me like a euphemism for freaky cult freaky you say hell yes the kid said standing up i heard what they do inside those secret buildings weird candlelight rituals with coffins and nooses and drinking wine out of skulls now thats freaky langdon scanned the class does that sound freaky to anyone else yes they all chimed in langdon feigned a sad sigh too bad if thats too freaky for you then i know youll never want to join my cult silence settled over the room the student from the womens center looked uneasy youre in a cult langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper dont tell anyone but on the pagan day of the sun god ra i kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh the class looked horrified langdon shrugged and if any of you care to join me come to the harvard chapel on sunday kneel beneath the crucifix and take holy communion the classroom remained silent langdon winked open your minds my friends we all fear what we do not understand the tolling of a clock began echoing through the capitol corridors seven oclock robert langdon was now running talk about a dramatic entrance passing through the house connecting corridor he spotted the entrance to the national statuary hall and headed straight for it as he neared the door he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths buttoning his jacket he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded showtime as professor robert langdon strode into the national statuary hall he raised his eyes and smiled warmly an instant later his smile evaporated he stopped dead in his tracks something was very very wrong chapter katherine solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater as she neared the buildings main entrance the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder she barely heard them her ears still ringing from the phone call shed just received that which your brother believes is hidden in dc it can be found katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe she and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening reaching the main doors she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building nobody knows this place is here the sign on the door announced smithsonian museum support center smsc the smithsonian institution despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the national mall had a collection so huge that only percent of it could be on display at any one time the other percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere and that somewhere was here not surprisingly this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts giant buddhas handwritten codices poisoned darts from new guinea jewelencrusted knives a kayak made of baleen equally mindboggling were the buildings natural treasures plesiosaur skeletons a priceless meteorite collection a giant squid even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an african safari by teddy roosevelt but none of this was why the smithsonian secretary peter solomon had introduced his sister to the smsc three years ago he had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels but rather to create them and that was exactly what katherine had been doing deep within this building in the darkness of the most remote recesses was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world the recent breakthroughs katherine had made here in the field of noetic science had ramifications across every discipline from physics to history to philosophy to religion soon everything will change she thought as katherine entered the lobby the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears ms solomon he smiled broadly redskins he blushed looking guilty pregame she smiled i wont tell she walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets when she slid the gold cartier watch from her wrist she felt the usual pang of sadness the timepiece had been a gift from her mother for katherines eighteenth birthday almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently passing away in katherines arms so ms solomon the guard whispered jokingly are you ever gonna tell anybody what youre doing back there she glanced up someday kyle not tonight come on he pressed a secret lab in a secret museum you must be doing something cool miles beyond cool katherine thought as she collected her things the truth was that katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science chapter robert langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the national statuary hall and studied the startling scene before him the room was precisely as he remembered it a balanced semicircle built in the style of a greek amphitheater the graceful arched walls of sandstone and italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia interspersed with the nations statuary collection lifesize statues of thirtyeight great americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of blackandwhite marble tile it was exactly as langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here except for one thing tonight the room was empty no chairs no audience no peter solomon just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly oblivious to langdons grand entrance did peter mean the rotunda he peered down the south corridor toward the rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there too the echoes of the clock chime had faded langdon was now officially late he hurried back into the hallway and found a docent excuse me the lecture for the smithsonian event tonight where is that being held the docent hesitated im not sure sir when does it start now the man shook his head i dont know about any smithsonian event this evening not here at least bewildered langdon hurried back toward the center of the room scanning the entire space is solomon playing some kind of joke langdon couldnt imagine it he pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed peters number his phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building finally it began to ring the familiar southern accent answered peter solomons office this is anthony may i help you anthony langdon said with relief im glad youre still there this is robert langdon there seems to be some confusion about the lecture im standing in the statuary hall but theres nobody here has the lecture been moved to a different room i dont believe so sir let me check his assistant paused a moment did you confirm with mr solomon directly langdon was confused no i confirmed with you anthony this morning yes i recall that there was a silence on the line that was a bit careless of you dont you think professor langdon was now fully alert i beg your pardon consider this the man said you received a fax asking you to call a number which you did you spoke to a total stranger who said he was peter solomons assistant then you willingly boarded a private plane to washington and climbed into a waiting car is that right langdon felt a chill race through his body who the hell is this where is peter im afraid peter solomon has no idea youre in washington today the mans southern accent disappeared and his voice morphed into a deeper mellifluous whisper you are here mr langdon because i want you here chapter inside the statuary hall robert langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle who the hell are you the mans reply was a silky calm whisper do not be alarmed professor you have been summoned here for a reason summoned langdon felt like a caged animal try kidnapped hardly the mans voice was eerily serene if i wanted to harm you you would be dead in your town car right now he let the words hang for a moment my intentions are purely noble i assure you i would simply like to offer you an invitation no thanks ever since his experiences in europe over the last several years langdons unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nutcases and this one had just crossed a very serious line look i dont know what the hell is going on here but im hanging up unwise said the man your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save peter solomons soul langdon drew a sharp breath what did you say im sure you heard me the way this man had uttered peters name had stopped langdon cold what do you know about peter at this point i know his deepest secrets mr solomon is my guest and i can be a persuasive host this cant be happening you dont have peter i answered his private cell phone that should give you pause im calling the police no need the man said the authorities will join you momentarily what is this lunatic talking about langdons tone hardened if you have peter put him on the phone right now thats impossible mr solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place the man paused he is in the araf where langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb the araf hamistagan that place to which dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary inferno the mans religious and literary references solidified langdons suspicion that he was dealing with a madman the second canticle langdon knew it well nobody escaped phillips exeter academy without reading dante youre saying you think peter solomon is in purgatory a crude word you christians use but yes mr solomon is in the inbetween the mans words hung in langdons ear are you saying peter is dead not exactly no not exactly langdon yelled his voice echoing sharply in the hall a family of tourists looked over at him he turned away and lowered his voice death is usually an allornothing thing you surprise me professor i expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death there is a world in between a world in which peter solomon is hovering at the moment he can either return to your world or he can move on to the next depending on your actions right now langdon tried to process this what do you want from me its simple you have been given access to something quite ancient and tonight you will share it with me i have no idea what youre talking about no you pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation now guessing what this was probably about ancient secrets he had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in paris several years earlier but grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely some connecting the dots and believing langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the holy grail perhaps even its location look langdon said if this is about the holy grail i can assure you i know nothing more than dont insult my intelligence mr langdon the man snapped i have no interest in anything so frivolous as the holy grail or mankinds pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me those are questions answered only through death the stark words left langdon confused then what the hell is this about the man paused for several seconds as you may know there exists within this city an ancient portal an ancient portal and tonight professor you will unlock it for me you should be honored i contacted you this is the invitation of your lifetime you alone have been chosen and you have lost your mind im sorry but youve chosen poorly langdon said i dont know anything about any ancient portal you dont understand professor it was not i who chose you it was peter solomon what langdon replied his voice barely a whisper mr solomon told me how to find the portal and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it and he said that man is you if peter said that he was mistaken or lying i think not he was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact and i am inclined to believe him langdon felt a stab of anger im warning you if you hurt peter in any its far too late for that the man said in an amused tone ive already taken what i need from peter solomon but for his sake i suggest you provide what i need from you time is of the essence for both of you i suggest you find the portal and unlock it peter will point the way peter i thought you said peter was in purgatory as above so below the man said langdon felt a deepening chill this strange response was an ancient hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth as above so below langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight look i dont know how to find any ancient portal im calling the police it really hasnt dawned on you yet has it why you were chosen no langdon said it will he replied chuckling any moment now then the line went dead langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments trying to process what had just happened suddenly in the distance he heard an unexpected sound it was coming from the rotunda someone was screaming chapter robert langdon had entered the capitol rotunda many times in his life but never at a full sprint as he ran through the north entrance he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room a small boy was screaming and his parents were trying to console him others were crowding around and several security guards were doing their best to restore order he pulled it out of his sling someone said frantically and just left it there as langdon drew nearer he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion admittedly the object on the capitol floor was odd but its presence hardly warranted screaming the device on the floor was one langdon had seen many times the harvard art department had dozens of these lifesize plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human bodys most complex feature which surprisingly was not the human face but rather the human hand someone left a mannequin hand in the rotunda mannequin hands or handequins as some called them had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air this handequin however had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling as langdon drew nearer though he realized this handequin was unusual its plastic surface was not smooth like most instead the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled and appeared almost like real skin langdon stopped abruptly now he saw the blood my god the severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up a wave of nausea rushed over him langdon inched closer unable to breathe seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos the tattoos however were not what held langdons attention his gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger no langdon recoiled his world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of peter solomon chapter why isnt peter answering katherine solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone where is he for three years peter solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven pm sundaynight meetings it was their private family ritual a way to remain connected before the start of a new week and for peter to stay uptodate on katherines work at the lab hes never late she thought and he always answers his phone to make matters worse katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive how do i even begin to ask him about what i found out today her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the smsc known as the street the corridor connected the buildings five massive storage pods forty feet overhead a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated normally during her nearly quartermile walk to her lab katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building tonight however the pulsing had her on edge what she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone and yet because peter was the only family she had in the world katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her as far as she knew he had kept a secret from her only once a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway three years ago her brother had walked katherine down this corridor introducing her to the smsc by proudly showing off some of the buildings more unusual items the mars meteorite alh the handwritten pictographic diary of sitting bull a collection of waxsealed ball jars containing original specimens collected by charles darwin at one point they walked past a heavy door with a small window katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped what in the world is that her brother chuckled and kept walking pod three its called wet pod pretty unusual sight isnt it terrifying is more like it katherine hurried after him this building was like another planet what i really want to show you is in pod five her brother said guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor its our newest addition it was built to house artifacts from the basement of the national museum of natural history that collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years which means pod five is sitting empty at the moment katherine glanced over empty so why are we looking at it her brothers gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief it occurred to me that because nobody is using the space maybe you could use it me sure i thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments youve been developing for all these years katherine stared at her brother in shock but peter those experiments are theoretical to actually perform them would be almost impossible nothing is impossible katherine and this building is perfect for you the smsc is not just a warehouse of treasures its one of the worlds most advanced scientific research facilities were constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy all the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal peter the technologies required to run these experiments are already in place he smiled broadly the lab is done katherine stopped short her brother pointed down the long corridor were going to see it now katherine could barely speak you you built me a lab its my job the smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge as secretary i must take that charge seriously i believe the experiments youve proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes whether or not you were my sister i would feel obliged to support this research your ideas are brilliant the world deserves to see where they lead peter i cant possibly okay relax it was my own money and nobodys using pod five right now when youre done with your experiments youll move out besides pod five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work katherine could not imagine what a massive empty pod might offer that would serve her research but she sensed she was about to find out they had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters pod her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up he raised his finger to type his access code but paused arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy you sure youre ready she nodded my brother always the showman stand back peter hit the keys the steel door hissed loudly open beyond the threshold was only inky blackness a yawning void a hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within it was like staring into the grand canyon at night picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of airbuses her brother said and you get the basic idea katherine felt herself take a step backward the pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated but your lab is a thermally insulated cinderblock room roughly a cube located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation katherine tried to picture it a box inside a box she strained to see into the darkness but it was absolute how far back pretty far a football field would fit easily in here i should warn you though the walk is a little unnerving its exceptionally dark katherine peered tentatively around the corner no light switch pod five is not yet wired for electricity but then how can a lab function he winked hydrogen fuel cell katherines jaw dropped youre kidding right enough clean power to run a small town your lab enjoys full radiofrequency separation from the rest of the building whats more all pod exteriors are sealed with photoresistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation essentially this pod is a sealed energyneutral environment katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of pod because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or white noise this included interference as subtle as brain radiation or thought emissions generated by people nearby for this reason a university campus or hospital lab wouldnt work but a deserted pod at the smsc could not have been more perfect lets go back and have a look her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness just follow me katherine stalled at the threshold over a hundred yards in total darkness she wanted to suggest a flashlight but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss peter she called leap of faith he called back his voice already fading away youll find your way trust me hes kidding right katherines heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold trying to peer into the darkness i cant see a thing suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her plunging her into total blackness not a speck of light anywhere peter silence youll find your way trust me tentative she inched forward blindly leap of faith katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face she kept moving forward but within a matter of seconds she was entirely lost where am i going that was three years ago now as katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door she realized how far she had come since that first night her lab nicknamed the cube had become her home a sanctuary within the depths of pod exactly as her brother had predicted she had found her way through the darkness that night and every day since thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself far more important her brothers other prediction had come true as well katherines experiments had produced astonishing results particularly in the last six months breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood one day soon however katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history a secret lab in a secret museum she thought inserting her key card into the pod door the keypad lit up and katherine typed her pin the steel door hissed open the familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air as always katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb strangest commute on earth steeling herself for the journey katherine solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void tonight however a troubled thought followed her inside where is peter chapter capitol police chief trent anderson had overseen security in the us capitol complex for over a decade a burly squarechested man with a chiseled face and red hair he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut giving him an air of military authority he wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a hightech surveillance center in the basement of the capitol here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors computer readouts and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded this evening had been unusually quiet and anderson was pleased he had been hoping to catch a bit of the redskins game on the flatpanel television in his office the game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed chief anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button yeah weve got some kind of disturbance in the rotunda ive got officers arriving now but i think youll want to have a look right anderson walked into the security nerve center a compact neomodern facility packed with computer monitors what have you got the technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor rotunda east balcony camera twenty seconds ago he played the clip anderson watched over the technicians shoulder the rotunda was almost deserted today dotted with just a few tourists andersons trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others shaved head green armysurplus jacket injured arm in a sling slight limp slouched posture talking on a cell phone the bald mans footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until suddenly arriving at the exact center of the rotunda he stopped short ended his phone call and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe but instead of tying a shoe he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind what in the world it was about eight inches tall and standing vertically anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted that cant be what it looks like as the bald man hurried off disappearing through the east portico a little boy nearby could be heard saying mommy that man dropped something the boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short after a long motionless beat he pointed and let out a deafening scream instantly the police chief spun and ran for the door barking orders as he went radio all points find the bald guy with the sling and detain him now dashing out of the security center he bounded up the treads of the wellworn staircase three at a time the security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the rotunda via the east portico the shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the eastwest corridor which was just ahead i can head him off as he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him an elderly couple strolled at the far end hand in hand nearby a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the house chamber excuse me sir anderson barked running toward him have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm the man looked up from his book with a confused expression a bald man with a sling anderson repeated more firmly have you seen him the tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway uh yes he said i think he just ran past me to that staircase over there he pointed down the hall anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it all points the suspect is headed for the southeast exit converge he stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster running toward the exit thirty seconds later at a quiet exit on the east side of the capitol the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air he smiled savoring the coolness of the evening transformation it had been so easy only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the rotunda in an armysurplus coat stepping into a darkened alcove he shed his coat revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath before abandoning his surplus jacket he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head then he stood up straight pulled a slim washington guidebook from his blazer and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait transformation this is my gift as malakhs mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine he arched his back standing to his full sixfootthree height and throwing back his shoulders he inhaled deeply letting the air fill his lungs he could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide if they only knew my power he thought gazing out at the city tonight my transformation will be complete malakh had played his cards artfully within the capitol building showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes the ancient invitation has been delivered if langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight soon he would chapter for robert langdon the capitol rotunda like st peters basilica always had a way of taking him by surprise intellectually he knew the room was so large that the statue of liberty could stand comfortably inside it but somehow the rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated as if there were spirits in the air tonight however there was only chaos capitol police officers were sealing the rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand the little boy was still crying a bright light flashed a tourist taking a photo of the hand and several guards immediately detained the man taking his camera and escorting him off in the confusion langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance slipping through the crowd inching closer to the hand peter solomons severed right hand was standing upright the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand three of the fingers were closed in a fist while the thumb and index finger were fully extended pointing up toward the soaring dome everyone back an officer called langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base postmortem wounds dont bleed which means peter is alive langdon didnt know whether to be relieved or nauseated peters hand was removed while he was alive bile rose in his throat he thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake langdons or offer a warm embrace for several seconds langdon felt his mind go blank like an untuned television set broadcasting only static the first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected a crown and a star langdon crouched down eyeing the tips of peters thumb and index finger tattoos incredibly the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on peters fingertips on the thumb a crown on the index finger a star this cant be the two symbols registered instantly in langdons mind amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly these symbols had appeared together many times in history and always in the same place on the fingertips of a hand it was one of the ancient worlds most coveted and secretive icons the hand of the mysteries the icon was rarely seen anymore but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him someone crafted the hand of the mysteries out of peters hand it was unthinkable traditionally the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing langdon had never heard of the hand of the mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh the concept was abhorrent sir a guard said behind langdon please step back langdon barely heard him there are other tattoos although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings that was the tradition five symbols in total through the millennia the symbols on the fingertips of the hand of the mysteries had never changed nor had the hands iconic purpose the hand represents an invitation langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here professor tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime in ancient times the hand of the mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth to receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages the invitation not only was a great honor but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom the hand of the master extended to the initiate sir the guard said putting a firm hand on langdons shoulder i need you to back up right now i know what this means langdon managed i can help you now the guard said my friend is in trouble we have to langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand he simply let it happen feeling too off balance to protest a formal invitation had just been delivered someone was summoning langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge but it was all madness delusions of a lunatic chapter malakhs stretch limousine eased away from the us capitol moving eastward down independence avenue a young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows hoping to glimpse a vip im in front malakh thought smiling to himself malakh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone none of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight the guarantee of privacy total privacy limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity embassies on wheels police officers who worked near capitol hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine and so most simply chose not to take the chance as malakh crossed the anacostia river into maryland he could feel himself moving closer to katherine pulled onward by destinys gravity i am being called to a second task tonight one i had not imagined last night when peter solomon told the last of his secrets malakh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which katherine solomon had performed miracles staggering breakthroughs that malakh realized would change the world if they were ever made known her work will unveil the true nature of all things for centuries the brightest minds on earth had ignored the ancient sciences mocking them as ignorant superstitions arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies tools that led them only further from the truth every generations breakthroughs are proven false by the next generations technology and so it had gone through the ages the more man learned the more he realized he did not know for millennia mankind had wandered in the darkness but now as had been prophesied there was a change coming after hurtling blindly through history mankind had reached a crossroads this moment had been predicted long ago prophesied by the ancient texts by the primeval calendars and even by the stars themselves the date was specific its arrival imminent it would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom i have come to obscure the light malakh thought this is my role fate had linked him to peter and katherine solomon the breakthroughs katherine solomon had made within the smsc would risk opening floodgates of new thinking starting a new renaissance katherines revelations if made public would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost empowering him beyond all imagination katherines destiny is to light this torch mine is to extinguish it chapter in total darkness katherine solomon groped for the outer door of her lab finding it she heaved open the leadlined door and hurried into the small entry room the journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds and yet her heart was pounding wildly after three years youd think id be used to that katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of pod and step into this clean welllit space the cube was a massive windowless box every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titaniumcoated lead fiber giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure dividers of frosted plexiglas separated the space into different compartments a laboratory a control room a mechanical room a bathroom and a small research library katherine strode briskly into the main lab the bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment paired electro encephalographs a femtosecond comb a magnetooptical trap and quantumindeterminate electronic noise regs more simply known as random event generators despite noetic sciences use of cuttingedge technologies the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold hightech machines that were producing them the stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in all of it supporting the basic ideology of noetic science the untapped potential of the human mind the overall thesis was simple we have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities experiments at facilities like the institute of noetic sciences ions in california and the princeton engineering anomalies research lab pear had categorically proven that human thought if properly focused had the ability to affect and change physical mass their experiments were no spoonbending parlor tricks but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world whether or not we knew it effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm mind over matter in in the hours following the horrifying events of september the field of noetic science made a quantum leap forward four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy the outputs of thirtyseven different random event generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random somehow the oneness of this shared experience the coalescing of millions of minds had affected the randomizing function of these machines organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos the shocking discovery it seemed paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a cosmic consciousnessa vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter recently studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in random event generators fueling the claim that human consciousness as noetic author lynne mctaggart described it was a substance outside the confines of the body a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world katherine had been fascinated by mctaggarts book the intention experiment and her global webbased study theintentionexperimentcom aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world a handful of other progressive texts had also piqued katherines interest from this foundation katherine solomons research had vaulted forward proving that focused thought could affect literally anything the growth rate of plants the direction that fish swam in a bowl the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish the synchronization of separately automated systems and the chemical reactions in ones own body even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by ones mind katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze incredibly the converse was also true when she sent negative polluting thoughts to the water the ice crystals froze in chaotic fractured forms human thought can literally transform the physical world as katherines experiments grew bolder her results became more astounding her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that mind over matter was not just some new age selfhelp mantra the mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself and more important the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction we are the masters of our own universe at the subatomic level katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them in a sense her desire to see a particle manifested that particle heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago and now it had be come a fundamental principle of noetic science in the words of lynne mctaggart living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real the most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it the most astonishing aspect of katherines work however had been the realization that the minds ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice intention was a learned skill like meditation harnessing the true power of thought required practice more important some people were born more skilled at it than others and throughout history there had been those few who had become true masters this is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism katherine had learned this from her brother peter and now as her thoughts turned back to him she felt a deepening concern she walked to the labs research library and peered in empty the library was a small reading room two morris chairs a wooden table two floor lamps and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books katherine and peter had pooled their favorite texts here writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old of cuttingedge and historical most of katherines books bore titles like quantum consciousness the new physics and principles of neural science her brothers bore older more esoteric titles like the kybalion the zohar the dancing wu li masters and a translation of the sumerian tablets from the british museum the key to our scientific future her brother often said is hidden in our past a lifelong scholar of history science and mysticism peter had been the first to encourage katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early hermetic philosophy she had been only nineteen years old when peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism so tell me kate her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at yale what are elis reading these days in theoretical physics katherine had stood in her familys bookfilled library and recited her demanding reading list impressive her brother replied einstein bohr and hawking are modern geniuses but are you reading anything older katherine scratched her head you mean like newton he smiled keep going at twentyseven peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world and he and katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring older than newton katherines head now filled with distant names like ptolemy pythagoras and hermes trismegistus nobody reads that stuff anymore her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes the scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all peter she said you already told me that the egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before newton and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry but so what todays physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients like what well like entanglement theory for one subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected entangled in a single unified mesh a kind of universal oneness youre telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory absolutely peter said pushing his long dark bangs out of his eyes entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs its names are as old as history itself dharmakaya tao brahman in fact mans oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement to sense his own interconnection with all things he has always wanted to become one with the universe to achieve the state of atonement her brother raised his eyebrows to this day jews and christians still strive for atonement although most of us have forgotten it is actually atonement were seeking katherine sighed having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history okay but youre talking in generalities im talking specific physics then be specific his keen eyes challenged her now okay how about something as simple as polarity the positivenegative balance of the subatomic realm obviously the ancients didnt underst hold on her brother pulled down a large dusty text which he dropped loudly on the library table modern polarity is nothing but the dual world described by krishna here in the bhagavad gita over two thousand years ago a dozen other books in here including the kybalion talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature katherine was skeptical okay but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics the heisenberg uncertainty principle for example then we must look here peter said striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text the sacred hindu vendantic scriptures known as the upanishads he dropped the tome heavily on the first heisenberg and schrцdinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories the showdown continued for several minutes and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller finally katherine threw up her hands in frustration okay you made your point but i want to study cuttingedge theoretical physics the future of science i really doubt krishna or vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models youre right they didnt her brother paused a smile crossing his lips if youre talking superstring theory he wandered over to the bookshelf yet again then youre talking this book here he heaved out a colossal leatherbound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk thirteenthcentury translation of the original medieval aramaic superstring theory in the thirteenth century katherine wasnt buying it come on superstring theory was a brandnew cosmological model based on the most recent scientific observations it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three but rather of ten dimensions which all interacted like vibrating strings similar to resonating violin strings katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book ran through the ornately printed table of contents and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book read this he pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams dutifully katherine studied the page the translation was oldfashioned and very hard to read but to her utter amazement the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory a tendimensional universe of resonating strings as she continued reading she suddenly gasped and recoiled my god it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one she took a frightened step backward what is this book her brother grinned something im hoping youll read one day he flipped back to the title page where an ornately printed plate bore three words the complete zohar although katherine had never read the zohar she knew it was the fundamental text of early jewish mysticism once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis katherine eyed the book youre saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions absolutely he motioned to the pages illustration of ten intertwined circles called sephiroth obviously the nomenclature is esoteric but the physics is very advanced katherine didnt know how to respond but then why dont more people study this her brother smiled they will i dont understand katherine we have been born into wonderful times a change is coming human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways back to the ideas in books like the zohar and other ancient texts from around the world powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it there will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him that night katherine eagerly began reading her brothers ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right the ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom todays science was not so much making discoveries as it was making rediscoveries mankind it seemed had once grasped the true nature of the universe but had let go and forgotten modern physics can help us remember this quest had become katherines mission in life to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients it was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding now more than ever at the rear of the lab katherine saw her brothers white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own reflexively she pulled out her phone to check for messages nothing a voice echoed again in her memory that which your brother believes is hidden in dc it can be found sometimes a legend that endures for centuries endures for a reason no katherine said aloud it cant possibly be real sometimes a legend was just that a legend chapter security chief trent anderson stormed back toward the capitol rotunda fuming at the failure of his security team one of his men had just found a sling and an armysurplus jacket in an alcove near the east portico the goddamn guy walked right out of here anderson had already assigned teams to start scanning exterior video but by the time they found anything this guy would be long gone now as anderson entered the rotunda to survey the damage he saw that the situation had been contained as well as could be expected all four entrances to the rotunda were closed with as inconspicuous a method of crowd control as security had at its disposal a velvet swag an apologetic guard and a sign that read this room temporarily closed for cleaning the dozen or so witnesses were all being herded into a group on the eastern perimeter of the room where the guards were collecting cell phones and cameras the last thing anderson needed was for one of these people to send a cellphone snapshot to cnn one of the detained witnesses a tall darkhaired man in a tweed sport coat was trying to break away from the group to speak to the chief the man was currently in a heated discussion with the guards ill speak to him in a moment anderson called over to the guards for now please hold everyone in the main lobby until we sort this out anderson turned his eyes now to the hand which stood at attention in the middle of the room for the love of god in fifteen years on security detail for the capitol building he had seen some strange things but nothing like this forensics had better get here fast and get this thing out of my building anderson moved closer seeing that the bloody wrist had been skewered on a spiked wooden base to make the hand stand up wood and flesh he thought invisible to metal detectors the only metal was a large gold ring which anderson assumed had either been wanded or casually pulled off the dead finger by the suspect as if it were his own anderson crouched down to examine the hand it looked as if it had belonged to a man of about sixty the ring bore some kind of ornate seal with a twoheaded bird and the number anderson didnt recognize it what really caught his eye were the tiny tattoos on the tips of the thumb and index finger a goddamn freak show chief one of the guards hurried over holding out a phone personal call for you security switchboard just patched it through anderson looked at him like he was insane im in the middle of something here he growled the guards face was pale he covered the mouthpiece and whispered its cia anderson did a double take cia heard about this already its their office of security anderson stiffened holy shit he glanced uneasily at the phone in the guards hand in washingtons vast ocean of intelligence agencies the cias office of security was something of a bermuda triangle a mysterious and treacherous region from which all who knew of it steered clear whenever possible with a seemingly selfdestructive mandate the os had been created by the cia for one strange purpose to spy on the cia itself like a powerful internalaffairs office the os monitored all cia employees for illicit behavior misappropriation of funds selling of secrets stealing classified technologies and use of illegal torture tactics to name a few they spy on americas spies with investigative carte blanche in all matters of national security the os had a long and potent reach anderson could not fathom why they would be interested in this incident at the capitol or how they had found out so fast then again the os was rumored to have eyes everywhere for all anderson knew they had a direct feed of us capitol security cameras this incident did not match os directives in any way although the timing of the call seemed too coincidental to anderson to be about anything other than this severed hand chiefthe guard was holding the phone out to him like a hot potato you need to take this call right now its he paused and silently mouthed two syllables sato anderson squinted hard at the man youve got to be kidding he felt his palms begin to sweat sato is handling this personally the overlord of the office of security director inoue sato was a legend in the intelligence community born inside the fences of a japanese internment camp in manzanar california in the aftermath of pearl harbor sato was a toughened survivor who had never forgotten the horrors of war or the perils of insufficient military intelligence now having risen to one of the most secretive and potent posts in us intelligence work sato had proven an uncompromising patriot as well as a terrifying enemy to any who stood in opposition seldom seen but universally feared the os director cruised the deep waters of the cia like a leviathan who surfaced only to devour its prey anderson had met sato facetoface only once and the memory of looking into those cold black eyes was enough to make him count his blessings that he would be having this conversation by telephone anderson took the phone and brought it to his lips director sato he said in as friendly a voice as possible this is chief anderson how may i there is a man in your building to whom i need to speak immediately the os directors voice was unmistakable like gravel grating on a chalkboard throat cancer surgery had left sato with a profoundly unnerving intonation and a repulsive neck scar to match i want you to find him for me immediately thats all you want me to page someone anderson felt suddenly hopeful that maybe the timing of this call was pure coincidence who are you looking for his name is robert langdon i believe he is inside your building right now langdon the name sounded vaguely familiar but anderson couldnt quite place it he was now wondering if sato knew about the hand im in the rotunda at the moment anderson said but weve got some tourists here hold on he lowered his phone and called out to the group folks is there anyone here by the name of langdon after a short silence a deep voice replied from the crowd of tourists yes im robert langdon sato knows all anderson craned his neck trying to see who had spoken up the same man who had been trying to get to him earlier stepped away from the others he looked distraught but familiar somehow anderson raised the phone to his lips yes mr langdon is here put him on sato said coarsely anderson exhaled better him than me hold on he waved langdon over as langdon approached anderson suddenly realized why the name sounded familiar i just read an article about this guy what the hell is he doing here despite langdons sixfoot frame and athletic build anderson saw none of the cold hardened edge he expected from a man famous for surviving an explosion at the vatican and a manhunt in paris this guy eluded the french police in loafers he looked more like someone anderson would expect to find hearthside in some ivy league library reading dostoyevsky mr langdonanderson said walking halfway to meet him im chief anderson i handle security here you have a phone call for me langdons blue eyes looked anxious and uncertain anderson held out the phone its the cias office of security ive never heard of it anderson smiled ominously well sir its heard of you langdon put the phone to his ear yes robert langdon director satos harsh voice blared in the tiny speaker loud enough that anderson could hear yes langdon replied anderson stepped closer to hear what sato was saying this is director inoue sato mr langdon i am handling a crisis at the moment and i believe you have information that can help me langdon looked hopeful is this about peter solomon do you know where he is peter solomon anderson felt entirely out of the loop professor sato replied i am asking the questions at the moment peter solomon is in very serious trouble langdon exclaimed some madman just excuse me sato said cutting him off anderson cringed bad move interrupting a top cia officials line of questioning was a mistake only a civilian would make i thought langdon was supposed to be smart listen carefully sato said as we speak this nation is facing a crisis i have been advised that you have information that can help me avert it now i am going to ask you again what information do you possess langdon looked lost director i have no idea what youre talking about all im concerned with is finding peter and no idea sato challenged anderson saw langdon bristle the professor now took a more aggressive tone no sir no damned idea at all anderson winced wrong wrong wrong robert langdon had just made a very costly mistake in dealing with director sato incredibly anderson now realized it was too late to his astonishment director sato had just appeared on the far side of the rotunda and was approaching fast behind langdon sato is in the building anderson held his breath and braced for impact langdon has no idea the directors dark form drew closer phone held to ear black eyes locked like two lasers on langdons back langdon clutched the police chiefs phone and felt a rising frustration as the os director pressed him im sorry sir langdon said tersely but i cant read your mind what do you want from me what do i want from you the os directors grating voice crackled through langdons phone scraping and hollow like that of a dying man with strep throat as the man spoke langdon felt a tap on his shoulder he turned and his eyes were drawn down directly into the face of a tiny japanese woman she had a fierce expression a mottled complexion thinning hair tobaccostained teeth and an unsettling white scar that sliced horizontally across her neck the womans gnarled hand held a cell phone to her ear and when her lips moved langdon heard the familiar raspy voice through his cell phone what do i want from you professor she calmly closed her phone and glared at him for starters you can stop calling me sir langdon stared mortified maam i apologize our connection was poor and our connection was fine professor she said and i have an extremely low tolerance for bullshit chapter director inoue sato was a fearsome specimen a bristly tempest of a woman who stood a mere four feet ten inches she was bone thin with jagged features and a dermatological condition known as vitiligo which gave her complexion the mottled look of coarse granite blotched with lichen her rumpled blue pantsuit hung on her emaciated frame like a loose sack the opennecked blouse doing nothing to hide the scar across her neck it had been noted by her coworkers that satos only acquiescence to physical vanity appeared to be that of plucking her substantial mustache for over a decade inoue sato had overseen the cias office of security she possessed an offthechart iq and chillingly accurate instincts a combination which girded her with a selfconfidence that made her terrifying to anyone who could not perform the impossible not even a terminal diagnosis of aggressive throat cancer had knocked her from her perch the battle had cost her one month of work half her voice box and a third of her body weight but she returned to the office as if nothing had happened inoue sato appeared to be indestructible robert langdon suspected he was probably not the first to mistake sato for a man on the phone but the director was still glaring at him with simmering black eyes again my apologies maam langdon said im still trying to get my bearings here the person who claims to have peter solomon tricked me into coming to dc this evening he pulled the fax from his jacket this is what he sent me earlier i wrote down the tail number of the plane he sent so maybe if you call the faa and track the satos tiny hand shot out and snatched the sheet of paper she stuck it in her pocket without even opening it professor i am running this investigation and until you start telling me what i want to know i suggest you not speak unless spoken to sato now spun to the police chief chief anderson she said stepping entirely too close and staring up at him through tiny black eyes would you care to tell me what the hell is going on here the guard at the east gate told me you found a human hand on the floor is that true anderson stepped to the side and revealed the object in the center of the floor yes maam only a few minutes ago she glanced at the hand as if it were nothing more than a misplaced piece of clothing and yet you didnt mention it to me when i called i i thought you knew do not lie to me anderson wilted under her gaze but his voice remained confident maam this situation is under control i really doubt that sato said with equal confidence a forensics team is on the way whoever did this may have left fingerprints sato looked skeptical i think someone clever enough to walk through your security checkpoint with a human hand is probably clever enough not to leave fingerprints that may be true but i have a responsibility to investigate actually i am relieving you of your responsibility as of this moment im taking over anderson stiffened this is not exactly os domain is it absolutely this is an issue of national security peters hand langdon wondered watching their exchange in a daze national security langdon was sensing that his own urgent goal of finding peter was not satos the os director seemed to be on another page entirely anderson looked puzzled as well national security with all due respect maam the last i checked she interrupted i outrank you i suggest you do exactly as i say and that you do it without question anderson nodded and swallowed hard but shouldnt we at least print the fingers to confirm the hand belongs to peter solomon ill confirm it langdon said feeling a sickening certainty i recognize his ring and his hand he paused the tattoos are new though someone did that to him recently im sorry sato looked unnerved for the first time since arriving the hand is tattooed langdon nodded the thumb has a crown and the index finger a star sato pulled out a pair of glasses and walked toward the hand circling like a shark also langdon said although you cant see the other three fingers im certain they will have tattoos on the fingertips as well sato looked intrigued by the comment and motioned to anderson chief can you look at the other fingertips for us please anderson crouched down beside the hand being careful not to touch it he put his cheek near the floor and looked up under the clenched fingertips hes right maam all of the fingertips have tattoos although i cant quite see what the other a sun a lantern and a key langdon said flatly sato turned fully to langdon now her small eyes appraising him and how exactly would you know that langdon stared back the image of a human hand marked in this way on the fingertips is a very old icon its known as the hand of the mysteries anderson stood up abruptly this thing has a name langdon nodded its one of the most secretive icons of the ancient world sato cocked her head then might i ask what the hell its doing in the middle of the us capitol langdon wished he would wake up from this nightmare traditionally maam it was used as an invitation an invitation to what she demanded langdon looked down at the symbols on his friends severed hand for centuries the hand of the mysteries served as a mystical summons basically its an invitation to receive secret knowledge protected wisdom known only to an elite few sato folded her thin arms and stared up at him with jetblack eyes well professor for someone who claims to have no clue why hes here youre doing quite well so far chapter katherine solomon donned her white lab coat and began her usual arrival routine her rounds as her brother called them like a nervous parent checking on a sleeping baby katherine poked her head into the mechanical room the hydrogen fuel cell was running smoothly its backup tanks all safely nestled in their racks katherine continued down the hall to the datastorage room as always the two redundant holographic backup units hummed safely within their temperaturecontrolled vault all of my research she thought gazing in through the threeinchthick shatterproof glass holographic datastorage devices unlike their refrigeratorsize ancestors looked more like sleek stereo components each perched atop a columnar pedestal both of her labs holographic drives were synchronized and identical serving as redundant backups to safeguard identical copies of her work most backup protocols advocated a secondary backup system offsite in case of earthquake fire or theft but katherine and her brother agreed that secrecy was paramount once this data left the building to an offsite server they could no longer be certain it would stay private content that everything was running smoothly here she headed back down the hallway as she rounded the corner however she spotted something unexpected across the lab what in the world a muted glow was glinting off all the equipment she hurried in to have a look surprised to see light emanating from behind the plexiglas wall of the control room hes here katherine flew across the lab arriving at the controlroom door and heaving it open peter she said running in the plump woman seated at the control rooms terminal jumped up oh my god katherine you scared me trish dunne the only other person on earth allowed back here was katherines metasystems analyst and seldom worked weekends the twentysixyearold redhead was a genius data modeler and had signed a nondisclosure document worthy of the kgb tonight she was apparently analyzing data on the control rooms plasma wall a huge flatscreen display that looked like something out of nasa mission control sorry trish said i didnt know you were here yet i was trying to finish up before you and your brother arrived have you spoken to him hes late and hes not answering his phone trish shook her head i bet hes still trying to figure out how to use that new iphone you gave him katherine appreciated trishs good humor and trishs presence here had just given her an idea actually im glad youre in tonight you might be able to help me with something if you dont mind whatever it is im sure it beats football katherine took a deep breath calming her mind im not sure how to explain this but earlier today i heard an unusual story trish dunne didnt know what story katherine solomon had heard but clearly it had her on edge her bosss usually calm gray eyes looked anxious and she had tucked her hair behind her ears three times since entering the room a nervous tell as trish called it brilliant scientist lousy poker player to me katherine said this story sounds like fiction an old legend and yet she paused tucking a wisp of hair behind her ears once again and yet katherine sighed and yet i was told today by a trusted source that the legend is true okay where is she going with this im going to talk to my brother about it but it occurs to me that maybe you can help me shed some light on it before i do id love to know if this legend has ever been corroborated anywhere else in history in all of history katherine nodded anywhere in the world in any language at any point in history strange request trish thought but certainly feasible ten years ago the task would have been impossible today however with the internet the world wide web and the ongoing digitization of the great libraries and museums in the world katherines goal could be achieved by using a relatively simple search engine equipped with an army of translation modules and some wellchosen keywords no problem trish said many of the labs research books contained passages in ancient languages and so trish was often asked to write specialized optical character recognition translation modules to generate english text from obscure languages she had to be the only metasystems specialist on earth who had built ocr translation modules in old frisian maek and akkadian the modules would help but the trick to building an effective search spider was all in choosing the right key words unique but not overly restrictive katherine looked to be a step ahead of trish and was already jotting down possible keywords on a slip of paper katherine had written down several when she paused thought a moment and then wrote several more okay she finally said handing trish the slip of paper trish perused the list of search strings and her eyes grew wide what kind of crazy legend is katherine investigating you want me to search for all of these key phrases one of the words trish didnt even recognize is that even english do you really think well find all of these in one place verbatim id like to try trish would have said impossible but the iword was banned here katherine considered it a dangerous mindset in a field that often transformed preconceived falsehoods into confirmed truths trish dunne seriously doubted this keyphrase search would fall into that category how long for results katherine asked a few minutes to write the spider and launch it after that maybe fifteen for the spider to exhaust itself so fast katherine looked encouraged trish nodded traditional search engines often required a full day to crawl across the entire online universe find new documents digest their content and add it to their searchable database but this was not the kind of search spider trish would write ill write a program called a delegator trish explained its not entirely kosher but its fast essentially its a program that orders other peoples search engines to do our work most databases have a search function built in libraries museums universities governments so i write a spider that finds their search engines inputs your keywords and asks them to search this way we harness the power of thousands of engines working in unison katherine looked impressed parallel processing a kind of metasystem ill call you if i get anything i appreciate ittrish katherine patted her on the back and headed for the door ill be in the library trish settled in to write the program coding a search spider was a menial task far below her skill level but trish dunne didnt care she would do anything for katherine solomon sometimes trish still couldnt believe the good fortune that had brought her here youve come a long way baby just over a year ago trish had quit her job as a metasystems analyst in one of the hightech industrys many cubicle farms in her offhours she did some freelance programming and started an industry blog future applications in computational metasystem analysisalthough she doubted anyone read it then one evening her phone rang trish dunne a womans voice asked politely yes whos calling please my name is katherine solomon trish almost fainted on the spot katherine solomon i just read your book noetic science modern gateway to ancient wisdom and i wrote about it on my blog yes i know the woman replied graciously thats why im calling of course it is trish realized feeling dumb even brilliant scientists google themselves your blog intrigues me katherine told her i wasnt aware metasystems modeling had come so far yes maam trish managed starstruck data models are an exploding technology with farreaching applications for several minutes the two women chatted about trishs work in metasystems discussing her experience analyzing modeling and predicting the flow of massive data fields obviously your book is way over my head trish said but i understood enough to see an intersection with my metasystems work your blog said you believe metasystems modeling can transform the study of noetics absolutely i believe metasystems could turn noetics into real science real science katherines tone hardened slightly as opposed to oh shit that came out wrong um what i meant is that noetics is more esoteric katherine laughed relax im kidding i get that all the time im not surprised trish thought even the institute of noetic sciences in california described the field in arcane and abstruse language defining it as the study of mankinds direct and immediate access to knowledge beyond what is available to our normal senses and the power of reason the word noetic trish had learned derived from the ancient greek nous translating roughly to inner knowledge or intuitive consciousness im interested in your metasystems work katherine said and how it might relate to a project im working on any chance youd be willing to meet id love to pick your brain katherine solomon wants to pick my brain it felt like maria sharapova had called for tennis tips the next day a white volvo pulled into trishs driveway and an attractive willowy woman in blue jeans got out trish immediately felt two feet tall great she groaned smart rich and thin and im supposed to believe god is good but katherines unassuming air set trish instantly at ease the two of them settled in on trishs huge back porch overlooking an impressive piece of property your house is amazing katherine said thanks i got lucky in college and licensed some software id written metasystems stuff a precursor to metasystems following the government was intercepting and crunching enormous data fields civilian email cell phone fax text web sites sniffing for keywords associated with terrorist communications so i wrote a piece of software that let them process their data field in a second way pulling from it an additional intelligence product she smiled essentially my software let them take americas temperature im sorry trish laughed yeah sounds crazy i know what i mean is that it quantified the nations emotional state it offered a kind of cosmic consciousness barometer if you will trish explained how using a data field of the nations communications one could assess the nations mood based on the occurrence density of certain keywords and emotional indicators in the data field happier times had happier language and stressful times vice versa in the event for example of a terrorist attack the government could use data fields to measure the shift in americas psyche and better advise the president on the emotional impact of the event fascinating katherine said stroking her chin so essentially youre examining a population of individuals as if it were a single organism exactly a metasystem a single entity defined by the sum of its parts the human body for example consists of millions of individual cells each with different attributes and different purposes but it functions as a single entity katherine nodded enthusiastically like a flock of birds or a school of fish moving as one we call it convergence or entanglement trish sensed her famous guest was starting to see the potential of metasystem programming in her own field of noetics my software trish explained was designed to help government agencies better evaluate and respond appropriately to widescale crises pandemic diseases national tragedies terrorism that sort of thing she paused of course theres always the potential that it could be used in other directions perhaps to take a snapshot of the national mindset and predict the outcome of a national election or the direction the stock market will move at the opening bell sounds powerful trish motioned to her big house the government thought so katherines gray eyes focused in on her now trish might i ask about the ethical dilemma posed by your work what do you mean i mean you created a piece of software that can easily be abused those who possess it have access to powerful information not available to everyone you didnt feel any hesitation creating it trish didnt blink absolutely not my software is no different than say a flight simulator program some users will practice flying firstaid missions into underdeveloped countries some users will practice flying passenger jets into skyscrapers knowledge is a tool and like all tools its impact is in the hands of the user katherine sat back looking impressed so let me ask you a hypothetical question trish suddenly sensed their conversation had just turned into a job interview katherine reached down and picked up a tiny speck of sand off the deck holding it up for trish to see it occurs to me she said that your metasystems work essentially lets you calculate the weight of an entire sandy beach by weighing one grain at a time yes basically thats right as you know this little grain of sand has mass a very small mass but mass nonetheless trish nodded and because this grain of sand has mass it therefore exerts gravity again too small to feel but there right now katherine said if we take trillions of these sand grains and let them attract one another to form say the moon then their combined gravity is enough to move entire oceans and drag the tides back and forth across our planet trish had no idea where this was headed but she liked what she was hearing so lets take a hypothetical katherine said discarding the sand grain what if i told you that a thought any tiny idea that forms in your mind actually has mass what if i told you that a thought is an actual thing a measurable entity with a measurable mass a minuscule mass of course but mass nonetheless what are the implications hypothetically speaking well the obvious implications are if a thought has mass then a thought exerts gravity and can pull things toward it katherine smiled youre good now take it a step further what happens if many people start focusing on the same thought all the occurrences of that same thought begin to merge into one and the cumulative mass of this thought begins to grow and therefore its gravity grows okay meaning if enough people begin thinking the same thing then the gravitational force of that thought becomes tangible and it exerts actual force katherine winked and it can have a measurable effect in our physical world chapter director inoue sato stood with her arms folded her eyes locked skeptically on langdon as she processed what he had just told her he said he wants you to unlock an ancient portal what am i supposed to do with that professor langdon shrugged weakly he was feeling ill again and tried not to look down at his friends severed hand thats exactly what he told me an ancient portal hidden somewhere in this building i told him i knew of no portal then why does he think you can find it obviously hes insane he said peter would point the way langdon looked down at peters upstretched finger again feeling repulsed by his captors sadistic play on words peter will point the way langdon had already permitted his eyes to follow the pointing finger up to the dome overhead a portal up there insane this man who called me langdon told sato was the only one who knew i was coming to the capitol tonight so whoever informed you i was here tonight thats your man i recommend where i got my information is not your concern sato interrupted voice sharpening my top priority at the moment is to cooperate with this man and i have information suggesting you are the only one who can give him what he wants and my top priority is to find my friend langdon replied frustrated sato inhaled deeply her patience clearly being tested if we want to find mr solomon we have one course of action professor to start cooperating with the one person who seems to know where he is sato checked her watch our time is limited i can assure you it is imperative we comply with this mans demands quickly how langdon asked incredulous by locating and unlocking an ancient portal there is no portal director sato this guys a lunatic sato stepped close less than a foot from langdon if i may point this out your lunatic deftly manipulated two fairly smart individuals already this morning she stared directly at langdon and then glanced at anderson in my business one learns there is a fine line between insanity and genius we would be wise to give this man a little respect he cut off a mans hand my point exactly that is hardly the act of an uncommitted or uncertain individual more important professor this man obviously believes you can help him he brought you all the way to washington and he must have done it for a reason he said the only reason he thinks i can unlock this portal is that peter told him i can unlock it langdon countered and why would peter solomon say that if it werent true im sure peter said no such thing and if he did then he did so under duress he was confused or frightened yes its called interrogational torture and its quite effective all the more reason mr solomon would tell the truth sato spoke as if shed had personal experience with this technique did he explain why peter thinks you alone can unlock the portal langdon shook his head professor if your reputations are correct then you and peter solomon both share an interest in this sort of thing secrets historical esoterica mysticism and so on in all of your discussions with peter he never once mentioned to you anything about a secret portal in washington dc langdon could scarcely believe he was being asked this question by a highranking officer of the cia im certain of it peter and i talk about some pretty arcane things but believe me id tell him to get his head examined if he ever told me there was an ancient portal hidden anywhere at all particularly one that leads to the ancient mysteries she glanced up im sorry the man told you specifically what this portal leads to yes but he didnt have to langdon motioned to the hand the hand of the mysteries is a formal invitation to pass through a mystical gateway and acquire ancient secret knowledge powerful wisdom known as the ancient mysteries or the lost wisdom of all the ages so youve heard of the secret he believes is hidden here a lot of historians have heard of it then how can you say the portal does not exist with respect maam weve all heard of the fountain of youth and shangrila but that does not mean they exist the loud squawk of andersons radio interrupted them chief the voice on the radio said anderson snatched his radio from his belt anderson here sir weve completed a search of the grounds theres no one here that fits the description any further orders sir anderson shot a quick glance at sato clearly expecting a reprimand but director sato seemed uninterested anderson moved away from langdon and sato speaking quietly into his radio satos unwavering focus remained on langdon youre saying the secret he believes is hidden in washington is a fantasy langdon nodded a very old myth the secret of the ancient mysteries is prechristian actually thousands of years old and yet its still around as are many equally improbable beliefs langdon often reminded his students that most modern religions included stories that did not hold up to scientific scrutiny everything from moses parting the red sea to joseph smith using magic eyeglasses to translate the book of mormon from a series of gold plates he found buried in upstate new york wide acceptance of an idea is not proof of its validity i see so what exactly are these ancient mysteries langdon exhaled have you got a few weeks in short the ancient mysteries refer to a body of secret knowledge that was amassed long ago one intriguing aspect of this knowledge is that it allegedly enables its practitioners to access powerful abilities that lie dormant in the human mind the enlightened adepts who possessed this knowledge vowed to keep it veiled from the masses because it was considered far too potent and dangerous for the uninitiated dangerous in what way the information was kept hidden for the same reason we keep matches from children in the correct hands fire can provide illumination but in the wrong hands fire can be highly destructive sato took off her glasses and studied him tell me professor do you believe such powerful information could truly exist langdon was not sure how to respond the ancient mysteries had always been the greatest paradox of his academic career virtually every mystical tradition on earth revolved around the idea that there existed arcane knowledge capable of imbuing humans with mystical almost godlike powers tarot and i ching gave men the ability to see the future alchemy gave men immortality through the fabled philosophers stone wicca permitted advanced practitioners to cast powerful spells the list went on and on as an academic langdon could not deny the historical record of these traditions troves of documents artifacts and artwork that indeed clearly suggested the ancients had a powerful wisdom that they shared only through allegory myths and symbols ensuring that only those properly initiated could access its power nonetheless as a realist and a skeptic langdon remained unconvinced lets just say im a skeptic he told sato i have never seen anything in the real world to suggest the ancient mysteries are anything other than legend a recurring mythological archetype it seems to me that if it were possible for humans to acquire miraculous powers there would be evidence and yet so far history has given us no men with superhuman powers sato arched her eyebrows thats not entirely true langdon hesitated realizing that for many religious people there was indeed a precedent for human gods jesus being the most obvious admittedly he said there are plenty of educated people who believe this empowering wisdom truly exists but im not yet convinced is peter solomon one of those people sato asked glancing toward the hand on the floor langdon could not bring himself to look at the hand peter comes from a family lineage that has always had a passion for all things ancient and mystical was that a yes sato asked i can assure you that even if peter believes the ancient mysteries are real he does not believe they are accessible through some kind of portal hidden in washington dc he understands metaphorical symbolism which is something his captor apparently does not sato nodded so you believe this portal is a metaphor of course langdon said in theory anyway its a very common metaphor a mystical portal through which one must travel to become enlightened portals and doorways are common symbolic constructs that represent transformative rites of passage to look for a literal portal would be like trying to locate the actual gates of heaven sato seemed to consider this momentarily but it sounds like mr solomons captor believes you can unlock an actual portal langdon exhaled hes made the same error many zealots make confusing metaphor with a literal reality similarly early alchemists had toiled in vain to transform lead into gold never realizing that leadtogold was nothing but a metaphor for tapping into true human potential that of taking a dull ignorant mind and transforming it into a bright enlightened one sato motioned to the hand if this man wants you to locate some kind of portal for him why wouldnt he simply tell you how to find it why all the dramatics why give you a tattooed hand langdon had asked himself the same question and the answer was unsettling well it seems the man we are dealing with in addition to being mentally unstable is also highly educated this hand is proof that he is well versed in the mysteries as well as their codes of secrecy not to mention with the history of this room i dont understand everything he has done tonight was done in perfect accordance with ancient protocols traditionally the hand of the mysteries is a sacred invitation and therefore it must be presented in a sacred place satos eyes narrowed this is the rotunda of the us capitol building professor not some sacred shrine to ancient mystical secrets actually maam langdon said i know a great number of historians who would disagree with you at that moment across town trish dunne was seated in the glow of the plasma wall inside the cube she finished preparing her search spider and typed in the five key phrases katherine had given her here goes nothing feeling little optimism she launched the spider effectively commencing a worldwide game of go fish at blinding speed the phrases were now being compared to texts all over the world looking for a perfect match trish couldnt help but wonder what this was all about but she had come to accept that working with the solomons meant never quite knowing the entire story chapter robert langdon stole an anxious glance at his wristwatch pm the smiling face of mickey mouse did little to cheer him up ive got to find peter were wasting time sato had stepped aside for a moment to take a phone call but now she returned to langdon professor am i keeping you from something no maam langdon said pulling his sleeve down over his watch im just extremely concerned about peter i can understand but i assure you the best thing you can do to help peter is to help me understand the mindset of his captor langdon was not so sure but he sensed he was not going anywhere until the os director got the information she desired a moment ago sato said you suggested this rotunda is somehow sacred to the idea of these ancient mysteries yes maam explain that to me langdon knew he would have to choose his words sparingly he had taught for entire semesters on the mystical symbolism of washington dc and there was an almost inexhaustible list of mystical references in this building alone america has a hidden past every time langdon lectured on the symbology of america his students were confounded to learn that the true intentions of our nations forefathers had absolutely nothing to do with what so many politicians now claimed americas intended destiny has been lost to history the forefathers who founded this capital city first named her rome they had named her river the tiber and erected a classical capital of pantheons and temples all adorned with images of historys great gods and goddesses apollo minerva venus helios vulcan jupiter in her center as in many of the great classical cities the founders had erected an enduring tribute to the ancients the egyptian obelisk this obelisk larger even than cairos or alexandrias rose feet into the sky more than thirty stories proclaiming thanks and honor to the demigod forefather for whom this capital city took its newer name washington now centuries later despite americas separation of church and state this statesponsored rotunda glistened with ancient religious symbolism there were over a dozen different gods in the rotunda more than the original pantheon in rome of course the roman pantheon had been converted to christianity in but this pantheon was never converted vestiges of its true history still remained in plain view as you may know langdon said this rotunda was designed as a tribute to one of romes most venerated mystical shrines the temple of vesta as in the vestal virgins sato looked doubtful that romes virginal guardians of the flame had anything to do with the us capitol building the temple of vesta in rome langdon said was circular with a gaping hole in the floor through which the sacred fire of enlightenment could be tended by a sisterhood of virgins whose job it was to ensure the flame never went out sato shrugged this rotunda is a circle but i see no gaping hole in this floor no not anymore but for years the center of this room had a large opening precisely where peters hand is now langdon motioned to the floor in fact you can still see the marks in the floor from the railing that kept people from falling in what sato demanded scrutinizing the floor ive never heard that looks like hes right anderson pointed out the circle of iron nubs where the posts had once been ive seen these before but i never had any idea why they were there youre not alone langdon thought imagining the thousands of people every day including famous lawmakers who strode across the center of the rotunda having no idea there was once a day when they would have plunged down into the capitol crypt the level beneath the rotunda floor the hole in the floor langdon told them was eventually covered but for a good while those who visited the rotunda could see straight down to the fire that burned below sato turned fire in the us capitol more of a large torch actually an eternal flame that burned in the crypt directly beneath us it was supposed to be visible through the hole in the floor making this room a modern temple of vesta this building even had its own vestal virgin a federal employee called the keeper of the crypt who successfully kept the flame burning for fifty years until politics religion and smoke damage snuffed out the idea both anderson and sato looked surprised nowadays the only reminder that a flame once burned here was the fourpointed star compass embedded in the crypt floor one story below them a symbol of americas eternal flame which once shed illumination toward the four corners of the new world so professor sato said your contention is that the man who left peters hand here knew all this clearly and much much more there are symbols all over this room that reflect a belief in the ancient mysteries secret wisdom sato said with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice knowledge that lets men acquire godlike powers yes maam that hardly fits with the christian underpinnings of this country so it would seem but its true this transformation of man into god is called apotheosis whether or not youre aware of it this theme transforming man into god is the core element in this rotundas symbolism apotheosis anderson spun with a startled look of recognition yes anderson works here he knows the word apotheosis literally means divine transformationthat of man becoming god its from the ancient greek apo to become theos god anderson looked amazed apotheosis means to become god i had no idea what am i missing sato demanded maam langdon said the largest painting in this building is called the apotheosis of washington and it clearly depicts george washington being transformed into a god sato looked doubtful ive never seen anything of the sort actually im sure you have langdon raised his index finger pointing straight up its directly over your head chapter the apotheosisof washington a squarefoot fresco that covers the canopy of the capitol rotunda was completed in by constantino brumidi known as the michelangelo of the capitol brumidi had laid claim to the capitol rotunda in the same way michelangelo had laid claim to the sistine chapel by painting a fresco on the rooms most lofty canvas the ceiling like michelangelo brumidi had done some of his finest work inside the vatican brumidi however immigrated to america in abandoning gods largest shrine in favor of a new shrine the us capitol which now glistened with examples of his mastery from the trompe loeil of the brumidi corridors to the frieze ceiling of the vice presidents room and yet it was the enormous image hovering above the capitol rotunda that most historians considered to be brumidis masterwork robert langdon gazed up at the massive fresco that covered the ceiling he usually enjoyed his students startled reactions to this frescos bizarre imagery but at the moment he simply felt trapped in a nightmare he had yet to understand director sato was standing next to him with her hands on her hips frowning up at the distant ceiling langdon sensed she was having the same reaction many had when they first stopped to examine the painting at the core of their nation utter confusion youre not alone langdon thought for most people the apotheosis of washington got stranger and stranger the longer they looked at it thats george washington on the central panel langdon said pointing feet upward into the middle of the dome as you can see hes dressed in white robes attended by thirteen maidens and ascending on a cloud above mortal man this is the moment of his apotheosis his transformation into a god sato and anderson said nothing nearby langdon continued you can see a strange anachronistic series of figures ancient gods presenting our forefathers with advanced knowledge theres minerva giving technological inspiration to our nations great inventors ben franklin robert fulton samuel morse langdon pointed them out one by one and over there is vulcan helping us build a steam engine beside them is neptune demonstrating how to lay the transatlantic cable beside that is ceres goddess of grain and root of our word cereal shes sitting on the mccormick reaper the farming breakthrough that enabled this country to become a world leader in food production the painting quite overtly portrays our forefathers receiving great wisdom from the gods he lowered his head looking at sato now knowledge is power and the right knowledge lets man perform miraculous almost godlike tasks sato dropped her gaze back down to langdon and rubbed her neck laying a phone cable is a far cry from being a god perhaps to a modern man langdon replied but if george washington knew that we had become a race that possessed the power to speak to one another across oceans fly at the speed of sound and set foot on our moon he would assume that we had become gods capable of miraculous tasks he paused in the words of futurist arthur c clarke any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic sato pursed her lips apparently deep in thought she glanced down at the hand and then followed the direction of the outstretched index finger up into the dome professor you were told peter will point the way is that correct yes maam but chief sato said turning away from langdon can you get us a closer look at the painting anderson nodded theres a catwalk around the interior of the dome langdon looked way way up to the tiny railing visible just beneath the painting and felt his body go rigid theres no need to go up there he had experienced that seldomvisited catwalk once before as the guest of a us senator and his wife and he had almost fainted from the dizzying height and perilous walkway no need sato demanded professor we have a man who believes this room contains a portal that has the potential to make him a god we have a ceiling fresco that symbolizes the transformation of a man into a god and we have a hand pointing straight at that painting it seems everything is urging us upward actually anderson interjected glancing up not many people know this but there is one hexagonal coffer in the dome that actually swings open like a portal and you can peer down through it and wait a second langdon said youre missing the point the portal this man is looking for is a figurative portal a gateway that doesnt exist when he said peter will point the way he was talking in metaphorical terms this pointinghand gesture with its index finger and thumb extended upward is a wellknown symbol of the ancient mysteries and it appears all over the world in ancient art this same gesture appears in three of leonardo da vincis most famous encoded masterpieces the last supper adoration of the magi and saint john the baptist its a symbol of mans mystical connection to god as above so below the madmans bizarre choice of words was starting to feel more relevant now ive never seen it before sato said then watch espn langdon thought always amused to see professional athletes point skyward in gratitude to god after a touchdown or home run he wondered how many knew they were continuing a prechristian mystical tradition of acknowledging the mystical power above which for one brief moment had transformed them into a god capable of miraculous feats if its of any help langdon said peters hand is not the first such hand to make an appearance in this rotunda sato eyed him like he was insane i beg your pardon langdon motioned to her blackberry google george washington zeus sato looked uncertain but started typing anderson inched toward her looking over her shoulder intently langdon said this rotunda was once dominated by a massive sculpture of a barechested george washington depicted as a god he sat in the same exact pose as zeus in the pantheon bare chest exposed left hand holding a sword right hand raised with thumb and finger extended sato had apparently found an online image because anderson was staring at her blackberry in shock hold on thats george washington yes langdon said depicted as zeus look at his hand anderson said still peering over satos shoulder his right hand is in the same exact position as mr solomons as i said langdon thought peters hand is not the first to make an appearance in this room when horatio greenoughs statue of a naked george washington was first unveiled in the rotunda many joked that washington must be reaching skyward in a desperate attempt to find some clothes as american religious ideals changed however the joking criticism turned to controversy and the statue was removed banished to a shed in the east garden currently it made its home at the smithsonians national museum of american history where those who saw it had no reason to suspect that it was one of the last vestigial links to a time when the father of the country had watched over the us capitol as a god like zeus watching over the pantheon sato began dialing a number on her blackberry apparently seeing this as an opportune moment to check in with her staff what have you got she listened patiently i see she glanced directly at langdon then at peters hand youre certain she listened a moment longer okay thanks she hung up and turned back toward langdon my support staff did some research and confirms the existence of your socalled hand of the mysteries corroborating everything you said five fingertip markings the star the sun the key the crown and the lantern as well as the fact that this hand served as an ancient invitation to learn secret wisdom im glad langdon said dont be she replied curtly it appears were now at a dead end until you share whatever it is youre still not telling me maam sato stepped toward him weve come full circle professor youve told me nothing i could not have learned from my own staff and so i will ask you once more why were you brought here tonight what makes you so special what is it that you alone know weve been through this langdon fired back i dont know why this guy thinks i know anything at all langdon was half tempted to demand how the hell sato knew that he was in the capitol tonight but theyd been through that too sato isnt talking if i knew the next step he told her id tell you but i dont traditionally the hand of the mysteries is extended by a teacher to a student and then shortly afterward the hand is followed up with a set of instructions directions to a temple the name of the master who will teach you something but all this guy left for us is five tattoos hardly langdon stopped short sato eyed him what is it langdons eyes shot back to the hand five tattoos he now realized that what he was saying might not be entirely true professor sato pressed langdon inched toward the gruesome object peter will point the way earlier it crossed my mind that maybe this guy had left an object clenched in peters palm a map or a letter or a set of directions he didnt anderson said as you can see those three fingers are not clenched tightly youre right langdon said but it occurs to me he crouched down now trying to see up under the fingers to the hidden part of peters palm maybe its not written on paper tattooed anderson said langdon nodded do you see anything on the palm sato asked langdon crouched lower trying to peer up under the loosely clenched fingers the angle is impossible i cant oh for heavens sake sato said moving toward him just open the damned thing anderson stepped in front of her maam we should really wait for forensics before we touch i want some answers sato said pushing past him she crouched down edging langdon away from the hand langdon stood up and watched in disbelief as sato pulled a pen from her pocket sliding it carefully under the three clenched fingers then one by one she pried each finger upward until the hand stood fully open with its palm visible she glanced up at langdon and a thin smile spread across her face right again professor chapter pacing the library katherine solomon pulled back the sleeve of her lab coat and checked her watch she was not a woman accustomed to waiting but at the moment she felt as if her whole world were on hold she was waiting for trishs searchspider results she was waiting for word from her brother and also she was waiting for a callback from the man who was responsible for this entire troubling situation i wish he hadnt told me she thought normally katherine was extremely careful about making new acquaintances and although she had met this man for the first time only this afternoon he had earned her trust in a matter of minutes completely his call had come this afternoon while katherine was at home enjoying her usual sundayafternoon pleasure of catching up on the weeks scientific journals ms solomon an unusually airy voice had said my name is dr christopher abaddon i was hoping i might speak to you for a moment about your brother im sorry who is this she had demanded and how did you get my private cellphone number dr christopher abaddon katherine did not recognize the name the man cleared his throat as if the situation had just become awkward i apologize ms solomon i was under the impression your brother had told you about me im his doctor your cell number was listed as his emergency contact katherines heart skipped emergency contact is something wrong no i dont think so the man said your brother missed an appointment this morning and i cant reach him on any of his numbers he never misses appointments without calling and im just a little worried i hesitated to phone you but no no not at all i appreciate the concern katherine was still trying to place the doctors name i havent spoken to my brother since yesterday morning but he probably just forgot to turn on his cell katherine had recently given him a new iphone and he still hadnt taken the time to figure out how to use it you say youre his doctor she asked does peter have an illness hes keeping from me there was a weighty pause on the line im terribly sorry but ive obviously just made a rather serious professional error by calling you your brother told me you were aware of his visits to me but now i see thats not the case my brother lied to his doctor katherines concern was now growing steadily is he sick im sorry ms solomon doctorpatient confidentiality precludes me from discussing your brothers condition and ive already said too much by admitting he is my patient im going to hang up now but if you hear from him today please ask him to call me so i know hes okay wait katherine said please tell me whats wrong with peter dr abaddon exhaled sounding displeased with his mistake ms solomon i can hear youre upset and i dont blame you im sure your brother is fine he was in my office just yesterday yesterday and hes scheduled again today this sounds urgent the man heaved a sigh i suggest we give him a little more time before we im coming by your office right now katherine said heading for the door where are you located silence dr christopher abaddon katherine said i can look up your address myself or you can simply give it to me either way im coming over the doctor paused if i meet with you ms solomon would you please do me the courtesy of saying nothing to your brother until ive had a chance to explain my misstep thats fine thank you my office is in kalorama heights he gave her an address twenty minutes later katherine solomon was navigating the stately streets of kalorama heights she had phoned all of her brothers numbers with no reply she did not feel overly concerned about her brothers whereabouts and yet the news that he was secretly seeing a doctor was troubling when katherine finally located the address she stared up at the building in confusion this is a doctors office the opulent mansion before her had a wroughtiron security fence electronic cameras and lush grounds as she slowed to doublecheck the address one of the security cameras rotated toward her and the gate swung open tentatively katherine drove up the driveway and parked next to a sixcar garage and a stretch limo what kind of doctor is this guy as she got out of her car the front door of the mansion opened and an elegant figure drifted out onto the landing he was handsome exceptionally tall and younger than she had imagined even so he projected the sophistication and polish of an older man he was impeccably dressed in a dark suit and tie and his thick blond hair was immaculately coiffed ms solomon im dr christopher abaddon he said his voice a breathy whisper when they shook hands his skin felt smooth and well tended katherine solomon she said trying not to stare at his skin which was unusually smooth and bronzed is he wearing makeup katherine felt a growing disquiet as she stepped into the homes beautifully appointed foyer classical music played softly in the background and it smelled as if someone had burned incense this is lovely she said although i expected more of an office im fortunate to work out of my home the man led her into a living room where there was a crackling fire please make yourself comfortable im just steeping some tea ill bring it out and we can talk he strode toward the kitchen and disappeared katherine solomon did not sit female intuition was a potent instinct that she had learned to trust and something about this place was making her skin crawl she saw nothing that looked anything like any doctors office she had ever seen the walls of this antiqueadorned living room were covered with classical art primarily paintings with strange mythical themes she paused before a large canvas depicting the three graces whose nude bodies were spectacularly rendered in vivid colors thats the original michael parkes oil dr abaddon appeared without warning beside her holding a tray of steaming tea i thought wed sit by the fire he led her over to the living room and offered her a seat theres no reason to be nervous im not nervous katherine said entirely too quickly he gave her a reassuring smile actually it is my business to know when people are nervous i beg your pardon im a practicing psychiatrist ms solomon that is my profession ive been seeing your brother for almost a year now im his therapist katherine could only stare my brother is in therapy patients often choose to keep their therapy to themselves the man said i made a mistake by calling you although in my defense your brother did mislead me i i had no idea i apologize if i made you nervous he said sounding embarrassed i noticed you studying my face when we met and yes i do wear makeup he touched his own cheek looking selfconscious i have a dermatological condition which i prefer to hide my wife usually puts the makeup on for me but when shes not here i have to rely on my own heavy touch katherine nodded too embarrassed to speak and this lovely hair he touched his lush blond mane a wig my skin condition affected my scalp follicles as well and all my hair jumped ship he shrugged im afraid my one sin is vanity apparently mine is rudeness katherine said not at all dr abaddons smile was disarming shall we start over perhaps with some tea they sat in front of the fire and abaddon poured tea your brother got me in the habit of serving tea during our sessions he said the solomons are tea drinkers family tradition katherine said black please they sipped their tea and made small talk for a few minutes but katherine was eager for information about her brother why was my brother coming to you she asked and why didnt he tell me admittedly peter had endured more than his fair share of tragedy in his life losing his father at a young age and then within a span of five years burying his only son and then his mother even so peter had always found a way to cope dr abaddon took a sip of tea your brother came to me because he trusts me we have a bond beyond that of normal patient and doctor he motioned to a framed document near the fireplace it looked like a diploma until katherine spied the doubleheaded phoenix youre a mason the highest degree no less peter and i are brothers of sorts you must have done something important to be invited into the thirtythird degree not really he said i have family money and i give a lot of money to masonic charities katherine now realized why her brother trusted this young doctor a mason with family money interested in philanthropy and ancient mythology dr abaddon had more in common with her brother than she had initially imagined when i asked why my brother came to you she said i didnt mean why did he choose you i meant why is he seeking the services of a psychiatrist dr abaddon smiled yes i know i was trying to sidestep the question politely its really not something i should be discussing he paused although i must say im puzzled that your brother would keep our discussions from you considering that they relate so directly to your research my research katherine said taken totally off guard my brother talks about my research recently your brother came to me looking for a professional opinion about the psychological impact of the breakthroughs you are making in your lab katherine almost choked on the tea really im surprised she managed what is peter thinking he told his shrink about my work their security protocol involved not discussing with anyone what katherine was working on moreover the confidentiality had been her brothers idea certainly you are aware ms solomon that your brother is deeply concerned about what will happen when your research goes public he sees the potential for a significant philosophical shift in the world and he came here to discuss the possible ramifications from a psychological perspective i see katherine said her teacup now shaking slightly the questions we discuss are challenging ones what happens to the human condition if the great mysteries of life are finally revealed what happens when those beliefs that we accept on faith are suddenly categorically proven as fact or disproved as myth one could argue that there exist certain questions that are best left unanswered katherine could not believe what she was hearing and yet she kept her emotions in check i hope you dont mind dr abaddon but id prefer not to discuss the details of my work i have no immediate plans to make anything public for the time being my discoveries will remain safely locked in my lab interesting abaddon leaned back in his chair lost in thought for a moment in any event i asked your brother to come back today because yesterday he suffered a bit of a break when that happens i like to have clients break katherines heart was pounding as in breakdown she couldnt imagine her brother breaking down over anything abaddon reached out kindly please i can see ive upset you im sorry considering these awkward circumstances i can understand how you might feel entitled to answers whether im entitled or not katherine said my brother is all i have left of my family nobody knows him better than i do so if you tell me what the hell happened maybe i can help you we all want the same thing whats best for peter dr abaddon fell silent for several long moments and then began slowly nodding as if katherine might have a point finally he spoke for the record ms solomon if i decide to share this information with you i would do so only because i think your insights might help me assist your brother of course abaddon leaned forward putting his elbows on his knees ms solomon as long as ive been seeing your brother ive sensed in him a deep struggle with feelings of guilt ive never pressed him on it because thats not why he comes to me and yet yesterday for a number of reasons i finally asked him about it abaddon locked eyes with her your brother opened up rather dramatically and unexpectedly he told me things i had not expected to hear including everything that happened the night your mother died christmas eve almost exactly ten years ago she died in my arms he told me your mother was murdered during a robbery attempt at your home a man broke in looking for something he believed your brother was hiding thats correct abaddons eyes were appraising her your brother said he shot the man dead yes abaddon stroked his chin do you recall what the intruder was looking for when he broke into your home katherine had tried in vain for ten years to block out the memory yes his demand was very specific unfortunately none of us knew what he was talking about his demand never made sense to any of us well it made sense to your brother what katherine sat up at least according to the story he told me yesterday peter knew exactly what the intruder was looking for and yet your brother did not want to hand it over so he pretended not to understand thats absurd peter couldnt possibly have known what the man wanted his demands made no sense interesting dr abaddon paused and took a few notes as i mentioned however peter told me he did know your brother believes if he had only cooperated with the intruder maybe your mother would be alive today this decision is the source of all his guilt katherine shook her head thats crazy abaddon slumped looking troubled ms solomon this has been useful feedback as i feared your brother seems to have had a little break with reality i must admit i was afraid this might be the case thats why i asked him to come back today these delusional episodes are not uncommon when they relate to traumatic memories katherine shook her head again peter is far from delusional dr abaddon i would agree except except what except that his recounting of the attack was just the beginning a tiny fraction of the long and farfetched tale he told me katherine leaned forward in her seat what did peter tell you abaddon gave a sad smile ms solomon let me ask you this has your brother ever discussed with you what he believes is hidden here in washington dc or the role he believes he plays in protecting a great treasure of lost ancient wisdom katherines jaw fell open what in the world are you talking about dr abaddon heaved a long sigh what i am about to tell you will be a bit shocking katherine he paused and locked eyes with her but it will be immeasurably helpful if you can tell me anything you may know about it he reached for her cup more tea chapter another tattoo langdon crouched anxiously beside peters open palm and examined the seven tiny symbols that had been hidden beneath the lifeless clenched fingers they appear to be numbers langdon said surprised although i dont recognize them the first is a roman numeral anderson said actually i dont think so langdon corrected the roman numeral iiix doesnt exist it would be written vii how about the rest of it sato asked im not sure it looks like eighteightfive in arabic numbers arabic anderson asked they look like normal numbers our normal numbers are arabic langdon had become so accustomed to clarifying this point for his students that hed actually prepared a lecture about the scientific advances made by early middle eastern cultures one of them being our modern numbering system whose advantages over roman numerals included positional notation and the invention of the number zero of course langdon always ended this lecture with a reminder that arab culture had also given mankind the word alkuhl the favorite beverage of harvard freshmen known as alcohol langdon scrutinized the tattoo feeling puzzled and im not even sure about the eighteightfive the rectilinear writing looks unusual those may not be numbers then what are they sato asked im not sure the whole tattoo looks almost runic meaning sato asked runic alphabets are composed solely of straight lines their letters are called runes and were often used for carving in stone because curves were too difficult to chisel if these are runes sato said what is their meaning langdon shook his head his expertise extended only to the most rudimentary runic alphabet futhark a thirdcentury teutonic system and this was not futhark to be honest im not even sure these are runes youd need to ask a specialist there are dozens of different forms hдlsinge manx the dotted stungnar peter solomon is a mason is he not langdon did a double take yes but what does that have to do with this he stood up now towering over the tiny woman you tell me you just said that runic alphabets are used for stone carvings and it is my understanding that the original freemasons were stone craftsmen i mention this only because when i asked my office to search for a connection between the hand of the mysteries and peter solomon their search returned one link in particular she paused as if to emphasize the importance of her finding the masons langdon exhaled fighting the impulse to tell sato the same thing he constantly told his students google is not a synonym for research in these days of massive worldwide keyword searches it seemed everything was linked to everything the world was becoming one big entangled web of information that was getting denser every day langdon maintained a patient tone im not surprised the masons appeared in your staffs search masons are a very obvious link between peter solomon and any number of esoteric topics yes sato said which is another reason i have been surprised this evening that you have not yet mentioned the masons after all youve been talking about secret wisdom protected by an enlightened few that sounds very masonic does it not it does and it also sounds very rosicrucian kabbalistic alumbradian and any number of other esoteric groups but peter solomon is a mason a very powerful mason at that it seems the masons would come to mind if we were talking about secrets heaven knows the masons love their secrets langdon could hear the distrust in her voice and he wanted no part of it if you want to know anything about the masons you would be far better served to ask a mason actually sato said id prefer to ask someone i can trust langdon found the comment both ignorant and offensive for the record maam the entire masonic philosophy is built on honesty and integrity masons are among the most trustworthy men you could ever hope to meet i have seen persuasive evidence to the contrary langdon was liking director sato less and less with each passing moment he had spent years writing about the masons rich tradition of metaphorical iconography and symbols and knew that masons had always been one of the most unfairly maligned and misunderstood organizations in the world regularly accused of everything from devil worship to plotting a oneworld government the masons also had a policy of never responding to their critics which made them an easy target regardless sato said her tone biting we are again at an impasse mr langdon it seems to me there is either something you are missing or something you are not telling me the man were dealing with said that peter solomon chose you specifically she leveled a cold stare at langdon i think its time we move this conversation to cia headquarters maybe well have more luck there satos threat barely registered with langdon she had just said something that had lodged in his mind peter solomon chose you the comment combined with the mention of masons had hit langdon strangely he looked down at the masonic ring on peters finger the ring was one of peters most prized possessions a solomon family heirloom that bore the symbol of the doubleheaded phoenix the ultimate mystical icon of masonic wisdom the gold glinted in the light sparking an unexpected memory langdon gasped recalling the eerie whisper of peters captor it really hasnt dawned on you yet has it why you were chosen now in one terrifying moment langdons thoughts snapped into focus and the fog lifted all at once langdons purpose here was crystal clear ten miles away driving south on suitland parkway malakh heard a distinctive vibration on the seat beside him it was peter solomons iphone which had proven a powerful tool today the visual caller id now displayed the image of an attractive middleaged woman with long black hair incoming call katherine solomon malakh smiled ignoring the call destiny pulls me closer he had lured katherine solomon to his home this afternoon for one reason only to determine if she had information that could assist him perhaps a family secret that might help malakh locate what he sought clearly however katherines brother had told her nothing of what he had been guarding all these years even so malakh had learned something else from katherine something that has earned her a few extra hours of life today katherine had confirmed for him that all of her research was in one location safely locked inside her lab i must destroy it katherines research was poised to open a new door of understanding and once the door was opened even a crack others would follow it would just be a matter of time before everything changed i cannot let that happen the world must stay as it is adrift in ignorant darkness the iphone beeped indicating katherine had left a voice mail malakh retrieved it peter its me again katherines voice sounded concerned where are you im still thinking about my conversation with dr abaddon and im worried is everything okay please call me im at the lab the voice mail ended malakh smiled katherine should worry less about her brother and more about herself he turned off suitland parkway onto silver hill road less than a mile later in the darkness he spotted the faint outline of the smsc nestled in the trees off the highway to his right the entire complex was surrounded by a high razorwire fence a secure building malakh chuckled to himself i know someone who will open the door for me chapter the revelation crashed over langdon like a wave i know why i am here standing in the center of the rotunda langdon felt a powerful urge to turn and run away from peters hand from the shining gold ring from the suspicious eyes of sato and anderson instead he stood dead still clinging more tightly to the leather daybag that hung on his shoulder ive got to get out of here his jaw clenched as his memory began replaying the scene from that cold morning years ago in cambridge it was six am and langdon was entering his classroom as he always did following his ritual morning laps in the harvard pool the familiar smells of chalk dust and steam heat greeted him as he crossed the threshold he took two steps toward his desk but stopped short a figure was waiting there for him an elegant gentleman with an aquiline face and regal gray eyes peter langdon stared in shock peter solomons smile flashed white in the dimly lit room good morning robert surprised to see me his voice was soft and yet there was power there langdon hurried over and warmly shook his friends hand what in the world is a yale blue blood doing on the crimson campus before dawn covert mission behind enemy lines solomon said laughing he motioned to langdons trim waistline laps are paying off youre in good shape just trying to make you feel old langdon said toying with him its great to see you peter whats up short business trip the man replied glancing around the deserted classroom im sorry to drop in on you like this robert but i have only a few minutes theres something i needed to ask you in person a favor thats a first langdon wondered what a simple college professor could possibly do for the man who had everything anything at all he replied pleased for any opportunity to do something for someone who had given him so much especially when peters life of good fortune had also been marred by so much tragedy solomon lowered his voice i was hoping you would consider looking after something for me langdon rolled his eyes not hercules i hope langdon had once agreed to take care of solomons hundredfiftypound mastiff hercules during solomons travels while at langdons home the dog apparently had become homesick for his favorite leather chew toy and had located a worthy substitute in langdons study an original vellum handcalligraphed illuminated bible from the s somehow bad dog didnt quite seem adequate you know im still searching for a replacement solomon said smiling sheepishly forget it im glad hercules got a taste of religion solomon chuckled but seemed distracted robert the reason i came to see you is id like you to keep an eye on something that is quite valuable to me i inherited it a while back but im no longer comfortable leaving it in my home or in my office langdon immediately felt uncomfortable anything quite valuable in peter solomons world had to be worth an absolute fortune how about a safedeposit box doesnt your family have stock in half the banks in america that would involve paperwork and bank employees id prefer a trusted friend and i know you can keep secrets solomon reached in his pocket and pulled out a small package handing it to langdon considering the dramatic preamble langdon had expected something more impressive the package was a small cubeshaped box about three inches square wrapped in faded brown packing paper and tied with twine from the packages heavy weight and size it felt like its contents must be rock or metal this is it langdon turned the box in his hands now noticing the twine had been carefully secured on one side with an embossed wax seal like an ancient edict the seal bore a doubleheaded phoenix with the number emblazoned on its chest the traditional symbol of the highest degree of freemasonry really peter langdon said a lopsided grin creeping across his face youre the worshipful master of a masonic lodge not the pope sealing packages with your ring solomon glanced down at his gold ring and gave a chuckle i didnt seal this package robert my greatgrandfather did almost a century ago langdons head snapped up what solomon held up his ring finger this masonic ring was his after that it was my grandfathers then my fathers and eventually mine langdon held up the package your greatgrandfather wrapped this a century ago and nobody has opened it thats right but why not solomon smiled because its not time langdon stared time for what robert i know this will sound odd but the less you know the better just put this package somewhere safe and please tell no one i gave it to you langdon searched his mentors eyes for a glint of playfulness solomon had a propensity for dramatics and langdon wondered if he wasnt being played a bit here peter are you sure this isnt just a clever ploy to make me think ive been entrusted with some kind of ancient masonic secret so ill be curious and decide to join the masons do not recruit robert you know that besides youve already told me youd prefer not to join this was true langdon had great respect for masonic philosophy and symbolism and yet he had decided never to be initiated the orders vows of secrecy would prevent him from discussing freemasonry with his students it had been for this same reason that socrates had refused to formally participate in the eleusinian mysteries as langdon now regarded the mysterious little box and its masonic seal he could not help but ask the obvious question why not entrust this to one of your masonic brothers lets just say i have an instinct it would be safer stored outside the brotherhood and please dont let the size of this package fool you if what my father told me is correct then it contains something of substantial power he paused a talisman of sorts did he say a talisman by definition a talisman was an object with magical powers traditionally talismans were used for bringing luck warding off evil spirits or aiding in ancient rituals peter you do realize that talismans went out of vogue in the middle ages right peter laid a patient hand on langdons shoulder i know how this sounds robert ive known you a long time and your skepticism is one of your greatest strengths as an academic it is also your greatest weakness i know you well enough to know youre not a man i can ask to believe only to trust so now i am asking you to trust me when i tell you this talisman is powerful i was told it can imbue its possessor with the ability to bring order from chaos langdon could only stare the idea of order from chaos was one of the great masonic axioms ordo ab chao even so the claim that a talisman could impart any power at all was absurd much less the power to bring order from chaos this talisman solomon continued would be dangerous in the wrong hands and unfortunately i have reason to believe powerful people want to steal it from me his eyes were as serious as langdon could ever recall i would like you to keep it safe for me for a while can you do that that night langdon sat alone at his kitchen table with the package and tried to imagine what could possibly be inside in the end he simply chalked it up to peters eccentricity and locked the package in his librarys wall safe eventually forgetting all about it that was until this morning the phone call from the man with the southern accent oh professor i almost forgot the assistant had said after giving langdon the specifics of his travel arrangements to dc there is one more thing mr solomon requested yes langdon replied his mind already moving to the lecture he had just agreed to give mr solomon left a note here for you the man began reading awkwardly as if trying to decipher peters penmanship please ask robert to bring the small sealed package i gave him many years ago the man paused does this make any sense to you langdon felt surprised as he recalled the small box that had been sitting in his wall safe all this time actually yes i know what peter means and you can bring it of course tell peter ill bring it wonderful the assistant sounded relieved enjoy your speech tonight safe travels before leaving home langdon had dutifully retrieved the wrapped package from the back of his safe and placed it in his shoulder bag now he was standing in the us capitol feeling certain of only one thing peter solomon would be horrified to know how badly langdon had failed him chapter my godkatherine was right as usual trish dunne stared in amazement at the searchspider results that were materializing on the plasma wall before her she had doubted the search would turn up any results at all but in fact she now had over a dozen hits and they were still coming in one entry in particular looked quite promising trish turned and shouted in the direction of the library katherine i think youll want to see this it had been a couple of years since trish had run a search spider like this and tonights results astounded her a few years ago this search would have been a dead end now however it seemed that the quantity of searchable digital material in the world had exploded to the point where someone could find literally anything incredibly one of the keywords was a word trish had never even heard before and the search even found that katherine rushed through the controlroom door what have you got a bunch of candidates trish motioned to the plasma wall every one of these documents contains all of your key phrases verbatim katherine tucked her hair behind her ear and scanned the list before you get too excited trish added i can assure you that most of these documents are not what youre looking for theyre what we call black holes look at the file sizes absolutely enormous theyre things like compressed archives of millions of emails giant unabridged encyclopedia sets global message boards that have been running for years and so forth by virtue of their size and diverse content these files contain so many potential keywords that they suck in any search engine that comes anywhere near them katherine pointed to one of the entries near the top of the list how about that one trish smiled katherine was a step ahead having found the sole file on the list that had a small file size good eyes yeah thats really our only candidate so far in fact that files so small it cant be more than a page or so open it katherines tone was intense trish could not imagine a onepage document containing all the strange search strings katherine had provided nonetheless when she clicked and opened the document the key phrases were there crystal clear and easy to spot in the text katherine strode over eyes riveted to the plasma wall this document is redacted trish nodded welcome to the world of digitized text automatic redaction had become standard practice when offering digitized documents redaction was a process wherein a server allowed a user to search the entire text but then revealed only a small portion of it a teaser of sorts only that text immediately flanking the requested keywords by omitting the vast majority of the text the server avoided copyright infringement and also sent the user an intriguing message i have the information youre searching for but if you want the rest of it youll have to buy it from me as you can see trish said scrolling through the heavily abridged page the document contains all of your key phrases katherine stared up at the redaction in silence trish gave her a minute and then scrolled back to the top of the page each of katherines key phrases was underlined in capital letters and accompanied by a small sample of teaser text the two words that appeared on either side of the requested phrase trish could not imagine what this document was referring to and what the heck is a symbolon katherine stepped eagerly toward the screen where did this document come from who wrote it trish was already working on it give me a second im trying to chase down the source i need to know who wrote this katherine repeated her voice intense i need to see the rest of it im trying trish said startled by the edge in katherines tone strangely the files location was not displaying as a traditional web address but rather as a numeric internet protocol address i cant unmask the ip trish said the domain names not coming up hold on she pulled up her terminal window ill run a traceroute trish typed the sequence of commands to ping all the hops between her control rooms machine and whatever machine was storing this document tracing now she said executing the command traceroutes were extremely fast and a long list of network devices appeared almost instantly on the plasma wall trish scanned down down through the path of routers and switches that connected her machine to what the hell her trace had stopped before reaching the documents server her ping for some reason had hit a network device that swallowed it rather than bouncing it back it looks like my traceroute got blocked trish said is that even possible run it again trish launched another traceroute and got the same result nope dead end its like this document is on a server that is untraceable she looked at the last few hops before the dead end i can tell you though its located somewhere in the dc area youre kidding not surprising trish said these spider programs spiral out geographically meaning the first results are always local besides one of your search strings was washington dc how about a who is search katherine prompted wouldnt that tell you who owns the domain a bit lowbrow but not a bad idea trish navigated to the who is database and ran a search for the ip hoping to match the cryptic numbers to an actual domain name her frustration was now tempered by rising curiosity who has this document the who is results appeared quickly showing no match and trish held up her hands in defeat its like this ip address doesnt exist i cant get any information about it at all obviously the ip exists weve just searched a document thats stored there true and yet whoever had this document apparently preferred not to share his or her identity im not sure what to tell you systems traces arent really my thing and unless you want to call in someone with hacking skills im at a loss do you know someone trish turned and stared at her boss katherine i was kidding its not exactly a great idea but it is done she checked her watch um yeah all the time technically its pretty easy who do you know hackers trish laughed nervously like half the guys at my old job anyone you trust is she serious trish could see katherine was dead serious well yeah she said hurriedly i know this one guy we could call he was our systems security specialist serious computer geek he wanted to date me which kind of sucked but hes a good guy and id trust him also he does freelance can he be discreet hes a hacker of course he can be discreet thats what he does but im sure hed want at least a thousand bucks to even look call him offer him double for fast results trish was not sure what made her more uncomfortable helping katherine solomon hire a hacker or calling a guy who probably still found it impossible to believe a pudgy redheaded metasystems analyst would rebuff his romantic advances youre sure about this use the phone in the library katherine said its got a blocked number and obviously dont use my name right trish headed for the door but paused when she heard katherines iphone chirp with luck the incoming text message might be information that would grant trish a reprieve from this distasteful task she waited as katherine fished the iphone from her lab coats pocket and eyed the screen katherine solomon felt a wave of relief to see the name on her iphone at last peter solomon its a text message from my brother she said glancing over at trish trish looked hopeful so maybe we should ask him about all this before we call a hacker katherine eyed the redacted document on the plasma wall and heard dr abaddons voice that which your brother believes is hidden in dc it can be found katherine had no idea what to believe anymore and this document represented information about the farfetched ideas with which peter had apparently become obsessed katherine shook her head i want to know who wrote this and where its located make the call trish frowned and headed for the door whether or not this document would be able to explain the mystery of what her brother had told dr abaddon there was at least one mystery that had been solved today her brother had finally learned how to use the textmessaging feature on the iphone katherine had given him and alert the media katherine called after trish the great peter solomon just sent his first text message in a stripmall parking lot across the street from the smsc malakh stood beside his limo stretching his legs and waiting for the phone call he knew would be coming the rain had stopped and a winter moon had started to break through the clouds it was the same moon that had shone down on malakh through the oculus of the house of the temple three months ago during his initiation the world looks different tonight as he waited his stomach growled again his twoday fast although uncomfortable was critical to his preparation such were the ancient ways soon all physical discomforts would be inconsequential as malakh stood in the cold night air he chuckled to see that fate had deposited him rather ironically directly in front of a tiny church here nestled between sterling dental and a minimart was a tiny sanctuary lords house of glory malakh gazed at the window which displayed part of the churchs doctrinal statement we believe that jesus christ was begotten by the holy spirit and born of the virgin mary and is both true man and god malakh smiled yes jesus is indeed both man and god but a virgin birth is not the prerequisite for divinity that is not how it happens the ring of a cell phone cut the night air quickening his pulse the phone that was now ringing was malakhs own a cheap disposable phone he had purchased yesterday the caller id indicated it was the call he had been anticipating a local call malakh mused gazing out across silver hill road toward the faint moonlit outline of a zigzag roofline over the treetops malakh flipped open his phone this is dr abaddon he said tuning his voice deeper its katherine the womans voice said i finally heard from my brother oh im relieved how is he hes on his way to my lab right now katherine said in fact he suggested you join us im sorry malakh feigned hesitation in your lab he must trust you deeply he never invites anyone back there i suppose maybe he thinks a visit might help our discussions but i feel like its an intrusion if my brother says youre welcome then youre welcome besides he said he has a lot to tell us both and id love to get to the bottom of whats going on very well then where exactly is your lab at the smithsonian museum support center do you know where that is no malakh said staring across the parking lot at the complex im actually in my car right now and i have a guidance system whats the address fortytwoten silver hill road okay hold on ill type it in malakh waited for ten seconds and then said ah good news it looks like im closer than i thought the gps says im only about ten minutes away great ill phone the security gate and tell them youre coming through thank you ill see you shortly malakh pocketed the disposable phone and looked out toward the smsc was i rude to invite myself smiling he now pulled out peter solomons iphone and admired the text message he had sent katherine several minutes earlier got your messages alls fine busy day forgot appointment with dr abaddon sorry not to mention him sooner long story am headed to lab now if available have dr abaddon join us inside i trust him fully and i have much to tell you both peter not surprisingly peters iphone now pinged with an incoming reply from katherine peter congrats on learning to text relieved youre okay spoke to dr a and he is coming to lab see you shortly k clutching solomons iphone malakh crouched down under his limousine and wedged the phone between the front tire and the pavement this phone had served malakh well but now it was time it became untraceable he climbed behind the wheel put the car in gear and crept forward until he heard the sharp crack of the iphone imploding malakh put the car back in park and stared out at the distant silhouette of the smsc ten minutes peter solomons sprawling warehouse housed over thirty million treasures but malakh had come here tonight to obliterate only the two most valuable all of katherine solomons research and katherine solomon herself chapter professor langdon sato said you look like youve seen a ghost are you okay langdon hoisted his daybag higher onto his shoulder and laid his hand on top of it as if somehow this might better hide the cubeshaped package he was carrying he could feel his face had gone ashen im just worried about peter sato cocked her head eyeing him askew langdon felt a sudden wariness that satos involvement tonight might relate to this small package that solomon had entrusted to him peter had warned langdon powerful people want to steal this it would be dangerous in the wrong hands langdon couldnt imagine why the cia would want a little box containing a talisman or even what the talisman could be ordo ab chao sato stepped closer her black eyes probing i sense youve had a revelation langdon felt himself sweating now no not exactly whats on your mind i just langdon hesitated having no idea what to say he had no intention of revealing the existence of the package in his bag and yet if sato took him to the cia his bag most certainly would be searched on the way in actually he fibbed i have another idea about the numbers on peters hand satos expression revealed nothing yes she glanced over at anderson now who was just arriving from greeting the forensics team that had finally arrived langdon swallowed hard and crouched down beside the hand wondering what he could possibly come up with to tell them youre a teacher robert improvise he took one last look at the seven tiny symbols hoping for some sort of inspiration nothing blank as langdons eidetic memory skimmed through his mental encyclopedia of symbols he could find only one possible point to make it was something that had occurred to him initially but had seemed unlikely at the moment however he had to buy time to think well he began a symbologists first clue that hes on the wrong track when deciphering symbols and codes is when he starts interpreting symbols using multiple symbolic languages for example when i told you this text was roman and arabic that was a poor analysis because i used multiple symbolic systems the same is true for roman and runic sato crossed her arms and arched her eyebrows as if to say go on in general communications are made in one language not multiple languages and so a symbologists first job with any text is to find a single consistent symbolic system that applies to the entire text and you see a single system now well yes and no langdons experience with the rotational symmetry of ambigrams had taught him that symbols sometimes had meanings from multiple angles in this case he realized there was indeed a way to view all seven symbols in a single language if we manipulated the hand slightly the language will become consistent eerily the manipulation langdon was about to perform was one that seemed to have been suggested by peters captor already when he spoke the ancient hermetic adage as above so below langdon felt a chill as he reached out and grasped the wooden base on which peters hand was secured gently he turned the base upside down so that peters extended fingers were now pointing straight down the symbols on the palm instantly transformed themselves from this angle langdon said xiii becomes a valid roman numeral thirteen moreover the rest of the characters can be interpreted using the roman alphabet sbb langdon assumed the analysis would elicit blank shrugs but andersons expression immediately changed sbb the chief demanded sato turned to anderson if im not mistaken that sounds like a familiar numbering system here in the capitol building anderson looked pale it is sato gave a grim smile and nodded to anderson chief follow me please id like a word in private as director sato led chief anderson out of earshot langdon stood alone in bewilderment what the hell is going on here and what is sbb xiii chief anderson wondered how this night could possibly get any stranger the hand says sbb he was amazed any outsider had even heard of sbb much less sbb peter solomons index finger it seemed was not directing them upward as it had appeared but rather was pointing in quite the opposite direction director sato led anderson over to a quiet area near the bronze statue of thomas jefferson chief she said i trust you know exactly where sbb thirteen is located of course do you know whats inside no not without looking i dont think its been used in decades well youre going to open it up anderson did not appreciate being told what he would do in his own building maam that may be problematic ill have to check the assignment roster first as you know most of the lower levels are private offices or storage and security protocol regarding private you will unlock sbb thirteen for me sato said or i will call os and send in a team with a battering ram anderson stared at her a long moment and then pulled out his radio raising it to his lips this is anderson i need someone to unlock the sbb have someone meet me there in five minutes the voice that replied sounded confused chief confirming you said sbb correct sbb send someone immediately and ill need a flashlight he stowed his radio andersons heart was pounding as sato stepped closer lowering her voice even further chief time is short she whispered and i want you to get us down to sbb thirteen as quickly as possible yes maam i also need something else from you in addition to breaking and entering anderson was in no position to protest and yet it had not gone unnoticed by him that sato had arrived within minutes of peters hand appearing in the rotunda and that she now was using the situation to demand access to private sections of the us capitol she seemed so far ahead of the curve tonight that she was practically defining it sato motioned across the room toward the professor the duffel bag on langdons shoulder anderson glanced over what about it i assume your staff xrayed that bag when langdon entered the building of course all bags are scanned i want to see that xray i want to know whats in his bag anderson looked over at the bag langdon had been carrying all evening but wouldnt it be easier just to ask him what part of my request was unclear anderson pulled out his radio again and called in her request sato gave anderson her blackberry address and requested that his team email her a digital copy of the xray as soon as they had located it reluctantly anderson complied forensics was now collecting the severed hand for the capitol police but sato ordered them to deliver it directly to her team at langley anderson was too tired to protest he had just been run over by a tiny japanese steamroller and i want that ring sato called over to forensics the chief technician seemed ready to question her but thought better of it he removed the gold ring from peters hand placed it in a clear specimen bag and gave it to sato she slipped it into her jacket pocket and then turned to langdon were leaving professor bring your things where are we going langdon replied just follow mr anderson yes anderson thought and follow me closely the sbb was a section of the capitol that few ever visited to reach it they would pass through a sprawling labyrinth of tiny chambers and tight passages buried beneath the crypt abraham lincolns youngest son tad had once gotten lost down there and almost perished anderson was starting to suspect that if sato had her way robert langdon might suffer a similar fate chapter systems security specialist mark zoubianis had always prided himself on his ability to multitask at the moment he was seated on his futon along with a tv remote a cordless phone a laptop a pda and a large bowl of pirates booty with one eye on the muted redskins game and one eye on his laptop zoubianis was speaking on his bluetooth headset with a woman he had not heard from in over a year leave it to trish dunne to call on the night of a playoff game confirming her social ineptitude yet again his former colleague had chosen the redskins game as a perfect moment to chat him up and request a favor after some brief small talk about the old days and how she missed his great jokes trish had gotten to her point she was trying to unmask a hidden ip address probably that of a secure server in the dc area the server contained a small text document and she wanted access to it or at the very least some information about whose document it was right guy wrong timing he had told her trish then showered him with her finest geek flattery most of which was true and before zoubianis knew it he was typing a strangelooking ip address into his laptop zoubianis took one look at the number and immediately felt uneasy trish this ip has a funky format its written in a protocol that isnt even publicly available yet its probably gov intel or military military trish laughed believe me i just pulled a redacted document off this server and it was not military zoubianis pulled up his terminal window and tried a traceroute you said your traceroute died yeah twice same hop mine too he pulled up a diagnostic probe and launched it and whats so interesting about this ip i ran a delegator that tapped a search engine at this ip and pulled a redacted document i need to see the rest of the document im happy to pay them for it but i cant figure out who owns the ip or how to access it zoubianis frowned at his screen are you sure about this im running a diagnostic and this firewall coding looks pretty serious thats why you get the big bucks zoubianis considered it theyd offered him a fortune for a job this easy one question trish why are you so hot on this trish paused im doing a favor for a friend must be a special friend she is zoubianis chuckled and held his tongue i knew it look trish said sounding impatient are you good enough to unmask this ip yes or no yes im good enough and yes i know youre playing me like a fiddle how long will it take you not long he said typing as he spoke i should be able to get into a machine on their network within ten minutes or so once im in and know what im looking at ill call you back i appreciate it so are you doing well now she asks trish for gods sake you called me on the night of a playoff game and now you want to chat do you want me to hack this ip or not thanks mark i appreciate it ill be waiting for your call fifteen minutes zoubianis hung up grabbed his bowl of pirates booty and unmuted the game women chapter where arethey taking me as langdon hurried with anderson and sato into the depths of the capitol he felt his heart rate increasing with each downward step they had begun their journey through the west portico of the rotunda descending a marble staircase and then doubling back through a wide doorway into the famous chamber directly beneath the rotunda floor the capitol crypt the air was heavier here and langdon was already feeling claustrophobic the crypts low ceiling and soft uplighting accentuated the robust girth of the forty doric columns required to support the vast stone floor directly overhead relax robert this way anderson said moving quickly as he angled to the left across the wide circular space thankfully this particular crypt contained no bodies instead it contained several statues a model of the capitol and a low storage area for the wooden catafalque on which coffins were laid for state funerals the entourage hurried through without even a glance at the fourpointed marble compass in the center of the floor where the eternal flame had once burned anderson seemed to be in a hurry and sato once again had her head buried in her blackberry cellular service langdon had heard was boosted and broadcast to all corners of the capitol building to support the hundreds of government phone calls that took place here every day after diagonally crossing the crypt the group entered a dimly lit foyer and began winding through a convoluted series of hallways and dead ends the warren of passages contained numbered doorways each of which bore an identification number langdon read the doors as they snaked their way around s s s he had no idea what lay behind these doors but at least one thing now seemed clear the meaning of the tattoo on peter solomons palm sbb appeared to be a numbered doorway somewhere in the bowels of the us capitol building what are all these doorways langdon asked clutching his daybag tightly to his ribs and wondering what solomons tiny package could possibly have to do with a door marked sbb offices and storage anderson said private offices and storage he added glancing back at sato sato did not even glance up from her blackberry they look tiny langdon said glorified closets most of them but theyre still some of the most soughtafter real estate in dc this is the heart of the original capitol and the old senate chamber is two stories above us and sbb thirteen langdon asked whose office is that nobodys the sbb is a private storage area and i must say im puzzled how chief anderson sato interrupted without looking up from her blackberry just take us there please anderson clenched his jaw and guided them on in silence through what was now feeling like a hybrid selfstorage facility and epic labyrinth on almost every wall directional signs pointed back and forth apparently attempting to locate specific office blocks in this network of hallways s to s st to st h to h ht to ht langdon doubted he could ever find his way out of here alone this place is a maze from all he could gather office numbers began with either an s or an h depending on whether they were on the senate side of the building or the house side areas designated st and ht were apparently on a level that anderson called terrace level still no signs for sbb finally they arrived at a heavy steel security door with a keycard entry box sb level langdon sensed they were getting closer anderson reached for his key card but hesitated looking uncomfortable with satos demands chief sato prompted we dont have all night anderson reluctantly inserted his key card the steel door released he pushed it open and they stepped through into the foyer beyond the heavy door clicked shut behind them langdon wasnt sure what he had hoped to see in this foyer but the sight in front of him was definitely not it he was staring at a descending stairway down again he said stopping short theres a level under the crypt yes anderson said sb stands for senate basement langdon groaned terrific chapter the headlights winding up the smscs wooded access road were the first the guard had seen in the last hour dutifully he turned down the volume on his portable tv set and stashed his snacks beneath the counter lousy timing the redskins were completing their opening drive and he didnt want to miss it as the car drew closer the guard checked the name on the notepad in front of him dr christopher abaddon katherine solomon had just called to alert security of this guests imminent arrival the guard had no idea who this doctor might be but he was apparently very good at doctoring he was arriving in a black stretch limousine the long sleek vehicle rolled to a stop beside the guardhouse and the drivers tinted window lowered silently good evening the chauffeur said doffing his cap he was a powerfully built man with a shaved head he was listening to the football game on his radio i have dr christopher abaddon for ms katherine solomon the guard nodded identification please the chauffeur looked surprised im sorry didnt ms solomon call ahead the guard nodded stealing a glance at the television im still required to scan and log visitor identification sorry regulations ill need to see the doctors id not a problem the chauffeur turned backward in his seat and spoke in hushed tones through the privacy screen as he did the guard stole another peek at the game the redskins were breaking from the huddle now and he hoped to get this limo through before the next play the chauffeur turned forward again and held out the id that hed apparently just received through the privacy screen the guard took the card and quickly scanned it into his system the dc drivers license showed one christopher abaddon from kalorama heights the photo depicted a handsome blond gentleman wearing a blue blazer a necktie and a satin pocket square who the hell wears a pocket square to the dmv a muffled cheer went up from the television set and the guard wheeled just in time to see a redskins player dancing in the end zone his finger pointed skyward i missed it the guard grumbled returning to the window okay he said returning the license to the chauffeur youre all set as the limo pulled through the guard returned to his tv hoping for a replay as malakh drove his limo up the winding access road he couldnt help but smile peter solomons secret museum had been simple to breach sweeter still tonight was the second time in twentyfour hours that malakh had broken into one of solomons private spaces last night a similar visit had been made to solomons home although peter solomon had a magnificent country estate in potomac he spent much of his time in the city at his penthouse apartment at the exclusive dorchester arms his building like most that catered to the superrich was a veritable fortress high walls guard gates guest lists secured underground parking malakh had driven this very limousine up to the buildings guardhouse doffed his chauffeurs cap from his shaved head and proclaimed i have dr christopher abaddon he is an invited guest of mr peter solomon malakh spoke the words as if he were announcing the duke of york the guard checked a log and then abaddons id yes i see mr solomon is expecting dr abaddon he pressed a button and the gate opened mr solomon is in the penthouse apartment have your guest use the last elevator on the right it goes all the way up thank you malakh tipped his hat and drove through as he wound deep into the garage he scanned for security cameras nothing apparently those who lived here were neither the kind of people who broke into cars nor the kind of people who appreciated being watched malakh parked in a dark corner near the elevators lowered the divider between the drivers compartment and the passenger compartment and slithered through the opening into the back of the limo once in back he got rid of his chauffeurs cap and donned his blond wig straightening his jacket and tie he checked the mirror to make sure he had not smeared his makeup malakh was not about to take any chances not tonight i have waited too long for this seconds later malakh was stepping into the private elevator the ride to the top was silent and smooth when the door opened he found himself in an elegant private foyer his host was already waiting dr abaddon welcome malakh looked into the mans famous gray eyes and felt his heart begin to race mr solomon i appreciate your seeing me please call me peter the two men shook hands as malakh gripped the older mans palm he saw the gold masonic ring on solomons hand the same hand that had once aimed a gun at malakh a voice whispered from malakhs distant past if you pull that trigger i will haunt you forever please come in solomon said ushering malakh into an elegant living room whose expansive windows offered an astonishing view of the washington skyline do i smell tea steeping malakh asked as he entered solomon looked impressed my parents always greeted guests with tea ive carried on that tradition he led malakh into the living room where a tea service was waiting in front of the fire cream and sugar black thank you again solomon looked impressed a purist he poured them both a cup of black tea you said you needed to discuss something with me that was sensitive in nature and could be discussed only in private thank you i appreciate your time you and i are masonic brothers now we have a bond tell me how i can help you first i would like to thank you for the honor of the thirtythird degree a few months ago this is deeply meaningful to me im glad but please know that those decisions are not mine alone they are by vote of the supreme council of course malakh suspected peter solomon had probably voted against him but within the masons as with all things money was power malakh after achieving the thirtysecond degree in his own lodge had waited only a month before making a multimilliondollar donation to charity in the name of the masonic grand lodge the unsolicited act of selflessness as malakh anticipated was enough to earn him a quick invitation into the elite thirtythird degree and yet i have learned no secrets despite the ageold whispers all is revealed at the thirtythird degreemalakh had been told nothing new nothing of relevance to his quest but he had never expected to be told the inner circle of freemasonry contained smaller circles still circles malakh would not see for years if ever he didnt care his initiation had served its purpose something unique had happened within that temple room and it had given malakh power over all of them i no longer play by your rules you do realize malakh said sipping his tea that you and i met many years ago solomon looked surprised really i dont recall it was quite a long time ago and christopher abaddon is not my real name im so sorry my mind must be getting old remind me how i know you malakh smiled one last time at the man he hated more than any other man on earth its unfortunate that you dont recall in one fluid motion malakh pulled a small device from his pocket and extended it outward driving it hard into the mans chest there was a flash of blue light the sharp sizzle of the stungun discharge and a gasp of pain as one million volts of electricity coursed through peter solomons body his eyes went wide and he slumped motionless in his chair malakh stood up now towering over the man salivating like a lion about to consume his injured prey solomon was gasping straining to breathe malakh saw fear in his victims eyes and wondered how many people had ever seen the great peter solomon cower malakh savored the scene for several long seconds he took a sip of tea waiting for the man to catch his breath solomon was twitching attempting to speak whwhy he finally managed why do you think malakh demanded solomon looked truly bewildered you want money money malakh laughed and took another sip of tea i gave the masons millions of dollars i have no need of wealth i come for wisdom and he offers me wealth then what do you want you possess a secret you will share it with me tonight solomon struggled to lift his chin so he could look malakh in the eye i dont understand no more lies malakh shouted advancing to within inches of the paralyzed man i know what is hidden here in washington solomons gray eyes were defiant i have no idea what youre talking about malakh took another sip of tea and set the cup on a coaster you spoke those same words to me ten years ago on the night of your mothers death solomons eyes shot wide open you she didnt have to die if you had given me what i demanded the older mans face contorted in a mask of horrified recognition and disbelief i warned you malakh said if you pulled the trigger i would haunt you forever but youre malakh lunged driving the taser hard into solomons chest again there was another flash of blue light and solomon went completely limp malakh put the taser back in his pocket and calmly finished his tea when he was done he dabbed his lips with a monogrammed linen napkin and peered down at his victim shall we go solomons body was motionless but his eyes were wide and engaged malakh got down close and whispered in the mans ear im taking you to a place where only truth remains without another word malakh wadded up the monogrammed napkin and stuffed it into solomons mouth then he hoisted the limp man onto his broad shoulders and headed for the private elevator on his way out he picked up solomons iphone and keys from the hall table tonight you will tell me all your secrets malakh thought including why you left me for dead all those years ago chapter sb level senate basement robert langdons claustrophobia gripped him more tightly with every hastening step of their descent as they moved deeper into the buildings original foundation the air became heavy and the ventilation seemed nonexistent the walls down here were an uneven blend of stone and yellow brick director sato typed on her blackberry as they walked langdon sensed a suspicion in her guarded manner but the feeling was quickly becoming reciprocal sato still hadnt told him how she knew langdon was here tonight an issue of national security he had a hard time understanding any relation between ancient mysticism and national security then again he had a hard time understanding much of anything about this situation peter solomon entrusted me with a talisman a deluded lunatic tricked me into bringing it to the capitol and wants me to use it to unlock a mystical portal possibly in a room called sbb not exactly a clear picture as they pressed on langdon tried to shake from his mind the horrible image of peters tattooed hand transformed into the hand of the mysteries the gruesome picture was accompanied by peters voice the ancient mysteries robert have spawned many myths but that does not mean they themselves are fiction despite a career studying mystical symbols and history langdon had always struggled intellectually with the idea of the ancient mysteries and their potent promise of apotheosis admittedly the historical record contained indisputable evidence that secret wisdom had been passed down through the ages apparently having come out of the mystery schools in early egypt this knowledge moved underground resurfacing in renaissance europe where according to most accounts it was entrusted to an elite group of scientists within the walls of europes premier scientific think tank the royal society of london enigmatically nicknamed the invisible college this concealed college quickly became a brain trust of the worlds most enlightened minds those of isaac newton francis bacon robert boyle and even benjamin franklin today the list of modern fellows was no less impressive einstein hawking bohr and celsius these great minds had all made quantum leaps in human understanding advances that according to some were the result of their exposure to ancient wisdom hidden within the invisible college langdon doubted this was true although certainly there had been an unusual amount of mystical work taking place within those walls the discovery of isaac newtons secret papers in had stunned the world by revealing newtons allconsuming passion for the study of ancient alchemy and mystical wisdom newtons private papers included a handwritten letter to robert boyle in which he exhorted boyle to keep high silence regarding the mystical knowledge they had learned it cannot be communicated newton wrote without immense damage to the world the meaning of this strange warning was still being debated today professor sato said suddenly glancing up from her blackberry despite your insistence that you have no idea why youre here tonight perhaps you could shed light on the meaning of peter solomons ring i can try langdon said refocusing she produced the specimen bag and handed it to langdon tell me about the symbols on his ring langdon examined the familiar ring as they moved through the deserted passageway its face bore the image of a doubleheaded phoenix holding a banner proclaiming ordo ab chao and its chest was emblazoned with the number the doubleheaded phoenix with the number thirtythree is the emblem of the highest masonic degree technically this prestigious degree existed solely within the scottish rite nonetheless the rites and degrees of masonry were a complex hierarchy that langdon had no desire to detail for sato tonight essentially the thirtythird degree is an elite honor reserved for a small group of highly accomplished masons all the other degrees can be attained by successful completion of the previous degree but ascension to the thirtythird degree is controlled its by invitation only so you were aware that peter solomon was a member of this elite inner circle of course membership is hardly a secret and he is their highestranking official currently yes peter heads the supreme council thirtythird degree which is the governing body of the scottish rite in america langdon always loved visiting their headquarters the house of the temple a classical masterpiece whose symbolic ornamentation rivaled that of scotlands rosslyn chapel professor did you notice the engraving on the rings band it bears the words all is revealed at the thirtythird degree langdon nodded its a common theme in masonic lore meaning i assume that if a mason is admitted to this highest thirtythird degree then something special is revealed to him yes thats the lore but probably not the reality theres always been conspiratorial conjecture that a select few within this highest echelon of masonry are made privy to some great mystical secret the truth i suspect is probably far less dramatic peter solomon often made playful allusions to the existence of a precious masonic secret but langdon always assumed it was just a mischievous attempt to coax him into joining the brotherhood unfortunately tonights events had been anything but playful and there had been nothing mischievous about the seriousness with which peter had urged langdon to protect the sealed package in his daybag langdon glanced forlornly at the plastic bag containing peters gold ring director he asked would you mind if i held on to this she looked over why its very valuable to peter and id like to return it to him tonight she looked skeptical lets hope you get that chance thanks langdon pocketed the ring another question sato said as they hastened deeper into the labyrinth my staff said that while crosschecking the concepts of the thirtythird degree and portal with masonry they turned up literally hundreds of references to a pyramid thats not surprising either langdon said the pyramid builders of egypt are the forerunners of the modern stonemasons and the pyramid along with egyptian themes is very common in masonic symbolism symbolizing what the pyramid essentially represents enlightenment its an architectural symbol emblematic of ancient mans ability to break free from his earthly plane and ascend upward toward heaven toward the golden sun and ultimately toward the supreme source of illumination she waited a moment nothing else nothing else langdon had just described one of historys most elegant symbols the structure through which man elevated himself into the realm of the gods according to my staff she said it sounds like there is a much more relevant connection tonight they tell me there exists a popular legend about a specific pyramid here in washington a pyramid that relates specifically to the masons and the ancient mysteries langdon now realized what she was referring to and he tried to dispel the notion before they wasted any more time i am familiar with the legend director but its pure fantasy the masonic pyramid is one of dcs most enduring myths probably stemming from the pyramid on the great seal of the united states why didnt you mention it earlier langdon shrugged because it has no basis in fact like i said its a myth one of many associated with the masons and yet this particular myth relates directly to the ancient mysteries sure as do plenty of others the ancient mysteries are the foundation for countless legends that have survived in history stories about powerful wisdom protected by secret guardians like the templars the rosicrucians the illuminati the alumbrados the list goes on and on they are all based on the ancient mysteries and the masonic pyramid is just one example i see sato said and what does this legend actually say langdon considered it for a few steps and then replied well im no specialist in conspiracy theory but i am educated in mythology and most accounts go something like this the ancient mysteries the lost wisdom of the ages have long been considered mankinds most sacred treasure and like all great treasures they have been carefully protected the enlightened sages who understood the true power of this wisdom learned to fear its awesome potential they knew that if this secret knowledge were to fall into uninitiated hands the results could be devastating as we said earlier powerful tools can be used either for good or for evil so in order to protect the ancient mysteries and mankind in the process the early practitioners formed secret fraternities inside these brotherhoods they shared their wisdom only with the properly initiated passing the wisdom from sage to sage many believe we can look back and see the historical remnants of those who mastered the mysteries in the stories of sorcerers magicians and healers and the masonic pyramid sato asked how does that fit in well langdon said striding faster now to keep pace this is where history and myth begin to merge according to some accounts by the sixteenth century in europe almost all of these secret fraternities had become extinct most of them exterminated by a growing tide of religious persecution the freemasons it is said became the last surviving custodians of the ancient mysteries understandably they feared that if their own brotherhood one day died off like its predecessors the ancient mysteries would be lost for all time and the pyramid sato again pressed langdon was getting to it the legend of the masonic pyramid is quite simple it states that the masons in order to fulfill their responsibility of protecting this great wisdom for future generations decided to hide it in a great fortress langdon tried to gather his recollections of the story again i stress this is all myth but allegedly the masons transported their secret wisdom from the old world to the new world here to america a land they hoped would remain free from religious tyranny and here they built an impenetrable fortress a hidden pyramid designed to protect the ancient mysteries until the time that all of mankind was ready to handle the awesome power that this wisdom could communicate according to the myth the masons crowned their great pyramid with a shining solidgold capstone as symbol of the precious treasure within the ancient wisdom capable of empowering mankind to his full human potential apotheosis quite a story sato said yes the masons fall victim to all kinds of crazy legends obviously you dont believe such a pyramid exists of course not langdon replied theres no evidence whatsoever to suggest that our masonic forefathers built any kind of pyramid in america much less in dc its pretty difficult to hide a pyramid especially one large enough to hold all the lost wisdom of the ages the legend as langdon recalled never explained exactly what was supposed to be inside the masonic pyramid whether it was ancient texts occult writings scientific revelations or something far more mysterious but the legend did say that the precious information inside was ingeniously encoded and understandable only to the most enlightened souls anyway langdon said this story falls into a category we symbologists call an archetypal hybrida blend of other classic legends borrowing so many elements from popular mythology that it could only be a fictional construct not historical fact when langdon taught his students about archetypal hybrids he used the example of fairy tales which were recounted across generations and exaggerated over time borrowing so heavily from one another that they evolved into homogenized morality tales with the same iconic elements virginal damsels handsome princes impenetrable fortresses and powerful wizards by way of fairy tales this primeval battle of good vs evil is ingrained into us as children through our stories merlin vs morgan le fay saint george vs the dragon david vs goliath snow white vs the witch and even luke skywalker battling darth vader sato scratched her head as they turned a corner and followed anderson down a short flight of stairs tell me this if im not mistaken pyramids were once considered mystical portals through which the deceased pharaohs could ascend to the gods were they not true sato stopped short and caught langdons arm glaring up at him with an expression somewhere between surprise and disbelief youre saying peter solomons captor told you to find a hidden portal and it didnt occur to you that he was talking about the masonic pyramid from this legend by any name the masonic pyramid is a fairy tale its purely fantasy sato stepped closer to him now and langdon could smell her cigarette breath i understand your position on that professor but for the sake of my investigation the parallel is hard to ignore a portal leading to secret knowledge to my ear this sounds a lot like what peter solomons captor claims you alone can unlock well i can hardly believe what you believe is not the point no matter what you believe you must concede that this man might himself believe that the masonic pyramid is real the mans a lunatic he may well believe that sbb thirteen is the entrance to a giant underground pyramid that contains all the lost wisdom of the ancients sato stood perfectly still her eyes seething the crisis i am facing tonight is not a fairy tale professor it is quite real i assure you a cold silence hung between them maam anderson finally said gesturing to another secure door ten feet away were almost there if youd like to continue sato finally broke eye contact with langdon motioning for anderson to move on they followed the security chief through the secure doorway which deposited them in a narrow passage langdon looked left and then right youve got to be kidding he was standing in the longest hallway he had ever seen chapter trish dunne felt the familiar surge of adrenaline as she exited the bright lights of the cube and moved into the raw darkness of the void the smscs front gate had just called to say that katherines guest dr abaddon had arrived and required an escort back to pod trish had offered to bring him back mostly out of curiosity katherine had said very little about the man who would be visiting them and trish was intrigued the man was apparently someone peter solomon trusted deeply the solomons never invited anyone back to the cube this was a first i hope he handles the crossing okay trish thought as she moved through the frigid darkness the last thing she needed was katherines vip panicking when he realized what he had to do to get to the lab the first time is always the worst trishs first time had been about a year ago she had accepted katherines job offer signed a nondisclosure and then come to the smsc with katherine to see the lab the two women had walked the length of the street arriving at a metal door marked pod even though katherine had tried to prepare her by describing the labs remote location trish was not ready for what she saw when the pod door hissed open the void katherine stepped over the threshold walked a few feet into the perfect blackness and then motioned for trish to follow trust me you wont get lost trish pictured herself wandering in a pitchblack stadiumsize room and broke a sweat at the mere thought we have a guidance system to keep you on track katherine pointed to the floor very lowtech trish squinted through the darkness at the rough cement floor it took a moment to see it in the darkness but there was a narrow carpet runner that had been laid down in a straight line the carpet ran like a roadway disappearing into the darkness see with your feet katherine said turning and walking off just follow right behind me as katherine disappeared into the blackness trish swallowed her fear and followed this is insane she had taken only a few steps down the carpet when the pod door swung shut behind her snuffing out the last faint hint of light pulse racing trish turned all of her attention to the feeling of the carpet beneath her feet she had ventured only a handful of steps down the soft runner when she felt the side of her right foot hit hard cement startled she instinctively corrected to the left getting both feet back on soft carpet katherines voice materialized up ahead in the blackness her words almost entirely swallowed by the lifeless acoustics of this abyss the human body is amazing she said if you deprive it of one sensory input the other senses take over almost instantly right now the nerves in your feet are literally tuning themselves to become more sensitive good thing trish thought correcting course again they walked in silence for what seemed entirely too long how much farther trish finally asked were about halfway katherines voice sounded more distant now trish sped up doing her best to stay composed but the breadth of the darkness felt like it would engulf her i cant see one millimeter in front of my face katherine how do you know when to stop walking youll know in a moment katherine said that was a year ago and now tonight trish was once again in the void heading in the opposite direction out to the lobby to retrieve her bosss guest a sudden change in carpet texture beneath her feet alerted her that she was three yards from the exit the warning track as it was called by peter solomon an avid baseball fan trish stopped short pulled out her key card and groped in the darkness along the wall until she found the raised slot and inserted her card the door hissed open trish squinted into the welcoming light of the smsc hallway made it again moving through the deserted corridors trish found herself thinking about the bizarre redacted file they had found on a secure network ancient portal secret location underground she wondered if mark zoubianis was having any luck figuring out where the mysterious document was located inside the control room katherine stood in the soft glow of the plasma wall and gazed up at the enigmatic document they had uncovered she had isolated her key phrases now and felt increasingly certain that the document was talking about the same farflung legend that her brother had apparently shared with dr abaddon secret location underground where the somewhere in washington dc the coordinates uncovered an ancient portal that led warning the pyramid holds dangerous decipher this engraved symbolon to unveil i need to see the rest of the file katherine thought she stared a moment longer and then flipped the plasma walls power switch katherine always turned off this energyintensive display so as not to waste the fuel cells liquid hydrogen reserves she watched as her keywords slowly faded collapsing down into a tiny white dot which hovered in the middle of the wall and then finally twinkled out she turned and walked back toward her office dr abaddon would be arriving momentarily and she wanted to make him feel welcome chapter almost there anderson said guiding langdon and sato down the seemingly endless corridor that ran the entire length of the capitols eastern foundation in lincolns day this passage had a dirt floor and was filled with rats langdon felt grateful the floor had been tiled he was not a big fan of rats the group continued on their footfalls drumming up an eerie uneven echo in the long passageway doorways lined the long hallway some closed but many ajar many of the rooms down on this level looked abandoned langdon noticed the numbers on the doors were now descending and after a while seemed to be running out sb sb sb sb they continued past an unmarked door but anderson stopped short when the numbers began ascending again hb hb sorry anderson said missed it i almost never come down this deep the group backed up a few yards to an old metal door which langdon now realized was located at the hallways central point the meridian that divided the senate basement sb and the house basement hb as it turned out the door was indeed marked but its engraving was so faded it was almost imperceptible sbb here we are anderson said keys will be arriving any moment sato frowned and checked her watch langdon eyed the sbb marking and asked anderson why is this space associated with the senate side even though its in the middle anderson looked puzzled what do you mean it says sbb which begins with an s not an h anderson shook his head the s in sbb doesnt stand for senate it chief a guard called out in the distance he came jogging up the hallway toward them holding out a key sorry sir it took a few minutes we couldnt locate the main sbb key this is a spare from an auxiliary box the original is missing anderson said sounding surprised probably lost the guard replied arriving out of breath nobody has requested access down here for ages anderson took the key no secondary key for sbb thirteen sorry so far were not finding keys for any of the rooms in the sbb macdonalds on it now the guard pulled out his radio and spoke into it bob im with the chief any additional info yet on the key for sbb thirteen the guards radio crackled and a voice replied actually yeah its strange im seeing no entries since we computerized but the hard logs indicate all the storage rooms in the sbb were cleaned out and abandoned more than twenty years ago theyre now listed as unused space he paused all except for sbb thirteen anderson grabbed the radio this is the chief what do you mean all except sbb thirteen well sir the voice replied ive got a handwritten notation here that designates sbb thirteen as private it was a long time ago but its written and initialed by the architect himself the term architect langdon knew was not a reference to the man who had designed the capitol but rather to the man who ran it similar to a building manager the man appointed as architect of the capitol was in charge of everything including maintenance restoration security hiring personnel and assigning offices the strange thing the voice on the radio said is that the architects notation indicates that this private space was set aside for the use of peter solomon langdon sato and anderson all exchanged startled looks im guessing sir the voice continued that mr solomon has our primary key to the sbb as well as any keys to sbb thirteen langdon could not believe his ears peter has a private room in the basement of the capitol he had always known peter solomon had secrets but this was surprising even to langdon okay anderson said clearly unamused were hoping to get access to sbb thirteen specifically so keep looking for a secondary key will do sir were also working on the digital image that you requested thank you anderson interrupted pressing the talk button and cutting him off that will be all send that file to director satos blackberry as soon as you have it understood sir the radio went silent anderson handed the radio back to the guard in front of them the guard pulled out a photocopy of a blueprint and handed it to his chief sir the sbb is in gray and weve notated with an x which room is sbb thirteen so it shouldnt be hard to find the area is quite small anderson thanked the guard and turned his focus to the blueprint as the young man hurried off langdon looked on surprised to see the astonishing number of cubicles that made up the bizarre maze beneath the us capitol anderson studied the blueprint for a moment nodded and then stuffed it into his pocket turning to the door marked sbb he raised the key but hesitated looking uneasy about opening it langdon felt similar misgivings he had no idea what was behind this door but he was quite certain that whatever solomon had hidden down here he wanted to keep private very private sato cleared her throat and anderson got the message the chief took a deep breath inserted the key and tried to turn it the key didnt move for a split second langdon felt hopeful the key was wrong on the second try though the lock turned and anderson heaved the door open as the heavy door creaked outward damp air rushed out into the corridor langdon peered into the darkness but could see nothing at all professor anderson said glancing back at langdon as he groped blindly for a light switch to answer your question the s in sbb doesnt stand for senate it stands for sub sub langdon asked puzzled anderson nodded and flicked the switch just inside the door a single bulb illuminated an alarmingly steep staircase descending into inky blackness sbb is the capitols subbasement chapter systems security specialist mark zoubianis was sinking deeper into his futon and scowling at the information on his laptop screen what the hell kind of address is this his best hacking tools were entirely ineffective at breaking into the document or at unmasking trishs mysterious ip address ten minutes had passed and zoubianiss program was still pounding away in vain at the network firewalls they showed little hope of penetration no wonder theyre overpaying me he was about to retool and try a different approach when his phone rang trish for christs sake i said id call you he muted the football game and answered yeah is this mark zoubianis a man asked at kingston drive in washington zoubianis could hear other muffled conversations in the background a telemarketer during the playoffs are they insane let me guess i won a week in anguilla no the voice replied with no trace of humor this is systems security for the central intelligence agency we would like to know why you are attempting to hack one of our classified databases three stories above the capitol buildings subbasement in the wideopen spaces of the visitor center security guard nuсez locked the main entry doors as he did every night at this time as he headed back across the expansive marble floors he thought of the man in the armysurplus jacket with the tattoos i let him in nuсez wondered if he would have a job tomorrow as he headed toward the escalator a sudden pounding on the outside doors caused him to turn he squinted back toward the main entrance and saw an elderly african american man outside rapping on the glass with his open palm and motioning to be let in nuсez shook his head and pointed to his watch the man pounded again and stepped into the light he was immaculately dressed in a blue suit and had closecropped graying hair nuсezs pulse quickened holy shit even at a distance nuсez now recognized who this man was he hurried back to the entrance and unlocked the door im sorry sir please please come in warren bellamy architect of the capitol stepped across the threshold and thanked nuсez with a polite nod bellamy was lithe and slender with an erect posture and piercing gaze that exuded the confidence of a man in full control of his surroundings for the last twentyfive years bellamy had served as the supervisor of the us capitol may i help you sir nuсez asked thank you yes bellamy enunciated his words with crisp precision as a northeastern ivy league graduate his diction was so exacting he sounded almost british ive just learned that you had an incident here this evening he looked deeply concerned yes sir it was wheres chief anderson downstairs with director sato from the cias office of security bellamys eyes widened with concern the cia is here yes sir director sato arrived almost immediately after the incident why bellamy demanded nuсez shrugged as if i was going to ask bellamy strode directly toward the escalators where are they they just went to the lower levels nuсez hastened after him bellamy glanced back with a look of concern downstairs why i dont really know i just heard it on my radio bellamy was moving faster now take me to them right away yes sir as the two men hurried across the open expanse nuсez caught a glimpse of a large golden ring on bellamys finger nuсez pulled out his radio ill alert the chief that youre coming down no bellamys eyes flashed dangerously id prefer to be unannounced nuсez had made some big mistakes tonight but failing to alert chief anderson that the architect was now in the building would be his last sir he said uneasy i think chief anderson would prefer you are aware that i employ mr anderson bellamy said nuсez nodded then i think he would prefer you obey my wishes chapter trish dunne entered the smsc lobby and looked up with surprise the guest waiting here looked nothing like the usual bookish flannelclad doctors who entered this building those of anthropology oceanography geology and other scientific fields quite to the contrary dr abaddon looked almost aristocratic in his impeccably tailored suit he was tall with a broad torso welltanned face and perfectly combed blond hair that gave trish the impression he was more accustomed to luxuries than to laboratories dr abaddon i presume trish said extending her hand the man looked uncertain but he took trishs plump hand in his broad palm im sorry and you are trish dunne she replied im katherines assistant she asked me to escort you back to her lab oh i see the man smiled now very nice to meet you trish my apologies if i seemed confused i was under the impression katherine was here alone this evening he motioned down the hall but im all yours lead the way despite the mans quick recovery trish had seen the flash of disappointment in his eyes she now suspected the motive for katherines secrecy earlier about dr abaddon a budding romance maybe katherine never discussed her social life but her visitor was attractive and wellgroomed and although younger than katherine he clearly came from her world of wealth and privilege nonetheless whatever dr abaddon had imagined tonights visit might entail trishs presence did not seem to be part of his plan at the lobbys security checkpoint a lone guard quickly pulled off his headphones and trish could hear the redskins game blaring the guard put dr abaddon through the usual visitor routine of metal detectors and temporary security badges whos winning dr abaddon said affably as he emptied his pockets of a cell phone some keys and a cigarette lighter skins by three the guard said sounding eager to get back helluva game mr solomon will be arriving shortly trish told the guard would you please send him back to the lab once he arrives will do the guard gave an appreciative wink as they passed through thanks for the headsup ill look busy trishs comment had been not only for the benefit of the guard but also to remind dr abaddon that trish was not the only one intruding on his private evening here with katherine so how do you know katherine trish asked glancing up at the mysterious guest dr abaddon chuckled oh its a long story weve been working on something together understood trish thought none of my business this is an amazing facility abaddon said glancing around as they moved down the massive corridor ive never actually been here his airy tone was becoming more genial with every step and trish noticed he was actively taking it all in in the bright lights of the hallway she also noticed that his face looked like he had a fake tan odd nonetheless as they navigated the deserted corridors trish gave him a general synopsis of the smscs purpose and function including the various pods and their contents the visitor looked impressed sounds like this place has a treasure trove of priceless artifacts i would have expected guards posted everywhere no need trish said motioning to the row of fisheye lenses lining the ceiling high above security here is automated every inch of this corridor is recorded twentyfourseven and this corridor is the spine of the facility its impossible to access any of the rooms off this corridor without a key card and pin number efficient use of cameras knock on wood weve never had a theft then again this is not the kind of museum anyone would rob theres not much call on the black market for extinct flowers inuit kayaks or giant squid carcasses dr abaddon chuckled i suppose youre right our biggest security threat is rodents and insects trish explained how the building prevented insect infestations by freezing all smsc refuse and also by an architectural feature called a dead zonean inhospitable compartment between double walls which surrounded the entire building like a sheath incredible abaddon said so where is katherine and peters lab pod five trish said its all the way at the end of this hallway abaddon halted suddenly spinning to his right toward a small window my word will you look at that trish laughed yeah thats pod three they call it wet pod wet abaddon said face pressed to the glass there are over three thousand gallons of liquid ethanol in there remember the giant squid carcass i mentioned earlier thats the squid dr abaddon turned from the window momentarily his eyes wide its huge a female architeuthis trish said shes over forty feet dr abaddon apparently enraptured by the sight of the squid seemed unable to pull his eyes away from the glass for a moment the grown man reminded trish of a little boy at a petstore window wishing he could go in and see a puppy five seconds later he was still staring longingly through the window okay okay trish finally said laughing as she inserted her key card and typed her pin number come on ill show you the squid as malakh stepped into the dimly lit world of pod he scanned the walls for security cameras katherines pudgy little assistant began rattling on about the specimens in this room malakh tuned her out he had no interest whatsoever in giant squids his only interest was in using this dark private space to solve an unexpected problem chapter the wooden stairs descending to the capitols subbasement were as steep and shallow as any stairs langdon had ever traversed his breathing was faster now and his lungs felt tight the air down here was cold and damp and langdon couldnt help but flash on a similar set of stairs he had taken a few years back into the vaticans necropolis the city of the dead ahead of him anderson led the way with his flashlight behind langdon sato followed closely her tiny hands occasionally pressing into langdons back im going as fast as i can langdon inhaled deeply trying to ignore the cramped walls on either side of him there was barely room for his shoulders on this staircase and his daybag now scraped down the sidewall maybe you should leave your bag above sato offered behind him im fine langdon replied having no intention of letting it out of his sight he pictured peters little package and could not begin to imagine how it might relate to anything in the subbasement of the us capitol just a few more steps anderson said almost there the group had descended into darkness moving beyond the reach of the staircases lone lightbulb when langdon stepped off the final wooden tread he could feel that the floor beneath his feet was dirt journey to the center of the earth sato stepped down behind him anderson now raised his beam examining their surroundings the subbasement was less of a basement than it was an ultranarrow corridor that ran perpendicular to the stairs anderson shone his light left and then right and langdon could see the passage was only about fifty feet long and lined on both sides with small wooden doors the doors abutted one another so closely that the rooms behind them could not have been more than ten feet wide acme storage meets the catacombs of domatilla langdon thought as anderson consulted the blueprint the tiny section depicting the subbasement was marked with an x to show the location of sbb langdon couldnt help but notice that the layout was identical to a fourteentomb mausoleum seven vaults facing seven vaults with one removed to accommodate the stairs they had just descended thirteen in all he suspected americas thirteen conspiracy theorists would have a field day if they knew there were exactly thirteen storage rooms buried beneath the us capitol some found it suspicious that the great seal of the united states had thirteen stars thirteen arrows thirteen pyramid steps thirteen shield stripes thirteen olive leaves thirteen olives thirteen letters in annuit coeptis thirteen letters in e pluribus unum and on and on it does look abandoned anderson said shining the beam into the chamber directly in front of them the heavy wooden door was wide open the shaft of light illuminated a narrow stone chamber about ten feet wide by some thirty feet deep like a deadend hallway to nowhere the chamber contained nothing more than a couple of old collapsed wooden boxes and some crumpled packing paper anderson shone his light on a copper plate mounted on the door the plate was covered with verdigris but the old marking was legible sbb iv sbb four anderson said which one is sbb thirteen sato asked faint wisps of steam curling out of her mouth in the cold subterranean air anderson turned the beam toward the south end of the corridor down there langdon peered down the narrow passage and shivered feeling a light sweat despite the cold as they moved through the phalanx of doorways all of the rooms looked the same doors ajar apparently abandoned long ago when they reached the end of the line anderson turned to his right raising the beam to peer into room sbb the flashlight beam however was impeded by a heavy wooden door unlike the others the door to sbb was closed this final door looked exactly like the others heavy hinges iron handle and a copper number plate encrusted with green the seven characters on the number plate were the same characters on peters palm upstairs sbb xiii please tell me the door is locked langdon thought sato spoke without hesitation try the door the police chief looked uneasy but he reached out grasped the heavy iron handle and pushed down on it the handle didnt budge he shone the light now illuminating a heavy oldfashioned lock plate and keyhole try the master key sato said anderson produced the main key from the entry door upstairs but it was not even close to fitting am i mistaken sato said her tone sarcastic or shouldnt security have access to every corner of a building in case of emergency anderson exhaled and looked back at sato maam my men are checking for a secondary key but shoot the lock she said nodding toward the key plate beneath the lever langdons pulse leaped anderson cleared his throat sounding uneasy maam im waiting for news on a secondary key i am not sure im comfortable blasting our way into perhaps youd be more comfortable in prison for obstructing a cia investigation anderson looked incredulous after a long beat he reluctantly handed the light to sato and unsnapped his holster wait langdon said no longer able to stand idly by think about it peter gave up his right hand rather than reveal whatever might be behind this door are you sure we want to do this unlocking this door is essentially complying with the demands of a terrorist do you want to get peter solomon back sato asked of course but then i suggest you do exactly what his captor is requesting unlock an ancient portal you think this is the portal sato shone the light in langdons face professor i have no idea what the hell this is whether its a storage unit or the secret entrance to an ancient pyramid i intend to open it do i make myself clear langdon squinted into the light and finally nodded sato lowered the beam and redirected it at the doors antique key plate chief go ahead still looking averse to the plan anderson extracted his sidearm very very slowly gazing down at it with uncertainty oh for gods sake satos tiny hands shot out and she grabbed the weapon from him she stuffed the flashlight into his now empty palm shine the damned light she handled the gun with the confidence of someone who had trained with weapons wasting no time turning off the pistols safety cocking the weapon and aiming at the lock wait langdon yelled but he was too late the gun roared three times langdons eardrums felt like they had exploded is she insane the gunshots in the tiny space had been deafening anderson also looked shaken his hand wavering a bit as he shone the flashlight on the bulletriddled door the lock mechanism was now in tatters the wood surrounding it entirely pulverized the lock had released the door now having fallen ajar sato extended the pistol and pressed the tip of the barrel against the door giving it a push the door swung fully into the blackness beyond langdon peered in but could see nothing in the darkness what in the world is that smell an unusual fetid odor wafted out of the darkness anderson stepped into the doorway and shone the light on the floor tracing carefully down the length of the barren dirt floor this room was like the others a long narrow space the sidewalls were rugged stone giving the room the feel of an ancient prison cell but that smell theres nothing here anderson said moving the beam farther down the chamber floor finally as the beam reached the end of the floor he raised it up to illuminate the chambers farthest wall my god anderson shouted everyone saw it and jumped back langdon stared in disbelief at the deepest recess of the chamber to his horror something was staring back chapter what in gods name at the threshold of sbb anderson fumbled with his light and retreated a step langdon also recoiled as did sato who looked startled for the first time all night sato aimed the gun at the back wall and motioned for anderson to shine the light again anderson raised the light the beam was dim by the time it reached the far wall but the light was enough to illuminate the shape of a pallid and ghostly face staring back at them through lifeless sockets a human skull the skull sat atop a rickety wooden desk positioned against the rear wall of the chamber two human leg bones sat beside the skull along with a collection of other items that were meticulously arranged on the desk in shrinelike fashion an antique hourglass a crystal flask a candle two saucers of pale powder and a sheet of paper propped against the wall beside the desk stood the fearsome shape of a long scythe its curved blade as familiar as that of the grim reaper sato stepped into the room well now it appears peter solomon keeps more secrets than i imagined anderson nodded inching after her talk about skeletons in your closet he raised the light and surveyed the rest of the empty chamber and that smell he added crinkling his nose what is it sulfur langdon replied evenly behind them there should be two saucers on the desk the saucer on the right will contain salt and the other sulfur sato wheeled in disbelief how the hell would you know that because maam there are rooms exactly like this all over the world one story above the subbasement capitol security guard nuсez escorted the architect of the capitol warren bellamy down the long hallway that ran the length of the eastern basement nuсez could have sworn that he had just heard three gunshots down here muffled and underground theres no way subbasement door is open bellamy said squinting down the hallway at a door that stood ajar in the distance strange evening indeed nuсez thought nobody goes down there ill be glad to find out whats going on he said reaching for his radio go back to your duties bellamy said im fine from here nuсez shifted uneasily you sure warren bellamy stopped placing a firm hand on nuсezs shoulder son ive worked here for twentyfive years i think i can find my way chapter malakh had seen some eerie spaces in his life but few rivaled the unearthly world of pod wet pod the massive room looked as if a mad scientist had taken over a walmart and packed every aisle and shelf with specimen jars of all shapes and sizes lit like a photographic darkroom the space was bathed in a reddish haze of safelight that emanated from beneath the shelves filtering upward and illuminating the ethanolfilled containers the clinical smell of preservative chemicals was nauseating this pod houses over twenty thousand species the chubby girl was saying fish rodents mammals reptiles all dead i hope malakh asked making a show of sounding nervous the girl laughed yes yes all very much dead ill admit i didnt dare come in for at least six months after i started work malakh could understand why everywhere he looked there were specimen jars of dead lifeforms salamanders jellyfish rats bugs birds and other things he could not begin to identify as if this collection were not unsettling enough on its own the hazy red safelights that protected these photosensitive specimens from longterm light exposure gave the visitor the feeling he was standing inside a giant aquarium where lifeless creatures were somehow congregating to watch from the shadows thats a coelacanth the girl said pointing to a big plexiglas container that held the ugliest fish malakh had ever seen they were thought to be extinct with the dinosaurs but this was caught off africa a few years back and donated to the smithsonian lucky you malakh thought barely listening he was busy scanning the walls for security cameras he saw only one trained on the entry door not surprising considering that entrance was probably the only way in and here is what you wanted to see she said leading him to the giant tank he had seen from the window our longest specimen she swept her arm out over the vile creature like a gameshow host displaying a new car architeuthis the squid tank looked like a series of glass phone booths had been laid on their sides and fused end to end within the long clear plexiglas coffin hovered a sickeningly pale and amorphous shape malakh gazed down at the bulbous saclike head and its basketballsize eyes almost makes your coelacanth look handsome he said wait till you see her lit trish flipped back the long lid of the tank ethanol fumes wafted out as she reached down into the tank and flipped a switch just above the liquid line a string of fluorescent lights flickered to life along the entire base of the tank architeuthis was now shining in all her glory a colossal head attached to a slithery mass of decaying tentacles and razorsharp suckers she began talking about how architeuthis could beat a sperm whale in a fight malakh heard only empty prattling the time had come trish dunne always felt a bit uneasy in pod but the chill that had just run through her felt different visceral primal she tried to ignore it but it grew quickly now clawing deeply at her although trish could not seem to place the source of her anxiety her gut was clearly telling her it was time to leave anyhow thats the squid she said reaching into the tank and turning off the display light we should probably get back to katherines a broad palm clamped hard over her mouth yanking her head back instantly a powerful arm was wrapped around her torso pinning her against a rockhard chest for a split second trish went numb with shock then came the terror the man groped across her chest grabbing her key card and yanking down hard the cord burned the back of her neck before snapping the key card fell on the floor at their feet she fought trying to twist away but she was no match for the mans size and strength she tried to scream but his hand remained tightly across her mouth he leaned down and placed his mouth next to her ear whispering when i take my hand off your mouth you will not scream is that clear she nodded vigorously her lungs burning for air i cant breathe the man removed his hand from her mouth and trish gasped inhaling deeply let me go she demanded breathless what the hell are you doing tell me your pin number the man said trish felt totally at a loss katherine help who is this man security can see you she said knowing full well they were out of range of the cameras and nobody is watching anyway your pin number the man repeated the one that matches your key card an icy fear churned in her gut and trish spun violently wriggling an arm free and twisting around clawing at the mans eyes her fingers hit flesh and raked down one cheek four dark gashes opened on his flesh where she scratched him then she realized the dark stripes on his flesh were not blood the man was wearing makeup which she had just scratched off revealing dark tattoos hidden underneath who is this monster with seemingly superhuman strength the man spun her around and hoisted her up pushing her out over the open squid tank her face now over the ethanol the fumes burned her nostrils what is your pin number he repeated her eyes burned and she could see the pale flesh of the squid submerged beneath her face tell me he said pushing her face closer to the surface what is it her throat was burning now zeroeightzerofour she blurted barely able to breathe let me go zeroeightzerofour if youre lying he said pushing down farther her hair in the ethanol now im not lying she said coughing august its my birthday thank you trish his powerful hands clasped her head tighter and a crushing force rammed her downward plunging her face into the tank searing pain burned her eyes the man pressed down harder driving her whole head under the ethanol trish felt her face pressing into the fleshy head of the squid summoning all of her strength she bucked violently arching backward trying to pull her head out of the tank but the powerful hands did not budge i have to breathe she remained submerged straining not to open her eyes or mouth her lungs burned as she fought the powerful urge to breathe in no dont but trishs inhalation reflex finally took over her mouth flew open and her lungs expanded violently attempting to suck in the oxygen that her body craved in a searing rush a wave of ethanol poured into her mouth as the chemicals gushed down her throat into her lungs trish felt a pain like nothing she had ever imagined possible mercifully it lasted only a few seconds before her world went black malakh stood beside the tank catching his breath and surveying the damage the lifeless woman lay slumped over the rim of the tank her face still submerged in ethanol seeing her there malakh flashed on the only other woman he had ever killed isabel solomon long ago another life malakh gazed down now at the womans flaccid corpse he grabbed her ample hips and lifted with his legs hoisting her up pushing forward until she began to slide over the rim of the squid tank trish dunne slithered headfirst down into the ethanol the rest of her body followed sloshing down gradually the ripples subsided leaving the woman hovering limp over the huge sea creature as her clothing got heavier she began to sink slipping into the darkness bit by bit trish dunnes body settled on top of the great beast malakh wiped his hands and replaced the plexiglas lid sealing the tank wet pod has a new specimen he retrieved trishs key card from the floor and slipped it in his pocket when malakh had first seen trish in the lobby hed seen a liability then hed realized her key card and password were his insurance if katherines datastorage room was as secure as peter had implied then malakh was anticipating some challenges persuading katherine to unlock it for him i now have my own set of keys he was pleased to know he would no longer have to waste time bending katherine to his will as malakh stood up straight he saw his own reflection in the window and could tell his makeup was badly mangled it didnt matter anymore by the time katherine put it all together it would be too late chapter this room is masonic sato demanded turning from the skull and staring at langdon in the darkness langdon nodded calmly its called a chamber of reflection these rooms are designed as cold austere places in which a mason can reflect on his own mortality by meditating on the inevitability of death a mason gains a valuable perspective on the fleeting nature of life sato looked around the eerie space apparently not convinced this is some kind of meditation room essentially yes these chambers always incorporate the same symbols skull and crossed bones scythe hourglass sulfur salt blank paper a candle et cetera the symbols of death inspire masons to ponder how better to lead their lives while on this earth it looks like a death shrine anderson said thats kind of the point most of my symbology students have the same reaction at first langdon often assigned them symbols of freemasonry by beresniak which contained beautiful photos of chambers of reflection and your students sato demanded dont find it unnerving that masons meditate with skulls and scythes no more unnerving than christians praying at the feet of a man nailed to a cross or hindus chanting in front of a fourarmed elephant named ganesh misunderstanding a cultures symbols is a common root of prejudice sato turned away apparently in no mood for a lecture she moved toward the table of artifacts anderson tried to light her way with the flashlight but the beam was beginning to dim he tapped the heel of the light and coaxed it to burn a little brighter as the threesome moved deeper into the narrow space the pungent tang of sulfur filled langdons nostrils the subbasement was damp and the humidity in the air was activating the sulfur in the bowl sato arrived at the table and stared down at the skull and accompanying objects anderson joined her doing his best to light the desk with the weakening beam of his flashlight sato examined everything on the table and then placed her hands on her hips sighing what is all this junk the artifacts in this room langdon knew were carefully selected and arranged symbols of transformation he told her feeling confined as he inched forward and joined them at the table the skull or caput mortuum represents mans final transformation through decay its a reminder that we all shed our mortal flesh one day the sulfur and salt are alchemical catalysts that facilitate transformation the hourglass represents the transformational power of time he motioned to the unlit candle and this candle represents the formative primordial fire and the awakening of man from his ignorant slumber transformation through illumination and that sato asked pointing into the corner anderson swung his dimming flashlight beam to the giant scythe that leaned against the back wall not a death symbol as most assume langdon said the scythe is actually a symbol of the transformative nourishment of nature the reaping of natures gifts sato and anderson fell silent apparently trying to process their bizarre surroundings langdon wanted nothing more than to get out of the place i realize this room may seem unusual he told them but theres nothing to see here its really quite normal a lot of masonic lodges have chambers exactly like this one but this is not a masonic lodgeanderson declared its the us capitol and id like to know what the hell this room is doing in my building sometimes masons set aside rooms like this in their offices or private homes as meditation spaces it is not uncommon langdon knew a heart surgeon in boston who had converted a closet in his office into a masonic chamber of reflection so he could ponder mortality before going into surgery sato looked troubled youre saying peter solomon comes down here to reflect on death i really dont know langdon said sincerely maybe he created it as a sanctuary for his masonic brothers who work in the building giving them a spiritual sanctuary away from the chaos of the material world a place for a powerful lawmaker to reflect before making decisions that affect his fellow man lovely sentiment sato said her tone sarcastic but i have a feeling americans might have a problem with their leaders praying in closets with scythes and skulls well they shouldnt langdon thought imagining how different a world it might be if more leaders took time to ponder the finality of death before racing off to war sato pursed her lips and carefully surveyed all four corners of the candle lit chamber there must be something in here besides human bones and bowls of chemicals professor someone transported you all the way from your home in cambridge to be in this precise room langdon clutched his daybag to his side still unable to imagine how the package he carried might relate to this chamber maam im sorry but i dont see anything out of the ordinary here langdon hoped that now at last they could get to the business of trying to find peter andersons light flickered again and sato spun on him her temper starting to show for christs sake is it too much to ask she plunged her hand into her pocket and yanked out a cigarette lighter striking her thumb on the flint she held out the flame and lit the desks lone candle the wick sputtered and then caught spreading a ghostly luminescence throughout the constricted space long shadows raked the stone walls as the flame grew brighter an unexpected sight materialized before them look anderson said pointing in the candlelight they could now see a faded patch of graffiti seven capital letters scrawled across the rear wall vitriol an odd choice of word sato said as the candlelight cast a frightening skullshaped silhouette across the letters actually its an acronym langdon said its written on the rear wall of most chambers like this as a shorthand for the masonic meditative mantra visita interiora terrae rectificando invenies occultum lapidem sato eyed him looking almost impressed meaning visit the interior of the earth and by rectifying you will find the hidden stone satos gaze sharpened does the hidden stone have any connection to a hidden pyramid langdon shrugged not wanting to encourage the comparison those who enjoy fantasizing about hidden pyramids in washington would tell you that occultum lapidem refers to the stone pyramid yes others will tell you its a reference to the philosophers stone a substance alchemists believed could bring them everlasting life or turn lead into gold others claim its a reference to the holy of holies a hidden stone chamber at the core of the great temple some say its a christian reference to the hidden teachings of saint peter the rock every esoteric tradition interprets the stone in its own way but invariably the occultum lapidem is a source of power and enlightenment anderson cleared his throat is it possible solomon lied to this guy maybe he told him there was something down here and there really isnt langdon was having similar thoughts without warning the candle flame flickered as if caught by a draft it dimmed for a moment and then recovered burning brightly again thats odd anderson said i hope no one closed the door upstairs he strode out of the chamber into the darkness of the hallway hello langdon barely noticed him leave his gaze had been drawn suddenly to the rear wall what just happened did you see that sato asked also staring with alarm at the wall langdon nodded his pulse quickening what did i just see a moment earlier the rear wall seemed to have shimmered as if a ripple of energy had passed through it anderson now strode back into the room no ones out there as he entered the wall shimmered again holy shit he exclaimed jumping back all three stood mute for a long moment staring in unison at the back wall langdon felt another chill run through him as he realized what they were seeing he reached out tentatively until his fingertips touched the rear surface of the chamber its not a wall he said anderson and sato stepped closer peering intently its a canvas langdon said but it billowed sato said quickly yes in a very strange way langdon examined the surface more closely the sheen on the canvas had refracted the candlelight in a startling manner because the canvas had just billowed away from the room fluttering backward through the plane of the rear wall langdon extended his outstretched fingers very gently pressing the canvas backward startled he yanked his hand back theres an opening pull it aside sato ordered langdons heart pounded wildly now he reached up and clutched the edge of the canvas banner slowly pulling the fabric to one side he stared in disbelief at what lay hidden behind it my god sato and anderson stood in stunned silence as they looked through the opening in the rear wall finally sato spoke it appears weve just found our pyramid chapter robert langdon stared at the opening in the rear wall of the chamber hidden behind the canvas banner a perfectly square hole had been hollowed out of the wall the opening about three feet across appeared to have been created by removing a series of bricks for a moment in the darkness langdon thought the hole was a window to a room beyond now he saw it was not the opening extended only a few feet into the wall before terminating like a roughhewn cubbyhole the recessed niche reminded langdon of a museum alcove designed to hold a statuette fittingly this niche displayed one small object about nine inches tall it was a piece of carved solid granite the surface was elegant and smooth with four polished sides that shone in the candlelight langdon could not fathom what it was doing here a stone pyramid from your look of surprise sato said sounding selfsatisfied i take it this object is not typical within a chamber of reflection langdon shook his head then perhaps you would like to reassess your previous claims regarding the legend of a masonic pyramid hidden in washington her tone now was almost smug director langdon replied instantly this little pyramid is not the masonic pyramid so it is merely coincidence that we found a pyramid hidden at the heart of the us capitol in a secret chamber belonging to a masonic leader langdon rubbed his eyes and tried to think clearly maam this pyramid doesnt resemble the myth in any way the masonic pyramid is described as enormous with a tip forged of solid gold moreover langdon knew this little pyramid with its flat top was not even a true pyramid without its tip this was another symbol entirely known as an unfinished pyramid it was a symbolic reminder that mans ascent to his full human potential was always a work in progress though few realized it this symbol was the most widely published symbol on earth over twenty billion in print adorning every onedollar bill in circulation the unfinished pyramid waited patiently for its shining capstone which hovered above it as a reminder of americas yetunfulfilled destiny and the work yet to be done both as a country and as individuals lift it down sato said to anderson motioning to the pyramid i want a closer look she began making room on the desk by shoving the skull and crossed bones to one side with no reverence whatsoever langdon was starting to feel like they were common grave robbers desecrating a personal shrine anderson maneuvered past langdon reached into the niche and clamped his large palms on either side of the pyramid then barely able to lift at this awkward angle he slid the pyramid toward him and lowered it with a hard thud onto the wooden desk he stepped back to give sato room the director repositioned the candle close to the pyramid and studied its polished surface slowly she ran her tiny fingers over it examining every inch of the flat top and then the sides she wrapped her hands around to feel the back then frowned in apparent disappointment professor earlier you said the masonic pyramid was constructed to protect secret information thats the legend yes so hypothetically speaking if peters captor believed this was the masonic pyramid he would believe it contained powerful information langdon nodded exasperated yes although even if he found this information he probably would not be able to read it according to legend the contents of the pyramid are encoded making them indecipherable except to the most worthy i beg your pardon despite langdons growing impatience he replied with an even tone mythological treasures are always protected by tests of worthiness as you may recall in the legend of the sword in the stone the stone refuses to give up the sword except to arthur who was spiritually prepared to wield the swords awesome power the masonic pyramid is based on the same idea in this case the information is the treasure and it is said to be written in an encoded language a mystical tongue of lost words legible only to the worthy a faint smile crossed satos lips that may explain why you were summoned here tonight im sorry calmly sato rotated the pyramid in place turning it a full degrees the pyramids fourth side now shone in the candlelight robert langdon stared at it with surprise it appears sato said that someone believes youre worthy chapter whats takingtrish so long katherine solomon checked her watch again shed forgotten to warn dr abaddon about the bizarre commute to her lab but she couldnt imagine the darkness had slowed them down this much they should have arrived by now katherine walked over to the exit and heaved open the leadlined door staring out into the void she listened for a moment but heard nothing trish she called out her voice swallowed by the darkness silence puzzled she closed the door took out her cell phone and called the lobby this is katherine is trish out there no maam the lobby guard said she and your guest headed back about ten minutes ago really i dont think theyre even inside pod five yet hold on ill check katherine could hear the guards fingers clicking on his computer keyboard youre right according to ms dunnes keycard logs she has not yet opened the pod five door her last access event was about eight minutes ago at pod three i guess shes giving your guest a little tour on his way in katherine frowned apparently the news was a bit odd but at least she knew trish wouldnt be long in pod the smell in there is terrible thanks has my brother arrived yet no maam not yet thank you as katherine hung up she felt an unexpected twinge of trepidation the uneasy feeling made her pause but only for a moment it was the same exact disquiet shed felt earlier when she stepped into dr abaddons house embarrassingly her feminine intuition had failed her there badly its nothing katherine told herself chapter robert langdon studied the stone pyramid this isnt possible an ancient encoded language sato said without looking up tell me does this qualify on the newly exposed face of the pyramid a series of sixteen characters was precisely engraved into the smooth stone beside langdon andersons mouth now gaped open mirroring langdons own shock the security chief looked like he had just seen some kind of alien keypad professor sato said i assume you can read this langdon turned why would you assume that because you were brought here professor you were chosen this inscription appears to be a code of some sort and considering your reputation it seems obvious to me that you were brought here to decipher it langdon had to admit that after his experiences in rome and paris hed received a steady flow of requests asking for his help deciphering some of historys great unsolved codes the phaistos disk the dorabella cipher the mysterious voynich manuscript sato ran her finger over the inscription can you tell me the meaning of these icons theyre not icons langdon thought theyre symbols the language was one he had recognized immediately an encrypted cipher language from the seventeenth century langdon knew very well how to break it maam he said feeling hesitant this pyramid is peters private property private or not if this code is indeed the reason you were brought to washington i am not giving you a choice in the matter i want to know what it says satos blackberry pinged loudly and she yanked the device from her pocket studying the incoming message for several moments langdon was amazed that the capitol buildings internal wireless network provided service this far down sato grunted and raised her eyebrows giving langdon an odd look chief anderson she said turning to him a word in private if i may the director motioned for anderson to join her and they disappeared into the pitchblack hallway leaving langdon alone in the flickering candlelight of peters chamber of reflection chief anderson wondered when this night would end a severed hand in my rotunda a death shrine in my basement bizarre engravings on a stone pyramid somehow the redskins game no longer felt significant as he followed sato into the darkness of the hall anderson flicked on his flashlight the beam was weak but better than nothing sato led him down the hall a few yards out of sight of langdon have a look at this she whispered handing anderson her blackberry anderson took the device and squinted at the illuminated screen it displayed a blackandwhite image the xray of langdons bag that anderson had requested be sent to sato as in all xrays the objects of greatest density appeared in the brightest white in langdons bag a lone item outshone everything else obviously extremely dense the object glowed like a dazzling jewel in a murky jumble of other items its shape was unmistakable hes been carrying that all night anderson looked over at sato in surprise why didnt langdon mention this damned good question sato whispered the shape it cant be coincidence no sato said her tone angry now i would say not a faint rustle in the corridor drew andersons attention startled he pointed his flashlight down the black passageway the dying beam revealed only a deserted corridor lined with open doors hello anderson said is somebody there silence sato gave him an odd look apparently having heard nothing anderson listened a moment longer and then shook it off ive got to get out of here alone in the candlelit chamber langdon ran his fingers over the sharply carved edges of the pyramids engraving he was curious to know what the message said and yet he was not about to intrude on peter solomons privacy any more than they already had and why would this lunatic care about this small pyramid anyway we have a problem professor satos voice declared loudly behind him ive just received a new piece of information and ive had enough of your lies langdon turned to see the os director marching in blackberry in hand and fire in her eyes taken aback langdon looked to anderson for help but the chief was now standing guard at the door his expression unsympathetic sato arrived in front of langdon and thrust her blackberry in his face bewildered langdon looked at the screen which displayed an inverted blackandwhite photograph like a ghostly film negative the photo looked like a jumble of objects and one of them shone very brightly though askew and off center the brightest object was clearly a little pointed pyramid a tiny pyramid langdon looked at sato what is this the question seemed only to incense sato further youre pretending you dont know langdons temper flared im not pretending anything ive never seen this before in my life bullshit sato snapped her voice cutting through the musty air youve been carrying it in your bag all night i langdon stalled midsentence his eyes moved slowly down to the daybag on his shoulder then he raised them again to the blackberry my god the package he looked more closely at the image now he saw it a ghostly cube enclosing the pyramid stunned langdon realized he was looking at an xray of his bag and also of peters mysterious cubeshaped package the cube was in fact a hollow box a small pyramid langdon opened his mouth to speak but his words failed him he felt the breath go out of his lungs as a new revelation struck him simple pure devastating my god he looked back at the truncated stone pyramid on the desk its apex was flat a small square area a blank space symbolically awaiting its final piece that piece which would transform it from an unfinished pyramid into a true pyramid langdon now realized the tiny pyramid he was carrying was not a pyramid at all its a capstone at that instant he knew why he alone could unlock the mysteries of this pyramid i hold the final piece and it is indeed a talisman when peter had told langdon the package contained a talisman langdon had laughed now he realized his friend was right this tiny capstone was a talisman but not the magic kind the far older kind long before talisman had magical connotations it had another meaning completion from the greek telesma meaning complete a talisman was any object or idea that completed another and made it whole the finishing element a capstone symbolically speaking was the ultimate talisman transforming the unfinished pyramid into a symbol of completed perfection langdon now felt an eerie convergence that forced him to accept one very strange truth with the exception of its size the stone pyramid in peters chamber of reflection seemed to be transforming itself bit by bit into something vaguely resembling the masonic pyramid of legend from the brightness with which the capstone shone on the xray langdon suspected it was made of metal a very dense metal whether or not it was solid gold he had no way of knowing and he was not about to let his mind start playing tricks on him this pyramid is too small the codes too easy to read and its a myth for heavens sake sato was watching him for a bright man professor youve made some dumb choices tonight lying to an intelligence director intentionally obstructing a cia investigation i can explain if youll let me you will be explaining at cia headquarters as of this moment i am detaining you langdons body went rigid you cant possibly be serious deadly serious i made it very clear to you that the stakes tonight were high and you chose not to cooperate i strongly suggest you start thinking about explaining the inscription on this pyramid because when we arrive at the cia she raised her blackberry and took a closeup snapshot of the engraving on the stone pyramid my analysts will have had a head start langdon opened his mouth to protest but sato was already turning to anderson at the door chief she said put the stone pyramid in langdons bag and carry it ill handle taking mr langdon into custody your weapon if i may anderson was stonefaced as he advanced into the chamber unsnapping his shoulder holster as he came he gave his gun to sato who immediately aimed it at langdon langdon watched as if in a dream this cannot be happening anderson now came to langdon and removed the daybag from his shoulder carrying it over to the desk and setting it on the chair he unzipped the bag propped it open and then hoisted the heavy stone pyramid off the desk and into the bag along with langdons notes and the tiny package suddenly there was a rustle of movement in the hallway a dark outline of a man materialized in the doorway rushing into the chamber and approaching fast behind anderson the chief never saw him coming in an instant the stranger had lowered his shoulder and crashed into andersons back the chief launched forward his head cracking into the edge of the stone niche he fell hard crumpling on the desk sending bones and artifacts flying the hourglass shattered on the floor the candle toppled to the floor still burning sato reeled amid the chaos raising the gun but the intruder grabbed a femur and lashed out with it striking her shoulder with the leg bone sato let out a cry of pain and fell back dropping the weapon the newcomer kicked the gun away and then wheeled toward langdon the man was tall and slender an elegant african american whom langdon had never seen before in his life grab the pyramid the man commanded follow me chapter the african american man leading langdon through the capitols subterranean maze was clearly someone of power beyond knowing his way through all the side corridors and back rooms the elegant stranger carried a key ring that seemed to unlock every door that blocked their way langdon followed quickly running up an unfamiliar staircase as they climbed he felt the leather strap of his daybag cutting hard into his shoulder the stone pyramid was so heavy that langdon feared the bags strap might break the past few minutes defied all logic and now langdon found himself moving on instinct alone his gut told him to trust this stranger beyond saving langdon from satos arrest the man had taken dangerous action to protect peter solomons mysterious pyramid whatever the pyramid may be while his motivation remained a mystery langdon had glimpsed a telltale shimmer of gold on the mans hand a masonic ring the doubleheaded phoenix and the number this man and peter solomon were more than trusted friends they were masonic brothers of the highest degree langdon followed him to the top of the stairs into another corridor and then through an unmarked door into a utilitarian hallway they ran past supply boxes and bags of garbage veering off suddenly through a service door that deposited them in an utterly unexpected world a plush movie theater of some sort the older man led the way up the side aisle and out the main doors into the light of a large atrium langdon now realized they were in the visitor center through which he had entered earlier tonight unfortunately so was a capitol police officer as they came facetoface with the officer all three men stopped staring at one another langdon recognized the young hispanic officer from the xray machine earlier tonight officer nuсez the african american man said not a word follow me the guard looked uneasy but obeyed without question who is this guy the three of them hurried toward the southeast corner of the visitor center where they arrived at a small foyer and a set of heavy doors blocked with orange pylons the doors were sealed with masking tape apparently to keep the dust of whatever was happening beyond out of the visitor center the man reached up and peeled off the tape on the door then he flipped through his key ring as he spoke to the guard our friend chief anderson is in the subbasement he may be injured youll want to check on him yes sir nuсez looked as baffled as he did alarmed most important you did not see us the man found a key took it off the key ring and used it to turn the heavy dead bolt he pulled open the steel door and tossed the key to the guard lock this door behind us put the tape back on as best as you can pocket the key and say nothing to anyone including the chief is that clear officer nuсez the guard eyed the key as if hed just been entrusted with a precious gem it is sir the man hurried through the door and langdon followed the guard locked the heavy bolt behind them and langdon could hear him reapplying the masking tape professor langdon the man said as they strode briskly down a modernlooking corridor that was obviously under construction my name is warren bellamy peter solomon is a dear friend of mine langdon shot a startled glance at the stately man youre warren bellamy langdon had never met the architect of the capitol but he certainly knew the mans name peter speaks very highly of you bellamy said and im sorry we are meeting under these dreadful circumstances peter is in terrible trouble his hand i know bellamy sounded grim thats not the half of it im afraid they reached the end of the lit section of corridor and the passageway took an abrupt left the remaining length of corridor wherever it went was pitchblack hold on bellamy said disappearing into a nearby electrical room from which a tangle of heavyduty orange extension cords snaked out running away from them into the darkness of the corridor langdon waited while bellamy rooted around inside the architect must have located the switch that sent power to the extension cords because suddenly the route before them became illuminated langdon could only stare washington dc like rome was a city laced with secret passageways and underground tunnels the passage before them now reminded langdon of the passetto tunnel connecting the vatican to castel santangelo long dark narrow unlike the ancient passetto however this passage was modern and not yet complete it was a slender construction zone that was so long it seemed to narrow to nothing at its distant end the only lighting was a string of intermittent construction bulbs that did little more than accentuate the tunnels impossible length bellamy was already heading down the passage follow me watch your step langdon felt himself fall into step behind bellamy wondering where on earth this tunnel led at that moment malakh stepped out of pod and strode briskly down the deserted main corridor of the smsc toward pod he clutched trishs key card in his hand and quietly whispered zeroeightzerofour something else was cycling through his mind as well malakh had just received an urgent message from the capitol building my contact has run into unforeseen difficulties even so the news remained encouraging robert langdon now possessed both the pyramid and the capstone despite the unexpected way in which it had happened the crucial pieces were falling into place it was almost as if destiny itself were guiding tonights events ensuring malakhs victory chapter langdon hurried to keep pace with warren bellamys brisk footsteps as they moved without a word down the long tunnel so far the architect of the capitol appeared far more intent on putting distance between sato and this stone pyramid than he did on explaining to langdon what was going on langdon had a growing apprehension that there was far more going on than he could imagine the cia the architect of the capitol two thirtythirddegree masons the shrill sound of langdons cell phone cut the air he pulled his phone from his jacket uncertain he answered hello the voice that spoke was an eerie familiar whisper professor i hear you had unexpected company langdon felt an icy chill where the hell is peter he demanded his words reverberating in the enclosed tunnel beside him warren bellamy glanced over looking concerned and motioning for langdon to keep walking dont worry the voice said as i told you peter is somewhere safe you cut off his hand for gods sake he needs a doctor he needs a priest the man replied but you can save him if you do as i command peter will live i give you my word the word of a madman means nothing to me madman professor surely you appreciate the reverence with which i have adhered to the ancient protocols tonight the hand of the mysteries guided you to a portal the pyramid that promises to unveil ancient wisdom i know you now possess it you think this is the masonic pyramid langdon demanded its a chunk of rock there was silence on the other end of the line mr langdon youre too smart to play dumb you know very well what youve uncovered tonight a stone pyramid hidden at the core of washington dc by a powerful mason youre chasing a myth whatever peter told you he told you in fear the legend of the masonic pyramid is fiction the masons never built any pyramid to protect secret wisdom and even if they did this pyramid is far too small to be what you think it is the man chuckled i see peter has told you very little nonetheless mr langdon whether or not you choose to accept what it is you now possess you will do as i say i am well aware that the pyramid you are carrying has an encrypted engraving you will decipher that engraving for me then and only then will i return peter solomon to you whatever you believe this engraving reveals langdon said it wont be the ancient mysteries of course not he replied the mysteries are far too vast to be written on the side of a little stone pyramid the response caught langdon off guard but if this engraving is not the ancient mysteries then this pyramid is not the masonic pyramid legend clearly states the masonic pyramid was constructed to protect the ancient mysteries the mans tone was condescending now mr langdon the masonic pyramid was constructed to preserve the ancient mysteries but with a twist youve apparently not yet grasped did peter never tell you the power of the masonic pyramid is not that it reveals the mysteries themselves but rather that it reveals the secret location where the mysteries are buried langdon did a double take decipher the engraving the voice continued and it will tell you the hiding place of mankinds greatest treasure he laughed peter did not entrust you with the treasure itself professor langdon came to an abrupt halt in the tunnel hold on youre saying this pyramid is a map bellamy jolted to a stop now too his expression one of shock and alarm clearly the caller had just hit a raw nerve the pyramid is a map this map the voice whispered or pyramid or portal or whatever you choose to call it was created long ago to ensure the hiding place of the ancient mysteries would never be forgotten that it would never be lost to history a grid of sixteen symbols doesnt look much like a map appearances can be deceiving professor but regardless you alone have the power to read that inscription youre wrong langdon fired back picturing the simplistic cipher anyone could decipher this engraving its not very sophisticated i suspect there is more to the pyramid than meets the eye regardless you alone possess the capstone langdon pictured the little capstone in his bag order from chaos he didnt know what to believe anymore but the stone pyramid in his bag seemed to be getting heavier with every passing moment malakh pressed the cell phone to his ear enjoying the sound of langdons anxious breathing on the other end right now i have business to attend to professor and so do you call me as soon as you have deciphered the map we will go together to the hiding place and make our trade peters life for all the wisdom of the ages i will do nothing langdon declared especially not without proof peter is alive i suggest you not test me you are a very small cog in a vast machine if you disobey me or attempt to find me peter will die this i swear for all i know peter is already dead he is very much alive professor but he desperately needs your help what are you really looking for langdon shouted into the phone malakh paused before answering many people have pursued the ancient mysteries and debated their power tonight i will prove the mysteries are real langdon was silent i suggest you get to work on the map immediately malakh said i need this information today today its already after nine oclock exactly tempus fugit chapter new york editor jonas faukman was just turning off the lights in his manhattan office when his phone rang he had no intention of picking up at this hour that is until he glimpsed the callerid display this ought to be good he thought reaching for the receiver do we still publish you faukman asked half serious jonas robert langdons voice sounded anxious thank god youre there i need your help faukmans spirits lifted youve got pages for me to edit robert finally no i need information last year i connected you with a scientist named katherine solomon the sister of peter solomon faukman frowned no pages she was looking for a publisher for a book on noetic science do you remember her faukman rolled his eyes sure i remember and thanks a million for that introduction not only did she refuse to let me read the results of her research she didnt want to publish anything until some magical date in the future jonas listen to me i dont have time i need katherines phone number right now do you have it ive got to warn you youre acting a little desperate shes great looking but youre not going to impress her by this is no joke jonas i need her number now all right hold on faukman and langdon had been close friends for enough years that faukman knew when langdon was serious jonas typed the name katherine solomon into a search window and began scanning the companys email server im looking now faukman said and for what its worth when you call her you may not want to call from the harvard pool it sounds like youre in an asylum im not at the pool im in a tunnel under the us capitol faukman sensed from langdons voice that he was not joking what is it with this guy robert why cant you just stay home and write his computer pinged okay hold on i got it he moused through the old email thread it looks like all i have is her cell ill take it faukman gave him the number thanks jonas langdon said sounding grateful i owe you one you owe me a manuscript robert do you have any idea how long the line went dead faukman stared at the receiver and shook his head book publishing would be so much easier without the authors chapter katherine solomon did a double take when she saw the name on her caller id she had imagined the incoming call was from trish checking in to explain why she and christopher abaddon were taking so long but the caller was not trish far from it katherine felt a blushing smile cross her lips could tonight get any stranger she flipped open her phone dont tell me she said playfully bookish bachelor seeking single noetic scientist katherine the deep voice belonged to robert langdon thank god youre okay of course im okay she replied puzzled other than the fact that you never called me after that party at peters house last summer something has happened tonight please listen his normally smooth voice sounded ragged im so sorry to have to tell you this but peter is in serious trouble katherines smile disappeared what are you talking about peter langdon hesitated as if searching for words i dont know how to say it but hes been taken im not sure how or by whom but taken katherine demanded robert youre scaring me taken where taken captive langdons voice cracked as if he were overwhelmed it must have happened earlier today or maybe yesterday this isnt funny she said angrily my brother is fine i just spoke to him fifteen minutes ago you did langdon sounded stunned yes he just texted me to say he was coming to the lab he texted you langdon thought out loud but you didnt actually hear his voice no but listen to me the text you received was not from your brother someone has peters phone hes dangerous whoever it is tricked me into coming to washington tonight tricked you youre not making any sense i know im so sorry langdon seemed uncharacteristically disorientated katherine i think you could be in danger katherine solomon was sure that langdon would never joke about something like this and yet he sounded like he had lost his mind im fine she said im locked inside a secure building read me the message you got from peters phone please bewildered katherine pulled up the text message and read it to langdon feeling a chill as she came to the final part referencing dr abaddon if available have dr abaddon join us inside i trust him fully oh god langdons voice was laced with fear did you invite this man inside yes my assistant just went out to the lobby to get him i expect them back any katherine get out langdon yelled now at the other side of the smsc inside the security room a phone began ringing drowning out the redskins game the guard reluctantly pulled out his earbuds one more time lobby he answered this is kyle kyle its katherine solomon her voice sounded anxious out of breath maam your brother has not yet wheres trish she demanded can you see her on the monitors the guard rolled his chair over to look at the screens she hasnt gotten back to the cube yet no katherine shouted sounding alarmed the guard now realized that katherine solomon was out of breath as if she were running whats going on back there the guard quickly worked the video joystick skimming through frames of digital video at rapid speed okay hold on scrolling through playback ive got trish with your guest leaving the lobby they move down the street fastforwarding okay theyre going into wet pod trish uses her key card to unlock the door both of them step into wet pod fastforwarding okay here they are coming out of wet pod just a minute ago heading down he cocked his head slowing the playback wait a minute thats odd what the gentleman came out of wet pod alone trish stayed inside yes it looks that way im watching your guest now hes in the hall on his own where is trish katherine asked more frantically i dont see her on the video feed he replied an edge of anxiety creeping into his voice he looked back at the screen and noticed that the mans jacket sleeves appeared to be wet all the way up to his elbows what in the world did he do in wet pod the guard watched as the man began to move purposefully down the main hallway toward pod clutching in his hand what looked like a key card the guard felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end ms solomon weve got a serious problem tonight was a night of firsts for katherine solomon in two years she had never used her cell phone inside the void nor had she ever crossed the void at a dead run at the moment however katherine had a cell phone pressed to her ear while she was dashing blindly along the endless length of carpet each time she felt a foot stray from the carpet she corrected back to center racing on through the sheer darkness where is he now katherine asked the guard breathless checking now the guard replied fastforwarding okay here he is walking down the hall moving toward pod five katherine ran harder hoping to reach the exit before she got trapped back here how long until he gets to the pod five entrance the guard paused maam you dont understand im still fastforwarding this is recorded playback this already happened he paused hold on let me check the entry event monitor he paused and then said maam ms dunnes key card shows a pod five entry event about a minute ago katherine slammed on the brakes sliding to a halt in the middle of the abyss he already unlocked pod five she whispered into the phone the guard was typing frantically yes it looks like he entered ninety seconds ago katherines body went rigid she stopped breathing the darkness felt suddenly alive all around her hes in here with me in an instant katherine realized that the only light in the entire space was coming from her cell phone illuminating the side of her face send help she whispered to the guard and get to wet pod to help trish then she quietly closed her phone extinguishing the light absolute darkness settled around her she stood stockstill and breathed as quietly as possible after a few seconds the pungent scent of ethanol wafted out of the darkness in front of her the smell got stronger she could sense a presence only a few feet in front of her on the carpet in the silence the pounding of katherines heart seemed loud enough to give her away silently she stepped out of her shoes and inched to her left sidestepping off the carpet the cement felt cold under her feet she took one more step to clear the carpet one of her toes cracked it sounded like a gunshot in the stillness only a few yards away a rustle of clothing suddenly came at her out of the darkness katherine bolted an instant too late and a powerful arm snagged her groping in the darkness hands violently attempting to gain purchase she spun away as a viselike grip caught her lab coat yanking her backward reeling her in katherine threw her arms backward slithering out of her lab coat and slipping free suddenly with no idea anymore which way was out katherine solomon found herself dashing dead blind across an endless black abyss chapter despite containing what many have called the most beautiful room in the world the library of congress is known less for its breathtaking splendor than for its vast collections with over five hundred miles of shelves enough to stretch from washington dc to boston it easily claims the title of largest library on earth and yet still it expands at a rate of over ten thousand items per day as an early repository for thomas jeffersons personal collection of books on science and philosophy the library stood as a symbol of americas commitment to the dissemination of knowledge one of the first buildings in washington to have electric lights it literally shone like a beacon in the darkness of the new world as its name implies the library of congress was established to serve congress whose venerated members worked across the street in the capitol building this ageold bond between library and capitol had been fortified recently by the construction of a physical connection a long tunnel beneath independence avenue that linked the two buildings tonight inside this dimly lit tunnel robert langdon followed warren bellamy through a construction zone trying to quell his own deepening concern for katherine this lunatic is at her lab langdon didnt even want to imagine why when he had called to warn her langdon had told katherine exactly where to meet him before they hung up how much longer is this damned tunnel his head ached now a roiling torrent of interconnected thoughts katherine peter the masons bellamy pyramids ancient prophecy and a map langdon shook it all off and pressed on bellamy promised me answers when the two men finally reached the end of the passage bellamy guided langdon through a set of double doors that were still under construction finding no way to lock the unfinished doors behind them bellamy improvised grabbing an aluminum ladder from the construction supplies and leaning it precariously against the outside of the door then he balanced a metal bucket on top if anyone opened the door the bucket would crash loudly to the floor thats our alarm system langdon eyed the perched bucket hoping bellamy had a more comprehensive plan for their safety tonight everything had happened so fast and langdon was only now starting to process the repercussions of his fleeing with bellamy im a fugitive from the cia bellamy led the way around a corner where the two men began ascending a wide staircase that was cordoned off with orange pylons langdons daybag weighed him down as he climbed the stone pyramid he said i still dont understand not here bellamy interrupted well examine it in the light i know a safe place langdon doubted such a place existed for anyone who had just physically assaulted the director of the cias office of security as the two men reached the top of the stairs they entered a wide hallway of italian marble stucco and gold leaf the hall was lined with eight pairs of statues all depicting the goddess minerva bellamy pressed on leading langdon eastward through a vaulted archway into a far grander space even in the dim afterhours lighting the librarys great hall shone with the classical grandeur of an opulent european palace seventyfive feet overhead stainedglass skylights glistened between paneled beams adorned with rare aluminum leafa metal that was considered to be more precious than gold at one time beneath that a stately course of paired pillars lined the secondfloor balcony accessible by two magnificent curling staircases whose newel posts supported giant bronze female figures raising torches of enlightenment in a bizarre attempt to reflect this theme of modern enlightenment and yet stay within the decorative register of renaissance architecture the stairway banisters had been carved with cupidlike putti portrayed as modern scientists an angelic electrician holding a telephone a cherubic entomologist with a specimen box langdon wondered what bernini would have thought well talk over here bellamy said leading langdon past the bulletproof display cases that contained the librarys two most valuable books the giant bible of mainz handwritten in the s and americas copy of the gutenberg bible one of only three perfect vellum copies in the world fittingly the vaulted ceiling overhead bore john white alexanders sixpanel painting titled the evolution of the book bellamy strode directly to a pair of elegant double doors at the center rear of the eastcorridor wall langdon knew what room lay beyond those doors but it seemed a strange choice for a conversation notwithstanding the irony of talking in a space filled with silence please signs this room hardly seemed like a safe place located dead center of the librarys cruciformshaped floor plan this chamber served as the heart of the building hiding in here was like breaking into a cathedral and hiding on the altar nonetheless bellamy unlocked the doors stepped into the darkness beyond and groped for the lights when he flipped the switch one of americas great architectural masterpieces seemed to materialize out of thin air the famous reading room was a feast for the senses a voluminous octagon rose feet at its center its eight sides finished in chocolatebrown tennessee marble creamcolored siena marble and applered algerian marble because it was lit from eight angles no shadows fell anywhere creating the effect that the room itself was glowing some say its the most striking room in washington bellamy said ushering langdon inside maybe in the whole world langdon thought as he stepped across the threshold as always his gaze first ascended straight up to the towering central collar where rays of arabesque coffers curled down the dome to an upper balcony encircling the room sixteen bronze portrait statues peered down from the balustrade beneath them a stunning arcade of archways formed a lower balcony down at floor level three concentric circles of burnished wood desks radiated out from the massive octagonal circulation desk langdon returned his focus to bellamy who was now propping the rooms double doors wide open i thought we were hiding langdon said confused if anyone enters the building bellamy said i want to hear them coming but wont they find us instantly in here no matter where we hide theyll find us but if anyone corners us in this building youll be very glad i chose this room langdon had no idea why but bellamy apparently wasnt looking to discuss it he was already on the move toward the center of the room where he selected one of the available reading desks pulled up two chairs and flipped on the reading light then he motioned to langdons bag okay professor lets have a closer look not wanting to risk scratching its polished surface with a rough piece of granite langdon hoisted his entire bag onto the desk and unzipped it folding the sides all the way down to reveal the pyramid inside warren bellamy adjusted the reading lamp and studied the pyramid carefully he ran his fingers over the unusual engraving i assume you recognize this language bellamy asked of course langdon replied eyeing the sixteen symbols known as the freemasons cipher this encoded language had been used for private communication among early masonic brothers the encryption method had been abandoned long ago for one simple reason it was much too easy to break most of the students in langdons senior symbology seminar could break this code in about five minutes langdon with a pencil and paper could do it in under sixty seconds the notorious breakability of this centuriesold encryption scheme now presented a couple of paradoxes first the claim that langdon was the only person on earth who could break it was absurd second for sato to suggest that a masonic cipher was an issue of national security was like her suggesting our nuclear launch codes were encrypted with a cracker jack decoder ring langdon was still struggling to believe any of it this pyramid is a map pointing to the lost wisdom of the ages robert bellamy said his tone grave did director sato tell you why she is so interested in this langdon shook his head not specifically she just kept saying it was an issue of national security i assume shes lying perhaps bellamy said rubbing the back of his neck he seemed to be struggling with something but there is a far more troubling possibility he turned to look langdon in the eye its possible that director sato has discovered this pyramids true potential chapter the blackness engulfing katherine solomon felt absolute having fled the familiar safety of the carpet she was now groping blindly forward her outstretched hands touching only empty space as she staggered deeper into the desolate void beneath her stockinged feet the endless expanse of cold cement felt like a frozen lake a hostile environment from which she now needed to escape no longer smelling ethanol she stopped and waited in darkness standing dead still she listened willing her heart to stop pounding so loudly the heavy footsteps behind her seemed to have stopped did i lose him katherine closed her eyes and tried to imagine where she was which direction did i run where is the door it was no use she was so turned around now that the exit could be anywhere fear katherine had once heard acted as a stimulant sharpening the minds ability to think right now however her fear had turned her mind into a tumbling torrent of panic and confusion even if i find the exit i cant get out her key card had been lost when shed shed her lab coat her only hope seemed to be that she was now a needle in a haystack a single point on a thirtythousandsquarefoot grid despite the overwhelming urge to flee katherines analytical mind told her instead to make the only logical move no move at all stay still dont make a sound the security guard was on his way and for some unknown reason her attacker smelled strongly of ethanol if he gets too close ill know it as katherine stood in silence her mind raced over what langdon had said your brother hes been taken she felt a bead of cold sweat materialize on her arm and trickle down toward the cell phone still clenched in her right hand it was a danger she had forgotten to consider if the phone rang it would give away her position and she could not turn it off without opening it and illuminating the display set down the phone and move away from it but it was too late the smell of ethanol approached on her right and now it grew stronger katherine struggled to stay calm forcing herself to override the instinct to run carefully slowly she took one step to her left the faint rustle of her clothing was apparently all her attacker needed she heard him lunge and the smell of ethanol washed over her as a powerful hand grabbed at her shoulder she twisted away raw terror gripping her mathematical probability went out the window and katherine broke into a blind sprint she veered hard to the left changing course dashing blindly now into the void the wall materialized out of nowhere katherine hit it hard knocking the wind from her lungs pain blossomed in her arm and shoulder but she managed to stay on her feet the oblique angle at which she had collided with the wall had spared her the full force of the blow but it was little comfort now the sound had echoed everywhere he knows where i am doubled over in pain she turned her head and stared out into the blackness of the pod and sensed him staring back at her change your location now still struggling to catch her breath she began moving down the wall touching her left hand quietly to each exposed steel stud as she passed stay along the wall slip past him before he corners you in her right hand katherine still clutched her cell phone ready to hurl it as a projectile if need be katherine was in no way prepared for the sound she heard next the clear rustle of clothing directly in front of her against the wall she froze stockstill and stopped breathing how could he be on the wall already she felt a faint puff of air laced with the stench of ethanol hes moving down the wall toward me katherine backed up several steps then turning silently degrees she began moving quickly in the opposite direction down the wall she moved twenty feet or so when the impossible happened once again directly in front of her along the wall she heard the rustling sound of clothing then came the same puff of air and the smell of ethanol katherine solomon froze in place my god hes everywhere barechested malakh stared into the darkness the smell of ethanol on his sleeves had proven a liability and so he had transformed it into an asset stripping off his shirt and jacket and using them to help corner his prey throwing his jacket against the wall to the right he had heard katherine stop short and change direction now having thrown his shirt ahead to the left malakh had heard her stop again he had effectively corralled katherine against the wall by establishing points beyond which she dared not pass now he waited ears straining in the silence she has only one direction she can move directly toward me even so malakh heard nothing either katherine was paralyzed with fear or she had decided to stand still and wait for help to enter pod either way she loses nobody would be entering pod anytime soon malakh had disabled the outer keypad with a very crude yet very effective technique after using trishs key card he had rammed a single dime deep into the keycard slot to prevent any other keycard use without first dismantling the entire mechanism you and i are alone katherine for as long as this takes malakh inched silently forward listening for any movement katherine solomon would die tonight in the darkness of her brothers museum a poetic end malakh looked forward to sharing the news of katherines death with her brother the old mans anguish would be longawaited revenge suddenly in the darkness to malakhs great surprise he saw a tiny glow in the distance and realized katherine had just made a deadly error in judgment shes phoning for help the electronic display that had just flickered to life was hovering waist high about twenty yards ahead like a shining beacon on a vast ocean of black malakh had been prepared to wait katherine out but now he wouldnt have to malakh sprang into motion racing toward the hovering light knowing he had to reach her before she could complete her call for help he was there in a matter of seconds and he lunged arms outstretched on either side of her glowing cell phone preparing to engulf her malakhs fingers jammed into a solid wall bending backward and almost breaking his head collided next crashing into a steel beam he cried out in pain as he crumpled beside the wall cursing he clambered back to his feet pulling himself up by the waisthigh horizontal strut on which katherine solomon had cleverly placed her open cell phone katherine was running again this time with no concern for the noise her hand was making as it bounced rhythmically off the evenly spaced metal studs of pod run if she followed the wall all the way around the pod she knew that sooner or later she would feel the exit door where the hell is the guard the even spacing of the studs continued as she ran with her left hand on the sidewall and her right out in front of her for protection when will i reach the corner the sidewall seemed to go on and on but suddenly the rhythm of the studs was broken her left hand hit empty space for several long strides and then the studs began again katherine slammed on the brakes and backed up feeling her way across the smooth metal panel why are there no studs here she could hear her attacker lumbering loudly after her now groping his way down the wall in her direction even so it was a different sound that scared katherine even more the distant rhythmic banging of a security guard pounding his flashlight against the pod door the guard cant get in while the thought was terrifying the location of his banging diagonally to her right instantly oriented katherine she could now picture where in pod she was located the visual flash brought with it an unexpected realization she now knew what this flat panel on the wall was every pod was equipped with a specimen bay a giant movable wall that could be retracted for transporting oversize specimens in and out of the pods like those of an airplane hangar this door was mammoth and katherine in her wildest dreams had never imagined needing to open it at the moment though it seemed like her only hope is it even operable katherine fumbled blindly in the blackness searching the bay door until she found the large metal handle grasping it she threw her weight backward trying to slide open the door nothing she tried again it didnt budge she could hear her attacker closing faster now homing in on the sounds of her efforts the bay door is locked wild with panic she slid her hands all over the door feeling the surface for any latch or lever she suddenly hit what felt like a vertical pole she followed it down to the floor crouching and could feel it was inserted into a hole in the cement a security rod she stood up grabbed the pole and lifting with her legs slid the rod up and out of the hole hes almost here katherine groped now for the handle found it again and heaved back on it with all her might the massive panel seemed barely to move and yet a sliver of moonlight now sliced into pod katherine pulled again the shaft of light from outside the building grew wider a little more she pulled one last time sensing her attacker was now only a few feet away leaping toward the light katherine wriggled her slender body sideways into the opening a hand materialized in the darkness clawing at her trying to pull her back inside she heaved herself through the opening pursued by a massive bare arm that was covered with tattooed scales the terrifying arm writhed like an angry snake trying to seize her katherine spun and fled down the long pale outer wall of pod the bed of loose stones that surrounded the entire perimeter of the smsc cut into her stockinged feet as she ran but she pressed on heading for the main entrance the night was dark but with her eyes fully dilated from the utter blackness of pod she could see perfectly almost as if it were daylight behind her the heavy bay door ground open and she heard heavy footsteps accelerating in pursuit down the side of the building the footsteps seemed impossibly fast ill never outrun him to the main entrance she knew her volvo was closer but even that would be too far im not going to make it then katherine realized she had one final card to play as she neared the corner of pod she could hear his footsteps quickly overtaking her in the darkness now or never instead of rounding the corner katherine suddenly cut hard to her left away from the building out onto the grass as she did so she closed her eyes tightly placed both hands over her face and began running totally blind across the lawn the motionactivated security lighting that blazed to life around pod transformed night into day instantly katherine heard a scream of pain behind her as the brilliant floodlights seared into her assailants hyper dilated pupils with over twentyfivemillion candlepower of light she could hear him stumbling on the loose stones katherine kept her eyes tightly closed trusting herself on the open lawn when she sensed she was far enough away from the building and the lights she opened her eyes corrected her course and ran like hell through the dark her volvos keys were exactly where she always left them in the center console breathless she seized the keys in her trembling hands and found the ignition the engine roared to life and her headlights flipped on illuminating a terrifying sight a hideous form raced toward her katherine froze for an instant the creature caught in her headlights was a bald and barechested animal its skin covered with tattooed scales symbols and text he bellowed as he ran into the glare raising his hands before his eyes like a cavedwelling beast seeing sunlight for the first time she reached for the gearshift but suddenly he was there hurling his elbow through her side window sending a shower of safety glass into her lap a massive scalecovered arm burst through her window groping half blind finding her neck she threw the car in reverse but her attacker had latched on to her throat squeezing with unimaginable force she turned her head in an attempt to escape his grasp and suddenly she was staring at his face three dark stripes like fingernail scratches had torn through his face makeup to reveal the tattoos beneath his eyes were wild and ruthless i should have killed you ten years ago he growled the night i killed your mother as his words registered katherine was seized by a horrifying memory that feral look in his eyes she had seen it before its him she would have screamed had it not been for the viselike grip around her neck she smashed her foot onto the accelerator and the car lurched backward almost snapping her neck as he was dragged beside her car the volvo careened up an inclined median and katherine could feel her neck about to give way beneath his weight suddenly tree branches were scraping the side of her car slapping through the side windows and the weight was gone the car burst through the evergreens and out into the upper parking lot where katherine slammed on the brakes below her the halfnaked man clambered to his feet staring into her headlights with a terrifying calm he raised a menacing scalecovered arm and pointed directly at her katherines blood coursed with raw fear and hatred as she spun the wheel and hit the gas seconds later she was fishtailing out onto silver hill road chapter in the heat of the moment capitol police officer nuсez had seen no option but to help the capitol architect and robert langdon escape now however back in the basement police headquarters nuсez could see the storm clouds gathering fast chief trent anderson was holding an ice pack to his head while another officer was tending to satos bruises both of them were standing with the video surveillance team reviewing digital playback files in an attempt to locate langdon and bellamy check the playback on every hallway and exit sato demanded i want to know where they went nuсez felt ill as he looked on he knew it would be only a matter of minutes before they found the right video clip and learned the truth i helped them escape making matters worse was the arrival of a fourman cia field team that was now staging nearby prepping to go after langdon and bellamy these guys looked nothing like the capitol police these guys were deadserious soldiers black camouflage night vision futuristiclooking handguns nuсez felt like he would throw up making up his mind he motioned discreetly to chief anderson a word chief what is it anderson followed nuсez into the hall chief i made a bad mistake nuсez said breaking a sweat im sorry and im resigning youll fire me in a few minutes anyway i beg your pardon nuсez swallowed hard earlier i saw langdon and architect bellamy in the visitor center on their way out of the building what anderson bellowed why didnt you say something the architect told me not to say a word you work for me goddamm it andersons voice echoed down the corridor bellamy smashed my head into a wall for christs sake nuсez handed anderson the key that the architect had given him what is this anderson demanded a key to the new tunnel under independence avenue architect bellamy had it thats how they escaped anderson stared down at the key speechless sato poked her head out into the hallway eyes probing whats going on out here nuсez felt himself go pale anderson was still holding the key and sato clearly had seen it as the hideous little woman drew near nuсez improvised as best as he could hoping to protect his chief i found a key on the floor in the subbasement i was just asking chief anderson if he knew what it might go to sato arrived eyeing the key and does the chief know nuсez glanced up at anderson who was clearly weighing all his options before speaking finally the chief shook his head not offhand id have to check the dont bother sato said this key unlocks a tunnel off the visitor center really anderson said how do you know that we just found the surveillance clip officer nuсez here helped langdon and bellamy escape and then relocked that tunnel door behind them bellamy gave nuсez that key anderson turned to nuсez with a flare of anger is this true nuсez nodded vigorously doing his best to play along im sorry sir the architect told me not to tell a soul i dont give a damn what the architect told you anderson yelled i expect shut up trent sato snapped youre both lousy liars save it for your cia inquisition she snatched the architects tunnel key from anderson youre done here chapter robert langdon hung up his cell phone feeling increasingly worried katherines not answering her cell katherine had promised to call him as soon as she was safely out of the lab and on her way to meet him here but she had never done so bellamy sat beside langdon at the readingroom desk he too had just made a call his to an individual he claimed could offer them sanctuary a safe place to hide unfortunately this person was not answering either and so bellamy had left an urgent message telling him to call langdons cell phone right away ill keep trying he said to langdon but for the moment were on our own and we need to discuss a plan for this pyramid the pyramid for langdon the spectacular backdrop of the reading room had all but disappeared his world constricting now to include only what was directly in front of him a stone pyramid a sealed package containing a capstone and an elegant african american man who had materialized out of the darkness and rescued him from the certainty of a cia interrogation langdon had expected a modicum of sanity from the architect of the capitol but now it seemed warren bellamy was no more rational than the madman claiming peter was in purgatory bellamy was insisting this stone pyramid was in fact the masonic pyramid of legend an ancient map that guides us to powerful wisdom mr bellamy langdon said politely this idea that there exists some kind of ancient knowledge that can imbue men with great power i simply cant take it seriously bellamys eyes looked both disappointed and earnest making langdons skepticism all the more awkward yes professor i had imagined you might feel this way but i suppose i should not be surprised you are an outsider looking in there exist certain masonic realities that you will perceive as myth because you are not properly initiated and prepared to understand them now langdon felt patronized i wasnt a member of odysseuss crew but im certain the cyclops is a myth mr bellamy even if the legend is true this pyramid cannot possibly be the masonic pyramid no bellamy ran a finger across the masonic cipher on the stone it looks to me like it fits the description perfectly a stone pyramid with a shining metal capstone which according to satos xray is exactly what peter entrusted to you bellamy picked up the little cubeshaped package weighing it in his hand this stone pyramid is less than a foot tall langdon countered every version of the story ive ever heard describes the masonic pyramid as enormous bellamy had clearly anticipated this point as you know the legend speaks of a pyramid rising so high that god himself can reach out and touch it exactly i can see your dilemma professor however both the ancient mysteries and masonic philosophy celebrate the potentiality of god within each of us symbolically speaking one could claim that anything within reach of an enlightened man is within reach of god langdon felt unswayed by the wordplay even the bible concurs bellamy said if we accept as genesis tells us that god created man in his own image then we also must accept what this implies that mankind was not created inferior to god in luke we are told the kingdom of god is within you im sorry but i dont know any christians who consider themselves gods equal of course not bellamy said his tone hardening because most christians want it both ways they want to be able to proudly declare they are believers in the bible and yet simply ignore those parts they find too difficult or too inconvenient to believe langdon made no response anyhow bellamy said the masonic pyramids ageold description as being tall enough to be touched by god this has long led to misinterpretations about its size conveniently it keeps academics like yourself insisting the pyramid is a legend and nobody searches for it langdon looked down at the stone pyramid i apologize that im frustrating you he said ive simply always thought of the masonic pyramid as a myth does it not seem perfectly fitting to you that a map created by stonemasons would be carved in stone throughout history our most important guideposts have always been carved in stone including the tablets god gave moses ten commandments to guide our human conduct i understand and yet it is always referred to as the legend of the masonic pyramid legend implies it is mythical yes legend bellamy chuckled im afraid youre suffering from the same problem moses had im sorry bellamy looked almost amused as he turned in his seat glancing up at the secondtier balcony where sixteen bronze statues peered down at them do you see moses langdon gazed up at the librarys celebrated statue of moses yes he has horns im aware of that but do you know why he has horns like most teachers langdon did not enjoy being lectured to the moses above them had horns for the same reason thousands of christian images of moses had horns a mistranslation of the book of exodus the original hebrew text described moses as having karan ohr panav facial skin that glowed with rays of lightbut when the roman catholic church created the official latin translation of the bible the translator bungled mosess description rendering it as cornuta esset facies sua meaning his face was horned from that moment on artists and sculptors fearing reprisals if they were not true to the gospels began depicting moses with horns it was a simple mistake langdon replied a mistranslation by saint jerome around four hundred ad bellamy looked impressed exactly a mistranslation and the result is poor moses is now misshapen for all history misshapen was a nice way to put it langdon as a child had been terrified when he saw michelangelos diabolical horned mosesthe centerpiece of romes basilica of st peter in chains i mention the horned moses bellamy now said to illustrate how a single word misunderstood can rewrite history youre preaching to the choir langdon thought having learned the lesson firsthand in paris a number of years back sangreal holy grail sangreal royal blood in the case of the masonic pyramid bellamy continued people heard whispers about a legend and the idea stuck the legend of the masonic pyramid sounded like a myth but the word legend was referring to something else it had been misconstrued much like the word talisman he smiled language can be very adept at hiding the truth thats true but youre losing me here robert the masonic pyramid is a map and like every map it has a legend a key that tells you how to read it bellamy took the cubeshaped package and held it up dont you see this capstone is the legend to the pyramid it is the key that tells you how to read the most powerful artifact on earth a map that unveils the hiding place of mankinds greatest treasure the lost wisdom of the ages langdon fell silent i humbly submit bellamy said that your towering masonic pyramid is only this a modest stone whose golden capstone reaches high enough to be touched by god high enough that an enlightened man can reach down and touch it silence hung between the two men for several seconds langdon felt an unexpected pulse of excitement as he looked down at the pyramid seeing it in a new light his eyes moved again to the masonic cipher but this code it seems so simple langdon nodded almost anyone could decipher this bellamy smiled and retrieved a pencil and paper for langdon then perhaps you should enlighten us langdon felt uneasy about reading the code and yet considering the circumstances it seemed a minor betrayal of peters trust moreover whatever the engraving said he could not imagine that it unveiled a secret hiding place of anything at all much less that of one of historys greatest treasures langdon accepted the pencil from bellamy and tapped it on his chin as he studied the cipher the code was so simple that he barely needed pencil and paper even so he wanted to ensure he made no mistakes and so he dutifully put pencil to paper and wrote down the most common decryption key for a masonic cipher the key consisted of four grids two plain and two dotted with the alphabet running through them in order each letter of the alphabet was now positioned inside a uniquely shaped enclosure or pen the shape of each letters enclosure became the symbol for that letter the scheme was so simple it was almost infantile langdon doublechecked his handiwork feeling confident the decryption key was correct he now turned his attention back to the code inscribed on the pyramid to decipher it all he had to do was to find the matching shape on his decryption key and write down the letter inside it the first character on the pyramid looked like a down arrow or a chalice langdon quickly found the chaliceshaped segment on the decryption key it was located in the lower lefthand corner and enclosed the letter s langdon wrote down s the next symbol on the pyramid was a dotted square missing its right side that shape on the decryption grid enclosed the letter o he wrote down o the third symbol was a simple square which enclosed the letter e langdon wrote down e s o e he continued picking up speed until he had completed the entire grid now as he gazed down at his finished translation langdon let out a puzzled sigh hardly what id call a eureka moment bellamys face showed the hint of a smile as you know professor the ancient mysteries are reserved only for the truly enlightened right langdon said frowning apparently i dont qualify chapter in a basement office deep inside cia headquarters in langley virginia the same sixteencharacter masonic cipher glowed brightly on a highdefinition computer monitor senior os analyst nola kaye sat alone and studied the image that had been emailed to her ten minutes ago by her boss director inoue sato is this some kind of joke nola knew it was not of course director sato had no sense of humor and the events of tonight were anything but a joking matter nolas highlevel clearance within the cias allseeing office of security had opened her eyes to the shadow worlds of power but what nola had witnessed in the last twentyfour hours had changed her impressions forever of the secrets that powerful men kept yes director nola now said cradling the phone on her shoulder as she talked to sato the engraving is indeed the masonic cipher however the cleartext is meaningless it appears to be a grid of random letters she gazed down at her decryption it must say something sato insisted not unless it has a second layer of encryption that im not aware of any guesses sato asked its a gridbased matrix so i could run the usual vigenиre grilles trellises and so forth but no promises especially if its a onetime pad do what you can and do it fast how about the xray nola swiveled her chair to a second system which displayed a standard security xray of someones bag sato had requested information on what appeared to be a small pyramid inside a cubeshaped box normally a twoinchtall object would not be an issue of national security unless it was made of enriched plutonium this one was not it was made of something almost equally startling imagedensity analysis was conclusive nola said nineteenpointthree grams per cubic centimeter its pure gold very very valuable anything else actually yes the density scan picked up minor irregularities on the surface of the gold pyramid it turns out the gold is engraved with text really sato sounded hopeful what does it say i cant tell yet the inscription is extremely faint im trying to enhance with filters but the resolution on the xray is not great okay keep trying call me when you have something yes maam and nola satos tone turned ominous as with everything you have learned in the last twentyfour hours the images of the stone pyramid and gold capstone are classified at the highest levels of security you are to consult no one you report to me directly i want to make sure that is clear of course maam good keep me posted sato hung up nola rubbed her eyes and looked blearily back at her computer screens she had not slept in over thirtysix hours and she knew damn well she would not sleep again until this crisis had reached its conclusion whatever that may be back at the capitol visitor center four blackclad cia fieldop specialists stood at the entrance to the tunnel peering hungrily down the dimly lit shaft like a pack of dogs eager for the hunt sato approached having just hung up from a call gentlemen she said still holding the architects key are your mission parameters clear affirmative the lead agent replied we have two targets the first is an engraved stone pyramid approximately one foot tall the second is a smaller cubeshaped package approximately two inches tall both were last seen in robert langdons shoulder bag correct sato said these two items must be retrieved quickly and intact do you have any questions parameters for use of force satos shoulder was still throbbing from where bellamy had struck her with a bone as i said it is of critical importance that these items be retrieved understood the four men turned and headed into the darkness of the tunnel sato lit a cigarette and watched them disappear chapter katherine solomon had always been a prudent driver but now she was pushing her volvo at over ninety as she fled blindly up the suitland parkway her trembling foot had been lodged on the accelerator for a full mile before her panic began to lift she now realized her uncontrollable shivering was no longer solely from fear im freezing the wintry night air was gushing through her shattered window buffeting her body like an arctic wind her stockinged feet were numb and she reached down for her spare pair of shoes which she kept beneath the passenger seat as she did she felt a stab of pain from the bruise on her throat where the powerful hand had latched on to her neck the man who had smashed through her window bore no resemblance to the blondhaired gentleman whom katherine knew as dr christopher abaddon his thick hair and smooth tanned complexion had disappeared his shaved head bare chest and makeupsmeared face had been unveiled as a terrifying tapestry of tattoos she heard his voice again whispering to her in the howl of wind outside her broken window katherine i should have killed you years ago the night i killed your mother katherine shivered feeling no doubt that was him she had never forgotten the look of fiendish violence in his eyes nor had she ever forgotten the sound of her brothers single gunshot which had killed this man propelling him off a high ledge into the frozen river below where he plummeted through the ice and never resurfaced investigators had searched for weeks never finding his body and finally decided it had been washed away by the current out to the chesapeake bay they were wrong she now knew he is still alive and hes back katherine felt angstridden as the memories flooded back it was almost exactly ten years ago christmas day katherine peter and their mother her entire family were gathered at their sprawling stone mansion in potomac nestled on a twohundredacre wooded estate with its own river running through it as was tradition their mother worked diligently in the kitchen rejoicing in the holiday custom of cooking for her two children even at seventyfive years of age isabel solomon was an exuberant cook and tonight the mouthwatering smells of roast venison parsnip gravy and garlic mashed potatoes wafted through the house while mother prepared the feast katherine and her brother relaxed in the conservatory discussing katherines latest fascination a new field called noetic science an unlikely fusion of modern particle physics and ancient mysticism noetics had absolutely captivated katherines imagination physics meets philosophy katherine told peter about some of the experiments she was dreaming up and she could see in his eyes that he was intrigued katherine felt particularly pleased to give her brother something positive to think about this christmas since the holiday had also become a painful reminder of a terrible tragedy peters son zachary katherines nephews twentyfirst birthday had been his last the family had been through a nightmare and it seemed that her brother was only now finally learning how to laugh again zachary had been a late bloomer frail and awkward a rebellious and angry teenager despite his deeply loving and privileged upbringing the boy seemed determined to detach himself from the solomon establishment he was kicked out of prep school partied hard with the celebrati and shunned his parents exhaustive attempts to provide him firm and loving guidance he broke peters heart shortly before zacharys eighteenth birthday katherine had sat down with her mother and brother and listened to them debating whether or not to withhold zacharys inheritance until he was more mature the solomon inheritance a centuriesold tradition in the family bequeathed a staggeringly generous piece of the solomon wealth to every solomon child on his or her eighteenth birthday the solomons believed that an inheritance was more helpful at the beginning of someones life than at the end moreover placing large pieces of the solomon fortune in the hands of eager young descendants had been the key to growing the familys dynastic wealth in this case however katherines mother argued that it was dangerous to give peters troubled son such a large sum of money peter disagreed the solomon inheritance her brother had said is a family tradition that should not be broken this money may well force zachary to be more responsible sadly her brother had been wrong the moment zachary received the money he broke from the family disappearing from the house without taking any of his belongings he surfaced a few months later in the tabloids trust fund playboy living european high life the tabloids took joy in documenting zacharys spoiled life of debauchery the photos of wild parties on yachts and drunken disco stupors were hard for the solomons to take but the photos of their wayward teen turned from tragic to frightening when the papers reported zachary had been caught carrying cocaine across a border in eastern europe solomon millionaire in turkish prison the prison they learned was called soganlik a brutal fclass detention center located in the kartal district outside of istanbul peter solomon fearing for his sons safety flew to turkey to retrieve him katherines distraught brother returned emptyhanded having been forbidden even to visit with zachary the only promising news was that solomons influential contacts at the us state department were working on getting him extradited as quickly as possible two days later however peter received a horrifying international phone call the next morning headlines blared solomon heir murdered in prison the prison photos were horrific and the media callously aired them all even long after the solomons private burial ceremony peters wife never forgave him for failing to free zachary and their marriage came to an end six months later peter had been alone ever since it was years later that katherine peter and their mother isabel were gathered quietly for christmas the pain was still a presence in their family but mercifully it was fading with each passing year the pleasant rattle of pots and pans now echoed from the kitchen as their mother prepared the traditional feast out in the conservatory peter and katherine were enjoying a baked brie and relaxed holiday conversation then came an utterly unexpected sound hello solomons an airy voice said behind them startled katherine and her brother spun to see an enormous muscular figure stepping into the conservatory he wore a black ski mask that covered all of his face except his eyes which shone with feral ferocity peter was on his feet in an instant who are you how did you get in here i knew your little boy zachary in prison he told me where this key was hidden the stranger held up an old key and grinned like a beast right before i bludgeoned him to death peters mouth fell open a pistol appeared aimed directly at peters chest sit peter fell back into his chair as the man moved into the room katherine was frozen in place behind his mask the mans eyes were wild like those of a rabid animal hey peter yelled as if trying to warn their mother in the kitchen whoever you are take what you want and get out the man leveled his gun at peters chest and what is it you think i want just tell me how much solomon said we dont have money in the house but i can the monster laughed do not insult me i have not come for money i have come tonight for zacharys other birthright he grinned he told me about the pyramid pyramid katherine thought in bewildered terror what pyramid her brother was defiant i dont know what youre talking about dont play dumb with me zachary told me what you keep in your study vault i want it now whatever zachary told you he was confused peter said i dont know what youre talking about no the intruder turned and aimed the gun at katherines face how about now peters eyes filled with terror you must believe me i dont know what it is you want lie to me one more time he said still aiming at katherine and i swear i will take her from you he smiled and from what zachary said your little sister is more precious to you than all your whats going on katherines mother shouted marching into the room with peters browning citori shotgun which she aimed directly at the mans chest the intruder spun toward her and the feisty seventyfiveyearold woman wasted no time she fired a deafening blast of pellets the intruder staggered backward firing his handgun wildly in all directions shattering windows as he fell and crashed through the glass doorway dropping the pistol as he fell peter was instantly in motion diving on the loose handgun katherine had fallen and mrs solomon hurried to her side kneeling beside her my god are you hurt katherine shook her head mute with shock outside the shattered glass door the masked man had clambered to his feet and was running into the woods clutching his side as he ran peter solomon glanced back to make sure his mother and sister were safe and seeing they were fine he held the pistol and raced out the door after the intruder katherines mother held her hand trembling thank heavens youre okay then suddenly her mother pulled away katherine youre bleeding theres blood youre hurt katherine saw the blood a lot of blood it was all over her but she felt no pain her mother frantically searched katherines body for a wound where does it hurt mom i dont know i dont feel anything then katherine saw the source of the blood and she went cold mom its not me she pointed to the side of her mothers white satin blouse where blood was running freely and a small tattered hole was visible her mother glanced down looking more confused than anything else she winced and shrank back as if the pain had just hit her katherine her voice was calm but suddenly it carried the weight of her seventyfive years i need you to call an ambulance katherine ran to the hall phone and called for help when she got back to the conservatory she found her mother lying motionless in a pool of blood she ran to her crouching down cradling her mothers body in her arms katherine had no idea how much time had passed when she heard the distant gunshot in the woods finally the conservatory door burst open and her brother peter rushed in eyes wild gun still in his hand when he saw katherine sobbing holding their lifeless mother in her arms his face contorted in anguish the scream that echoed through the conservatory was a sound katherine solomon would never forget chapter malakh could feel the tattooed muscles on his back rippling as he sprinted back around the building toward the open bay door of pod i must gain access to her lab katherines escape had been unanticipated and problematic not only did she know where malakh lived she now knew his true identity and that he was the one who had invaded their home a decade earlier malakh had not forgotten that night either he had come within inches of possessing the pyramid but destiny had obstructed him i was not yet ready but he was ready now more powerful more influential having endured unthinkable hardship in preparation for his return malakh was poised tonight to fulfill his destiny at last he felt certain that before the night was over he would indeed be staring into the dying eyes of katherine solomon as malakh reached the bay door he reassured himself that katherine had not truly escaped she had only prolonged the inevitable he slid through the opening and strode confidently across the darkness until his feet hit the carpet then he took a right turn and headed for the cube the banging on the door of pod had stopped and malakh suspected the guard was now trying to remove the dime malakh had jammed into the key panel to render it useless when malakh reached the door that led into the cube he located the outer keypad and inserted trishs key card the panel lit up he entered trishs pin and went inside the lights were all ablaze and as he moved into the sterile space he squinted in amazement at the dazzling array of equipment malakh was no stranger to the power of technology he performed his own breed of science in the basement of his home and last night some of that science had borne fruit the truth peter solomons unique confinement trapped alone in the inbetween had laid bare all of the mans secrets i can see his soul malakh had learned certain secrets he anticipated and others he had not including the news about katherines lab and her shocking discoveries science is getting close malakh had realized and i will not allow it to light the way for the unworthy katherines work here had begun using modern science to answer ancient philosophical questions does anyone hear our prayers is there life after death do humans have souls incredibly katherine had answered all of these questions and more scientifically conclusively the methods she used were irrefutable even the most skeptical of people would be persuaded by the results of her experiments if this information were published and made known a fundamental shift would begin in the consciousness of man they will start to find their way malakhs last task tonight before his transformation was to ensure that this did not happen as he moved through the lab malakh located the data room that peter had told him about he peered through the heavy glass walls at the two holographic datastorage units exactly as he said they would be malakh found it hard to imagine that the contents of these little boxes could change the course of human development and yet truth had always been the most potent of all the catalysts eyeing the holographic storage units malakh produced trishs key card and inserted it in the doors security panel to his surprise the panel did not light up apparently access to this room was not a trust extended to trish dunne he now reached for the key card he had found in katherines labcoat pocket when he inserted this one the panel lit up malakh had a problem i never got katherines pin he tried trishs pin but it didnt work stroking his chin he stepped back and examined the threeinchthick plexiglas door even with an ax he knew he would be unable to break through and obtain the drives he needed to destroy malakh had planned for this contingency however inside the powersupply room exactly as peter had described malakh located the rack holding several metal cylinders resembling large scuba tanks the cylinders bore the letters lh the number and the universal symbol for combustible one of the canisters was connected to the labs hydrogen fuel cell malakh left one canister connected and carefully heaved one of the reserve cylinders down onto a dolly beside the rack then he rolled the cylinder out of the powersupply room across the lab to the plexiglas door of the datastorage room although this location would certainly be plenty close enough he had noticed one weakness in the heavy plexiglas door the small space between the bottom and the jamb at the threshold he carefully laid the canister on its side and slid the flexible rubber tube beneath the door it took him a moment to remove the safety seals and access the cylinders valve but once he did ever so gently he uncocked the valve through the plexiglas he could see the clear bubbling liquid begin draining out of the tube onto the floor inside the storage room malakh watched the puddle expand oozing across the floor steaming and bubbling as it grew hydrogen remained in liquid form only when it was cold and as it warmed up it would start to boil off the resulting gas conveniently was even more flammable than the liquid remember the hindenburg malakh hurried now into the lab and retrieved the pyrex jug of bunsenburner fuel a viscous highly flammable yet noncombustible oil he carried it to the plexiglas door pleased to see the liquid hydrogen canister was still draining the puddle of boiling liquid inside the datastorage room now covering the entire floor encircling the pedestals that supported the holographic storage units a whitish mist now rose from the boiling puddle as the liquid hydrogen began turning to gas filling the small space malakh raised the jug of bunsenburner fuel and squirted a healthy amount on the hydrogen canister the tubing and into the small opening beneath the door then very carefully he began backing out of the lab leaving an unbroken stream of oil on the floor as he went the dispatch operator handling calls for washington dc had been unusually busy tonight football beer and a full moon she thought as yet another emergency call appeared on her screen this one from a gasstation pay phone on the suitland parkway in anacostia a car accident probably nineoneone she answered what is your emergency i was just attacked at the smithsonian museum support center a panicked womans voice said please send the police fortytwoten silver hill road okay slow down the operator said you need to i need you to send officers also to a mansion in kalorama heights where i think my brother may be held captive the operator sighed full moon chapter as i tried to tell you bellamy was saying to langdon there is more to this pyramid than meets the eye apparently so langdon had to admit that the stone pyramid sitting in his unzipped daybag looked much more mysterious to him now his decryption of the masonic cipher had rendered a seemingly meaningless grid of letters chaos for a long while langdon examined the grid searching for any hint of meaning within the letters hidden words anagrams clues of any sort but he found nothing the masonic pyramid bellamy explained is said to guard its secrets behind many veils each time you pull back a curtain you face another you have unveiled these letters and yet they tell you nothing until you peel back another layer of course the way to do that is known only to the one who holds the capstone the capstone i suspect has an inscription as well which tells you how to decipher the pyramid langdon glanced at the cubeshaped package on the desk from what bellamy had said langdon now understood that the capstone and pyramid were a segmented ciphera code broken into pieces modern cryptologists used segmented ciphers all the time although the security scheme had been invented in ancient greece the greeks when they wanted to store secret information inscribed it on a clay tablet and then shattered the tablet into pieces storing each piece in a separate location only when all the pieces were gathered together could the secrets be read this kind of inscribed clay tablet called a symbolon was in fact the origin of the modern word symbol robert bellamy said this pyramid and capstone have been kept apart for generations ensuring the secrets safety his tone turned rueful tonight however the pieces have come dangerously close im sure i dont have to say this but it is our duty to ensure this pyramid is not assembled langdon found bellamys sense of drama to be somewhat overwrought is he describing the capstone and pyramid or a detonator and nuclear bomb he still couldnt quite accept bellamys claims but it hardly seemed to matter even if this is the masonic pyramid and even if this inscription does somehow reveal the location of ancient knowledge how could that knowledge possibly impart the kind of power it is said to impart peter always told me you were a hard man to convince an academic who prefers proof to speculation youre saying you do believe that langdon demanded feeling impatient now respectfully you are a modern educated man how could you believe such a thing bellamy gave a patient smile the craft of freemasonry has given me a deep respect for that which transcends human understanding ive learned never to close my mind to an idea simply because it seems miraculous chapter frantically the smsc perimeter patrolman dashed down the gravel pathway that ran along the outside of the building hed just received a call from an officer inside saying that the keypad to pod had been sabotaged and that a security light indicated that pod s specimen bay door was now open what the hell is going on as he arrived at the specimen bay sure enough he found the door open a couple of feet bizarre he thought this can only be unlocked from the inside he took the flashlight off his belt and shone it into the inky blackness of the pod nothing having no desire to step into the unknown he moved only as far as the threshold and then stuck the flashlight through the opening swinging it to the left and then to the powerful hands seized his wrist and yanked him into the blackness the guard felt himself being spun around by an invisible force he smelled ethanol the flashlight flew out of his hand and before he could even process what was happening a rockhard fist collided with his sternum the guard crumpled to the cement floor groaning in pain as a large black form stepped away from him the guard lay on his side gasping and wheezing for breath his flashlight lay nearby its beam spilling across the floor and illuminating what appeared to be a metal can of some sort the cans label said it was fuel oil for a bunsen burner a cigarette lighter sparked and the orange flame illuminated a vision that hardly seemed human jesus christ the guard barely had time to process what he was seeing before the barechested creature knelt down and touched the flame to the floor instantly a strip of fire materialized leaping away from them racing into the void bewildered the guard looked back but the creature was already slipping out the open bay door into the night the guard managed to sit up wincing in pain as his eyes followed the thin ribbon of fire what the hell the flame looked too small to be truly dangerous and yet now he saw something utterly terrifying the fire was no longer illuminating only the darkened void it had traveled all the way to the back wall where it was now illuminating a massive cinderblock structure the guard had never been permitted inside pod but he knew very well what this structure must be the cube katherine solomons lab the flame raced in a straight line directly to the labs outer door the guard clambered to his feet knowing full well that the ribbon of oil probably continued beneath the lab door and would soon start a fire inside but as he turned to run for help he felt an unexpected puff of air sucking past him for a brief instant all of pod was bathed in light the guard never saw the hydrogen fireball erupting skyward ripping the roof off pod and billowing hundreds of feet into the air nor did he see the sky raining fragments of titanium mesh electronic equipment and droplets of melted silicon from the labs holographic storage units katherine solomon was driving north when she saw the sudden flash of light in her rearview mirror a deep rumble thundered through the night air startling her fireworks she wondered do the redskins have a halftime show she refocused on the road her thoughts still on the call shed placed from the deserted gas stations pay phone katherine had successfully convinced the dispatcher to send the police to the smsc to investigate a tattooed intruder and katherine prayed to find her assistant trish in addition she urged the dispatcher to check dr abaddons address in kalorama heights where she thought peter was being held hostage unfortunately katherine had been unable to obtain robert langdons unlisted cellphone number so now seeing no other option she was speeding toward the library of congress where langdon had told her he was headed the terrifying revelation of dr abaddons true identity had changed everything katherine had no idea what to believe anymore all she knew for certain was that the same man who had killed her mother and nephew all those years ago had now captured her brother and had come to kill her who is this madman what does he want the only answer she could come up with made no sense a pyramid equally confusing was why this man had come to her lab tonight if he wanted to hurt her why hadnt he done so in the privacy of his own home earlier today why go to the trouble of sending a text message and risk breaking into her lab unexpectedly the fireworks in her rearview mirror grew brighter the initial flash followed by an unexpected sight a blazing orange fireball that katherine could see rising above the tree line what in the world the fireball was accompanied by dark black smoke and it was nowhere near the redskins fedex field bewildered she tried to determine what industry might be located on the other side of those trees just southeast of the parkway then like an oncoming truck it hit her chapter warren bellamy stabbed urgently at the buttons on his cell phone trying again to make contact with someone who could help them whoever that might be langdon watched bellamy but his mind was with peter trying to figure out how best to find him decipher the engraving peters captor had commanded and it will tell you the hiding place of mankinds greatest treasure we will go together and make our trade bellamy hung up frowning still no answer heres what i dont understand langdon said even if i could somehow accept that this hidden wisdom exists and that this pyramid somehow points to its underground location what am i looking for a vault a bunker bellamy sat quietly for a long moment then he gave a reluctant sigh and spoke guardedly robert according to what ive heard through the years the pyramid leads to the entrance of a spiral staircase a staircase thats right a staircase that leads down into the earth many hundreds of feet langdon could not believe what he was hearing he leaned closer ive heard it said that the ancient wisdom is buried at the bottom robert langdon stood up and began pacing a spiral staircase descending hundreds of feet into the earth in washington dc and nobody has ever seen this staircase allegedly the entrance has been covered with an enormous stone langdon sighed the idea of a tomb covered with an enormous stone was right out of the biblical accounts of jesus tomb this archetypal hybrid was the grandfather of them all warren do you believe this secret mystical staircase into the earth exists ive never seen it personally but a few of the older masons swear it exists i was trying to call one of them just now langdon continued pacing uncertain what to say next robert you leave me a difficult task with respect to this pyramid warren bellamys gaze hardened in the soft glow of the reading lamp i know of no way to force a man to believe what he does not want to believe and yet i hope you understand your duty to peter solomon yes i have a duty to help him langdon thought i dont need you to believe in the power this pyramid can unveil nor do i need you to believe in the staircase it supposedly leads to but i do need you to believe that you are morally obliged to protect this secret whatever it may be bellamy motioned to the little cubeshaped package peter entrusted the capstone to you because he had faith you would obey his wishes and keep it secret and now you must do exactly that even if it means sacrificing peters life langdon stopped short and wheeled around what bellamy remained seated his expression pained but resolute its what he would want you need to forget peter hes gone peter did his job doing the best he could to protect the pyramid now it is our job to make sure his efforts were not in vain i cant believe youre saying this langdon exclaimed temper flaring even if this pyramid is everything you say it is peter is your masonic brother youre sworn to protect him above all else even your country no robert a mason must protect a fellow mason above all things except one the great secret our brotherhood protects for all mankind whether or not i believe this lost wisdom has the potential that history suggests i have taken a vow to keep it out of the hands of the unworthy and i would not give it over to anyone even in exchange for peter solomons life i know plenty of masons langdon said angrily including the most advanced and im damned sure these men are not sworn to sacrifice their lives for the sake of a stone pyramid and im also damned sure none of them believes in a secret staircase that descends to a treasure buried deep in the earth there are circles within circles robert not everyone knows everything langdon exhaled trying to control his emotions he like everyone had heard the rumors of elite circles within the masons whether or not it was true seemed irrelevant in the face of this situation warren if this pyramid and capstone truly reveal the ultimate masonic secret then why would peter involve me im not even a brother much less part of any inner circle i know and i suspect that is precisely why peter chose you to guard it this pyramid has been targeted in the past even by those who infiltrated our brotherhood with unworthy motives peters choice to store it outside the brotherhood was a clever one were you aware i had the capstone langdon asked no and if peter told anyone at all it would have been only one man bellamy pulled out his cell phone and hit redial and so far ive been unable to reach him he got a voicemail greeting and hung up well robert it looks like you and i are on our own for the moment and we have a decision to make langdon looked at his mickey mouse watch pm you do realize that peters captor is waiting for me to decipher this pyramid tonight and tell him what it says bellamy frowned great men throughout history have made deep personal sacrifices to protect the ancient mysteries you and i must do the same he stood up now we should keep moving sooner or later sato will figure out where we are what about katherine langdon demanded not wanting to leave i cant reach her and she never called obviously something happened but we cant just abandon her forget katherine bellamy said his voice commanding now forget peter forget everyone dont you understand robert that youve been entrusted with a duty that is bigger than all of us you peter katherine myself he locked eyes with langdon we need to find a safe place to hide this pyramid and capstone far from a loud metallic crash echoed in the direction of the great hall bellamy wheeled eyes filling with fear that was fast langdon turned toward the door the sound apparently had come from the metal bucket that bellamy had placed on the ladder blocking the tunnel doors theyre coming for us then quite unexpectedly the crash echoed again and again and again the homeless man on the bench in front of the library of congress rubbed his eyes and watched the strange scene unfolding before him a white volvo had just jumped the curb lurched across the deserted pedestrian walkway and screeched to a halt at the foot of the librarys main entrance an attractive darkhaired woman had leaped out anxiously surveyed the area and spotting the homeless man had shouted do you have a phone lady i dont have a left shoe apparently realizing as much the woman dashed up the staircase toward the librarys main doors arriving at the top of the stairs she grabbed the handle and tried desperately to open each of the three giant doors the librarys closed lady but the woman didnt seem to care she seized one of the heavy ringshaped handles heaved it backward and let it fall with a loud crash against the door then she did it again and again and again wow the homeless man thought she must really need a book chapter when katherine solomon finally saw the massive bronze doors of the library swing open before her she felt as if an emotional floodgate had burst all the fear and confusion she had bottled up tonight came pouring through the figure in the library doorway was warren bellamy a friend and confidant of her brothers but it was the man behind bellamy in the shadows whom katherine felt happiest to see the feeling was apparently mutual robert langdons eyes filled with relief as she rushed through the doorway directly into his arms as katherine lost herself in the comforting embrace of an old friend bellamy closed the front door she heard the heavy lock click into place and at last she felt safe tears came unexpectedly but she fought them back langdon held her its okay he whispered youre okay because you saved me katherine wanted to tell him he destroyed my lab all my work years of research up in smoke she wanted to tell him everything but she could barely breathe well find peter langdons deep voice resonated against her chest comforting her somehow i promise i know who did this katherine wanted to yell the same man who killed my mother and nephew before she could explain herself an unexpected sound broke the silence of the library the loud crash echoed up from beneath them in a vestibule stairwell as if a large metal object had fallen on a tile floor katherine felt langdons muscles stiffen instantly bellamy stepped forward his expression dire were leaving now bewildered katherine followed as the architect and langdon hurried across the great hall toward the librarys famed reading room which was ablaze with light bellamy quickly locked the two sets of doors behind them first the outer then the inner katherine followed in a daze as bellamy hustled them both toward the center of the room the threesome arrived at a reading desk where a leather bag sat beneath a light beside the bag there was a tiny cubeshaped package which bellamy scooped up and placed inside the bag alongside a katherine stopped short a pyramid although she had never seen this engraved stone pyramid she felt her entire body recoil in recognition somehow her gut knew the truth katherine solomon had just come facetoface with the object that had so deeply damaged her life the pyramid bellamy zipped up the bag and handed it to langdon dont let this out of your sight a sudden explosion rocked the rooms outer doors the tinkling of shattered glass followed this way bellamy spun looking scared now as he rushed them over to the central circulation desk eight counters around a massive octagonal cabinet he guided them in behind the counters and then pointed to an opening in the cabinet get in there in there langdon demanded theyll find us for sure trust me bellamy said its not what you think chapter malakh gunned his limousine north toward kalorama heights the explosion in katherines lab had been bigger than he had anticipated and he had been lucky to escape unscathed conveniently the ensuing chaos had enabled him to slip out without opposition powering his limousine past a distracted gate guard who was busy yelling into a telephone ive got to get off the road he thought if katherine hadnt yet phoned the police the explosion would certainly draw their attention and a shirtless man driving a limousine would be hard to miss after years of preparation malakh could scarcely believe the night was now upon him the journey to this moment had been a long difficult one what began years ago in misery will end tonight in glory on the night it all began he had not had the name malakh in fact on the night it all began he had not had any name at all inmate like most of the prisoners at the brutal soganlik prison outside of istanbul inmate was here because of drugs he had been lying on his bunk in a cement cell hungry and cold in the darkness wondering how long he would be incarcerated his new cellmate whom hed met only twentyfour hours ago was sleeping in the bunk above him the prison administrator an obese alcoholic who hated his job and took it out on the inmates had just killed all the lights for the night it was almost ten oclock when inmate heard the conversation filtering in through the ventilation shaft the first voice was unmistakably clear the piercing belligerent accent of the prison administrator who clearly did not appreciate being woken up by a latenight visitor yes yes youve come a long way he was saying but there are no visitors for the first month state regulations no exceptions the voice that replied was soft and refined filled with pain is my son safe he is a drug addict is he being treated well well enough the administrator said this is not a hotel there was a pained pause you do realize the us state department will request extradition yes yes they always do it will be granted although the paperwork might take us a couple of weeks or even a month depending depending on what well the administrator said we are understaffed he paused of course sometimes concerned parties like yourself make donations to the prison staff to help us push things through more quickly the visitor did not reply mr solomon the administrator continued lowering his voice for a man like yourself for whom money is no object there are always options i know people in government if you and i work together we may be able to get your son out of here tomorrow with all the charges dropped he would not even have to face prosecution at home the response was immediate forgetting the legal ramifications of your suggestion i refuse to teach my son that money solves all problems or that there is no accountability in life especially in a serious matter like this youd like to leave him here id like to speak to him right now as i said we have rules your son is unavailable to you unless you would like to negotiate his immediate release a cold silence hung for several moments the state department will be contacting you keep zachary safe i expect him on a plane home within the week good night the door slammed inmate could not believe his ears what kind of father leaves his son in this hellhole in order to teach him a lesson peter solomon had even rejected an offer to clear zacharys record it was later that night lying awake in his bunk that inmate had realized how he would free himself if money was the only thing separating a prisoner from freedom then inmate was as good as free peter solomon might not be willing to part with money but as anyone who read the tabloids knew his son zachary had plenty of money too the next day inmate spoke privately to the administrator and suggested a plan a bold ingenious scheme that would give them both exactly what they wanted zachary solomon would have to die for this to work explained inmate but we could both disappear immediately you could retire to the greek islands you would never see this place again after some discussion the two men shook hands soon zachary solomon will be dead inmate thought smiling to think how easy it would be it was two days later that the state department contacted the solomon family with the horrific news the prison snapshots showed their sons brutally bludgeoned body lying curled and lifeless on the floor of his prison cell his head had been bashed in by a steel bar and the rest of him was battered and twisted beyond what was humanly imaginable he appeared to have been tortured and finally killed the prime suspect was the prison administrator himself who had disappeared probably with all of the murdered boys money zachary had signed papers moving his vast fortune into a private numbered account which had been emptied immediately following his death there was no telling where the money was now peter solomon flew to turkey on a private jet and returned with their sons casket which they buried in the solomon family cemetery the prison administrator was never found nor would he be inmate knew the turks rotund body was now resting at the bottom of the sea of marmara feeding the blue manna crabs that migrated in through the bosporus strait the vast fortune belonging to zachary solomon had all been moved to an untraceable numbered account inmate was a free man again a free man with a massive fortune the greek islands were like heaven the light the water the women there was nothing money couldnt buy new identities new passports new hope he chose a greek name andros dareios andros meaning warrior and dareios meaning wealthy the dark nights in prison had frightened him and andros vowed never to go back he shaved off his shaggy hair and shunned the drug world entirely he began life anew exploring neverbeforeimagined sensual pleasures the serenity of sailing alone on the inkblue aegean sea became his new heroin trance the sensuality of sucking moist arni souvlakia right off the skewer became his new ecstasy and the rush of cliff diving into the foamfilled ravines of mykonos became his new cocaine i am reborn andros bought a sprawling villa on the island of syros and settled in among the bella gente in the exclusive town of possidonia this new world was a community not only of wealth but of culture and physical perfection his neighbors took great pride in their bodies and minds and it was contagious the newcomer suddenly found himself jogging on the beach tanning his pale body and reading books andros read homers odyssey captivated by the images of powerful bronze men doing battle on these islands the next day he began lifting weights and was amazed to see how quickly his chest and arms grew larger gradually he began to feel womens eyes on him and the admiration was intoxicating he longed to grow stronger still and he did with the help of aggressive cycles of steroids intermixed with blackmarket growth hormones and endless hours of weight lifting andros transformed himself into something he had never imagined he could be a perfect male specimen he grew in both height and musculature developing flawless pectorals and massive sinewy legs which he kept perfectly tanned everyone was looking now as andros had been warned the heavy steroids and hormones changed not only his body but also his voice box giving him an eerie breathy whisper which made him feel more mysterious the soft enigmatic voice combined with his new body his wealth and his refusal to speak about his mysterious past served as catnip for the women who met him they gave themselves willingly and he satisfied them all from fashion models visiting his island on photo shoots to nubile american college girls on vacation to the lonely wives of his neighbors to the occasional young man they could not get enough i am a masterpiece as the years passed however andross sexual adventures began to lose their thrill as did everything the islands sumptuous cuisine lost its taste books no longer held his interest and even the dazzling sunsets from his villa looked dull how could this be he was only in his midtwenties and yet he felt old what more is there to life he had sculpted his body into a masterpiece he had educated himself and nourished his mind with culture he had made his home in paradise and he had the love of anyone he desired and yet incredibly he felt as empty as he had in that turkish prison what is it i am missing the answer had come to him several months later andros was sitting alone in his villa absently surfing channels in the middle of the night when he stumbled across a program about the secrets of freemasonry the show was poorly done posing more questions than answers and yet he found himself intrigued by the plethora of conspiracy theories surrounding the brotherhood the narrator described legend after legend freemasons and the new world order the great masonic seal of the united states the p masonic lodge the lost secret of freemasonry the masonic pyramid andros sat up startled pyramid the narrator began recounting the story of a mysterious stone pyramid whose encrypted engraving promised to lead to lost wisdom and unfathomable power the story though seemingly implausible sparked in him a distant memory a faint recollection from a much darker time andros remembered what zachary solomon had heard from his father about a mysterious pyramid could it be andros strained to recall the details when the show ended he stepped out onto the balcony letting the cool air clear his mind he remembered more now and as it all came back he began to sense there might be some truth to this legend after all and if so then zachary solomon although long dead still had something to offer what do i have to lose three weeks later his timing carefully planned andros stood in the frigid cold outside the conservatory of the solomons potomac estate through the glass he could see peter solomon chatting and laughing with his sister katherine it looks like theyve had no trouble forgetting zachary he thought before he pulled the ski mask over his face andros took a hit of cocaine his first in ages he felt the familiar rush of fearlessness he pulled out a handgun used an old key to unlock the door and stepped inside hello solomons unfortunately the night had not gone as andros had planned rather than obtaining the pyramid for which he had come he found himself riddled with bird shot and fleeing across the snowcovered lawn toward the dense woods to his surprise behind him peter solomon was giving chase pistol glinting in his hand andros dashed into the woods running down a trail along the edge of a deep ravine far below the sounds of a waterfall echoed up through the crisp winter air he passed a stand of oak trees and rounded a corner to his left seconds later he was skidding to a stop on the icy path narrowly escaping death my god only feet in front of him the path ended plunging straight down into an icy river far below the large boulder at the side of the path had been carved by the unskilled hand of a child on the far side of the ravine the path continued on so wheres the bridge the cocaine was no longer working im trapped panicking now andros turned to flee back up the path but he found himself facing peter solomon who stood breathless before him pistol in hand andros looked at the gun and took a step backward the drop behind him was at least fifty feet to an icecovered river the mist from the waterfall upstream billowed around them chilling him to the bone zachs bridge rotted out long ago solomon said panting he was the only one who ever came down this far solomon held the gun remarkably steady why did you kill my son he was nothing andros replied a drug addict i did him a favor solomon moved closer gun aimed directly at andross chest perhaps i should do you the same favor his tone was surprisingly fierce you bludgeoned my son to death how does a man do such a thing men do the unthinkable when pushed to the brink you killed my son no andros replied hotly now you killed your son what kind of man leaves his son in a prison when he has the option to get him out you killed your son not me you know nothing solomon yelled his voice filled with pain youre wrong andros thought i know everything peter solomon drew closer only five yards away now gun leveled andross chest was burning and he could tell he was bleeding badly the warmth ran down over his stomach he looked over his shoulder at the drop impossible he turned back to solomon i know more about you than you think he whispered i know you are not the kind of man who kills in cold blood solomon stepped closer taking dead aim im warning you andros said if you pull that trigger i will haunt you forever you already will and with that solomon fired as he raced his black limousine back toward kalorama heights the one who now called himself malakh reflected on the miraculous events that had delivered him from certain death atop that icy ravine he had been transformed forever the gunshot had echoed only for an instant and yet its effects had reverberated across decades his body once tanned and perfect was now marred by scars from that night scars he kept hidden beneath the tattooed symbols of his new identity i am malakh this was my destiny all along he had walked through fire been reduced to ashes and then emerged again transformed once more tonight would be the final step of his long and magnificent journey chapter the coyly nicknamed explosive key had been developed by special forces specifically for opening locked doors with minimal collateral damage consisting primarily of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine with a diethylhexyl plasticizer it was essentially a piece of c rolled into paperthin sheets for insertion into doorjambs in the case of the librarys reading room the explosive had worked perfectly operation leader agent turner simkins stepped over the wreckage of the doors and scanned the massive octagonal room for any signs of movement nothing kill the lights simkins said a second agent found the wall panel threw the switches and plunged the room into darkness in unison all four men reached up and yanked down their nightvision headgear adjusting the goggles over their eyes they stood motionless surveying the reading room which now materialized in shades of luminescent green inside their goggles the scene remained unchanged nobody made a dash for it in the dark the fugitives were probably unarmed and yet the field team entered the room with weapons raised in the darkness their firearms projected four menacing rods of laser light the men washed the beams in all directions across the floor up the far walls into the balconies probing the darkness oftentimes a mere glimpse of a lasersighted weapon in a darkened room was enough to induce instant surrender apparently not tonight still no movement agent simkins raised his hand motioning his team into the space silently the men fanned out moving cautiously up the center aisle simkins reached up and flipped a switch on his goggles activating the newest addition to the cias arsenal thermal imaging had been around for years but recent advances in miniaturization differential sensitivity and dualsource integration had facilitated a new generation of vision enhancing equipment that gave field agents eyesight that bordered on superhuman we see in the dark we see through walls and now we see back in time thermalimaging equipment had become so sensitive to heat differentials that it could detect not only a persons location but their previous locations the ability to see into the past often proved the most valuable asset of all and tonight once again it proved its worth agent simkins now spied a thermal signature at one of the reading desks the two wooden chairs luminesced in his goggles registering a reddishpurple color indicating those chairs were warmer than the other chairs in the room the desk lamps bulb glowed orange obviously the two men had been sitting at the desk but the question now was in which direction they had gone he found his answer on the central counter that surrounded the large wooden console in the middle of the room a ghostly handprint glowing crimson weapon raised simkins moved toward the octagonal cabinet training his laser sight across the surface he circled until he saw an opening in the side of the console did they really corner themselves in a cabinet the agent scanned the trim around the opening and saw another glowing handprint on it clearly someone had grabbed the doorjamb as he ducked inside the console the time for silence was over thermal signature simkins shouted pointing at the opening flanks converge his two flanks moved in from opposite sides effectively surrounding the octagonal console simkins moved toward the opening still ten feet away he could see a light source within light inside the console he shouted hoping the sound of his voice might convince mr bellamy and mr langdon to exit the cabinet with their hands up nothing happened fine well do this the other way as simkins drew closer to the opening he could hear an unexpected hum rumbling from within it sounded like machinery he paused trying to imagine what could be making such a noise in such a small space he inched closer now hearing voices over the sound of machinery then just as he arrived at the opening the lights inside went out thank you he thought adjusting his night vision advantage us standing at the threshold he peered through the opening what lay beyond was unexpected the console was less of a cabinet than a raised ceiling over a steep set of stairs that descended into a room below the agent aimed his weapon down the stairs and began descending the hum of machinery grew louder with every step what the hell is this place the room beneath the reading room was a small industriallooking space the hum he heard was indeed machinery although he was not sure whether it was running because bellamy and langdon had activated it or because it ran around the clock either way it clearly made no difference the fugitives had left their telltale heat signatures on the rooms lone exit a heavy steel door whose keypad showed four clear fingerprints glowing on the numbers around the door slivers of glowing orange shone beneath the doorjamb indicating that lights were illuminated on the other side blow the door simkins said this was their escape route it took eight seconds to insert and detonate a sheet of key when the smoke cleared the fieldteam agents found themselves peering into a strange underground world known here as the stacks the library of congress had miles and miles of bookshelves most of them underground the endless rows of shelves looked like some kind of infinity optical illusion created with mirrors a sign announced temperaturecontrolled environment keep this door closed at all times simkins pushed through the mangled doors and felt cool air beyond he couldnt help but smile could this get any easier heat signatures in controlled environments showed up like solar flares and already his goggles revealed a glowing red smear on a banister up ahead which bellamy or langdon had grabbed on to while running past you can run he whispered to himself but you cant hide as simkins and his team advanced into the maze of stacks he realized the playing field was tipped so heavily in his favor that he would not even need his goggles to track his prey under normal circumstances this maze of stacks would have been a respectable hiding place but the library of congress used motionactivated lights to save energy and the fugitives escape route was now lit up like a runway a narrow strip of illumination stretched into the distance dodging and weaving as it went all the men ripped off their goggles surging ahead on welltrained legs the field team followed the trail of lights zigging and zagging through a seemingly endless labyrinth of books soon simkins began seeing lights flickering on in the darkness up ahead were gaining he pushed harder faster until he heard footsteps and labored breathing ahead then he saw a target ive got visual he yelled the lanky form of warren bellamy was apparently bringing up the rear the primly dressed african american staggered through the stacks obviously out of breath its no use old man stop right there mr bellamy simkins yelled bellamy kept running turning sharp corners weaving through the rows of books at every turn the lights kept coming on over his head as the team drew within twenty yards they shouted again to stop but bellamy ran on take him down simkins commanded the agent carrying the teams nonlethal rifle raised it and fired the projectile that launched down the aisle and wrapped itself around bellamys legs was nicknamed silly string but there was nothing silly about it a military technology invented at sandia national laboratories this nonlethal incapacitant was a thread of gooey polyurethane that turned rock hard on contact creating a rigid web of plastic across the back of the fugitives knees the effect on a running target was that of jamming a stick into the spokes of a moving bike the mans legs seized midstride and he pitched forward crashing to the floor bellamy slid another ten feet down a darkened aisle before coming to a stop the lights above him flickering unceremoniously to life ill deal with bellamy simkins shouted you keep going after langdon he must be up ahead some the team leader stopped now seeing that the library stacks ahead of bellamy were all pitchblack obviously there was no one else running in front of bellamy hes alone bellamy was still on his chest breathing heavily his legs and ankles all tangled with hardened plastic the agent walked over and used his foot to roll the old man over onto his back where is he the agent demanded bellamys lip was bleeding from the fall where is who agent simkins lifted his foot and placed his boot squarely on bellamys pristine silk tie then he leaned in applying some pressure believe me mr bellamy you do not want to play this game with me chapter robert langdon felt like a corpse he lay supine hands folded on his chest in total darkness trapped in the most confined of spaces although katherine lay nearby in a similar position near his head langdon could not see her he had his eyes closed to prevent himself from catching even a fleeting glimpse of his frightening predicament the space around him was small very small sixty seconds ago with the double doors of the reading room crashing down he and katherine had followed bellamy into the octagonal console down a steep set of stairs and into the unexpected space below langdon had realized at once where they were the heart of the librarys circulation system resembling a small airport baggage distribution center the circulation room had numerous conveyor belts that angled off in different directions because the library of congress was housed in three separate buildings books requested in the reading room often had to be transported great distances by a system of conveyors through a web of underground tunnels bellamy immediately crossed the room to a steel door where he inserted his key card typed a sequence of buttons and pushed open the door the space beyond was dark but as the door opened a span of motionsensor lights flickered to life when langdon saw what lay beyond he realized he was looking at something few people ever saw the library of congress stacks he felt encouraged by bellamys plan what better place to hide than in a giant labyrinth bellamy did not guide them into the stacks however instead he propped the door open with a book and turned back to face them i had hoped to be able to explain a lot more to you but we have no time he gave langdon his key card youll need this youre not coming with us langdon asked bellamy shook his head youll never make it unless we split up the most important thing is to keep that pyramid and capstone in safe hands langdon saw no other way out except the stairs back up to the reading room and where are you going ill coax them into the stacks away from you bellamy said its all i can do to help you escape before langdon could ask where he and katherine were supposed to go bellamy was heaving a large crate of books off one of the conveyors lie on the belt bellamy said keep your hands in langdon stared you cannot be serious the conveyor belt extended a short distance then disappeared into a dark hole in the wall the opening looked large enough to permit passage of a crate of books but not much more langdon glanced back longingly at the stacks forget it bellamy said the motionsensor lights will make it impossible to hide thermal signature a voice upstairs shouted flanks converge katherine apparently had heard all she needed to hear she climbed onto the conveyor belt with her head only a few feet from the opening in the wall she crossed her hands over her chest like a mummy in a sarcophagus langdon stood frozen robert bellamy urged if you wont do this for me do it for peter the voices upstairs sounded closer now as if in a dream langdon moved to the conveyor he slung his daybag onto the belt and then climbed on placing his head at katherines feet the hard rubber conveyor felt cold against his back he stared at the ceiling and felt like a hospital patient preparing for insertion headfirst into an mri machine keep your phone on bellamy said someone will call soon and offer help trust him someone will call langdon knew that bellamy had been trying to reach someone with no luck and had left a message earlier and only moments ago as they hurried down the spiral staircase bellamy had tried one last time and gotten through speaking very briefly in hushed tones and then hanging up follow the conveyor to the end bellamy said and jump off quickly before you circle back use my key card to get out get out of where langdon demanded but bellamy was already pulling levers all the different conveyors in the room hummed to life langdon felt himself jolt into motion and the ceiling began moving overhead god save me as langdon approached the opening in the wall he looked back and saw warren bellamy race through the doorway into the stacks closing the door behind him an instant later langdon slid into the darkness swallowed up by the library just as a glowing red laser dot came dancing down the stairs chapter the underpaid female security guard from preferred security doublechecked the kalorama heights address on her call sheet this is it the gated driveway before her belonged to one of the neighborhoods largest and quietest estates and so it seemed odd that had just received an urgent call about it as usual with unconfirmed callins had contacted the local alarm company before bothering the police the guard often thought the alarm companys motto your first line of defensecould just as easily have been false alarms pranks lost pets and complaints from wacky neighbors tonight as usual the guard had arrived with no details about the specific concern above my pay grade her job was simply to show up with her yellow bubble light spinning assess the property and report anything unusual normally something innocuous had tripped the house alarm and she would use her override keys to reset it this house however was silent no alarm from the road everything looked dark and peaceful the guard buzzed the intercom at the gate but got no answer she typed her override code to open the gate and pulled into the driveway leaving her engine running and her bubble light spinning she walked up to the front door and rang the bell no answer she saw no lights and no movement reluctantly following procedure she flicked on her flashlight to begin her trek around the house to check the doors and windows for signs of breakin as she rounded the corner a black stretch limousine drove past the house slowing for a moment before continuing on rubbernecking neighbors bit by bit she made her way around the house but saw nothing out of place the house was bigger than she had imagined and by the time she reached the backyard she was shivering from the cold obviously there was nobody home dispatch she called in on her radio im on the kalorama heights call owners arent home no signs of trouble finished the perimeter check no indication of an intruder false alarm roger that the dispatcher replied have a good night the guard put her radio back on her belt and began retracing her steps eager to get back to the warmth of her vehicle as she did so however she spotted something she had missed earlier a tiny speck of bluish light on the back of the house puzzled she walked over to it now seeing the source a low transom window apparently to the homes basement the glass of the window had been blacked out coated on the inside with an opaque paint some kind of darkroom maybe the bluish glow she had seen was emanating through a tiny spot on the window where the black paint had started to peel she crouched down trying to peer through but she couldnt see much through the tiny opening she tapped on the glass wondering if maybe someone was working down there hello she shouted there was no answer but as she knocked on the window the paint chip suddenly detached and fell off affording her a more complete view she leaned in nearly pressing her face to the window as she scanned the basement instantly she wished she hadnt what in the name of god transfixed she remained crouched there for a moment staring in abject horror at the scene before her finally trembling the guard groped for the radio on her belt she never found it a sizzling pair of taser prongs slammed into the back of her neck and a searing pain shot through her body her muscles seized and she pitched forward unable even to close her eyes before her face hit the cold ground chapter tonight was not the first time warren bellamy had been blindfolded like all of his masonic brothers he had worn the ritual hoodwink during his ascent to the upper echelons of masonry that however had taken place among trusted friends tonight was different these roughhanded men had bound him placed a bag on his head and were now marching him through the library stacks the agents had physically threatened bellamy and demanded to know the whereabouts of robert langdon knowing his aging body couldnt take much punishment bellamy had told his lie quickly langdon never came down here with me he had said gasping for air i told him to go up to the balcony and hide behind the moses statue but i dont know where he is now the story apparently had been convincing because two of the agents had run off in pursuit now the remaining two agents were marching him in silence through the stacks bellamys only solace was in knowing langdon and katherine were whisking the pyramid off to safety soon langdon would be contacted by a man who could offer sanctuary trust him the man bellamy had called knew a great deal about the masonic pyramid and the secret it held the location of a hidden spiral staircase that led down into the earth to the hiding place of potent ancient wisdom buried long ago bellamy had finally gotten through to the man as they were escaping the reading room and he felt confident that his short message would be understood perfectly now as he moved in total darkness bellamy pictured the stone pyramid and golden capstone in langdons bag it has been many years since those two pieces were in the same room bellamy would never forget that painful night the first of many for peter bellamy had been asked to come to the solomon estate in potomac for zachary solomons eighteenth birthday zachary despite being a rebellious child was a solomon which meant tonight following family tradition he would receive his inheritance bellamy was one of peters dearest friends and a trusted masonic brother and therefore was asked to attend as a witness but it was not only the transference of money that bellamy had been asked to witness there was far more than money at stake tonight bellamy had arrived early and waited as requested in peters private study the wonderful old room smelled of leather wood fires and looseleaf tea warren was seated when peter led his son zachary into the room when the scrawny eighteenyearold saw bellamy he frowned what are you doing here bearing witness bellamy offered happy birthday zachary the boy mumbled and looked away sit down zach peter said zachary sat in the solitary chair facing his fathers huge wooden desk solomon bolted the study door bellamy took a seat off to one side solomon addressed zachary in a serious tone do you know why youre here i think so zachary said solomon sighed deeply i know you and i have not seen eye to eye for quite some time zach ive done my best to be a good father and to prepare you for this moment zachary said nothing as you know every solomon child upon reaching adulthood is presented with his or her birthright a share of the solomon fortune which is intended to be a seed a seed for you to nurture make grow and use to help nourish mankind solomon walked to a vault in the wall unlocked it and removed a large black folder son this portfolio contains everything you need to legally transfer your financial inheritance into your own name he laid it on the desk the aim is that you use this money to build a life of productivity prosperity and philanthropy zachary reached for the folder thanks hold on his father said putting his hand on the portfolio theres something else i need to explain zachary shot his father a contemptuous look and slumped back down there are aspects of the solomon inheritance of which you are not yet aware his father was staring straight into zacharys eyes now you are my firstborn zachary which means you are entitled to a choice the teenager sat up looking intrigued it is a choice that may well determine the direction of your future and so i urge you to ponder it carefully what choice his father took a deep breath it is the choice between wealth or wisdom zachary gave him a blank stare wealth or wisdom i dont get it solomon stood walking again to the vault where he pulled out a heavy stone pyramid with masonic symbols carved into it peter heaved the stone onto the desk beside the portfolio this pyramid was created long ago and has been entrusted to our family for generations a pyramid zachary didnt look very excited son this pyramid is a map a map that reveals the location of one of humankinds greatest lost treasures this map was created so that the treasure could one day be rediscovered peters voice swelled now with pride and tonight following tradition i am able to offer it to you under certain conditions zachary eyed the pyramid suspiciously whats the treasure bellamy could tell that this coarse question was not what peter had hoped for nonetheless his demeanor remained steady zachary its hard to explain without a lot of background but this treasure in essence is something we call the ancient mysteries zachary laughed apparently thinking his father was joking bellamy could see the melancholy growing now in peters eyes this is very difficult for me to describe zach traditionally by the time a solomon is eighteen years of age he is about to embark on his years of higher education in i told you zachary fired back im not interested in college i dont mean college his father said his voice still calm and quiet im talking about the brotherhood of freemasonry im talking about an education in the enduring mysteries of human science if you had plans to join me within their ranks you would be on the verge of receiving the education necessary to understand the importance of your decision tonight zachary rolled his eyes spare me the masonic lecture again i know im the first solomon who doesnt want to join but so what dont you get it i have no interest in playing dressup with a bunch of old men his father was silent for a long time and bellamy noticed the fine age lines that had started to appear around peters stillyouthful eyes yes i get it peter finally said times are different now i understand that masonry probably appears strange to you or maybe even boring but i want you to know that doorway will always be open for you should you change your mind dont hold your breath zach grumbled thats enough peter snapped standing up i realize life has been a struggle for you zachary but i am not your only guidepost there are good men waiting for you men who will welcome you within the masonic fold and show you your true potential zachary chuckled and glanced over at bellamy is that why youre here mr bellamy so you masons can gang up on me bellamy said nothing instead directing a respectful gaze back at peter solomon a reminder to zachary of who held the power in this room zachary turned back to his father zach peter said were getting nowhere so let me just tell you this whether or not you comprehend the responsibility being offered to you tonight it is my family obligation to present it he motioned to the pyramid it is a rare privilege to guard this pyramid i urge you to consider this opportunity for a few days before making your decision opportunity zachary said babysitting a rock there are great mysteries in this world zach peter said with a sigh secrets that transcend your wildest imagination this pyramid protects those secrets and even more important there will come a time probably within your lifetime when this pyramid will at last be deciphered and its secrets unearthed it will be a moment of great human transformation and you have a chance to play a role in that moment i want you to consider it very carefully wealth is commonplace but wisdom is rare he motioned to the portfolio and then to the pyramid i beg you to remember that wealth without wisdom can often end in disaster zachary looked like he thought his father was insane whatever you say dad but theres no way im giving up my inheritance for this he gestured to the pyramid peter folded his hands before him if you choose to accept the responsibility i will hold your money and the pyramid for you until you have successfully completed your education within the masons this will take years but you will emerge with the maturity to receive both your money and this pyramid wealth and wisdom a potent combination zachary shot up jesus dad you dont give up do you cant you see that i dont give a damn about the masons or stone pyramids and ancient mysteries he reached down and scooped up the black portfolio waving it in front of his fathers face this is my birthright the same birthright of the solomons who came before me i cant believe youd try to trick me out of my inheritance with lame stories about ancient treasure maps he tucked the portfolio under his arm and marched past bellamy to the studys patio door zachary wait his father rushed after him as zachary stalked out into the night whatever you do you can never speak of the pyramid you have seen peter solomons voice cracked not to anyone ever but zachary ignored him disappearing into the night peter solomons gray eyes were filled with pain as he returned to his desk and sat heavily in his leather chair after a long silence he looked up at bellamy and forced a sad smile that went well bellamy sighed sharing in solomons pain peter i dont mean to sound insensitive but do you trust him solomon stared blankly into space i mean bellamy pressed not to say anything about the pyramid solomons face was blank i really dont know what to say warren im not sure i even know him anymore bellamy rose and walked slowly back and forth before the large desk peter you have followed your family duty but now considering what just happened i think we need to take precautions i should return the capstone to you so you can find a new home for it someone else should watch over it why solomon asked if zachary tells anyone about the pyramid and mentions my being present tonight he knows nothing of the capstone and hes too immature to know the pyramid has any significance we dont need a new home for it ill keep the pyramid in my vault and you will keep the capstone wherever you keep it as we always have it was six years later on christmas day with the family still healing from zacharys death that the enormous man claiming to have killed him in prison broke into the solomon estate the intruder had come for the pyramid but he had taken with him only isabel solomons life days later peter summoned bellamy to his office he locked the door and took the pyramid out of his vault setting it on the desk between them i should have listened to you bellamy knew peter was racked with guilt over this it wouldnt have mattered solomon drew a tired breath did you bring the capstone bellamy pulled a small cubeshaped package from his pocket the faded brown paper was tied with twine and bore a wax seal of solomons ring bellamy laid the package on the desk knowing the two halves of the masonic pyramid were closer together tonight than they should be find someone else to watch this dont tell me who it is solomon nodded and i know where you can hide the pyramid bellamy said he told solomon about the capitol building subbasement theres no place in washington more secure bellamy recalled solomon liking the idea right away because it felt symbolically apt to hide the pyramid in the symbolic heart of our nation typical solomon bellamy had thought the idealist even in a crisis now ten years later as bellamy was being shoved blindly through the library of congress he knew the crisis tonight was far from over he also now knew whom solomon had chosen to guard the capstone and he prayed to god that robert langdon was up to the job chapter im undersecond street langdons eyes remained tightly shut as the conveyor rumbled through the darkness toward the adams building he did his best not to picture the tons of earth overhead and the narrow tube through which he was now traveling he could hear katherine breathing several yards ahead of him but so far she had not uttered a word shes in shock langdon was not looking forward to telling her about her brothers severed hand you have to robert she needs to know katherine langdon finally said without opening his eyes are you okay a tremulous disembodied voice replied somewhere up ahead robert the pyramid youre carrying its peters isnt it yes langdon replied a long silence followed i think that pyramid is why my mother was murdered langdon was well aware that isabel solomon had been murdered ten years ago but he didnt know the details and peter had never mentioned anything about a pyramid what are you talking about katherines voice filled with emotion as she recounted the harrowing events of that night how the tattooed man had broken into their estate it was a long time ago but ill never forget that he demanded a pyramid he said he heard about the pyramid in prison from my nephew zachary right before he killed him langdon listened in amazement the tragedy within the solomon family was almost beyond belief katherine continued telling langdon that she had always believed the intruder was killed that night that is until this same man had resurfaced today posing as peters psychiatrist and luring katherine to his home he knew private things about my brother my mothers death and even my work she said anxiously things he could only have learned from my brother and so i trusted him and thats how he got inside the smithsonian museum support center katherine took a deep breath and told langdon she was nearly certain the man had destroyed her lab tonight langdon listened in utter shock for several moments the two of them lay together in silence on the moving conveyor langdon knew he had an obligation to share with katherine the rest of tonights terrible news he began slowly and as gently as he possibly could he told her how her brother had entrusted him with a small package years earlier how langdon had been tricked into bringing this package to washington tonight and finally about her brothers hand having been found in the rotunda of the capitol building katherines reaction was deafening silence langdon could tell she was reeling and he wished he could reach out and comfort her but lying end to end in the narrow blackness made it impossible peters okay he whispered hes alive and well get him back langdon tried to give her hope katherine his captor promised me your brother would be returned alive as long as i decipher the pyramid for him still katherine said nothing langdon kept talking he told her about the stone pyramid its masonic cipher the sealed capstone and of course about bellamys claims that this pyramid was in fact the masonic pyramid of legend a map that revealed the hiding place of a long spiral staircase that led deep into the earth down hundreds of feet to a mystical ancient treasure that had been buried in washington long ago katherine finally spoke but her voice was flat and emotionless robert open your eyes open my eyes langdon had no desire to have even the slightest glimpse of how cramped this space really was robert katherine demanded urgently now open your eyes were here langdons eyes flew open as his body emerged through an opening similar to the one it had entered at the other end katherine was already climbing off the conveyor belt she lifted his daybag off the belt as langdon swung his legs over the edge and jumped down onto the tile floor just in time before the conveyor turned the corner and headed back the way it came the space around them was a circulation room much like the one they had come from in the other building a small sign read adams building circulation room langdon felt like he had just emerged from some kind of subterranean birth canal born again he turned immediately to katherine are you okay her eyes were red and she had obviously been crying but she nodded with a resolute stoicism she picked up langdons daybag and carried it across the room without a word setting it on a cluttered desk she lit the desks halogen clamp lamp unzipped the bag folded down the sides and peered inside the granite pyramid looked almost austere in the clean halogen light katherine ran her fingers over the engraved masonic cipher and langdon sensed deep emotion churning within her slowly she reached into the daybag and pulled out the cubeshaped package she held it under the light examining it closely as you can see langdon quietly said the wax seal is embossed with peters masonic ring he said this ring was used to seal the package more than a century ago katherine said nothing when your brother entrusted the package to me langdon told her he said it would give me the power to create order out of chaos im not entirely sure what that means but ive got to assume the capstone reveals something important because peter was insistent that it not fall into the wrong hands mr bellamy just told me the same thing urging me to hide the pyramid and not let anyone open the package katherine turned now looking angry bellamy told you not to open the package yes he was adamant katherine looked incredulous but you said this capstone is the only way we can decipher the pyramid right probably yes katherines voice was rising now and you said deciphering the pyramid is what you were told to do its the only way we can get peter back right langdon nodded then robert why wouldnt we open the package and decipher this thing right now langdon didnt know how to respond katherine i had the same exact reaction and yet bellamy told me that keeping this pyramids secret intact was more important than anything including your brothers life katherines pretty features hardened and she tucked a wisp of hair behind her ears when she spoke her voice was resolved this stone pyramid whatever it is has cost me my entire family first my nephew zachary then my mother and now my brotherand lets face it robert if you hadnt called tonight to warn me langdon could feel himself trapped between katherines logic and bellamys steadfast urging i may be a scientist she said but i also come from a family of wellknown masons believe me ive heard all the stories about the masonic pyramid and its promise of some great treasure that will enlighten mankind honestly i find it hard to imagine such a thing exists however if it does exist perhaps its time to unveil it katherine slid a finger beneath the old twine on the package langdon jumped katherine no wait she paused but her finger remained beneath the string robert im not going to let my brother die for this whatever this capstone says whatever lost treasures this engraving might reveal those secrets end tonight with that katherine yanked defiantly on the twine and the brittle wax seal exploded chapter in a quiet neighborhood just west of embassy row in washington there exists a medievalstyle walled garden whose roses it is said spring from twelfthcentury plants the gardens carderock gazebo known as shadow house sits elegantly amid meandering pathways of stones dug from george washingtons private quarry tonight the silence of the gardens was broken by a young man who rushed through the wooden gate shouting as he came hello he called out straining to see in the moonlight are you in here the voice that replied was frail barely audible in the gazebo just taking some air the young man found his withered superior seated on the stone bench beneath a blanket the hunched old man was tiny with elfin features the years had bent him in two and stolen his eyesight but his soul remained a force to be reckoned with catching his breath the young man told him i just took a call from your friend warren bellamy oh the old man perked up about what he didnt say but he sounded like he was in a big hurry he told me he left you a message on your voice mail which you need to listen to right away thats all he said not quite the young man paused he told me to ask you a question a very strange question he said he needed your response right away the old man leaned closer what question as the young man spoke mr bellamys question the pall that crossed the old mans face was visible even in the moonlight immediately he threw off his blanket and began struggling to his feet please help me inside right away chapter no more secrets thought katherine solomon on the table in front of her the wax seal that had been intact for generations now lay in pieces she finished removing the faded brown paper from her brothers precious package beside her langdon looked decidedly uneasy from within the paper katherine extracted a small box made of gray stone resembling a polished granite cube the box had no hinges no latch and no apparent way inside it reminded katherine of a chinese puzzle box it looks like a solid block she said running her fingers over the edges are you sure the xray showed it was hollow with a capstone inside it did langdon said moving next to katherine and scrutinizing the mysterious box he and katherine peered at the box from different angles attempting to find a way in got it katherine said as her fingernail located the hidden slit along one of the boxs top edges she set the box down on the desk and then carefully pried open the lid which rose smoothly like the top of a fine jewelry box when the lid fell back langdon and katherine both drew audible breaths the interior of the box seemed to be glowing the inside was shining with an almost supernatural effulgence katherine had never seen a piece of gold this large and it took her an instant to realize that the precious metal was simply reflecting the radiance of the desk lamp its spectacular she whispered despite being sealed in a dark stone cube for over a century the capstone had not faded or tarnished in any way gold resists the entropic laws of decay thats one of the reasons the ancients considered it magical katherine felt her pulse quicken as she leaned forward peering down over the small golden point theres an inscription langdon moved closer their shoulders now touching his blue eyes flashed with curiosity he had told katherine about the ancient greek practice of creating a symbolon a code broken into parts and how this capstone long separated from the pyramid itself would hold the key to deciphering the pyramid allegedly this inscription whatever it said would bring order from this chaos katherine held the little box up to the light and peered straight down over the capstone though small the inscription was perfectly visible a small bit of elegantly engraved text on the face of one side katherine read the six simple words then she read them again no she declared that cant be what it says across the street director sato hurried up the long walkway outside the capitol building toward her rendezvous point on first street the update from her field team had been unacceptable no langdon no pyramid no capstone bellamy was in custody but he was not telling them the truth at least not yet ill make him talk she glanced back over her shoulder at one of washingtons newest vistas the capitol dome framed above the new visitor center the illuminated dome only accentuated the significance of what was truly at stake tonight dangerous times sato was relieved to hear her cell phone ring and see her analysts id on the screen nola sato answered what have you got nola kaye gave her the bad news the xray of the capstones inscription was too faint to read and the imageenhancing filters had not helped shit sato chewed at her lip how about the sixteenletter grid im still trying nola said but so far ive found no secondary encryption scheme thats applicable ive got a computer reshuffling the letters in the grid and looking for anything identifiable but there are over twenty trillion possibilities stay on it let me know sato hung up scowling her hopes of deciphering the pyramid using only a photograph and xray were fading fast i need that pyramid and capstone and im running out of time sato arrived at first street just as a black escalade suv with dark windows roared across the double yellow and skidded to a stop in front of her at their rendezvous point a lone agent got out any word yet on langdon sato demanded confidence is high the man said emotionless backup just arrived all library exits are surrounded we even have air support coming in well flush him with tear gas and hell have nowhere to run and bellamy tied up in the backseat good her shoulder was still smarting the agent handed sato a plastic ziploc bag containing cell phone keys and wallet bellamys effects nothing else no maam the pyramid and package must still be with langdon okay sato said bellamy knows plenty hes not telling id like to question him personally yes maam to langley then sato took a deep breath and paced a moment beside the suv strict protocols governed the interrogation of us civilians and questioning bellamy was highly illegal unless it was done at langley on video with witnesses attorneys blah blah blah not langley she said trying to think of somewhere closer and more private the agent said nothing standing at attention beside the idling suv waiting for orders sato lit a cigarette took a long drag and gazed down at the ziploc bag of bellamys items his key ring she had noticed included an electronic fob adorned with four letters usbg sato knew of course which government building this fob accessed the building was very close and at this hour very private she smiled and pocketed the fob perfect when she told the agent where she wanted to take bellamy she expected the man to look surprised but he simply nodded and opened the passenger door for her his cold stare revealing nothing sato loved professionals langdon stood in the basement of the adams building and stared in disbelief at the elegantly inscribed words on the face of the golden capstone thats all it says beside him katherine held the capstone under the light and shook her head theres got to be more she insisted sounding cheated this is what my brother has been protecting all these years langdon had to admit he was mystified according to peter and bellamy this capstone was supposed to help them decipher the stone pyramid in light of those claims langdon had expected something illuminating and helpful more like obvious and useless once again he read the six words delicately inscribed on the face of the capstone the secret hides within the order the secret hides within the order at first glance the inscription appeared to be stating the obvious that the letters on the pyramid were out of order and that their secret lay in finding their proper sequence this reading however in addition to being selfevident seemed unlikely for another reason the words the and order are capitalized langdon said katherine nodded blankly i saw that the secret hides within the order langdon could think of only one logical implication the order must be referencing the masonic order i agree katherine said but its still no help it tells us nothing langdon had to concur after all the entire story of the masonic pyramid revolved around a secret hidden within the masonic order robert didnt my brother tell you this capstone would give you power to see order where others saw only chaos he nodded in frustration for the second time tonight robert langdon was feeling unworthy chapter once malakh had finished dealing with his unexpected visitor a female security guard from preferred security he fixed the paint on the window through which she had glimpsed his sacred work space now ascending out of the soft blue haze of the basement he emerged through a hidden doorway into his living room inside he paused admiring his spectacular painting of the three graces and savoring the familiar smells and sounds of his home soon i will be leaving forever malakh knew that after tonight he would be unable to return to this place after tonight he thought smiling i will have no need for this place he wondered if robert langdon yet understood the true power of the pyramid or the importance of the role for which fate had chosen him langdon has yet to call me malakh thought after doublechecking for messages on his disposable phone it was now pm he has less than two hours malakh went upstairs to his italianmarble bathroom and turned on the steam shower to let it heat up methodically he stripped off his clothes eager to begin his cleansing ritual he drank two glasses of water to calm his starving stomach then he walked to the fulllength mirror and studied his naked body his two days of fasting had accentuated his musculature and he could not help but admire that which he had become by dawn i will be so much more chapter we should get out of here langdon said to katherine its only a matter of time before they figure out where we are he hoped bellamy had managed to escape katherine still seemed fixated on the gold capstone looking incredulous that the inscription was so unhelpful she had taken the capstone out of the box examined every side and was now carefully putting it back in the box the secret hides within the order langdon thought big help langdon found himself wondering now if perhaps peter had been misinformed about the contents of the box this pyramid and capstone had been created long before peter was born and peter was simply doing as his forefathers had told him keeping a secret that was probably as much a mystery to him as it was to langdon and katherine what did i expect langdon wondered the more he learned tonight about the legend of the masonic pyramid the less plausible it all seemed im searching for a hidden spiral staircase covered by a huge stone something told langdon he was chasing shadows nonetheless deciphering this pyramid seemed his best chance at saving peter robert does the year mean anything to you fifteenfourteen the question seemed apropos of nothing langdon shrugged no why katherine handed him the stone box look the box is dated have a look under the light langdon took a seat at the desk and studied the cubeshaped box beneath the light katherine put a soft hand on his shoulder leaning in to point out the tiny text she had found carved on the exterior of the box near the bottom corner of one side fifteenfourteen ad she said pointing into the box sure enough the carving depicted the number followed by an unusual stylization of the letters a and d this date katherine was saying sounding suddenly hopeful maybe its the link were missing this dated cube looks a lot like a masonic cornerstone so maybe its pointing to a real cornerstone maybe to a building built in ad langdon barely heard her fifteenfourteen ad is not a date the symbol as any scholar of medieval art would recognize was a wellknown symbature a symbol used in place of a signature many of the early philosophers artists and authors signed their work with their own unique symbol or monogram rather than their name this practice added a mysterious allure to their work and also protected them from persecution should their writings or artwork be deemed counterestablishment in the case of this symbature the letters ad did not stand for anno domini they were german for something else entirely langdon instantly saw all the pieces fall into place within seconds he was certain he knew exactly how to decipher the pyramid katherine you did it he said packing up thats all we needed lets go ill explain on the way katherine looked amazed the date ad actually means something to you langdon winked at her and headed for the door ad isnt a date katherine its a person chapter west of embassy row all was silent again inside the walled garden with its twelfthcentury roses and shadow house gazebo on the other side of an entry road the young man was helping his hunched superior walk across an expansive lawn hes letting me guide him normally the blind old man refused help preferring to navigate by memory alone while on the grounds of his sanctuary tonight however he was apparently in a hurry to get inside and return warren bellamys phone call thank you the old man said as they entered the building that held his private study i can find my way from here sir i would be happy to stay and help thats all for tonight he said letting go of his helpers arm and shuffling hurriedly off into the darkness good night the young man exited the building and walked back across the great lawn to his modest dwelling on the grounds by the time he entered his flat he could feel his curiosity gnawing at him the old man clearly had been upset by the question posed by mr bellamy and yet the question had seemed strange almost meaningless is there no help for the widows son in his wildest imagination he could not guess what this could mean puzzled he went to his computer and typed in a search for this precise phrase to his great surprise page after page of references appeared all citing this exact question he read the information in wonderment it seemed warren bellamy was not the first person in history to ask this strange question these same words had been uttered centuries ago by king solomon as he mourned a murdered friend the question was allegedly still spoken today by masons who used it as a kind of encoded cry for help warren bellamy it seemed was sending a distress call to a fellow mason chapter albrecht dьrer katherine was trying to put the pieces together as she hurried with langdon through the basement of the adams building ad stands for albrecht dьrer the famous sixteenthcentury german engraver and painter was one of her brothers favorite artists and katherine was vaguely familiar with his work even so she could not imagine how dьrer would be any help to them in this case for one thing hes been dead more than four hundred years dьrer is symbolically perfect langdon was saying as they followed the trail of illuminated exit signs he was the ultimate renaissance mind artist philosopher alchemist and a lifelong student of the ancient mysteries to this day nobody fully understands the messages hidden in dьrers art that may be true she said but how does albrecht dьrer explain how to decipher the pyramid they reached a locked door and langdon used bellamys key card to get through the number langdon said as they hurried up the stairs is pointing us to a very specific piece of dьrers work they came into a huge corridor langdon glanced around and then pointed left this way they moved quickly again albrecht dьrer actually hid the number in his most mysterious piece of art melencolia i which he completed in the year its considered the seminal work of the northern european renaissance peter had once shown katherine melencolia i in an old book on ancient mysticism but she didnt recall any hidden number as you may know langdon said sounding excited melencolia i depicts mankinds struggle to comprehend the ancient mysteries the symbolism in melencolia i is so complex it makes leonardo da vinci look overt katherine stopped abruptly and looked at langdon robert melencolia i is here in washington it hangs in the national gallery yes he said with a smile and something tells me thats not a coincidence the gallery is closed at this hour but i know the curator and forget it robert i know what happens when you go to museums katherine headed off into a nearby alcove where she saw a desk with a computer langdon followed looking unhappy lets do this the easier way it seemed professor langdon the art connoisseur was having an ethical dilemma about using the internet when an original was so nearby katherine stepped behind the desk and powered up the computer when the machine finally came to life she realized she had another problem theres no icon for a browser its an internal library network langdon pointed to an icon on the desktop try that katherine clicked on the icon marked digital collections the computer accessed a new screen and langdon pointed again katherine clicked on his choice of icon fine prints collection the screen refreshed fine prints search type in albrecht dьrer katherine entered the name and then clicked the search key within seconds the screen began displaying a series of thumbnail images all of the images looked to be similar in style intricate blackandwhite engravings dьrer had apparently done dozens of similar engravings katherine scanned the alphabetical list of his artwork adam and eve betrayal of christ four horsemen of the apocalypse great passion last supper seeing all the biblical titles katherine recalled that dьrer practiced something called mystic christianity a fusion of early christianity alchemy astrology and science science the image of her lab in flames rushed through her mind she could barely process the longterm ramifications but for the moment her thoughts turned to her assistant trish i hope she made it out langdon was saying something about dьrers version of the last supper but katherine was barely listening she had just seen the link for melencolia i she clicked the mouse and the page refreshed with general information melencolia i albrecht dьrer engraving on laid paper rosenwald collection national gallery of art washington dc when she scrolled down a highres digital image of dьrers masterpiece appeared in all its glory katherine stared in bewilderment having forgotten just how strange it was langdon gave an understanding chuckle as i said its cryptic melencolia i consisted of a brooding figure with giant wings seated in front of a stone building surrounded by the most disparate and bizarre collection of objects imaginable measuring scales an emaciated dog carpenters tools an hourglass various geometric solids a hanging bell a putto a blade a ladder katherine vaguely recalled her brother telling her that the winged figure was a representation of human geniusa great thinker with chin in hand looking depressed still unable to achieve enlightenment the genius is surrounded with all of the symbols of his human intellect objects of science math philosophy nature geometry even carpentry and yet is still unable to climb the ladder to true enlightenment even the human genius has difficulty comprehending the ancient mysteries symbolically langdon said this represents mankinds failed attempt to transform human intellect into god like power in alchemical terms it represents our inability to turn lead into gold not a particularly encouraging message katherine agreed so how does it help us she did not see the hidden number that langdon was talking about order from chaos langdon said flashing a lopsided grin just as your brother promised he reached in his pocket and pulled out the grid of letters he had written earlier from the masonic cipher right now this grid is meaningless he spread the paper out on the desk katherine eyed the grid definitely meaningless but dьrer will transform it and how might he do that linguistic alchemy langdon motioned to the computer screen look carefully hidden in this masterpiece is something that will make sense of our sixteen letters he waited do you see it yet look for the number katherine was in no mood to play classroom robert i see nothing an orb a ladder a knife a polyhedron a scale i give up look there in the background carved into that building behind the angel beneath the bell dьrer engraved a square that is full of numbers katherine now saw the square that contained numbers among them katherine that square is the key to deciphering the pyramid she shot him a surprised look thats not just any square langdon said grinning that ms solomon is a magic square chapter where thehell are they taking me bellamy was still blindfolded in the back of an suv after a short stop somewhere close to the library of congress the vehicle had continued on but only for a minute now the suv had stopped again having again traveled only about a block bellamy heard muffled voices talking sorry impossible an authoritative voice was saying closed at this hour the man driving the suv replied with equal authority cia investigation national security apparently the exchange of words and ids was persuasive because the tone shifted immediately yes of course service entrance there was the loud grinding of what sounded like a garage door and as it opened the voice added shall i accompany you once youre inside you wont be able to get through no we have access already if the guard was surprised it was too late the suv was moving again it advanced about fifty yards and then came to a stop the heavy door rumbled closed again behind them silence bellamy realized he was trembling with a bang the suvs rear hatch flew open bellamy felt a sharp pain in his shoulders as someone dragged him out by his arms then lifted him to his feet without a word a powerful force led him across a wide expanse of pavement there was a strange earthy smell here that he could not place there were footsteps of someone else walking with them but whoever it was had yet to speak they stopped at a door and bellamy heard an electronic ping the door clicked open bellamy was manhandled through several corridors and could not help but notice that the air was warmer and more humid an indoor pool maybe no the smell in the air was not chlorine it was far more earthy and primal where the hell are we bellamy knew he could not be more than a block or two from the capitol building again they stopped and again he heard the electronic beep of a security door this one slid open with a hiss as they pushed him through the smell that hit him was unmistakable bellamy now realized where they were my god he came here often although never through the service entrance this magnificent glass building was only three hundred yards from the capitol building and was technically part of the capitol complex i run this place bellamy now realized it was his own key fob that was giving them access powerful arms pushed him through the doorway leading him down a familiar winding walkway the heavy damp warmth of this place usually felt comforting to him tonight he was sweating what are we doing here bellamy was halted suddenly and seated on a bench the man with the muscles unhooked his handcuffs only long enough to reaffix them to the bench behind his back what do you want from me bellamy demanded heart pounding wildly the only response he received was the sound of boots walking off and the glass door sliding shut then silence dead silence theyre just going to leave me here bellamy was sweating more heavily now as he struggled to release his hands i cant even take off my blindfold help he shouted anybody even as he called out in panic bellamy knew nobody was going to hear him this massive glass room known as the jungle was entirely airtight when the doors were closed they left me in the jungle he thought nobody will find me until morning then he heard it the sound was barely audible but it terrified bellamy like no sound he had ever heard in his life something breathing very close he was not alone on the bench the sudden hiss of a sulfur match sizzled so close to his face that he could feel the heat bellamy recoiled instinctively yanking hard at his chains then without warning a hand was on his face removing his blindfold the flame before him reflected in the black eyes of inoue sato as she pressed the match against the cigarette dangling from her lips only inches away from bellamys face she glared at him in the moonlight that filtered down through the glass ceiling she looked pleased to see his fear so mr bellamy sato said shaking out the match where shall we begin chapter a magic square katherine nodded as she eyed the numbered square in dьrers engraving most people would have thought langdon had lost his mind but katherine had quickly realized he was right the term magic square referred not to something mystical but to something mathematical it was the name given to a grid of consecutive numbers arranged in such a way that all the rows columns and diagonals added up to the same thing created some four thousand years ago by mathematicians in egypt and india magic squares were still believed by some to hold magical powers katherine had read that even nowadays devout indians drew special threebythree magic squares called the kubera kolam on their pooja altars primarily though modern man had relegated magic squares to the category of recreational mathematics some people still deriving pleasure from the quest to discover new magical configurations sudoku for geniuses katherine quickly analyzed dьrers square adding up the numbers in several rows and columns thirtyfour she said every direction adds up to thirtyfour exactly langdon said but did you know that this magic square is famous because dьrer accomplished the seemingly impossible he quickly showed katherine that in addition to making the rows columns and diagonals add up to thirtyfour dьrer had also found a way to make the four quadrants the four center squares and even the four corner squares add up to that number most amazing though was dьrers ability to position the numbers and together in the bottom row as an indication of the year in which he accomplished this incredible feat katherine scanned the numbers amazed by all the combinations langdons tone grew more excited now extraordinarily melencolia i represents the very first time in history that a magic square appeared in european art some historians believe this was dьrers encoded way of indicating that the ancient mysteries had traveled outside the egyptian mystery schools and were now held by the european secret societies langdon paused which brings us back to this he motioned to the slip of paper bearing the grid of letters from the stone pyramid i assume the layout looks familiar now langdon asked fourbyfour square langdon picked up the pencil and carefully transcribed dьrers numbered magic square onto the slip of paper directly beside the lettered square katherine was now seeing just how easy this was going to be he stood poised pencil in hand and yet strangely after all this enthusiasm he seemed to hesitate robert he turned to her his expression one of trepidation are you sure we want to do this peter expressly robert if you dont want to decipher this engraving then i will she held out her hand for the pencil langdon could tell there would be no deterring her and so he acquiesced turning his attention back to the pyramid carefully he superimposed the magic square over the pyramids grid of letters and assigned each letter a number then he created a new grid placing the masonic ciphers letters in the new order as defined by the sequence in dьrers magic square when langdon was finished they both examined the result katherine immediately felt confused its still gibberish langdon remained silent a long moment actually katherine its not gibberish his eyes brightened again with the thrill of discovery its latin in a long dark corridor an old blind man shuffled as quickly as he could toward his office when he finally arrived he collapsed in his desk chair his old bones grateful for the reprieve his answering machine was beeping he pressed the button and listened its warren bellamy said the hushed whisper of his friend and masonic brother im afraid i have alarming news katherine solomons eyes shot back to the grid of letters reexamining the text sure enough a latin word now materialized before her eyes jeova katherine had not studied latin but this word was familiar from her reading of ancient hebrew texts jeova jehovah as her eyes continued to trace downward reading the grid like a book she was surprised to realize she could read the entire text of the pyramid jeova sanctus unus she knew its meaning at once this phrase was ubiquitous in modern translations of hebrew scripture in the torah the god of the hebrews was known by many names jeova jehovah jeshua yahweh the source the elohim but many roman translations had consolidated the confusing nomenclature into a single latin phrase jeova sanctus unus one true god she whispered to herself the phrase certainly did not seem like something that would help them find her brother thats this pyramids secret message one true god i thought this was a map langdon looked equally perplexed the excitement in his eyes evaporating this decryption obviously is correct but the man who has my brother wants to know a location she tucked her hair behind her ear this is not going to make him very happy katherine langdon said heaving a sigh ive been afraid of this all night ive had a feeling were treating as reality a collection of myths and allegories maybe this inscription is pointing to a metaphorical location telling us that the true potential of man can be accessed only through the one true god but that makes no sense katherine replied her jaw now clenched in frustration my family protected this pyramid for generations one true god thats the secret and the cia considers this an issue of national security either theyre lying or were missing something langdon shrugged in accord just then his phone began to ring in a cluttered office lined with old books the old man hunched over his desk clutching a phone receiver in his arthritic hand the line rang and rang at last a tentative voice answered hello the voice was deep but uncertain the old man whispered i was told you require sanctuary the man on the line seemed startled who is this did warren bell no names please the old man said tell me have you successfully protected the map that was entrusted to you a startled pause yes but i dont think it matters it doesnt say much if it is a map it seems to be more metaphorical than no the map is quite real i assure you and it points to a very real location you must keep it safe i cannot impress upon you enough how important this is you are being pursued but if you can travel unseen to my location i will provide sanctuary and answers the man hesitated apparently uncertain my friend the old man began choosing his words carefully there is a refuge in rome north of the tiber which contains ten stones from mount sinai one from heaven itself and one with the visage of lukes dark father do you know my location there was a long pause on the line and then the man replied yes i do the old man smiled i thought you might professor come at once make sure youre not followed chapter malakh stood naked in the billowing warmth of his steam shower he felt pure again having washed off the last remaining scent of ethanol as the eucalyptusinfused vapors permeated his skin he could feel his pores opening to the heat then he began his ritual first he rubbed depilatory chemicals across his tattooed body and scalp removing any traces of body hair hairless were the gods of the seven islands of heliades then he massaged abramelin oil into his softened and receptive flesh abramelin is the sacred oil of the great magi then he turned his shower lever hard to the left and the water turned ice cold he stood beneath the frigid water for a full minute to close his pores and trap the heat and energy within his core the cold served as a reminder of the icy river in which this transformation had begun when he stepped from the shower he was shivering but within seconds his core heat emanated up through his layers of flesh and warmed him malakhs insides felt like a furnace he stood naked before the mirror and admired his form perhaps the last time he would see himself as a mere mortal his feet were the talons of a hawk his legs boaz and jachin were the ancient pillars of wisdom his hips and abdomen were the archways of mystical power hanging beneath the archway his massive sex organ bore the tattooed symbols of his destiny in another life this heavy shaft of flesh had been his source of carnal pleasure but no longer i have been purified like the mystical eunuch monks of katharoi malakh had removed his testicles he had sacrificed his physical potency for a more worthy one gods have no gender having shed the human imperfection of gender along with the earthly pull of sexual temptation malakh had become like ouranos attis sporus and the great castrati magicians of arthurian legend every spiritual metamorphosis is preceded by a physical one such was the lesson of all the great gods from osiris to tammuz to jesus to shiva to the buddha himself i must shed the man who clothes me abruptly malakh drew his gaze upward past the doubleheaded phoenix on his chest past the collage of ancient sigils adorning his face and directly to the top of his head he tipped his head toward the mirror barely able to see the circle of bare flesh that waited there this location on the body was sacred known as the fontanel it was the one area of the human skull that remained open at birth an oculus to the brain although this physiological portal closes within a matter of months it remains a symbolic vestige of the lost connection between the outer and inner worlds malakh studied the sacred patch of virginal skin which was enclosed by the crownlike circle of an ouroboros a mystical snake devouring its own tail the bare flesh seemed to stare back at him bright with promise robert langdon soon would uncover the great treasure that malakh required once malakh possessed it the void on top of his head would be filled and he would at last be prepared for his final transformation malakh padded across his bedroom and took from his bottom drawer a long strip of white silk as he had done many times before he wrapped it around his groin and buttocks then he went downstairs in his office his computer had received an email message it was from his contact what you require is now within reach i will contact you within the hour patience malakh smiled it was time to make final preparations chapter the cia field agent was in a foul mood as he descended from the readingroom balcony bellamy lied to us the agent had seen no heat signatures whatsoever upstairs near the moses statue nor anywhere else upstairs for that matter so where the hell did langdon go the agent retraced his steps now to the only place theyd spotted any heat signatures at all the librarys distribution hub he descended the stairs again moving beneath the octagonal console the noise of the rumbling conveyors was grating advancing into the space he flipped down his thermal goggles and scanned the room nothing he looked toward the stacks where the mangled door still showed hot from the explosion other than that he saw no holy shit the agent jumped back as an unexpected luminescence drifted into his field of vision like a pair of ghosts the dimly glowing imprints of two humanoids had just emerged from the wall on a conveyor belt heat signatures stunned the agent watched as the two apparitions circled the room on the conveyor loop and then disappeared headfirst into a narrow hole in the wall they rode the conveyor out thats insanity in addition to realizing they had just lost robert langdon through a hole in the wall the field agent was now aware that he had another problem langdons not alone he was just about to switch on his transceiver and call the team leader but the team leader beat him to it all points weve got an abandoned volvo on the plaza in front of the library registered to one katherine solomon eyewitness says she entered the library not long ago we suspect shes with robert langdon director sato has ordered that we find them both immediately ive got heat signatures for both of them shouted the field agent in the distribution room he explained the situation for christs sake the team leader replied where the hell does the conveyor go the field agent was already consulting the employee reference schematic on the bulletin board adams building he replied one block from here all points redirect to the adams building now chapter sanctuary answers the words echoed in langdons mind as he and katherine burst through a side door of the adams building and out into the cold winter night the mysterious caller had conveyed his location cryptically but langdon had understood katherines reaction to their destination had been surprisingly sanguine where better to find one true god now the question was how to get there langdon spun in place trying to get his bearings it was dark but thankfully the weather had cleared they were standing in a small courtyard in the distance the capitol dome looked startlingly far away and langdon realized this was the first moment he had stepped outside since arriving at the capitol several hours ago so much for my lecture robert look katherine pointed toward the silhouette of the jefferson building langdons first reaction on seeing the building was astonishment that they had traveled so far underground on a conveyor belt his second reaction however was alarm the jefferson building was now abuzz with activity trucks and cars pulling in men shouting is that a searchlight langdon grabbed katherines hand come on they ran northeast across the courtyard quickly disappearing from view behind an elegant ushaped building which langdon realized was the folger shakespeare library this particular building seemed appropriate camouflage for them tonight as it housed the original latin manuscript of francis bacons new atlantis the utopian vision on which the american forefathers had allegedly modeled a new world based on ancient knowledge even so langdon would not be stopping we need a cab they arrived at the corner of third street and east capitol the traffic was sparse and langdon felt fading hope as he scanned for taxis he and katherine hurried northward on third street putting distance between themselves and the library of congress it was not until they had gone an entire block that langdon finally spotted a cab rounding the corner he flagged it down and the cab pulled over middle eastern music played on his radio and the young arab driver gave them a friendly smile where to the driver asked as they jumped into the car we need to go to northwest katherine interjected pointing up third street away from the jefferson building drive toward union station then left on massachusetts avenue well tell you when to stop the driver shrugged closed the plexiglas divider and turned his music back on katherine shot langdon an admonishing look as if to say leave no trail she pointed out the window directing langdons attention to a black helicopter that was skimming in low approaching the area shit sato was apparently dead serious about recovering solomons pyramid as they watched the helicopter land between the jefferson and adams buildings katherine turned to him looking increasingly worried can i see your cell phone for a second langdon handed her his phone peter told me you have an eidetic memory she said rolling down her window and that you remember every phone number youve ever dialed thats true but katherine hurled his phone out into the night langdon spun in his seat and watched as his cell phone cartwheeled and splintered into pieces on the pavement behind them why did you do that off the grid katherine said her eyes grave this pyramid is our only hope of finding my brother and i have no intention of letting the cia steal it from us in the front seat omar amirana bobbed his head and hummed along with his music tonight had been slow and he felt blessed to finally have a fare his cab was just passing stanton park when the familiar voice of his company dispatcher crackled over the radio this is dispatch all vehicles in the area of the national mall we have just received a bulletin from government authorities regarding two fugitives in the area of the adams building omar listened in amazement as dispatch described the precise couple in his cab he stole an uneasy glance in his rearview mirror omar had to admit the tall guy did look familiar somehow did i see him on americas most wanted gingerly omar reached for his radio handset dispatch he said speaking quietly into the transceiver this is cab onethreefour the two people you asked about they are in my cab right now dispatch immediately advised omar what to do omars hands were trembling as he called the phone number dispatch had given him the voice that answered was tight and efficient like that of a soldier this is agent turner simkins cia field ops who is this um im the taxi driver omar said i was told to call about the two are the fugitives currently in your vehicle answer only yes or no yes can they hear this conversation yes or no no the slider is where are you taking them northwest on massachusetts specific destination they didnt say the agent hesitated is the male passenger carrying a leather bag omar glanced in the rearview mirror and his eyes went wide yes that bag doesnt have explosives or anything in listen carefully the agent said you are in no danger so long as you follow my directions exactly is that clear yes sir what is your name omar he said breaking a sweat listen omar the man said calmly youre doing great i want you to drive as slowly as possible while i get my team out in front of you do you understand yes sir also is your cab equipped with an intercom system so you can communicate with them in the backseat yes sir good heres what i want you to do chapter the jungle as it is known is the centerpiece of the us botanic garden usbg americas living museum located adjacent to the us capitol building technically a rain forest the jungle is housed in a towering greenhouse complete with soaring rubber trees strangler figs and a canopy catwalk for more daring tourists normally warren bellamy felt nurtured by the jungles earthy smells and the sunlight glinting through the mist that filtered down from the vapor nozzles in the glass ceiling tonight however lit only by moonlight the jungle terrified him he was sweating profusely writhing against the cramps that now stabbed at his arms still pinned painfully behind him director sato paced before him puffing calmly on her cigarette the equivalent of ecoterrorism in this carefully calibrated environment her face looked almost demonic in the smokefilled moonlight that streamed down through the glass ceiling overhead so then sato continued when you arrived at the capitol tonight and you discovered that i was already there you made a decision rather than making your presence known to me you descended quietly into the sbb where at great risk to yourself you attacked chief anderson and myself and you helped langdon escape with the pyramid and capstone she rubbed her shoulder an interesting choice a choice i would make again bellamy thought where is peter he demanded angrily how would i know sato said you seem to know everything else bellamy fired back at her making no attempt to hide his suspicion that she was somehow behind all this you knew to go to the capitol building you knew to find robert langdon and you even knew to xray langdons bag to find the capstone obviously someone is giving you a lot of inside information sato laughed coldly and stepped closer to him mr bellamy is that why you attacked me do you think im the enemy do you think im trying to steal your little pyramid sato took a drag on her cigarette and blew the smoke out of her nostrils listen carefully no one understands better than i do the importance of keeping secrets i believe as you do that there is certain information to which the masses should not be privy tonight however there are forces at work that i fear you have not yet grasped the man who kidnapped peter solomon holds enormous power a power that you apparently have yet to realize believe me he is a walking time bomb capable of initiating a series of events that will profoundly change the world as you know it i dont understand bellamy shifted on the bench his arms aching in his handcuffs you dont need to understand you need to obey right now my only hope of averting a major disaster is to cooperate with this man and to give him exactly what he wants which means you are going to call mr langdon and tell him to turn himself in along with the pyramid and capstone once langdon is in my custody he will decrypt the pyramids inscription obtain whatever information this man is demanding and provide him with exactly what he wants the location of the spiral staircase that leads to the ancient mysteries i cant do that ive taken vows of secrecy sato erupted i dont give a damn what youve vowed i will throw you in prison so fast threaten me all you like bellamy said defiantly i will not help you sato took a deep breath and spoke now in a fearsome whisper mr bellamy you have no idea whats really going on tonight do you the tense silence hung for several seconds finally broken by the sound of satos phone she plunged her hand into her pocket and eagerly snatched it out talk to me she answered listening carefully to the reply where is their taxi now how long okay good bring them to the us botanic garden service entrance and make sure you get me that goddamn pyramid and capstone sato hung up and turned back to bellamy with a smug smile well then it seems youre fast outliving your usefulness chapter robert langdon stared blankly into space feeling too tired to urge the slowmoving taxi driver to pick up the pace beside him katherine had fallen silent too looking frustrated by their lack of understanding of what made the pyramid so special they had again been through everything they knew about the pyramid the capstone and the evenings strange events they still had no ideas as to how this pyramid could possibly be considered a map to anything at all jeova sanctus unus the secret hides within the order their mysterious contact had promised them answers if they could meet him at a specific place a refuge in rome north of the tiber langdon knew the forefathers new rome had been renamed washington early in her history and yet vestiges of their original dream remained the tibers waters still flowed into the potomac senators still convened beneath a replica of st peters dome and vulcan and minerva still watched over the rotundas longextinguished flame the answers sought by langdon and katherine were apparently waiting for them just a few miles ahead northwest on massachusetts avenue their destination was indeed a refuge north of washingtons tiber creek langdon wished the driver would speed up abruptly katherine jolted upright in her seat as if she had made a sudden realization oh my god robert she turned to him her face going white she hesitated a moment and then spoke emphatically were going the wrong way no this is right langdon countered its northwest on massachu no i mean were going to the wrong place langdon was mystified he had already told katherine how he knew what location was being described by the mysterious caller it contains ten stones from mount sinai one from heaven itself and one with the visage of lukes dark father only one building on earth could make those claims and that was exactly where this taxi was headed katherine im certain the location is correct no she shouted we dont need to go there anymore i figured out the pyramid and capstone i know what this is all about langdon was amazed you understand it yes we have to go to freedom plaza instead now langdon was lost freedom plaza although nearby seemed totally irrelevant jeova sanctus unus katherine said the one true god of the hebrews the sacred symbol of the hebrews is the jewish star the seal of solomon an important symbol to the masons she fished a dollar bill out of her pocket give me your pen bewildered langdon pulled a pen from his jacket look she spread the bill out on her thigh and took his pen pointing to the great seal on the back if you superimpose solomons seal on the great seal of the united states she drew the symbol of a jewish star precisely over the pyramid look what you get langdon looked down at the bill and then back at katherine as if she were mad robert look more closely dont you see what im pointing at he glanced back at the drawing what in the world is she getting at langdon had seen this image before it was popular among conspiracy theorists as proof that the masons held secret influence over our early nation when the sixpointed star was laid perfectly over the great seal of the united states the stars top vertex fit perfectly over the masonic allseeing eye and quite eerily the other five vertices clearly pointed to the letters mason katherine thats just a coincidence and i still dont see how it has anything to do with freedom plaza look again she said sounding almost angry now youre not looking where i am pointing right there dont you see it an instant later langdon saw it cia fieldoperations leader turner simkins stood outside the adams building and pressed his cell phone tightly to his ear straining to hear the conversation now taking place in the back of the taxi something just happened his team was about to board the modified sikorsky uh helicopter to head northwest and set up a roadblock but now it seemed the situation had suddenly changed seconds ago katherine solomon had begun insisting they were going to the wrong destination her explanation something about the dollar bill and jewish stars made no sense to the team leader nor apparently to robert langdon at least at first now however langdon seemed to have grasped her meaning my god youre right langdon blurted i didnt see it earlier suddenly simkins could hear someone banging on the drivers divider and then it slid open change of plans katherine shouted to the driver take us to freedom plaza freedom plaza the cabbie said sounding nervous not northwest on massachusetts forget that katherine shouted freedom plaza go left here here here agent simkins heard the cab screeching around a corner katherine was talking excitedly again to langdon saying something about the famous bronze cast of the great seal embedded in the plaza maam just to confirm the cabbies voice interjected sounding tense were going to freedom plaza on the corner of pennsylvania and thirteenth yes katherine said hurry its very close two minutes simkins smiled nicely done omar as he dashed toward the idling helicopter he shouted to his team weve got them freedom plaza move chapter freedom plaza is a map located at the corner of pennsylvania avenue and thirteenth street the plazas vast surface of inlaid stone depicts the streets of washington as they were originally envisioned by pierre lenfant the plaza is a popular tourist destination not only because the giant map is fun to walk on but also because martin luther king jr for whom freedom plaza is named wrote much of his i have a dream speech in the nearby willard hotel dc cabdriver omar amirana brought tourists to freedom plaza all the time but tonight his two passengers were obviously no ordinary sightseers the cia is chasing them omar had barely come to a stop at the curb before the man and woman had jumped out stay right here the man in the tweed coat told omar well be right back omar watched the two people dash out onto the wideopen spaces of the enormous map pointing and shouting as they scanned the geometry of intersecting streets omar grabbed his cell phone off the dashboard sir are you still there yes omar a voice shouted barely audible over a thundering noise on his end of the line where are they now out on the map it seems like theyre looking for something do not let them out of your sight the agent shouted im almost there omar watched as the two fugitives quickly found the plazas famous great seal one of the largest bronze medallions ever cast they stood over it a moment and quickly began pointing to the southwest then the man in tweed came racing back toward the cab omar quickly set his phone down on the dashboard as the man arrived breathless which direction is alexandria virginia he demanded alexandria omar pointed southwest the exact same direction the man and woman had just pointed toward i knew it the man whispered beneath his breath he spun and shouted back to the woman youre right alexandria the woman now pointed across the plaza to an illuminated metro sign nearby the blue line goes directly there we want king street station omar felt a surge of panic oh no the man turned back to omar and handed him entirely too many bills for the fare thanks were all set he hoisted his leather bag and ran off wait i can drive you i go there all the time but it was too late the man and woman were already dashing across the plaza they disappeared down the stairs into the metro center subway station omar grabbed his cell phone sir they ran down into the subway i couldnt stop them theyre taking the blue line to alexandria stay right there the agent shouted ill be there in fifteen seconds omar looked down at the wad of bills the man had given him the bill on top was apparently the one they had been writing on it had a jewish star on top of the great seal of the united states sure enough the stars points fell on letters that spelled mason without warning omar felt a deafening vibration all around him as if a tractor trailer were about to collide with his cab he looked up but the street was deserted the noise increased and suddenly a sleek black helicopter dropped down out of the night and landed hard in the middle of the plaza map a group of blackclad men jumped out most ran toward the subway station but one came dashing toward omars cab he yanked open the passenger door omar is that you omar nodded speechless did they say where they were headed the agent demanded alexandria king street station omar blurted i offered to drive but did they say where in alexandria they were going no they looked at the medallion of the great seal on the plaza then they asked about alexandria and they paid me with this he handed the agent the dollar bill with the bizarre diagram as the agent studied the bill omar suddenly put it all together the masons alexandria one of the most famous masonic buildings in america was in alexandria thats it he blurted the george washington masonic memorial its directly across from king street station that it is the agent said apparently having just come to the same realization as the rest of the agents came sprinting back from the station we missed them one of the men yelled blue line just left theyre not down there agent simkins checked his watch and turned back to omar how long does the subway take to alexandria ten minutes at least probably more omar youve done an excellent job thank you sure whats this all about but agent simkins was already running back to the chopper shouting as he went king street station well get there before they do bewildered omar watched the great black bird lift off it banked hard to the south across pennsylvania avenue and then thundered off into the night underneath the cabbies feet a subway train was picking up speed as it headed away from freedom plaza on board robert langdon and katherine solomon sat breathless neither one saying a word as the train whisked them toward their destination chapter the memory always began the same way he was falling plummeting backward toward an icecovered river at the bottom of a deep ravine above him the merciless gray eyes of peter solomon stared down over the barrel of andross handgun as he fell the world above him receded everything disappearing as he was enveloped by the cloud of billowing mist from the waterfall upstream for an instant everything was white like heaven then he hit the ice cold black pain he was tumbling being dragged by a powerful force that pounded him relentlessly across rocks in an impossibly cold void his lungs ached for air and yet his chest muscles had contracted so violently in the cold that he was unable even to inhale im under the ice the ice near the waterfall was apparently thin on account of the turbulent water and andros had broken directly through it now he was being washed downstream trapped beneath a transparent ceiling he clawed at the underside of the ice trying to break out but he had no leverage the searing pain from the bullet hole in his shoulder was evaporating as was the sting of the bird shot both were blotted out now by the crippling throb of his body going numb the current was accelerating slingshotting him around a bend in the river his body screamed for oxygen suddenly he was tangled in branches lodged against a tree that had fallen into the water think he groped wildly at the branch working his way toward the surface finding the spot where the branch pierced up through the ice his fingertips found the tiny space of open water surrounding the branch and he pulled at the edges trying to break the hole wider once twice the opening was growing now several inches across propping himself against the branch he tipped his head back and pressed his mouth against the small opening the winter air that poured into his lungs felt warm the sudden burst of oxygen fueled his hope he planted his feet on the tree trunk and pressed his back and shoulders forcefully upward the ice around the fallen tree perforated by branches and debris was weakened already and as he drove his powerful legs into the trunk his head and shoulders broke through the ice crashing up into the winter night air poured into his lungs still mostly submerged he wriggled desperately upward pushing with his legs pulling with his arms until finally he was out of the water lying breathless on the bare ice andros tore off his soaked ski mask and pocketed it glancing back upstream for peter solomon the bend in the river obscured his view his chest was burning again quietly he dragged a small branch over the hole in the ice in order to hide it the hole would be frozen again by morning as andros staggered into the woods it began to snow he had no idea how far he had run when he stumbled out of the woods onto an embankment beside a small highway he was delirious and hypothermic the snow was falling harder now and a single set of headlights approached in the distance andros waved wildly and the lone pickup truck immediately pulled over it had vermont plates an old man in a red plaid shirt jumped out andros staggered toward him holding his bleeding chest a hunter shot me i need a hospital without hesitation the old man helped andros up into the passenger seat of the truck and turned up the heater wheres the nearest hospital andros had no idea but he pointed south next exit were not going to a hospital the old man from vermont was reported missing the next day but nobody had any idea where on his journey from vermont he might have disappeared in the blinding snowstorm nor did anyone link his disappearance to the other news story that dominated the headlines the next day the shocking murder of isabel solomon when andros awoke he was lying in a desolate bedroom of a cheap motel that had been boarded up for the season he recalled breaking in and binding his wounds with torn bedsheets and then burrowing into a flimsy bed beneath a pile of musty blankets he was famished he limped to the bathroom and saw the pile of bloody birdshot pellets in the sink he vaguely recalled prying them out of his chest raising his eyes to the dirty mirror he reluctantly unwrapped his bloody bandages to survey the damage the hard muscles of his chest and abdomen had stopped the bird shot from penetrating too deep and yet his body once perfect was now ruined with wounds the single bullet fired by peter solomon had apparently gone cleanly through his shoulder leaving a bloody crater making matters worse andros had failed to obtain that for which he had traveled all this distance the pyramid his stomach growled and he limped outside to the mans truck hoping maybe to find food the pickup was now covered with heavy snow and andros wondered how long he had been sleeping in this old motel thank god i woke up andros found no food anywhere in the front seat but he did find some arthritis painkillers in the glove compartment he took a handful washing them down with several mouthfuls of snow i need food a few hours later the pickup that pulled out from behind the old motel looked nothing like the truck that had pulled in two days earlier the cab cap was missing as were the hubcaps bumper stickers and all of the trim the vermont plates were gone replaced by those from an old maintenance truck andros had found parked by the motel dumpster into which he had thrown all the bloody sheets bird shot and other evidence that he had ever been at the motel andros had not given up on the pyramid but for the moment it would have to wait he needed to hide heal and above all eat he found a roadside diner where he gorged himself on eggs bacon hash browns and three glasses of orange juice when he was done he ordered more food to go back on the road andros listened to the trucks old radio he had not seen a television or newspaper since his ordeal and when he finally heard a local news station the report stunned him fbi investigators a news announcer said continue their search for the armed intruder who murdered isabel solomon in her potomac home two days ago the murderer is believed to have fallen through the ice and been washed out to sea andros froze murdered isabel solomon he drove on in bewildered silence listening to the full report it was time to get far far away from this place the upper west side apartment offered breathtaking views of central park andros had chosen it because the sea of green outside his window reminded him of his lost view of the adriatic although he knew he should be happy to be alive he was not the emptiness had never left him and he found himself fixated on his failed attempt to steal peter solomons pyramid andros had spent long hours researching the legend of the masonic pyramid and although nobody seemed to agree on whether or not the pyramid was real they all concurred on its famous promise of vast wisdom and power the masonic pyramid is real andros told himself my inside information is irrefutable fate had placed the pyramid within andross reach and he knew that ignoring it was like holding a winning lottery ticket and never cashing it in i am the only nonmason alive who knows the pyramid is real as well as the identity of the man who guards it months had passed and although his body had healed andros was no longer the cocky specimen he had been in greece he had stopped working out and he had stopped admiring himself naked in the mirror he felt as if his body were beginning to show signs of age his onceperfect skin was a patchwork of scars and this only depressed him further he still relied on the painkillers that had nursed him through his recovery and he felt himself slipping back to the lifestyle that had put him in soganlik prison he didnt care the body craves what the body craves one night he was in greenwich village buying drugs from a man whose forearm had been tattooed with a long jagged lightning bolt andros asked him about it and the man told him the tattoo was covering a long scar he had gotten in a car accident seeing the scar every day reminded me of the accident the dealer said and so i tattooed over it with a symbol of personal power i took back control that night high on his new stash of drugs andros staggered into a local tattoo parlor and took off his shirt i want to hide these scars he announced i want to take back control hide them the tattoo artist eyed his chest with what tattoos yes i mean tattoos of what andros shrugged wanting nothing more than to hide the ugly reminders of his past i dont know you choose the artist shook his head and handed andros a pamphlet on the ancient and sacred tradition of tattooing come back when youre ready andros discovered that the new york public library had in its collection fiftythree books on tattooing and within a few weeks he had read them all having rediscovered his passion for reading he began carrying entire backpacks of books back and forth between the library and his apartment where he voraciously devoured them while overlooking central park these books on tattoos had opened a door to a strange world andros had never known existed a world of symbols mysticism mythology and the magical arts the more he read the more he realized how blind he had been he began keeping notebooks of his ideas his sketches and his strange dreams when he could no longer find what he wanted at the library he paid rarebook dealers to purchase for him some of the most esoteric texts on earth de praestigiis daemonum lemegeton ars almadel grimorium verum ars notoria and on and on he read them all becoming more and more certain that the world still had many treasures yet to offer him there are secrets out there that transcend human understanding then he discovered the writings of aleister crowley a visionary mystic from the early s whom the church had deemed the most evil man who ever lived great minds are always feared by lesser minds andros learned about the power of ritual and incantation he learned that sacred words if properly spoken functioned like keys that opened gateways to other worlds there is a shadow universe beyond this one a world from which i can draw power and although andros longed to harness that power he knew there were rules and tasks to be completed beforehand become something holy crowley wrote make yourself sacred the ancient rite of sacred making had once been the law of the land from the early hebrews who made burnt offerings at the temple to the mayans who beheaded humans atop the pyramids of chichйn itzб to jesus christ who offered his body on the cross the ancients understood gods requirement for sacrifice sacrifice was the original ritual by which humans drew favor from the gods and made themselves holy sacra sacred face make even though the rite of sacrifice had been abandoned eons ago its power remained there had been a handful of modern mystics including aleister crowley who practiced the art perfecting it over time and transforming themselves gradually into something more andros craved to transform himself as they had and yet he knew he would have to cross a dangerous bridge to do so blood is all that separates the light from the dark one night a crow flew through andross open bathroom window and got trapped in his apartment andros watched the bird flutter around for a while and then finally stop apparently accepting its inability to escape andros had learned enough to recognize a sign i am being urged onward clutching the bird in one hand he stood at the makeshift altar in his kitchen and raised a sharp knife speaking aloud the incantation he had memorized camiach eomiahe emial macbal emoii zazean by the most holy names of the angels in the book of assamaian i conjure thee that thou assist me in this operation by the power of the one true god andros now lowered the knife and carefully pierced the large vein on the right wing of the panicked bird the crow began to bleed as he watched the stream of red liquid flowing down into the metal cup he had placed as a receptacle he felt an unexpected chill in the air nonetheless he continued almighty adonai arathron ashai elohim elohi elion asher eheieh shaddai be my aid so that this blood may have power and efficacy in all wherein i shall wish and in all that i shall demand that night he dreamed of birds of a giant phoenix rising from a billowing fire the next morning he awoke with an energy he had not felt since childhood he went running in the park faster and farther than hed imagined possible when he could run no longer he stopped to do pushups and situps countless repetitions still he had energy that night again he dreamed of the phoenix autumn had fallen again on central park and the wildlife were scurrying about searching for food for winter andros despised the cold and yet his carefully hidden traps were now overflowing with live rats and squirrels he took them home in his backpack performing rituals of increasing complexity emanual massiach yod he vaud please find me worthy the blood rituals fueled his vitality andros felt younger every day he continued to read day and night ancient mystical texts epic medieval poems the early philosophers and the more he learned about the true nature of things the more he realized that all hope for mankind was lost they are blind wandering aimlessly in a world they will never understand andros was still a man but he sensed he was evolving into something else something greater something sacred his massive physique had emerged from dormancy more powerful now than ever before he finally understood its true purpose my body is but a vessel for my most potent treasure my mind andros knew his true potential had not yet been realized and he delved deeper what is my destiny all the ancient texts spoke of good and evil and of mans need to choose between them i made my choice long ago he knew and yet he felt no remorse what is evil if not a natural law darkness followed light chaos followed order entropy was fundamental everything decayed the perfectly ordered crystal eventually turned into random particles of dust there are those who create and those who destroy it was not until andros read john miltons paradise lost that he saw his destiny materialize before him he read of the great fallen angel the warrior demon who fought against the light the valiant one the angel called moloch moloch walked the earth as a god the angels name andros later learned when translated to the ancient tongue became malakh and so shall i like all great transformations this one had to begin with a sacrifice but not of rats nor birds no this transformation required a true sacrifice there is but one worthy sacrifice suddenly he had a sense of clarity unlike anything he had ever experienced in his life his entire destiny had materialized for three straight days he sketched on an enormous sheet of paper when he was done he had created a blueprint of what he would become he hung the lifesize sketch on his wall and gazed into it as if into a mirror i am a masterpiece the next day he took his drawing to the tattoo parlor he was ready chapter the george washington masonic memorial stands atop shuters hill in alexandria virginia built in three distinct tiers of increasing architectural complexity from bottom to top doric ionic and corinthian the structure stands as a physical symbol of mans intellectual ascent inspired by the ancient pharos lighthouse of alexandria egypt this soaring tower is capped by an egyptian pyramid with a flamelike finial inside the spectacular marble foyer sits a massive bronze of george washington in full masonic regalia along with the actual trowel he used to lay the cornerstone of the capitol building above the foyer nine different levels bear names like the grotto the crypt room and the knights templar chapel among the treasures housed within these spaces are over twenty thousand volumes of masonic writings a dazzling replica of the ark of the covenant and even a scale model of the throne room in king solomons temple cia agent simkins checked his watch as the modified uh chopper skimmed in low over the potomac six minutes until their train arrives he exhaled and gazed out the window at the shining masonic memorial on the horizon he had to admit the brilliantly shining tower was as impressive as any building on the national mall simkins had never been inside the memorial and tonight would be no different if all went according to plan robert langdon and katherine solomon would never make it out of the subway station over there simkins shouted to the pilot pointing down at the king street subway station across from the memorial the pilot banked the helicopter and set it down on a grassy area at the foot of shuters hill pedestrians looked up in surprise as simkins and his team piled out dashed across the street and ran down into king street station in the stairwell several departing passengers leaped out of the way plastering themselves to the walls as the phalanx of armed men in black thundered past them the king street station was larger than simkins had anticipated apparently serving several different lines blue yellow and amtrak he raced over to the metro map on the wall found freedom plaza and the direct line to this location blue line southbound platform simkins shouted get down there and clear everyone out his team dashed off simkins rushed over to the ticket booth flashed his identification and shouted to the woman inside the next train from metro center what time is it due the woman inside looked frightened im not sure blue line arrives every eleven minutes theres no set schedule how long since the last train five six minutes maybe no more than that turner did the math perfect the next train had to be langdons inside a fastmoving subway car katherine solomon shifted uncomfortably on the hard plastic seat the bright fluorescent lights overhead hurt her eyes and she fought the impulse to let her eyelids close even for a second langdon sat beside her in the empty car staring blankly down at the leather bag at his feet his eyelids looked heavy too as if the rhythmic sway of the moving car were lulling him into a trance katherine pictured the strange contents of langdons bag why does the cia want this pyramid bellamy had said that sato might be pursuing the pyramid because she knew its true potential but even if this pyramid somehow did reveal the hiding place of ancient secrets katherine found it hard to believe that its promise of primeval mystical wisdom would interest the cia then again she reminded herself the cia had been caught several times running parapsychological or psi programs that bordered on ancient magic and mysticism in the stargatescannate scandal had exposed a classified cia technology called remote viewing a kind of telepathic mind travel that enabled a viewer to transport his minds eye to any location on earth and spy there without being physically present of course the technology was nothing new mystics called it astral projection and yogis called it outofbody experience unfortunately horrified american taxpayers called it absurd and the program had been scuttled at least publicly ironically katherine saw remarkable connections between the cias failed programs and her own breakthroughs in noetic science katherine felt eager to call the police and find out if they had discovered anything in kalorama heights but she and langdon were phoneless now and making contact with the authorities would probably be a mistake anyway there was no telling how far satos reach extended patience katherine within minutes they would be in a safe hiding place guests of a man who had assured them he could provide answers katherine hoped his answers whatever they might be would help her save her brother robert she whispered glancing up at the subway map next stop is ours langdon emerged slowly from his daydream right thanks as the train rumbled toward the station he collected his daybag and gave katherine an uncertain glance lets just hope our arrival is uneventful by the time turner simkins dashed down to join his men the subway platform had been entirely cleared and his team was fanning out taking up positions behind the support pillars that ran the length of the platform a distant rumble echoed in the tunnel at the other end of the platform and as it grew louder simkins felt the push of stale warm air billowing around him no escape mr langdon simkins turned to the two agents he had told to join him on the platform identification and weapons out these trains are automated but they all have a conductor who opens the doors find him the trains headlamp now appeared down the tunnel and the sound of squealing brakes pierced the air as the train burst into the station and began slowing down simkins and his two agents leaned out over the track waving cia identification badges and straining to make eye contact with the conductor before he could open the doors the train was closing fast in the third car simkins finally saw the startled face of the conductor who was apparently trying to figure out why three men in black were all waving identification badges at him simkins jogged toward the train which was now nearing a full stop cia simkins shouted holding up his id do not open the doors as the train glided slowly past him he went toward the conductors car shouting in at him do not open your doors do you understand do not open your doors the train came to a full stop its wideeyed conductor nodding repeatedly whats wrong the man demanded through his side window dont let this train move simkins said and dont open the doors okay can you let us into the first car the conductor nodded looking fearful he stepped out of the train closing the door behind him he escorted simkins and his men to the first car where he manually opened the door lock it behind us simkins said pulling his weapon simkins and his men stepped quickly into the stark light of the first car the conductor locked the door behind them the first car contained only four passengers three teenage boys and an old woman all of whom looked understandably startled to see three armed men entering simkins held up his id everythings fine just stay seated simkins and his men now began their sweep pushing toward the back of the sealed train one car at a time squeezing toothpaste as it was called during his training at the farm very few passengers were on this train and halfway to the back the agents still had seen nobody even remotely resembling the description of robert langdon and katherine solomon nonetheless simkins remained confident there was absolutely no place to hide on a subway car no bathrooms no storage and no alternative exits even if the targets had seen them board the train and fled to the back there was no way out prying open a door was almost impossible and simkins had men watching the platform and both sides of the train anyway patience by the time simkins reached the secondtolast car however he was feeling edgy this penultimate car had only one passenger a chinese man simkins and his agents moved through scanning for any place to hide there was none last car simkins said raising his weapon as the threesome moved toward the threshold of the trains final section as they stepped into the last car all three of them immediately stopped and stared what the simkins raced to the rear of the deserted cabin searching behind all the seats he spun back to his men blood boiling where the hell did they go chapter eight miles due north of alexandria virginia robert langdon and katherine solomon strode calmly across a wide expanse of frostcovered lawn you should be an actress langdon said still impressed by katherines quick thinking and improvisational skills you werent half bad yourself she gave him a smile at first langdon had been mystified by katherines abrupt antics in the taxi without warning she had suddenly demanded they go to freedom plaza based on some revelation about a jewish star and the great seal of the united states she drew a wellknown conspiracytheory image on a dollar bill and then insisted langdon look closely where she was pointing finally langdon realized that katherine was pointing not at the dollar bill but at a tiny indicator bulb on the back of the drivers seat the bulb was so covered with grime that he had not even noticed it as he leaned forward however he could see that the bulb was illuminated emitting a dull red glow he could also see the two faint words directly beneath the lit bulb intercom on startled langdon glanced back at katherine whose frantic eyes were urging him to look into the front seat he obeyed stealing a discreet glance through the divider the cabbys cell phone was on the dash wide open illuminated facing the intercom speaker an instant later langdon understood katherines actions they know were in this cab theyve been listening to us langdon had no idea how much time he and katherine had until their taxi was stopped and surrounded but he knew they had to act fast instantly hed begun playing along realizing that katherines desire to go to freedom plaza had nothing to do with the pyramid but rather with its being a large subway station metro center from which they could take the red blue or orange lines in any of six different directions they jumped out of the taxi at freedom plaza and langdon took over doing some improvising of his own leaving a trail to the masonic memorial in alexandria before he and katherine ran down into the subway station dashing past the blue line platforms and continuing on to the red line where they caught a train in the opposite direction traveling six stops northbound to tenleytown they emerged all alone into a quiet upscale neighborhood their destination the tallest structure for miles was immediately visible on the horizon just off massachusetts avenue on a vast expanse of manicured lawn now off the grid as katherine called it the two of them walked across the damp grass on their right was a medievalstyle garden famous for its ancient rosebushes and shadow house gazebo they moved past the garden directly toward the magnificent building to which they had been summoned a refuge containing ten stones from mount sinai one from heaven itself and one with the visage of lukes dark father ive never been here at night katherine said gazing up at the brightly lit towers its spectacular langdon agreed having forgotten how impressive this place truly was this neogothic masterpiece stood at the north end of embassy row he hadnt been here for years not since writing a piece about it for a kids magazine in hopes of generating some excitement among young americans to come see this amazing landmark his article moses moon rocks and star wars had been part of the tourist literature for years washington national cathedral langdon thought feeling an unexpected anticipation at being back after all these years where better to ask about one true god this cathedral really has ten stones from mount sinai katherine asked gazing up at the twin bell towers langdon nodded near the main altar they symbolize the ten commandments given to moses on mount sinai and theres a lunar rock a rock from heaven itself yes one of the stainedglass windows is called the space window and has a fragment of moon rock embedded in it okay but you cant be serious about the last thing katherine glanced over her pretty eyes flashing skepticism a statue of darth vader langdon chuckled luke skywalkers dark father absolutely vader is one of the national cathedrals most popular grotesques he pointed high into the west towers tough to see him at night but hes there what in the world is darth vader doing on washington national cathedral a contest for kids to carve a gargoyle that depicted the face of evil darth won they reached the grand staircase to the main entrance which was set back in an eightyfoot archway beneath a breathtaking rose window as they began climbing langdons mind shifted to the mysterious stranger who had called him no names please tell me have you successfully protected the map that was entrusted to you langdons shoulder ached from carrying the heavy stone pyramid and he was looking forward to setting it down sanctuary and answers as they approached the top of the stairs they were met with an imposing pair of wooden doors do we just knock katherine asked langdon had been wondering the same thing except that now one of the doors was creaking open whos there a frail voice said the face of a withered old man appeared in the doorway he wore priests robes and a blank stare his eyes were opaque and white clouded with cataracts my name is robert langdon he replied katherine solomon and i are seeking sanctuary the blind man exhaled in relief thank god ive been expecting you chapter warren bellamy felt a sudden ray of hope inside the jungle director sato had just received a phone call from a field agent and had immediately flown into a tirade well you damn well better find them she shouted into her phone were running out of time she had hung up and was now stalking back and forth in front of bellamy as if trying to decide what to do next finally she stopped directly in front of him and turned mr bellamy im going to ask you this once and only once she stared deep into his eyes yes or no do you have any idea where robert langdon might have gone bellamy had more than a good idea but he shook his head no satos piercing gaze had never left his eyes unfortunately part of my job is to know when people are lying bellamy averted his eyes sorry i cant help you architect bellamy sato said tonight just after seven pm you were having dinner in a restaurant outside the city when you received a phone call from a man who told you he had kidnapped peter solomon bellamy felt an instant chill and returned his eyes to hers how could you possibly know that the man sato continued told you that he had sent robert langdon to the capitol building and given langdon a task to complete a task that required your help he warned that if langdon failed in this task your friend peter solomon would die panicked you called all of peters numbers but failed to reach him understandably you then raced to the capitol bellamy could not imagine how sato knew about this phone call as you fled the capitol sato said behind the smoldering tip of her cigarette you sent a text message to solomons kidnapper assuring him that you and langdon had been successful in obtaining the masonic pyramid where is she getting her information bellamy wondered not even langdon knows i sent that text message immediately after entering the tunnel to the library of congress bellamy had stepped into the electrical room to plug in the construction lighting in the privacy of that moment he had decided to send a quick text message to solomons captor telling him about satos involvement but reassuring him that he bellamy and langdon had obtained the masonic pyramid and would indeed cooperate with his demands it was a lie of course but bellamy hoped the reassurance might buy time both for peter solomon and also to hide the pyramid who told you i sent a text bellamy demanded sato tossed bellamys cell phone on the bench next to him hardly rocket science bellamy now remembered his phone and keys had been taken from him by the agents who captured him as for the rest of my inside information sato said the patriot act gives me the right to place a wiretap on the phone of anyone i consider a viable threat to national security i consider peter solomon to be such a threat and last night i took action bellamy could barely get his mind around what she was telling him youre tapping peter solomons phone yes this is how i knew the kidnapper called you at the restaurant you called peters cell phone and left an anxious message explaining what had just happened bellamy realized she was right we had also intercepted a call from robert langdon who was in the capitol building deeply confused to learn he had been tricked into coming there i went to the capitol at once arriving before you because i was closer as for how i knew to check the xray of langdons bag in light of my realization that langdon was involved in all of this i had my staff reexamine a seemingly innocuous earlymorning call between langdon and peter solomons cell phone in which the kidnapper posing as solomons assistant persuaded langdon to come for a lecture and also to bring a small package that peter had entrusted to him when langdon was not forthcoming with me about the package he was carrying i requested the xray of his bag bellamy could barely think admittedly everything sato was saying was feasible and yet something was not adding up but how could you possibly think peter solomon is a threat to national security believe me peter solomon is a serious nationalsecurity threat she snapped and frankly mr bellamy so are you bellamy sat bolt upright the handcuffs chafing against his wrists i beg your pardon she forced a smile you masons play a risky game you keep a very very dangerous secret is she talking about the ancient mysteries thankfully youve always done a good job of keeping your secrets hidden unfortunately recently youve been careless and tonight your most dangerous secret is about to be unveiled to the world and unless we can stop that from happening i assure you the results will be catastrophic bellamy stared in bewilderment if you had not attacked me sato said you would have realized that you and i are on the same team the same team the words sparked in bellamy an idea that seemed almost impossible to fathom is sato a member of eastern star the order of the eastern star often considered a sister organization to the masons embraced a similar mystical philosophy of benevolence secret wisdom and spiritual openmindedness the same team im in handcuffs shes tapping peters phone you will help me stop this man sato said he has the potential to bring about a cataclysm from which this country might not recover her face was like stone then why arent you tracking him sato looked incredulous do you think im not trying my trace on solomons cell phone went dead before we got a location his other number appears to be a disposable phone which is almost impossible to track the privatejet company told us that langdons flight was booked by solomons assistant on solomons cell phone with solomons marquis jet card there is no trail not that it matters anyway even if we find out exactly where he is i cant possibly risk moving in and trying to grab him why not id prefer not to share that as the information is classified sato said patience clearly waning i am asking you to trust me on this well i dont satos eyes were like ice she turned suddenly and shouted across the jungle agent hartmann the briefcase please bellamy heard the hiss of the electronic door and an agent strode into the jungle he was carrying a sleek titanium briefcase which he set on the ground beside the os director leave us sato said as the agent departed the door hissed again and then everything fell silent sato picked up the metal case laid it across her lap and popped the clasps then she raised her eyes slowly to bellamy i did not want to do this but our time is running out and youve left me no choice bellamy eyed the strange briefcase and felt a swell of fear is she going to torture me he strained at his cuffs again whats in that case sato smiled grimly something that will persuade you to see things my way i guarantee it chapter the subterranean space in which malakh performed the art was ingeniously hidden his homes basement to those who entered appeared quite normal a typical cellar with boiler fuse box woodpile and a hodgepodge of storage this visible cellar however was only a portion of malakhs underground space a sizable area had been walled off for his clandestine practices malakhs private work space was a suite of small rooms each with a specialized purpose the areas sole entrance was a steep ramp secretly accessible through his living room making the areas discovery virtually impossible tonight as malakh descended the ramp the tattooed sigils and signs on his flesh seemed to come alive in the cerulean glow of his basements specialized lighting moving into the bluish haze he walked past several closed doors and headed directly for the largest room at the end of the corridor the sanctum sanctorum as malakh liked to call it was a perfect twelvefoot square twelve are the signs of the zodiac twelve are the hours of the day twelve are the gates of heaven in the center of the chamber was a stone table a sevenbyseven square seven are the seals of revelation seven are the steps of the temple centered over the table hung a carefully calibrated light source that cycled through a spectrum of preordained colors completing its cycle every six hours in accordance with the sacred table of planetary hours the hour of yanor is blue the hour of nasnia is red the hour of salam is white now was the hour of caerra meaning the light in the room had modulated to a soft purplish hue wearing only a silken loincloth wrapped around his buttocks and neutered sex organ malakh began his preparations he carefully combined the suffumigation chemicals that he would later ignite to sanctify the air then he folded the virgin silk robe that he would eventually don in place of his loincloth and finally he purified a flask of water for the anointing of his offering when he was done he placed all of these prepared ingredients on a side table next he went to a shelf and retrieved a small ivory box which he carried to the side table and placed with the other items although he was not yet ready to use it he could not resist opening the lid and admiring this treasure the knife inside the ivory box nestled in a cradle of black velvet shone the sacrificial knife that malakh had been saving for tonight he had purchased it for million on the middle eastern antiquities black market last year the most famous knife in history unimaginably old and believed lost this precious blade was made of iron attached to a bone handle over the ages it had been in the possession of countless powerful individuals in recent decades however it had disappeared languishing in a secret private collection malakh had gone to enormous lengths to obtain it the knife he suspected had not drawn blood for decades possibly centuries tonight this blade would again taste the power of the sacrifice for which it was honed malakh gently lifted the knife from its cushioned compartment and reverently polished the blade with a silk cloth soaked in purified water his skills had progressed greatly since his first rudimentary experiments in new york the dark art that malakh practiced had been known by many names in many languages but by any name it was a precise science this primeval technology had once held the key to the portals of power but it had been banished long ago relegated to the shadows of occultism and magic those few who still practiced this art were considered madmen but malakh knew better this is not work for those with dull faculties the ancient dark art like modern science was a discipline involving precise formulas specific ingredients and meticulous timing this art was not the impotent black magic of today often practiced halfheartedly by curious souls this art like nuclear physics had the potential to unleash enormous power the warnings were dire the unskilled practitioner runs the risk of being struck by a reflux current and destroyed malakh finished admiring the sacred blade and turned his attention to a lone sheet of thick vellum lying on the table before him he had made this vellum himself from the skin of a baby lamb as was the protocol the lamb was pure having not yet reached sexual maturity beside the vellum was a quill pen he had made from the feather of a crow a silver saucer and three glimmering candles arranged around a solidbrass bowl the bowl contained one inch of thick crimson liquid the liquid was peter solomons blood blood is the tincture of eternity malakh picked up the quill pen placed his left hand on the vellum and dipping the quill tip in the blood he carefully traced the outline of his open palm when he was done he added the five symbols of the ancient mysteries one on each fingertip of the drawing the crown to represent the king i shall become the star to represent the heavens which have ordained my destiny the sun to represent the illumination of my soul the lantern to represent the feeble light of human understanding and the key to represent the missing piece that which tonight i shall at last possess malakh completed his blood tracing and held up the vellum admiring his work in the light of the three candles he waited until the blood was dry and then folded the thick vellum three times while chanting an ethereal ancient incantation malakh touched the vellum to the third candle and it burst into flames he set the flaming vellum on the silver saucer and let it burn as it did the carbon in the animal skin dissolved to a powdery black char when the flame went out malakh carefully tapped the ashes into the brass bowl of blood then he stirred the mixture with the crows feather the liquid turned a deeper crimson nearly black holding the bowl in both palms malakh raised it over his head and gave thanks intoning the blood eukharistos of the ancients then he carefully poured the blackened mixture into a glass vial and corked it this would be the ink with which malakh would inscribe the untattooed flesh atop his head and complete his masterpiece chapter washington national cathedral is the sixthlargest cathedral in the world and soars higher than a thirtystory skyscraper embellished with over two hundred stainedglass windows a fiftythreebell carillon and a pipe organ this gothic masterpiece can accommodate more than three thousand worshippers tonight however the great cathedral was deserted reverend colin galloway dean of the cathedral looked like he had been alive forever stooped and withered he wore a simple black cassock and shuffled blindly ahead without a word langdon and katherine followed in silence through the darkness of the fourhundredfootlong naves central aisle which was curved ever so slightly to the left to create a softening optical illusion when they reached the great crossing the dean guided them through the rood screen the symbolic divider between the public area and the sanctuary beyond the scent of frankincense hung in the air of the chancel this sacred space was dark illuminated only by indirect reflections in the foliated vaults overhead flags of the fifty states hung above the quire which was ornately appointed with several carved reredos depicting biblical events dean galloway continued on apparently knowing this walk by heart for a moment langdon thought they were headed straight for the high altar where the ten stones from mount sinai were embedded but the old dean finally turned left and groped his way through a discreetly hidden door that led into an administrative annex they moved down a short hallway to an office door bearing a brass nameplate the reverend dr colin galloway cathedral dean galloway opened the door and turned on the lights apparently accustomed to remembering this courtesy for his guests he ushered them in and closed the door the deans office was small but elegant with high bookshelves a desk a carved armoire and a private bathroom on the walls hung sixteenthcentury tapestries and several religious paintings the old dean motioned to the two leather chairs directly opposite his desk langdon sat with katherine and felt grateful finally to set his heavy shoulder bag on the floor at his feet sanctuary and answers langdon thought settling into the comfortable chair the aged man shuffled around behind his desk and eased himself down into his highbacked chair then with a weary sigh he raised his head staring blankly out at them through clouded eyes when he spoke his voice was unexpectedly clear and strong i realize we have never met the old man said and yet i feel i know you both he took out a handkerchief and dabbed his mouth professor langdon i am familiar with your writings including the clever piece you did on the symbolism of this cathedral and ms solomon your brother peter and i have been masonic brothers for many years now peter is in terrible trouble katherine said so i have been told the old man sighed and i will do everything in my power to help you langdon saw no masonic ring on the deans finger and yet he knew many masons especially those within the clergy chose not to advertise their affiliation as they began to talk it became clear that dean galloway already knew some of the nights events from warren bellamys phone message as langdon and katherine filled him in on the rest the dean looked more and more troubled and this man who has taken our beloved peter the dean said he is insisting you decipher the pyramid in exchange for peters life yes langdon said he thinks its a map that will lead him to the hiding place of the ancient mysteries the dean turned his eerie opaque eyes toward langdon my ears tell me you do not believe in such things langdon did not want to waste time going down this road it doesnt matter what i believe we need to help peter unfortunately when we deciphered the pyramid it pointed nowhere the old man sat straighter youve deciphered the pyramid katherine interceded now quickly explaining that despite bellamys warnings and her brothers request that langdon not unwrap the package she had done so feeling her first priority was to help her brother however she could she told the dean about the golden capstone albrecht dьrers magic square and how it decrypted the sixteenletter masonic cipher into the phrase jeova sanctus unus thats all it says the dean asked one true god yes sir langdon replied apparently the pyramid is more of a metaphorical map than a geographic one the dean held out his hands let me feel it langdon unzipped his bag and pulled out the pyramid which he carefully hoisted up on the desk setting it directly in front of the reverend langdon and katherine watched as the old mans frail hands examined every inch of the stone the engraved side the smooth base and the truncated top when he was finished he held out his hands again and the capstone langdon retrieved the small stone box set it on the desk and opened the lid then he removed the capstone and placed it into the old mans waiting hands the dean performed a similar examination feeling every inch pausing on the capstones engraving apparently having some trouble reading the small elegantly inscribed text the secret hides within the order langdon offered and the words the and order are capitalized the old mans face was expressionless as he positioned the capstone on top of the pyramid and aligned it by sense of touch he seemed to pause a moment as if in prayer and reverently ran his palms over the complete pyramid several times then he reached out and located the cubeshaped box taking it in his hands feeling it carefully his fingers probing inside and out when he was done he set down the box and leaned back in his chair so tell me he demanded his voice suddenly stern why have you come to me the question took langdon off guard we came sir because you told us to and mr bellamy said we should trust you and yet you did not trust him im sorry the deans white eyes stared directly through langdon the package containing the capstone was sealed mr bellamy told you not to open it and yet you did in addition peter solomon himself told you not to open it and yet you did sir katherine intervened we were trying to help my brother the man who has him demanded we decipher i can appreciate that the dean declared and yet what have you achieved by opening the package nothing peters captor is looking for a location and he will not be satisfied with the answer of jeova sanctus unus i agree langdon said but unfortunately thats all the pyramid says as i mentioned the map seems to be more figurative than youre mistaken professor the dean said the masonic pyramid is a real map it points to a real location you do not understand that because you have not yet deciphered the pyramid fully not even close langdon and katherine exchanged startled looks the dean laid his hands back on the pyramid almost caressing it this map like the ancient mysteries themselves has many layers of meaning its true secret remains veiled from you dean galloway langdon said weve been over every inch of the pyramid and capstone and theres nothing else to see not in its current state no but objects change sir professor as you know the promise of this pyramid is one of miraculous transformative power legend holds that this pyramid can change its shape alter its physical form to reveal its secrets like the famed stone that released excalibur into the hands of king arthur the masonic pyramid can transform itself if it so chooses and reveal its secret to the worthy langdon now sensed that the old mans advanced years had perhaps robbed him of his faculties im sorry sir are you saying this pyramid can undergo a literal physical transformation professor if i were to reach out with my hand and transform this pyramid right before your eyes would you believe what you had witnessed langdon had no idea how to respond i suppose i would have no choice very well then in a moment i shall do exactly that he dabbed his mouth again let me remind you that there was an era when even the brightest minds perceived the earth as flat for if the earth were round then surely the oceans would spill off imagine how they would have mocked you if you proclaimed not only is the world a sphere but there is an invisible mystical force that holds everything to its surface theres a difference langdon said between the existence of gravity and the ability to transform objects with a touch of your hand is there is it not possible that we are still living in the dark ages still mocking the suggestion of mystical forces that we cannot see or comprehend history if it has taught us anything at all has taught us that the strange ideas we deride today will one day be our celebrated truths i claim i can transform this pyramid with a touch of my finger and you question my sanity i would expect more from an historian history is replete with great minds who have all proclaimed the same thing great minds who have all insisted that man possesses mystical abilities of which he is unaware langdon knew the dean was correct the famous hermetic aphorism know ye not that ye are gods was one of the pillars of the ancient mysteries as above so below man created in gods image apotheosis this persistent message of mans own divinity of his hidden potential was the recurring theme in the ancient texts of countless traditions even the holy bible cried out in psalms ye are gods professor the old man said i realize that you like many educated people live trapped between worlds one foot in the spiritual one foot in the physical your heart yearns to believe but your intellect refuses to permit it as an academic you would be wise to learn from the great minds of history he paused and cleared his throat if im remembering correctly one of the greatest minds ever to live proclaimed that which is impenetrable to us really exists behind the secrets of nature remains something subtle intangible and inexplicable veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion who said that langdon said gandhi no katherine interjected albert einstein katherine solomon had read every word einstein had ever written and was struck by his profound respect for the mystical as well as his predictions that the masses would one day feel the same the religion of the future einstein had predicted will be a cosmic religion it will transcend personal god and avoid dogma and theology robert langdon appeared to be struggling with the idea katherine could sense his rising frustration with the old episcopal priest and she understood after all they had traveled here for answers and they had found instead a blind man who claimed he could transform objects with a touch of his hands even so the old mans overt passion for mystical forces reminded katherine of her brother father galloway katherine said peter is in trouble the cia is chasing us and warren bellamy sent us to you for help i dont know what this pyramid says or where it points but if deciphering it means that we can help peter we need to do that mr bellamy may have preferred to sacrifice my brothers life to hide this pyramid but my family has experienced nothing but pain because of it whatever secret it may hold it ends tonight you are correct the old man replied his tone dire it will all end tonight youve guaranteed that he sighed ms solomon when you broke the seal on that box you set in motion a series of events from which there will be no return there are forces at work tonight that you do not yet comprehend there is no turning back katherine stared dumbfounded at the reverend there was something apocalyptic about his tone as if he were referring to the seven seals of revelation or pandoras box respectfully sir langdon interceded i cant imagine how a stone pyramid could set in motion anything at all of course you cant professor the old man stared blindly through him you do not yet have eyes to see chapter in the moist air of the jungle the architect of the capitol could feel the sweat now rolling down his back his handcuffed wrists ached but all of his attention remained riveted on the ominous titanium briefcase that sato had just opened on the bench between them the contents of this case sato had told him will persuade you to see things my way i guarantee it the tiny asian woman had unclasped the metal case away from bellamys line of sight and he had yet to see its contents but his imagination was running wild satos hands were doing something inside the case and bellamy half expected her to extract a series of glistening razorsharp tools suddenly a light source flickered inside the case growing brighter illuminating satos face from beneath her hands kept moving inside and the light changed hue after a few moments she removed her hands grasped the entire case and turned it toward bellamy so he could see inside bellamy found himself squinting into the glow of what appeared to be some kind of futuristic laptop with a handheld phone receiver two antennae and a double keyboard his initial surge of relief turned quickly to confusion the screen bore the cia logo and the text secure login user inoue sato security clearance level beneath the laptops login window a progress icon was spinning one moment please decrypting file bellamys gaze shot back up to sato whose eyes were locked on his i had not wanted to show you this she said but youve left me no choice the screen flickered again and bellamy glanced back down as the file opened its contents filling the entire lcd for several moments bellamy stared at the screen trying to make sense of what he was looking at gradually as it began to dawn on him he felt the blood draining from his face he stared in horror unable to look away but this is impossible he exclaimed how could this be satos face was grim you tell me mr bellamy you tell me as the architect of the capitol began to fully comprehend the ramifications of what he was seeing he could feel his entire world teetering precariously on the brink of disaster my god ive made a terrible terrible mistake chapter dean galloway felt alive like all mortals he knew the time was coming when he would shed his mortal shell but tonight was not the night his corporeal heart was beating strong and fast and his mind felt sharp there is work to be done as he ran his arthritic hands across the pyramids smooth surfaces he could scarcely believe what he was feeling i never imagined i would live to witness this moment for generations the pieces of the symbolon map had been kept safely apart from one another now they were united at last galloway wondered if this was the foretold time strangely fate had selected two nonmasons to assemble the pyramid somehow this seemed fitting the mysteries are moving out of the inner circles out of darkness into the light professor he said turning his head in the direction of langdons breathing did peter tell you why he wanted you to watch over the little package he said powerful people wanted to steal it from him langdon replied the dean nodded yes peter told me the same thing he did katherine said suddenly on his left you and my brother spoke about this pyramid of course galloway said your brother and i have spoken on many things i was once the worshipful master at the house of the temple and he comes to me for guidance at times it was about a year ago that he came to me deeply troubled he sat exactly where you are now and he asked me if i believed in supernatural premonitions premonitions katherine sounded concerned you mean like visions not exactly it was more visceral peter said he was feeling the growing presence of a dark force in his life he sensed something was watching him waiting intending to do him great harm obviously he was right katherine said considering that the same man who killed our mother and peters son had come to washington and become one of peters own masonic brothers true langdon said but it doesnt explain the involvement of the cia galloway was not so sure men in power are always interested in greater power but the cia langdon challenged and mystical secrets something doesnt add up sure it does katherine said the cia thrives on technological advancement and has always experimented with the mystical sciences esp remote viewing sensory deprivation pharmacologically induced highly mentalized states its all the same thing tapping the unseen potential of the human mind if theres one thing ive learned from peter its this science and mysticism are very closely related distinguishable only by their approaches they have identical goals but different methods peter tells me galloway said that your field of study is a kind of modern mystical science noetics katherine said nodding and its proving man has powers unlike anything we can imagine she motioned to a stainedglass window depicting the familiar image of the luminous jesus that of christ with rays of light flowing from his head and hands in fact i just used a supercooled chargecoupled device to photograph the hands of a faith healer at work the photos looked a lot like the image of jesus in your stainedglass window streams of energy pouring through the healers fingertips the welltrained mind galloway thought hiding a smile how do you think jesus healed the sick i realize katherine said that modern medicine ridicules healers and shamans but i saw this with my own eyes my ccd cameras clearly photographed this man transmitting a massive energy field from his fingertips and literally changing the cellular makeup of his patient if thats not godlike power then i dont know what is dean galloway let himself smile katherine had the same fiery passion as her brother peter once compared noetic scientists to the early explorers who were mocked for embracing the heretical notion of a spherical earth almost overnight these explorers went from fools to heroes discovering uncharted worlds and expanding the horizons of everyone on the planet peter thinks you will do this as well he has very high hopes for your work after all every great philosophical shift in history began with a single bold idea galloway knew of course that one neednt go to a lab to witness proof of this bold new idea this proposal of mans untapped potential this very cathedral held healing prayer circles for the sick and repeatedly had witnessed truly miraculous results medically documented physical transformations the question was not whether god had imbued man with great powers but rather how we liberate those powers the old dean placed his hands reverently around the sides of the masonic pyramid and spoke very quietly my friends i do not know exactly where this pyramid points but i do know this there is a great spiritual treasure buried out there somewhere a treasure that has waited patiently in darkness for generations i believe it is a catalyst that has the power to transform this world he now touched the golden tip of the capstone and now that this pyramid is assembled the time is fast approaching and why shouldnt it the promise of a great transformational enlightenment has been prophesied forever father langdon said his tone challenging were all familiar with the revelation of saint john and the literal meaning of the apocalypse but biblical prophecy hardly seems oh heavens the book of revelation is a mess the dean said nobody knows how to read that im talking about clear minds writing in clear language the predictions of saint augustine sir francis bacon newton einstein the list goes on and on all anticipating a transformative moment of enlightenment even jesus himself said nothing is hidden that will not be made known nor secret that will not come to light its a safe prediction to make langdon said knowledge grows exponentially the more we know the greater our ability to learn and the faster we expand our knowledge base yes katherine added we see this in science all the time each new technology we invent becomes a tool with which to invent new technologies and it snowballs thats why science has advanced more in the last five years than in the previous five thousand exponential growth mathematically as time passes the exponential curve of progress becomes almost vertical and new development occurs incredibly fast silence fell in the deans office and galloway sensed that his two guests still had no idea how this pyramid could possibly help them reveal anything further that is why fate brought you to me he thought i have a role to play for many years the reverend colin galloway along with his masonic brothers had played the role of gatekeeper now it was all changing i am no longer a gatekeeper i am a guide professor langdon galloway said reaching out across his desk take my hand if you will robert langdon felt uncertain as he stared across at dean galloways outstretched palm are we going to pray politely langdon reached out and placed his right hand in the deans withered hand the old man grasped it firmly but did not begin to pray instead he found langdons index finger and guided it downward into the stone box that had once housed the golden capstone your eyes have blinded you the dean said if you saw with your fingertips as i do you would realize this box has something left to teach you dutifully langdon worked his fingertip around the inside of the box but he felt nothing the inside was perfectly smooth keep looking galloway prompted finally langdons fingertip felt something a tiny raised circle a minuscule dot in the center of the base of the box he removed his hand and peered inside the little circle was virtually invisible to the naked eye what is that do you recognize that symbol galloway asked symbol langdon replied i can barely see anything at all push down on it langdon did as he asked pressing his fingertip down onto the spot what does he think will happen hold your finger down the dean said apply pressure langdon glanced over at katherine who looked puzzled as she tucked a wisp of hair behind her ears a few seconds later the old dean finally nodded okay remove your hand the alchemy is complete alchemy robert langdon removed his hand from the stone box and sat in bewildered silence nothing had changed at all the box just sat there on the desk nothing langdon said look at your fingertip the dean replied you should see a transformation langdon looked at his finger but the only transformation he could see was that he now had an indentation on his skin made by the circular nubbin a tiny circle with a dot in the middle now do you recognize this symbol the dean asked although langdon recognized the symbol he was more impressed that the dean had been able to feel the detail of it seeing with ones fingertips was apparently a learned skill its alchemical katherine said sliding her chair closer and examining langdons finger its the ancient symbol for gold indeed it is the dean smiled and patted the box professor congratulations you have just achieved what every alchemist in history has strived for from a worthless substance youve created gold langdon frowned unimpressed the little parlor trick seemed to be no help at all an interesting idea sir but im afraid this symbol a circle with a round dot in the middle has dozens of meanings its called a circumpunct and its one of the most widely used symbols in history what are you talking about the dean asked sounding skeptical langdon was stunned that a mason was not more familiar with the spiritual importance of this symbol sir the circumpunct has countless meanings in ancient egypt it was the symbol for ra the sun god and modern astronomy still uses it as the solar symbol in eastern philosophy it represents the spiritual insight of the third eye the divine rose and the sign of illumination the kabbalists use it to symbolize the kether the highest sephiroth and the most hidden of all hidden things early mystics called it the eye of god and its the origin of the allseeing eye on the great seal the pythagoreans used the circumpunct as the symbol of the monad the divine truth the prisca sapientia the atonement of mind and soul and the enough dean galloway was chuckling now professor thank you you are correct of course langdon now realized he had just been played he knew all that the circumpunct galloway said still smiling to himself is essentially the symbol of the ancient mysteries for this reason i would suggest that its presence in this box is not mere coincidence legend holds that the secrets of this map are hidden in the smallest of details fine katherine said but even if this symbol was inscribed there intentionally it doesnt bring us any closer to deciphering the map does it you mentioned earlier that the wax seal you broke was embossed with peters ring thats correct and you said you have that ring with you i do langdon reached into his pocket found the ring took it out of the plastic bag and placed it on the desk in front of the dean galloway picked up the ring and began feeling its surfaces this unique ring was created at the same time as the masonic pyramid and traditionally it is worn by the mason in charge of protecting the pyramid tonight when i felt the tiny circumpunct on the bottom of the stone box i realized that the ring is in fact part of the symbolon it is im certain of it peter is my closest friend and he wore this ring for many years i am quite familiar with it he handed the ring to langdon see for yourself langdon took the ring and examined it running his fingers over the doubleheaded phoenix the number the words ordo ab chao and also the words all is revealed at the thirtythird degree he felt nothing helpful then as his fingers traced down around the outside of the band he stopped short startled he turned the ring over and eyed the very bottom of its band did you find it galloway said i think so yes langdon said katherine slid her chair closer what the degree sign on the band langdon said showing her its so small that you dont really notice it with your eyes but if you feel it you can tell its actually indented like a tiny circular incision the degree sign was centered on the bottom of the band and admittedly looked to be the same size as the raised nubbin in the bottom of the cube is it the same size katherine moved closer still sounding excited now theres one way to find out he took the ring and lowered it into the box aligning the two tiny circles as he pushed down the raised circle on the box slid into the rings opening and there was a faint but decisive click they all jumped langdon waited but nothing happened what was that the priest said nothing katherine replied the ring locked into place but nothing else happened no great transformation galloway looked puzzled were not done langdon realized gazing down at the rings embossed insignia a doubleheaded phoenix and the number all is revealed at the thirtythird degree his mind filled with thoughts of pythagoras sacred geometry and angles he wondered if perhaps degrees had a mathematical meaning slowly heart beating faster now he reached down and grasped the ring which was affixed to the base of the cube then slowly he began turning the ring to the right all is revealed at the thirtythird degree he turned the ring ten degrees twenty degrees thirty degrees what happened next langdon never saw coming chapter transformation dean galloway heard it happen and so he didnt need to see it across the desk from him langdon and katherine were dead silent no doubt staring in mute astonishment at the stone cube which had just transformed itself loudly before their very eyes galloway couldnt help but smile he had anticipated the result and although he still had no idea how this development would ultimately help them solve the riddle of the pyramid he was enjoying the rare chance to teach a harvard symbologist something about symbols professor the dean said few people realize that the masons venerate the shape of the cube or ashlar as we call it because it is a threedimensional representation of another symbol a much older twodimensional symbol galloway didnt need to ask if the professor recognized the ancient symbol now lying before them on the desk it was one of the most famous symbols in the world robert langdons thoughts churned as he stared at the transformed box on the desk in front of him i had no idea moments ago he had reached into the stone box grasped the masonic ring and gently turned it as he rotated the ring through thirtythree degrees the cube had suddenly changed before his eyes the square panels that made up the sides of the box fell away from one another as their hidden hinges released the box collapsed all at once its side panels and lid falling outward slapping loudly on the desk the cube becomes a cross langdon thought symbolic alchemy katherine looked bewildered by the sight of the collapsed cube the masonic pyramid relates to christianity for a moment langdon had wondered the same thing after all the christian crucifix was a respected symbol within the masons and certainly there were plenty of christian masons however masons were also jews muslims buddhists hindus and those who had no name for their god the presence of an exclusively christian symbol seemed restrictive then the true meaning of this symbol had dawned on him its not a crucifix langdon said standing up now the cross with the circumpunct in the middle is a binary symbol two symbols fused to create one what are you saying katherines eyes followed him as he paced the room the cross langdon said was not a christian symbol until the fourth century long before that it was used by the egyptians to represent the intersection of two dimensions the human and the celestial as above so below it was a visual representation of the juncture where man and god become one okay the circumpunct langdon said we already know has many meanings one of its most esoteric being the rose the alchemical symbol for perfection but when you place a rose on the center of a cross you create another symbol entirely the rose cross galloway reclined in his chair smiling my my now youre cooking katherine stood now too what am i missing the rose cross langdon explained is a common symbol in freemasonry in fact one of the degrees of the scottish rite is called knights of the rose cross and honors the early rosicrucians who contributed to masonic mystical philosophy peter may have mentioned the rosicrucians to you dozens of great scientists were members john dee elias ashmole robert fludd absolutely katherine said ive read all of the rosicrucian manifestos in my research every scientist should langdon thought the order of the rose cross or more formally the ancient and mystical order rosae crucis had an enigmatic history that had greatly influenced science and closely paralleled the legend of the ancient mysteries early sages possessing secret wisdom that was passed down through the ages and studied by only the brightest minds admittedly historys list of famous rosicrucians was a whos who of european renaissance luminaries paracelsus bacon fludd descartes pascal spinoza newton leibniz according to rosicrucian doctrine the order was built on esoteric truths of the ancient past truths which had to be concealed from the average man and which promised great insight into the spiritual realm the brotherhoods symbol had blossomed over the years into a flowering rose on an ornate cross but it had begun as a more modest dotted circle on an unadorned cross the simplest manifestation of the rose on the simplest manifestation of the cross peter and i often discuss rosicrucian philosophy galloway told katherine as the dean began outlining the interrelationship between masonry and rosicrucianism langdon felt his attention drawn back to the same nagging thought hed had all night jeova sanctus unus this phrase is linked to alchemy somehow he still could not remember exactly what peter had told him about the phrase but for some reason the mention of rosicrucianism seemed to have rekindled the thought think robert the rosicrucian founder galloway was saying was allegedly a german mystic who went by the name christian rosenkreuz a pseudonym obviously perhaps even for francis bacon who some historians believe founded the group himself although there is no proof of a pseudonym langdon declared suddenly startling even himself thats it jeova sanctus unus its a pseudonym what are you talking about katherine demanded langdons pulse had quickened now all night ive been trying to remember what peter told me about jeova sanctus unus and its relationship to alchemy finally i remembered its not about alchemy so much as about an alchemist a very famous alchemist galloway chuckled its about time professor i mentioned his name twice and also the word pseudonym langdon stared at the old dean you knew well i had my suspicions when you told me the engraving said jeova sanctus unus and had been decrypted using dьrers alchemical magic square but when you found the rose cross i was certain as you probably know the personal papers of the scientist in question included a very heavily annotated copy of the rosicrucian manifestos who katherine asked one of the worlds greatest scientists langdon replied he was an alchemist a member of the royal society of london a rosicrucian and he signed some of his most secretive science papers with a pseudonym jeova sanctus unus one true god katherine said modest guy brilliant guy actually galloway corrected he signed his name that way because like the ancient adepts he understood himself as divine in addition because the sixteen letters in jeova sanctus unus could be rearranged to spell his name in latin making it a perfect pseudonym katherine now looked puzzled jeova sanctus unus is an anagram of a famous alchemists name in latin langdon grabbed a piece of paper and pencil off the deans desk writing as he talked latin interchanges the letters j for i and the letter v for u which means jeova sanctus unus can actually be perfectly rearranged to spell this mans name langdon wrote down sixteen letters isaacus neutonuus he handed the slip of paper to katherine and said i think youve heard of him isaac newton katherine demanded looking at the paper thats what the engraving on the pyramid was trying to tell us for a moment langdon was back in westminster abbey standing at newtons pyramidical tomb where he had experienced a similar epiphany and tonight the great scientist surfaces again it was no coincidence of course the pyramids mysteries science hidden knowledge it was all intertwined newtons name had always been a recurring guidepost for those seeking secret knowledge isaac newton galloway said must have something to do with how to decipher the meaning of the pyramid i cant imagine what it would be but genius katherine exclaimed her eyes going wide thats how we transform the pyramid you understand langdon said yes she said i cant believe we didnt see it it has been staring us right in the face a simple alchemical process i can transform this pyramid using basic science newtonian science langdon strained to understand dean galloway katherine said if you read the ring it says stop the old dean suddenly raised his finger in the air and motioned for silence gently he cocked his head to the side as if he were listening to something after a moment he stood up abruptly my friends this pyramid obviously has secrets left to reveal i dont know what ms solomon is getting at but if she knows your next step then i have played my role pack up your things and say no more to me leave me in darkness for the moment i would prefer to have no information to share should our visitors try to force me visitors katherine said listening i dont hear anyone you will galloway said heading for the door hurry across town a cell tower was attempting to contact a phone that lay in pieces on massachusetts avenue finding no signal it redirected the call to voice mail robert warren bellamys panicked voice shouted where are you call me something terrible is happening chapter in the cerulean glow of his basement lights malakh stood at the stone table and continued his preparations as he worked his empty stomach growled he paid no heed his days of servitude to the whims of his flesh were behind him transformation requires sacrifice like many of historys most spiritually evolved men malakh had committed to his path by making the noblest of flesh sacrifices castration had been less painful than he had imagined and he had learned far more common every year thousands of men underwent surgical gelding orchiectomy as the process was known their motivations ranging from transgender issues to curbing sexual addictions to deepseated spiritual beliefs for malakh the reasons were of the highest nature like the mythological selfcastrated attis malakh knew that achieving immortality required a clean break with the material world of male and female the androgyne is one nowadays eunuchs were shunned although the ancients understood the inherent power of this transmutational sacrifice even the early christians had heard jesus himself extol its virtues in matthew there are those who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven he who is able to accept this let him accept it peter solomon had made a flesh sacrifice although a single hand was a small price in the grand scheme by nights end however solomon would be sacrificing much much more in order to create i must destroy such was the nature of polarity peter solomon of course deserved the fate that awaited him tonight it would be a fitting end long ago he had played the pivotal role in malakhs mortal life path for this reason peter had been chosen to play the pivotal role in malakhs great transformation this man had earned all the horror and pain he was about to endure peter solomon was not the man the world believed he was he sacrificed his own son peter solomon had once presented his son zachary with an impossible choice wealth or wisdom zachary chose poorly the boys decision had begun a chain of events that eventually dragged the young man into the depths of hell soganlik prison zachary solomon had died in that turkish prison the whole world knew the story but what they didnt know was that peter solomon could have saved his son i was there malakh thought i heard it all malakh had never forgotten that night solomons brutal decision had meant the end of his son zach but it had been the birth of malakh some must die that others may live as the light over malakhs head began changing color again he realized the hour was late he completed his preparations and headed back up the ramp it was time to attend to matters of the mortal world chapter all isrevealed at the thirtythird degree katherine thought as she ran i know how to transform the pyramid the answer had been right in front of them all night katherine and langdon were alone now dashing through the cathedrals annex following signs for the garth now exactly as the dean had promised they burst out of the cathedral into a massive walledin courtyard the cathedral garth was a cloistered pentagonal garden with a bronze postmodern fountain katherine was amazed how loudly the fountains flowing water seemed to be reverberating in the courtyard then she realized it was not the fountain she was hearing helicopter she shouted as a beam of light pierced the night sky above them get under that portico the dazzling glare of a searchlight flooded the garth just as langdon and katherine reached the other side slipping beneath a gothic arch into a tunnel that led to the outside lawn they waited huddled in the tunnel as the helicopter passed overhead and began circling the cathedral in wide arcs i guess galloway was right about hearing visitors katherine said impressed bad eyes make for great ears her own ears now pounded rhythmically with her racing pulse this way langdon said clutching his daybag and moving through the passage dean galloway had given them a single key and a clear set of directions unfortunately when they reached the end of the short tunnel they found themselves separated from their destination by a wideopen expanse of lawn currently flooded with light from the helicopter overhead we cant get across katherine said hold on look langdon pointed to a black shadow that was materializing on the lawn to their left the shadow began as an amorphous blob but it was growing quickly moving in their direction becoming more defined rushing at them faster and faster stretching and finally transforming itself into a massive black rectangle crowned by two impossibly tall spires the cathedral facade is blocking the searchlight langdon said theyre landing out in front langdon grabbed katherines hand run now inside the cathedral dean galloway felt a lightness in his step that he had not felt in years he moved through the great crossing down the nave toward the narthex and the front doors he could hear the helicopter hovering in front of the cathedral now and he imagined its lights coming through the rose window in front of him throwing spectacular colors all over the sanctuary he recalled the days when he could see color ironically the lightless void that had become his world had illuminated many things for him i see more clearly now than ever galloway had been called to god as a young man and over his lifetime had loved the church as much as any man could like many of his colleagues who had given their lives in earnest to god galloway was weary he had spent his life straining to be heard above the din of ignorance what did i expect from the crusades to the inquisition to american politics the name jesus had been hijacked as an ally in all kinds of power struggles since the beginning of time the ignorant had always screamed the loudest herding the unsuspecting masses and forcing them to do their bidding they defended their worldly desires by citing scripture they did not understand they celebrated their intolerance as proof of their convictions now after all these years mankind had finally managed to utterly erode everything that had once been so beautiful about jesus tonight encountering the symbol of the rose cross had fueled him with great hope reminding him of the prophecies written in the rosicrucian manifestos which galloway had read countless times in the past and could still recall chapter one jehova will redeem humanity by revealing those secrets which he previously reserved only for the elect chapter four the whole world shall become as one book and all the contradictions of science and theology shall be reconciled chapter seven before the end of the world god shall create a great flood of spiritual light to alleviate the suffering of humankind chapter eight before this revelation is possible the world must sleep away the intoxication of her poisoned chalice which was filled with the false life of the theological vine galloway knew the church had long ago lost her way and he had dedicated his life to righting her course now he realized the moment was fast approaching it is always darkest before the dawn cia field agent turner simkins was perched on the strut of the sikorsky helicopter as it touched down on the frosty grass he leaped off joined by his men and immediately waved the chopper back up into the air to keep an eye on all the exits nobody leaves this building as the chopper rose back into the night sky simkins and his team ran up the stairs to the cathedrals main entrance before he could decide which of the six doors to pound on one of them swung open yes a calm voice said from the shadows simkins could barely make out the hunched figure in priests robes are you dean colin galloway i am the old man replied im looking for robert langdon have you seen him the old man stepped forward now staring past simkins with eerie blank eyes now wouldnt that be a miracle chapter time isrunning out security analyst nola kaye was already on edge and the third mug of coffee she was now drinking had begun coursing through her like an electric current no word yet from sato finally her phone rang and nola leaped on it os she answered nola here nola its rick parrish in systems security nola slumped no sato hi rick what can i do for you i wanted to give you a headsup our department may have information relevant to what youre working on tonight nola set down her coffee how the hell do you know what im working on tonight i beg your pardon sorry its the new ci program were betatesting parrish said it keeps flagging your workstation number nola now realized what he was talking about the agency was currently running a new piece of collaborative integration software designed to provide realtime alerts to disparate cia departments when they happened to be processing related data fields in an era of timesensitive terrorist threats the key to thwarting disaster was often as simple as a headsup telling you that the guy down the hall was analyzing the very data you needed as far as nola was concerned this ci software had proven more of a distraction than any real help constant interruption software she called it right i forgot nola said what have you got she was positive that nobody else in the building knew about this crisis much less could be working on it the only computer work nola had done tonight was historical research for sato on esoteric masonic topics nonetheless she was obliged to play the game well its probably nothing parrish said but we stopped a hacker tonight and the ci program keeps suggesting i share the information with you a hacker nola sipped her coffee im listening about an hour ago parrish said we snagged a guy named zoubianis trying to access a file on one of our internal databases this guy claims it was a job for hire and that he has no idea why he was being paid to access this particular file or even that it was on a cia server okay we finished questioning him and hes clean but heres the weird thing the same file he was targeting had been flagged earlier tonight by an internal search engine it looks like someone piggybacked into our system ran a specific keyword search and generated a redaction the thing is the keywords they used are really strange and theres one in particular that the ci flagged as a highpriority match one thats unique to both of our data sets he paused do you know the word symbolon nola jolted upright spilling coffee on her desk the other keywords are just as unusual parrish continued pyramid portal get down here nola commanded mopping up her desk and bring everything youve got these words actually mean something to you now chapter cathedral college is an elegant castlelike edifice located adjacent to the national cathedral the college of preachers as it was originally envisioned by the first episcopal bishop of washington was founded to provide ongoing education for clergy after their ordination today the college offers a wide variety of programs on theology global justice healing and spirituality langdon and katherine had made the dash across the lawn and used galloways key to slip inside just as the helicopter rose back over the cathedral its floodlights turning night back into day now standing breathless inside the foyer they surveyed their surroundings the windows provided sufficient illumination and langdon saw no reason to turn the lights on and take a chance of broadcasting their whereabouts to the helicopter overhead as they moved down the central hallway they passed a series of conference halls classrooms and sitting areas the interior reminded langdon of the neogothic buildings of yale university breathtaking on the outside and yet surprisingly utilitarian on the inside their period elegance having been retrofitted to endure heavy foot traffic down here katherine said motioning toward the far end of the hall katherine had yet to share with langdon her new revelation regarding the pyramid but apparently the reference to isaacus neutonuus had sparked it all she had said as they crossed the lawn was that the pyramid could be transformed using simple science everything she needed she believed could probably be found in this building langdon had no idea what she needed or how katherine intended to transform a solid piece of granite or gold but considering he had just witnessed a cube metamorphose into a rosicrucian cross he was willing to have faith they reached the end of the hall and katherine frowned apparently not seeing what she wanted you said this building has dormitory facilities yes for residential conferences so they must have a kitchen in here somewhere right youre hungry she frowned back at him no i need a lab of course you do langdon spotted a descending staircase that bore a promising symbol americas favorite pictogram the basement kitchen was industrial looking lots of stainless steel and big bowls clearly designed to cook for large groups the kitchen had no windows katherine closed the door and flipped on the lights the exhaust fans came on automatically she began rooting around in the cupboards for whatever it was she needed robert she directed put the pyramid out on the island if you would feeling like the novice sous chef taking orders from daniel boulud langdon did as he was told removing the pyramid from his bag and placing the gold capstone on top of it when he finished katherine was busy filling an enormous pot with hot tap water would you please lift this to the stove for me langdon heaved the sloshing pot onto the stove as katherine turned on the gas burner and cranked up the flame are we doing lobsters he asked hopefully very funny no were doing alchemy and for the record this is a pasta pot not a lobster pot she pointed to the perforated strainer insert that she had removed from the pot and placed on the island beside the pyramid silly me and boiling pasta is going to help us decipher the pyramid katherine ignored the comment her tone turning serious as im sure you know there is a historical and symbolic reason the masons chose thirtythree as their highest degree of course langdon said in the days of pythagoras six centuries before christ the tradition of numerology hailed the number as the highest of all the master numbers it was the most sacred figure symbolizing divine truth the tradition lived on within the masons and elsewhere it was no coincidence that christians were taught that jesus was crucified at age thirtythree despite no real historical evidence to that effect nor was it coincidence that joseph was said to have been thirtythree when he married the virgin mary or that jesus accomplished thirtythree miracles or that gods name was mentioned thirtythree times in genesis or that in islam all the dwellers of heaven were permanently thirtythree years old thirtythree katherine said is a sacred number in many mystical traditions correct langdon still had no idea what this had to do with a pasta pot so it should come as no surprise to you that an early alchemist rosicrucian and mystic like isaac newton also considered the number thirtythree special im sure he did langdon replied newton was deep into numerology prophecy and astrology but what does all is revealed at the thirtythird degree langdon pulled peters ring from his pocket and read the inscription then he glanced back at the pot of water sorry you lost me robert earlier tonight we all assumed thirtythird degree referred to the masonic degree and yet when we rotated that ring thirtythree degrees the cube transformed and revealed a cross at that moment we realized the word degree was being used in another sense yes degrees of arc exactly but degree has a third meaning as well langdon eyed the pot of water on the stove temperature exactly she said it was right in front of us all night all is revealed at the thirtythird degree if we bring this pyramids temperature to thirtythree degrees it may just reveal something langdon knew katherine solomon was exceptionally bright and yet she seemed to be missing a rather obvious point if im not mistaken thirtythree degrees is almost freezing shouldnt we be putting the pyramid in the freezer katherine smiled not if we want to follow the recipe written by the great alchemist and rosicrucian mystic who signed his papers jeova sanctus unus isaacus neutonuus wrote recipes robert temperature is the fundamental alchemical catalyst and it was not always measured in fahrenheit and celsius there are far older temperature scales one of them invented by isaac the newton scale langdon said realizing she was right yes isaac newton invented an entire system of quantifying temperature based entirely on natural phenomena the temperature of melting ice was newtons base point and he called it the zeroth degree she paused i suppose you can guess what degree he assigned the temperature of boiling water the king of all alchemical processes thirtythree yes thirtythree the thirtythird degree on the newton scale the temperature of boiling water is thirtythree degrees i remember asking my brother once why newton chose that number i mean it seemed so random boiling water is the most fundamental alchemical process and he chose thirtythree why not a hundred why not something more elegant peter explained that to a mystic like isaac newton there was no number more elegant than thirtythree all is revealed at the thirtythird degree langdon glanced at the pot of water and then over at the pyramid katherine the pyramid is made out of solid granite and solid gold do you really think boiling water is hot enough to transform it the smile on her face told langdon that katherine knew something he did not know confidently she walked over to the island lifted the goldcapped granite pyramid and set it in the strainer then she carefully lowered it into the bubbling water lets find out shall we high above the national cathedral the cia pilot locked the helicopter in autohover mode and surveyed the perimeter of the building and the grounds no movement his thermal imaging couldnt penetrate the cathedral stone and so he couldnt tell what the team was doing inside but if anyone tried to slip out the thermal would pick it up it was sixty seconds later that a thermal sensor pinged working on the same principle as homesecurity systems the detector had identified a strong temperature differential usually this meant a human form moving through a cool space but what appeared on the monitor was more of a thermal cloud a patch of hot air drifting across the lawn the pilot found the source an active vent on the side of cathedral college probably nothing he thought he saw these kinds of gradients all the time someone cooking or doing laundry as he was about to turn away though he realized something odd there were no cars in the parking lot and no lights on anywhere in the building he studied the uhs imaging system for a long moment then he radioed down to his team leader simkins its probably nothing but incandescent temperature indicator langdon had to admit it was clever its simple science katherine said different substances incandesce at different temperatures we call them thermal markers science uses these markers all the time langdon gazed down at the submerged pyramid and capstone wisps of steam were beginning to curl over the bubbling water although he was not feeling hopeful he glanced at his watch and his heart rate accelerated pm you believe something here will luminesce as it heats up not luminesce robert incandesce theres a big difference incandescence is caused by heat and it occurs at a specific temperature for example when steel manufacturers temper beams they spray a grid on them with a transparent coating that incandesces at a specific target temperature so they know when the beams are done think of a mood ring just put it on your finger and it changes color from body heat katherine this pyramid was built in the s i can understand a craftsman making hidden release hinges in a stone box but applying some kind of transparent thermal coating perfectly feasible she said glancing hopefully at the submerged pyramid the early alchemists used organic phosphors all the time as thermal markers the chinese made colored fireworks and even the egyptians katherine stopped midsentence staring intently into the roiling water what langdon followed her gaze into the turbulent water but saw nothing at all katherine leaned in staring more intently into the water suddenly she turned and ran across the kitchen toward the door where are you going langdon shouted she slid to a stop at the kitchen light switch flipped it off the lights and exhaust fan went off plunging the room into total darkness and silence langdon turned back to the pyramid and peered through the steam at the capstone beneath the water by the time katherine made it back to his side his mouth had fallen open in disbelief exactly as katherine had predicted a small section of the metal capstone was starting to glow beneath the water letters were starting to appear and they were getting brighter as the water heated up text katherine whispered langdon nodded dumbstruck the glowing words were materializing just beneath the engraved inscription on the capstone it looked like only three words and although langdon could not yet read what the words said he wondered if they would unveil everything they had been looking for tonight the pyramid is a real map galloway had told them and it points to a real location as the letters shone brighter katherine turned off the gas and the water slowly stopped churning the capstone now came into focus beneath the waters calm surface three shining words were clearly legible chapter in the dim light of the cathedral college kitchen langdon and katherine stood over the pot of water and stared at the transformed capstone beneath the surface on the side of the golden capstone an incandescent message was glowing langdon read the shining text scarcely able to believe his eyes he knew the pyramid was rumored to reveal a specific location but he had never imagined that the location would be quite this specific eight franklin square a street address he whispered stunned katherine looked equally amazed i dont know whats there do you langdon shook his head he knew franklin square was one of the older sections of washington but he wasnt familiar with the address he looked at the tip of the capstone and read downward taking in the entire text thesecret hideswithin the order eight franklin square is there some kind of order on franklin square is there a building that hides the opening to a deep spiral staircase whether or not there was actually something buried at that address langdon had no idea the important issue at this point was that he and katherine had deciphered the pyramid and now possessed the information required to negotiate peters release and not a moment too soon the glowing arms on langdons mickey mouse watch indicated that they had less than ten minutes to spare make the call katherine said motioning to a phone on the wall in the kitchen now the sudden arrival of this moment startled langdon and he found himself hesitating are we sure about this i most certainly am im not telling him anything until we know peter is safe of course not you remember the number right langdon nodded and made his way over to the kitchen phone he lifted the receiver and dialed the mans cellphone number katherine came over and placed her head next to his so she could listen in as the line began to ring langdon prepared himself for the eerie whisper of the man who had tricked him earlier tonight finally the call connected there was no greeting though no voice only the sound of breathing at the other end langdon waited and then finally spoke i have the information you want but if you want it youll have to give us peter who is this a womans voice replied langdon jumped robert langdon he said reflexively who are you for an instant he thought he must have dialed incorrectly your name is langdon the woman sounded surprised theres someone here asking for you what im sorry who is this officer paige montgomery with preferred security her voice seemed shaky maybe you can help us with this about an hour ago my partner responded to a call in kalorama heights a possible hostage situation i lost all contact with her and so i called backup and came to check the residence we found my partner dead in the backyard the home owner was gone and so we broke in a cell phone was ringing on the hall table and i youre inside langdon demanded yes and the tip was a good one the woman stammered sorry if i sound rattled but my partners dead and we found a man being held here against his will hes in bad shape and were working on him now hes been asking for two people one named langdon and one named katherine thats my brother katherine blurted into the receiver pressing her head closer to langdons i made the call is he okay actually maam hes the womans voice cracked hes in bad shape hes missing his right hand please katherine urged i want to talk to him theyre working on him at the moment hes in and out of consciousness if youre anywhere in the area you should get over here he obviously wants to see you were about six minutes away katherine said then i suggest you hurry there was a muffled noise in the background and the woman then returned to the line sorry it looks like im needed ill speak to you when you arrive the line went dead chapter inside cathedral college langdon and katherine bounded up the basement stairs and hurried down a darkened hallway looking for a front exit no longer did they hear the sounds of helicopter blades overhead and langdon felt hopeful they could slip out unseen and find their way up to kalorama heights to see peter they found him hes alive thirty seconds earlier when theyd hung up with the female security guard katherine had hurriedly hoisted the steaming pyramid and capstone out of the water the pyramid was still dripping when she lowered it into langdons leather bag now he could feel the heat radiating through the leather excitement over peters discovery had temporarily trumped any further reflection on the capstones glowing message eight franklin square but there would be time for that once they got to peter as they rounded the corner at the top of the stairs katherine stopped short and pointed into a sitting room across the hall through the bay window langdon could see a sleek black helicopter sitting silent on the lawn a lone pilot stood beside it facing away from them and talking on his radio there was also a black escalade with tinted windows parked nearby staying in the shadows langdon and katherine moved into the sitting room and peered out the window to see if they could see the rest of the field team thankfully the huge lawn outside the national cathedral was empty they must be inside the cathedral langdon said theyre not a deep voice said behind them langdon and katherine wheeled around to see who had spoken in the doorway of the sitting room two blackclad figures aimed lasersighted rifles at them langdon could see a glowing red dot dancing on his chest nice to see you again professor said a familiar raspy voice the agents parted and the tiny form of director sato sliced effortlessly through crossing the sitting room and stopping directly in front of langdon youve made some exceedingly poor choices tonight the police found peter solomon langdon declared forcefully hes in bad shape but hell live its over if sato was surprised peter had been found she did not show it her eyes were unflinching as she walked to langdon and stopped only inches away professor i can assure you this is nowhere near over and if the police are now involved it has only become more serious as i told you earlier this evening this is an extremely delicate situation you never should have run away with that pyramid maam katherine blurted i need to see my brother you can have the pyramid but you must let i must sato demanded spinning to katherine ms solomon i assume she stared at katherine with fire in her eyes and then turned back to langdon put the leather bag on the table langdon glanced down at the pair of laser sights on his chest he set the leather bag on the coffee table an agent approached cautiously unzipped the bag and pulled the two sides apart a little puff of trapped steam billowed up out of the bag he aimed his light inside stared for a long puzzled moment and then nodded to sato sato walked over and peered into the bag the wet pyramid and capstone glistened in the beam of the flashlight sato crouched down looking very closely at the golden capstone which langdon realized she had only seen in xray the inscription sato demanded does it mean anything to you the secret hides within the order were not sure maam why is the pyramid steaming hot we submerged it in boiling water katherine said without hesitation it was part of the process of deciphering the code well tell you everything but please let us go see my brother hes been through you boiled the pyramid sato demanded turn off the flashlight katherine said look at the capstone you can probably still see the agent flicked off his light and sato knelt down before the capstone even from where langdon was standing he could see that the text on the capstone was still glowing slightly eight franklin square sato said sounding amazed yes maam that text was written with an incandescent lacquer or something the thirtythird degree was actually and the address sato demanded is this what this guy wants yes langdon said he believes the pyramid is a map that will tell him the location of a great treasure the key to unlocking the ancient mysteries sato looked again at the capstone her expression one of disbelief tell me she said fear creeping into her voice have you contacted this man yet have you already given him this address we tried langdon explained what had happened when they called the mans cell phone sato listened running her tongue over her yellow teeth as he spoke despite looking ready to erupt with anger over the situation she turned to one of her agents and spoke in a restrained whisper send him in hes in the suv the agent nodded and spoke into his transceiver send who in langdon said the only person who has any hope of fixing the goddamn mess you made what mess langdon fired back now that peter is safe everything is for christs sake sato exploded this is not about peter i tried to tell you that at the capitol building professor but you chose to work against me rather than with me now youve made an ungodly mess when you destroyed your cell phone which by the way we were tracking you cut off your communication with this man and this address you uncovered whatever the hell it is this address was our one chance to catch this lunatic i needed you to play his game to provide him with this address so we would know where the hell to catch him before langdon could reply sato directed the remainder of her wrath at katherine and you ms solomon you knew where this maniac lived why didnt you tell me you sent a rentacop to this mans house dont you see youve ruined any chance we had of catching him there im glad your brother is safe but let me tell you this we are facing a crisis tonight whose ramifications far outreach your family they will be felt all around the world the man who took your brother has enormous power and we need to catch him immediately as she finished her tirade the tall elegant silhouette of warren bellamy emerged from the shadows and stepped into the sitting room he looked rumpled bruised and shaken like hed been through hell warren langdon stood up are you okay no he replied not really did you hear peter is safe bellamy nodded looking dazed as if nothing mattered anymore yes i just heard your conversation im glad warren what the hell is going on sato intervened you boys can catch up in a minute right now mr bellamy is going to reach out to this lunatic and communicate with him just like hes been doing all night langdon felt lost bellamy hasnt been communicating with this guy tonight this guy doesnt even know bellamy is involved sato turned to bellamy and raised her eyebrows bellamy sighed robert im afraid i havent been entirely honest with you this evening langdon could only stare i thought i was doing the right thing bellamy said looking frightened well sato said now you will do the right thing and wed all better pray to god it works as if to substantiate satos portentous tone the mantel clock began chiming the hour sato took out a ziploc bag of items and tossed it to bellamy heres your stuff does your cell phone take photos yes maam good hold up the capstone the message malakh had just received was from his contact warren bellamy the mason he had sent to the capitol building earlier tonight to assist robert langdon bellamy like langdon wanted peter solomon back alive and had assured malakh he would help langdon acquire and decipher the pyramid all night malakh had been receiving email updates which had been automatically forwarded to his cell phone this should be interesting malakh thought opening the message from warren bellamy got separated from langdon but finally have info you demanded proof attached call for missing piece wb one attachment jpeg call for missing piece malakh wondered opening the attachment the attachment was a photo when malakh saw it he gasped out loud and he could feel his heart start pounding with excitement he was looking at a closeup of a tiny golden pyramid the legendary capstone the ornate engraving on the face carried a promising message the secret hides within the order beneath the inscription malakh now saw something that stunned him the capstone seemed to be glowing in disbelief he stared at the faintly radiant text and realized that the legend was literally true the masonic pyramid transforms itself to reveal its secret to the worthy how this magical transformation had occurred malakh had no idea and he didnt care the glowing text was clearly pointing to a specific location in dc exactly as prophesied franklin square unfortunately the photo of the capstone also included warren bellamys index finger which was strategically positioned on the capstone to block out a critical piece of information the secret hides within the order franklin square call for missing piece malakh now understood bellamys meaning the architect of the capitol had been cooperative all night but now he had chosen to play a very dangerous game chapter beneath the watchful gaze of several armed cia agents langdon katherine and bellamy waited with sato in the cathedral college sitting room on the coffee table before them langdons leather bag was still open the golden capstone peeking out the top the words eight franklin square had now faded away leaving no evidence that they had ever existed katherine had pleaded with sato to let her go see her brother but sato had simply shaken her head eyes fixed on bellamys cell phone it sat on the coffee table and had yet to ring why didnt bellamy just tell me the truth langdon wondered apparently the architect had been in contact with peters captor all night reassuring him that langdon was making progress deciphering the pyramid it was a bluff an attempt to buy time for peter in fact bellamy was doing all he could to interfere with anyone who threatened to unveil the pyramids secret now however it seemed that bellamy had switched sides he and sato were now prepared to risk the pyramids secret in hopes of catching this man take your hands off me shouted an elderly voice in the hall im blind not inept i know my way through the college dean galloway was still protesting loudly as a cia agent manhandled him into the sitting room and forced him into one of the chairs whos here galloway demanded his blank eyes staring dead ahead it sounds like a lot of you how many do you need to detain an old man really now there are seven of us sato declared including robert langdon katherine solomon and your masonic brother warren bellamy galloway slumped all his bluster gone were okay langdon said and we just heard that peter is safe hes in bad shape but the police are with him thank heavens galloway said and the a loud rattling caused everyone in the room to jump it was bellamys cell phone vibrating against the coffee table everyone fell silent okay mr bellamy sato said dont blow it you know the stakes bellamy took a deep breath and exhaled then he reached down and pressed the speakerphone button to connect the call bellamy here he said speaking loudly toward the phone on the coffee table the voice that crackled back through the speaker was familiar an airy whisper it sounded like he was calling from a handsfree speakerphone inside a car its past midnight mr bellamy i was about to put peter out of his misery there was an uneasy silence in the room let me talk to him impossible the man replied were driving hes tied up in the trunk langdon and katherine exchanged looks and then began shaking their heads at everyone hes bluffing he no longer has peter sato motioned for bellamy to keep pressing i want proof that peters alive bellamy said im not giving you the rest of your worshipful master needs a doctor dont waste time with negotiations tell me the street number on franklin square and ill bring peter to you there i told you i want now the man exploded or i will pull over and peter solomon dies this instant you listen to me bellamy said forcefully if you want the rest of the address youll play by my rules meet me at franklin square once you deliver peter alive ill tell you the number of the building how do i know you wont bring the authorities because i cant risk doublecrossing you peters life is not the only card you hold i know whats really at stake tonight you do realize the man on the phone said that if i sense so much as a hint of anyone other than you at franklin square i will keep driving and you will never find even a trace of peter solomon and of course that will be the least of your worries ill come alone bellamy replied somberly when you turn over peter ill give you everything you need center of the square the man said it will take me at least twenty minutes to get there i suggest you wait for me as long as it takes the line went dead instantly the room sprang to life sato began shouting orders several field agents grabbed their radios and headed for the door move move in the chaos langdon looked to bellamy for some kind of explanation as to what was actually going on tonight but the older man was already being hurried out the door i need to see my brother katherine shouted you have to let us go sato walked over to katherine i dont have to do anything ms solomon is that clear katherine stood her ground and looked desperately into satos small eyes ms solomon my top priority is apprehending the man at franklin square and you will sit here with one of my men until i accomplish that task then and only then will we deal with your brother youre missing the point katherine said i know exactly where this man lives its literally five minutes up the road in kalorama heights and there will be evidence there that will help you besides you said you want to keep this quiet who knows what peter will start telling the authorities once hes stabilized sato pursed her lips apparently registering katherines point outside the chopper blades began winding up sato frowned and then turned to one of her men hartmann you take the escalade transport ms solomon and mr langdon to kalorama heights peter solomon is not to speak to anyone is that understood yes maam the agent said call me when you get there tell me what you find and dont let these two out of your sight agent hartmann gave a quick nod pulled out the escalade keys and headed for the door katherine was right behind him sato turned to langdon ill see you shortly professor i know you think im the enemy but i can assure you thats not the case get to peter at once this isnt over yet off to one side of langdon dean galloway was sitting quietly at the coffee table his hands had found the stone pyramid which was still sitting in langdons open leather bag on the table in front of him the old man was running his hands over the stones warm surface langdon said father are you coming to see peter id just slow you down galloway removed his hands from the bag and zipped it up around the pyramid ill stay right here and pray for peters recovery we can all speak later but when you show peter the pyramid would you please tell him something for me of course langdon hoisted the bag onto his shoulder tell him this galloway cleared his throat the masonic pyramid has always kept her secret sincerely i dont understand the old man winked just tell peter that he will understand with that dean galloway bowed his head and began praying perplexed langdon left him there and hurried outside katherine was already in the front seat of the suv giving the agent directions langdon climbed in back and had barely closed the door before the giant vehicle was rocketing across the lawn racing northward to kalorama heights chapter franklin square is located in the northwest quadrant of downtown washington bordered by k and thirteenth streets it is home to many historic buildings most notably the franklin school from which alexander graham bell sent the worlds first wireless message in high above the square a fastmoving uh helicopter approached from the west having completed its journey from the national cathedral in a matter of minutes plenty of time sato thought peering down at the square below she knew it was critical that her men got into position undetected before their target arrived he said he wouldnt be here for at least twenty minutes on satos command the pilot performed a touchhover on the roof of the tallest building around the renowned one franklin square a towering and prestigious office building with two gold spires on top the maneuver was illegal of course but the chopper was there only a few seconds and its skids barely touched the gravel rooftop once everyone had jumped out the pilot immediately lifted off banking to the east where he would climb to silent altitude and provide invisible support from above sato waited as her field team collected their things and prepared bellamy for his task the architect was still looking dazed from having seen the file on satos secure laptop as i said an issue of national security bellamy had quickly understood satos meaning and was now fully cooperative all set maam agent simkins said on satos command the agents ushered bellamy across the rooftop and disappeared down a stairwell heading for ground level to take up their positions sato walked to the edge of the building and gazed down the rectangular wooded park below filled the entire block plenty of cover satos team fully understood the importance of making an undetected intercept if their target sensed a presence here and decided just to slip away the director didnt even want to think about it the wind up here was gusty and cold sato wrapped her arms around herself and planted her feet firmly to avoid getting blown over the edge from this high vantage point franklin square looked smaller than she recalled with fewer buildings she wondered which building was eight franklin square this was information she had requested from her analyst nola from whom she expected word at any moment bellamy and the agents now appeared looking like ants fanning out into the darkness of the wooded area simkins positioned bellamy in a clearing near the center of the deserted park then simkins and his team melted into the natural cover disappearing from view within seconds bellamy was alone pacing and shivering in the light of a streetlamp near the center of the park sato felt no pity she lit a cigarette and took a long drag savoring the warmth as it permeated her lungs satisfied that everything below was in order she stepped back from the edge to await her two phone calls one from her analyst nola and one from agent hartmann whom she had sent to kalorama heights chapter slow down langdon gripped the backseat of the escalade as it flew around a corner threatening to tip up on two tires cia agent hartmann was either eager to show off his driving skills to katherine or he had orders to get to peter solomon before solomon recuperated enough to say anything he shouldnt say to the local authorities the highspeed game of beattheredlight on embassy row had been worrisome enough but now they were racing through the winding residential neighborhood of kalorama heights katherine shouted directions as they went having been to this mans house earlier that afternoon with every turn the leather bag at langdons feet rocked back and forth and langdon could hear the clank of the capstone which had clearly been jarred from the top of the pyramid and was now bouncing around in the bottom of his bag fearing it might get damaged he fished around inside until he found it it was still warm but the glowing text had now faded and disappeared returning to its original engraving the secret hides within the order as langdon was about to place the capstone in a side pocket he noticed its elegant surface was covered with tiny white gobs of something puzzled he tried to wipe them off but they were stuck on and hard to the touch like plastic what in the world he could now see that the surface of the stone pyramid itself was also covered with the little white dots langdon used his fingernail and picked one off rolling it between his fingers wax he blurted katherine glanced over her shoulder what there are bits of wax all over the pyramid and capstone i dont understand it where could that possibly have come from something in your bag maybe i dont think so as they rounded a corner katherine pointed through the windshield and turned to agent hartmann thats it were here langdon glanced up and saw the spinning lights of a security vehicle parked in a driveway up ahead the driveway gate was pulled aside and the agent gunned the suv inside the compound the house was a spectacular mansion every light inside was ablaze and the front door was wide open a halfdozen vehicles were parked haphazardly in the driveway and on the lawn apparently having arrived in a hurry some of the cars were still running and had their headlights shining most on the house but one askew practically blinding them as they drove in agent hartmann skidded to a stop on the lawn beside a white sedan with a brightly colored decal preferred security the spinning lights and the high beams in their face made it hard to see katherine immediately jumped out and raced for the house langdon heaved his bag onto his shoulder without taking the time to zip it up he followed katherine at a jog across the lawn toward the open front door the sounds of voices echoed within behind langdon the suv chirped as agent hartmann locked the vehicle and hurried after them katherine bounded up the porch stairs through the main door and disappeared into the entryway langdon crossed the threshold behind her and could see katherine was already moving across the foyer and down the main hallway toward the sound of voices beyond her visible at the end of the hall was a diningroom table where a woman in a security uniform was sitting with her back to them officer katherine shouted as she ran where is peter solomon langdon rushed after her but as he did so an unexpected movement caught his eye to his left through the livingroom window he could see the driveway gate was now swinging shut odd something else caught his eye something that had been hidden from him by the glare of the spinning lights and the blinding high beams when they drove in the halfdozen cars parked haphazardly in the driveway looked nothing like the police cars and emergency vehicles langdon had imagined they were a mercedes a hummer a tesla roadster in that instant langdon also realized the voices he heard in the house were nothing but a television blaring in the direction of the dining room wheeling in slow motion langdon shouted down the hallway katherine wait but as he turned he could see that katherine solomon was no longer running she was airborne chapter katherine solomon knew she was falling but she couldnt figure out why she had been running down the hall toward the security guard in the dining room when suddenly her feet had become entangled in an invisible obstacle and her entire body had lurched forward sailing through the air now she was returning to earth in this case a hardwood floor katherine crashed down on her stomach the wind driven violently from her lungs above her a heavy coat tree teetered precariously and then toppled over barely missing her on the floor she raised her head still gasping for breath puzzled to see that the female security guard in the chair had not moved a muscle stranger still the toppled coat tree appeared to have a thin wire attached to the bottom which had been stretched across the hallway why in the world would someone katherine langdon was shouting to her and as katherine rolled onto her side and looked back at him she felt her blood turn to ice robert behind you she tried to scream but she was still gasping for breath all she could do was watch in terrifying slow motion as langdon rushed down the hall to help her completely unaware that behind him agent hartmann was staggering across the threshold and clutching his throat blood sprayed through hartmanns hands as he groped at the handle of a long screwdriver that protruded from his neck as the agent pitched forward his attacker came into full view my god no naked except for a strange undergarment that looked like a loincloth the massive man had apparently been hiding in the foyer his muscular body was covered from head to toe with strange tattoos the front door was swinging closed and he was rushing down the hall after langdon agent hartmann hit the floor just as the front door slammed shut langdon looked startled and whirled around but the tattooed man was already on him thrusting some kind of device into his back there was a flash of light and a sharp electrical sizzle and katherine saw langdon go rigid eyes frozen wide langdon lurched forward collapsing down in a paralyzed heap he fell hard on top of his leather bag the pyramid tumbling out onto the floor without so much as a glance down at his victim the tattooed man stepped over langdon and headed directly for katherine she was already crawling backward into the dining room where she collided with a chair the female security guard who had been propped in that chair now wobbled and dropped to the floor in a heap beside her the womans lifeless expression was one of terror her mouth was stuffed with a rag the enormous man had reached her before katherine had time to react he seized her by the shoulders with impossible strength his face no longer covered by makeup was an utterly terrifying sight his muscles flexed and she felt herself being flipped over onto her stomach like a rag doll a heavy knee ground into her back and for a moment she thought she would break in two he grabbed her arms and pulled them backward with her head now turned to one side and her cheek pressed into the carpet katherine could see langdon his body still jerking facing away from her beyond that agent hartmann lay motionless in the foyer cold metal pinched katherines wrists and she realized she was being bound with wire in terror she tried to pull away but doing so sent searing pain into her hands this wire will cut you if you move the man said finishing with her wrists and moving down to her ankles with frightening efficiency katherine kicked at him and he threw a powerful fist into the back of her right thigh crippling her leg within seconds her ankles were bound robert she now managed to call out langdon was groaning on the floor in the hallway he lay crumpled on his leather bag with the stone pyramid lying on its side near his head katherine realized the pyramid was her last hope we deciphered the pyramid she told her attacker ill tell you everything yes you will with that he pulled the cloth from the dead womans mouth and firmly stuffed it into katherines it tasted like death robert langdons body was not his own he lay numb and immobile his cheek pressed against the hardwood floor he had heard enough about stun guns to know they crippled their victims by temporarily overloading the nervous system their action something called electromuscular disruption might as well have been a bolt of lightning the excruciating jolt of pain seemed to penetrate every molecule of his body now despite his minds focused intention his muscles refused to obey the command he was sending them get up facedown paralyzed on the floor langdon was gulping shallow breaths scarcely able to inhale he had yet to lay eyes on the man who had attacked him but he could see agent hartmann lying in an expanding pool of blood langdon had heard katherine struggling and arguing but moments ago her voice had become muffled as if the man had stuffed something in her mouth get up robert youve got to help her langdons legs were tingling now a fiery and painful recovery of feeling but still they refused to cooperate move his arms twitched as sensation started to come back along with feeling in his face and neck with great effort he managed to rotate his head dragging his cheek roughly across the hardwood floor as he turned his head to look down into the dining room langdons sight line was impeded by the stone pyramid which had toppled out of his bag and was lying sideways on the floor its base inches from his face for an instant langdon didnt understand what he was looking at the square of stone before him was obviously the base of the pyramid and yet it looked somehow different very different it was still square and still stone but it was no longer flat and smooth the base of the pyramid was covered with engraved markings how is this possible he stared for several seconds wondering if he was hallucinating i looked at the base of this pyramid a dozen times and there were no markings langdon now realized why his breathing reflex kickstarted and he drew a sudden gasp of air realizing that the masonic pyramid had secrets yet to share i have witnessed another transformation in a flash langdon understood the meaning of galloways last request tell peter this the masonic pyramid has always kept her secret sincerely the words had seemed strange at the time but now langdon understood that dean galloway was sending peter a code ironically this same code had been a plot twist in a mediocre thriller langdon had read years ago sincere since the days of michelangelo sculptors had been hiding the flaws in their work by smearing hot wax into the cracks and then dabbing the wax with stone dust the method was considered cheating and therefore any sculpture without waxliterally sine cera was considered a sincere piece of art the phrase stuck to this day we still sign our letters sincerely as a promise that we have written without wax and that our words are true the engravings on the base of this pyramid had been concealed by the same method when katherine followed the capstones directions and boiled the pyramid the wax melted away revealing the writing on the base galloway had run his hands over the pyramid in the sitting room apparently feeling the markings exposed on the bottom now if only for an instant langdon had forgotten all the danger he and katherine faced he stared at the incredible array of symbols on the base of the pyramid he had no idea what they meant or what they would ultimately reveal but one thing was for certain the masonic pyramid has secrets left to tell eight franklin square is not the final answer whether it was this adrenalinefilled revelation or simply the extra few seconds lying there langdon did not know but he suddenly felt control returning to his body painfully he swept an arm to one side pushing the leather bag out of the way to clear his sight line into the dining room to his horror he saw that katherine had been tied up and a large rag had been stuffed deep into her mouth langdon flexed his muscles trying to climb to his knees but a moment later he froze in utter disbelief the diningroom doorway had just filled with a chilling sight a human form unlike anything langdon had ever seen what in the name of god langdon rolled kicking with his legs trying to back away but the huge tattooed man grabbed him flipping him onto his back and straddling his chest he placed his knees on langdons biceps pinning langdon pain fully to the floor the mans chest bore a rippling doubleheaded phoenix his neck face and shaved head were covered with a dazzling array of unusually intricate symbols sigils langdon knew which were used in the rituals of dark ceremonial magic before langdon could process anything more the huge man clasped langdons ears between his palms lifted his head up off the floor and with incredible force smashed it back down onto the hardwood everything went black chapter malakh stood in his hallway and surveyed the carnage around him his home looked like a battlefield robert langdon lay unconscious at his feet katherine solomon was bound and gagged on the diningroom floor the corpse of a female security guard lay crumpled nearby having toppled off the chair where she was propped this female guard eager to save her own life had done exactly as malakh commanded with a knife to her throat she had answered malakhs cell phone and told the lie that had coaxed langdon and katherine to come racing out here she had no partner and peter solomon was certainly not okay as soon as the woman had given her performance malakh had quietly strangled her to complete the illusion that malakh was not home he had phoned bellamy using the handsfree speaker in one of his cars im on the road he had told bellamy and whoever else had been listening peter is in my trunk in fact malakh was driving only between his garage and his front yard where he had left several of his myriad cars parked askew with the headlights on and the engines running the deception had worked perfectly almost the only wrinkle was the bloody blackclad heap in the foyer with a screwdriver protruding from his neck malakh searched the corpse and had to chuckle when he found a hightech transceiver and cell phone with a cia logo it seems even they are aware of my power he removed the batteries and crushed both devices with a heavy bronze doorstop malakh knew he had to move quickly now especially if the cia was involved he strode back over to langdon the professor was out cold and would be for a while malakhs eyes moved with trepidation now to the stone pyramid on the floor beside the professors open bag his breath caught and his heart pounded i have waited for years his hands trembled slightly as he reached down and picked up the masonic pyramid as he ran his fingers slowly across the engravings he felt awed by their promise before he became too entranced he put the pyramid back in langdons bag with the capstone and zipped it up i will assemble the pyramid soon in a much safer location he threw langdons bag over his shoulder and then tried to hoist langdon himself but the professors toned physique weighed much more than anticipated malakh settled on grabbing him beneath the armpits and dragging him across the floor hes not going to like where he ends up malakh thought as he dragged langdon off the television in the kitchen blared the sound of voices from the tv had been part of the deception and malakh had yet to turn it off the station was now broadcasting a televangelist leading his congregation in the lords prayer malakh wondered if any of his hypnotized viewers had any idea where this prayer really came from on earth as it is in heaven the group intoned yes malakh thought as above so below and lead us not into temptation help us master the weakness of our flesh deliver us from evil they all beseeched malakh smiled that could be difficult the darkness is growing even so he had to give them credit for trying humans who spoke to invisible forces and requested help were a dying breed in this modern world malakh was dragging langdon across the living room when the congregation declared amen amon malakh corrected egypt is the cradle of your religion the god amon was the prototype for zeus for jupiter and for every modern face of god to this day every religion on earth shouted out a variation of his name amen amin aum the televangelist began quoting verses from the bible describing hierarchies of angels demons and spirits that ruled in heaven and hell protect your souls from evil forces he warned them lift your hearts in prayer god and his angels will hear you hes right malakh knew but so will the demons malakh had learned long ago that through proper application of the art a practitioner could open a portal to the spiritual realm the invisible forces that existed there much like man himself came in many forms both good and evil those of light healed protected and sought to bring order to the universe those of dark functioned oppositely bringing destruction and chaos if properly summoned the invisible forces could be persuaded to do a practitioners bidding on earth thus instilling him with seemingly supernatural power in exchange for helping the summoner these forces required offerings prayers and praise for those of light and the spilling of blood for those of dark the greater the sacrifice the greater the power that is transferred malakh had begun his practice with the blood of inconsequential animals over time however his choices for sacrifice had become more bold tonight i take the final step beware the preacher shouted warning of the coming apocalypse the final battle for the souls of man will soon be fought indeed malakh thought and i shall become its greatest warrior this battle of course had begun long long ago in ancient egypt those who perfected the art had become the great adepts of history evolving beyond the masses to become true practitioners of light they moved as gods on earth they built great temples of initiation to which neophytes traveled from around the world to partake of the wisdom there arose a race of golden men for a brief span of time mankind seemed poised to elevate himself and transcend his earthly bonds the golden age of the ancient mysteries and yet man being of the flesh was susceptible to the sins of hubris hatred impatience and greed over time there were those who corrupted the art perverting it and abusing its power for personal gain they began using this perverted version to summon dark forces a different art evolved a more potent immediate and intoxicating influence such is my art such is my great work the illuminated adepts and their esoteric fraternities witnessed the rising evil and saw that man was not using his newfound knowledge for the good of his species and so they hid their wisdom to keep it from the eyes of the unworthy eventually it was lost to history with this came the great fall of man and a lasting darkness to this day the noble descendants of the adepts soldiered on grasping blindly for the light trying to recapture the lost power of their past trying to keep the darkness at bay they were the priests and priestesses of the churches temples and shrines of all the religions on earth time had erased the memories detached them from their past they no longer knew the source from which their potent wisdom had once flowed when they were asked about the divine mysteries of their forebears the new custodians of faith vociferously disowned them condemning them as heresy have they truly forgotten malakh wondered echoes of the ancient art still resonated in every corner of the globe from the mystical kabbalists of judaism to the esoteric sufis of islam vestiges remained in the arcane rituals of christianity in its godeating rites of holy communion its hierarchies of saints angels and demons its chanting and incantation its holy calendars astrological underpinnings its consecrated robes and in its promise of everlasting life even now its priests dispelled evil spirits by swinging smokefilled censers ringing sacred bells and sprinkling holy water christians still practiced the supernatural craft of exorcism an early practice of their faith that required the ability not only to cast out demons but to summon them and yet they cannot see their past nowhere was the churchs mystical past more evident than at her epicenter in vatican city at the heart of st peters square stood the great egyptian obelisk carved thirteen hundred years before jesus took his first breath this numinous monolith had no relevance there no link to modern christianity and yet there it was at the core of christs church a stone beacon screaming to be heard a reminder to those few sages who remembered where it all began this church born of the womb of the ancient mysteries still bore her rites and symbols one symbol above all adorning her altars vestments spires and scripture was the singular image of christianity that of a precious sacrificed human being christianity more than any other faith understood the transformative power of sacrifice even now to honor the sacrifice made by jesus his followers proffered their own feeble gestures of personal sacrifice fasting lenten renunciation tithing all of those offerings are impotent of course without blood there is no true sacrifice the powers of darkness had long embraced blood sacrifice and in doing so they had grown so strong that the powers of goodness now struggled to keep them in check soon the light would be entirely consumed and the practitioners of darkness would move freely through the minds of men chapter eight franklin squaremust exist sato insisted look it up again nola kaye sat at her desk and adjusted her headset maam ive checked everywhere that address doesnt exist in dc but im on the roof of one franklin square sato said there has to be an eight director satos on a roof hold on nola began running a new search she was considering telling the os director about the hacker but sato seemed fixated on eight franklin square at the moment besides nola still didnt have all the information wheres that damned syssec anyway okay nola said eyeing her screen i see the problem one franklin square is the name of the building not the address the address is actually k street the news seemed to confound the director nola i dont have time to explain the pyramid clearly points to the address eight franklin square nola sat bolt upright the pyramid points to a specific location the inscription sato continued reads the secret hides within the order eight franklin square nola could scarcely imagine an order like a masonic or fraternal order i assume so sato replied nola thought a moment and then began typing again maam maybe the street numbers on the square changed over the years i mean if this pyramid is as old as legend claims maybe the numbers on franklin square were different when the pyramid was built im now running a search without the number eight for the order franklin square and washington dc and this way we might get some idea if theres she stalled midsentence as the search results appeared what have you got sato demanded nola stared at the first result on the list a spectacular image of the great pyramid of egypt which served as the thematic backdrop for the home page dedicated to a building on franklin square the building was unlike any other building on the square or in the entire city for that matter what stopped nola cold was not the buildings bizarre architecture but rather the description of its purpose according to the web site this unusual edifice was built as a sacred mystical shrine designed by and designed for an ancient secret order chapter robert langdon regained consciousness with a crippling headache where am i wherever he was it was dark deepcave dark and deathly silent he was lying on his back with his arms at his side confused he tried moving his fingers and toes relieved to find they moved freely with no pain what happened with the exception of his headache and the profound darkness everything seemed more or less normal almost everything langdon realized he was lying on a hard floor that felt unusually smooth like a sheet of glass stranger still he could feel that the slick surface was in direct contact with his bare flesh shoulders back buttocks thighs calves am i naked puzzled he ran his hands over his body jesus where the hell are my clothes in the darkness the cobwebs began to lift and langdon saw flashes of memory frightening snapshots a dead cia agent the face of a tattooed beast langdons head smashing into the floor the images came faster and now he recalled the sickening image of katherine solomon bound and gagged on the diningroom floor my god langdon sat bolt upright and as he did his forehead smashed into something suspended only inches above him pain exploded through his skull and he fell back teetering near unconsciousness groggy he reached up with his hands groping in the darkness to find the obstacle what he found made no sense to him it seemed this rooms ceiling was less than a foot above him what in the world as he spread his arms to his sides in an attempt to roll over both of his hands hit sidewalls the truth now dawned on him robert langdon was not in a room at all im in a box in the darkness of his small coffinlike container langdon began pounding wildly with his fist he shouted over and over for help the terror that gripped him deepened with each passing instant until it was intolerable i have been buried alive the lid of langdons strange coffin refused to budge even with the full force of his arms and legs pushing upward in wild panic the box from all he could tell was made of heavy fiberglass airtight soundproof lightproof escapeproof i am going to suffocate alone in this box he thought of the deep well into which he had fallen as a young boy and of the terrifying night he spent treading water alone in the darkness of a bottomless pit that trauma had scarred langdons psyche burdening him with an overwhelming phobia of enclosed spaces tonight buried alive robert langdon was living his ultimate nightmare katherine solomon trembled in silence on the floor of malakhs dining room the sharp wire around her wrists and ankles had already cut into her and the slightest movements seemed only to tighten her bonds the tattooed man had brutally knocked langdon unconscious and dragged his limp body across the floor along with his leather bag and the stone pyramid where they had gone katherine had no idea the agent who had accompanied them was dead she had not heard a sound in many minutes and she wondered if the tattooed man and langdon were still inside the house she had been trying to scream for help but with each attempt the rag in her mouth crept back dangerously closer to her windpipe now she felt approaching footsteps on the floor and she turned her head hoping against hope that someone was coming to help the massive silhouette of her captor materialized in the hallway katherine recoiled as she flashed on the image of him standing in her family home ten years earlier he killed my family now he strode toward her langdon was nowhere to be seen the man crouched down and gripped her around the waist hoisting her roughly onto his shoulder the wire sliced into her wrists and the rag muffled her muted cries of pain he carried her down the hallway toward the living room where earlier today the two of them had calmly sipped tea together where is he taking me he carried katherine across the living room and stopped directly in front of the large oil painting of the three graces that she had admired this afternoon you mentioned you liked this painting the man whispered his lips practically touching her ear im glad it may be the last thing of beauty you see with that he reached out and pressed his palm into the right side of the enormous frame to katherines shock the painting rotated into the wall turning on a central pivot like a revolving door a hidden doorway katherine tried to wriggle free but the man held her firmly carrying her through the opening behind the canvas as the three graces pivoted shut behind them she could see heavy insulation on the back of the canvas whatever sounds were made back here were apparently not meant to be heard by the outside world the space behind the painting was cramped more like a hallway than a room the man carried her to the far side and opened a heavy door carrying her through it onto a small landing katherine found herself looking down a narrow ramp into a deep basement she drew a breath to scream but the rag was choking her the incline was steep and narrow the walls on either side were made of cement awash in a bluish light that seemed to emanate from below the air that wafted up was warm and pungent laden with an eerie blend of smells the sharp bite of chemicals the smooth calm of incense the earthy musk of human sweat and pervading it all a distinct aura of visceral animal fear your science impressed me the man whispered as they reached the bottom of the ramp i hope mine impresses you chapter cia field agent turner simkins crouched in the darkness of franklin park and kept his steady gaze on warren bellamy nobody had taken the bait yet but it was still early simkinss transceiver beeped and he activated it hoping one of his men had spotted something but it was sato she had new information simkins listened and agreed with her concern hold on he said ill see if i can get a visual he crawled through the bushes in which he was hiding and peered back in the direction from which he had entered the square after some maneuvering he finally opened a sight line holy shit he was staring at a building that looked like an old world mosque nestled between two much larger buildings the moorish facade was made of gleaming terracotta tile laid in intricate multicolored designs above the three massive doors two tiers of lancet windows looked as if arabian archers might appear and open fire if anyone approached uninvited i see it simkins said any activity nothing good i need you to reposition and watch it very carefully its called the almas shrine temple and its the headquarters of a mystical order simkins had worked in the dc area for a long time but was not familiar with this temple or any ancient mystical order headquartered on franklin square this building sato said belongs to a group called the ancient arabic order of nobles of the mystic shrine never heard of them i think you have sato said theyre an appendant body of the masons more commonly known as the shriners simkins shot a dubious glance at the ornate building the shriners the guys who build hospitals for kids he could imagine no order less ominous sounding than a fraternity of philanthropists who wore little red fezzes and marched in parades even so satos concerns were valid maam if our target realizes that this building is in fact the order on franklin square he wont need the address hell simply bypass the rendezvous and go directly to the correct location my thoughts exactly keep an eye on the entrance yes maam any word from agent hartmann in kalorama heights no maam you asked him to phone you directly well he hasnt odd simkins thought checking his watch hes overdue chapter robert langdon lay shivering naked and alone in total blackness paralyzed by fear he was no longer pounding or shouting instead he had closed his eyes and was doing his best to control his hammering heart and his panicked breathing you are lying beneath a vast nighttime sky he tried to convince himself there is nothing above you but miles of wideopen space this calming visualization had been the only way he had managed to survive a recent stint in an enclosed mri machine that and a triple dose of valium tonight however the visualization was having no effect whatsoever the rag in katherine solomons mouth had shifted backward and was all but choking her her captor had carried her down a narrow ramp and into a dark basement corridor at the far end of the hall she had glimpsed a room lit with an eerie reddishpurple light but theyd never made it that far the man had stopped instead at a small side room carried her inside and placed her on a wooden chair he had set her down with her bound wrists behind the chair back so she could not move now katherine could feel the wire on her wrists slicing deeper into her flesh the pain barely registered next to the rising panic she was feeling over being unable to breathe the cloth in her mouth was slipping deeper into her throat and she felt herself gagging reflexively her vision started to tunnel behind her the tattooed man closed the rooms lone door and flipped on the light katherines eyes were watering profusely now and she could no longer differentiate objects in her immediate surroundings everything had become a blur a distorted vision of colorful flesh appeared before her and katherine felt her eyes starting to flutter as she teetered on the brink of unconsciousness a scalecovered arm reached out and yanked the rag from her mouth katherine gasped inhaling deep breaths coughing and choking as her lungs flooded with precious air slowly her vision began to clear and she found herself looking into the demons face the visage was barely human blanketing his neck face and shaved head was an astounding pattern of bizarre tattooed symbols with the exception of a small circle on top of his head every inch of his body appeared to be decorated a massive doubleheaded phoenix on his chest glared at her through nipple eyes like some kind of ravenous vulture patiently waiting for her death open your mouth the man whispered katherine stared at the monster with total revulsion what open your mouth the man repeated or the cloth goes back in trembling katherine opened her mouth the man extended his thick tattooed index finger inserting it between her lips when he touched her tongue katherine thought she would vomit he extracted his wet finger and raised it to the top of his shaved head closing his eyes he massaged her saliva into his small circular patch of untattooed flesh repulsed katherine looked away the room in which she was sitting appeared to be a boiler room of some sort pipes on the walls gurgling sounds fluorescent lights before she could take in her surroundings though her gaze stopped dead on something beside her on the floor a pile of clothing turtleneck tweed sport coat loafers mickey mouse watch my god she wheeled back to the tattooed animal before her what have you done with robert shh the man whispered or hell hear you he stepped to one side and motioned behind him langdon was not there all katherine saw was a huge black fiberglass box its shape bore an unsettling resemblance to the heavy crates in which corpses were shipped back from war two massive clasps firmly locked the box shut hes inside katherine blurted but hell suffocate no he wont the man said pointing to a series of transparent pipes that ran along the wall into the bottom of the crate hell only wish he could in total darkness langdon listened intently to the muffled vibrations he now heard from the outside world voices he began pounding on the box and shouting at the top of his lungs help can anyone hear me far off a muted voice called out robert my god no no he knew the voice it was katherine and she sounded terrified even so it was a welcome sound langdon drew a breath to call out to her but he stopped short feeling an unexpected sensation at the back of his neck a faint breeze seemed to be emanating from the bottom of the box how is that possible he lay very still taking stock yes definitely he could feel the tiny hairs on the back of his neck being tickled by air movement instinctively langdon began feeling along the floor of the box searching for the source of the air it took only a moment to locate theres a tiny vent the small perforated opening felt similar to a drain plate on a sink or tub except that a soft steady breeze was now coming up through it hes pumping air in for me he doesnt want me to suffocate langdons relief was shortlived a terrifying sound was now emanating up through the holes in the vent it was the unmistakable gurgle of flowing liquid coming his way katherine stared in disbelief at the clear shaft of liquid that was progressing down one of the pipes toward langdons crate the scene looked like some kind of twisted stage magicians act hes pumping water into the crate katherine strained at her bonds ignoring the deep bite of the wires around her wrists all she could do was look on in panic she could hear langdon pounding in desperation but as the water reached the underside of the container the pounding stopped there was a moment of terrified silence then the pounding started again with renewed desperation let him out katherine begged please you cant do this drowning is a terrible death you know the man spoke calmly as he paced around her in circles your assistant trish could tell you that katherine heard his words but she could barely process them you may remember that i almost drowned once the man whispered it was on your familys estate in potomac your brother shot me and i fell through the ice out at zachs bridge katherine glared at him filled with loathing the night you killed my mother the gods protected me that night he said and they showed me the way to become one of them the water gurgling into the box behind langdons head felt warm body temperature the fluid was already several inches deep and had completely swallowed the back of his naked body as it began creeping up his rib cage langdon felt a stark reality closing in fast im going to die with renewed panic he raised his arms and began pounding wildly again chapter youve got to let him out katherine begged crying now well do whatever you want she could hear langdon pounding more frantically as the water flowed into his container the tattooed man just smiled youre easier than your brother the things i had to do to get peter to tell me his secrets where is he she demanded where is peter tell me we did exactly what you wanted we solved the pyramid and no you did not solve the pyramid you played a game you withheld information and brought a government agent to my home hardly behavior i intend to reward we didnt have a choice she replied choking back the tears the cia is looking for you they made us travel with an agent ill tell you everything just let robert out katherine could hear langdon shouting and pounding in the crate and she could see the water flowing through the pipe she knew he didnt have a lot of time in front of her the tattooed man spoke calmly stroking his chin i assume there are agents waiting for me at franklin square katherine said nothing and the man placed his massive palms on her shoulders slowly pulling her forward with her arms still wirebound be hind the chair back her shoulders strained burning with pain threatening to dislocate yes katherine said there are agents at franklin square he pulled harder what is the address on the capstone the pain in her wrists and shoulders grew unbearable but katherine said nothing you can tell me now katherine or ill break your arms and ask you again eight she gasped in pain the missing number is eight the capstone says the secret hides within the order eight franklin square i swear it i dont know what else to tell you its eight franklin square the man still did not release her shoulders thats all i know katherine said thats the address let go of me let robert out of that tank i would the man said but theres one problem i cant go to eight franklin square without being caught tell me whats at that address i dont know and the symbols on the base of the pyramid on the underside do you know their meaning what symbols on the base katherine had no idea what he was talking about the bottom has no symbols its smooth blank stone apparently immune to the muffled cries for help emanating from the coffinlike crate the tattooed man calmly padded over to langdons daybag and retrieved the stone pyramid then he returned to katherine and held it up before her eyes so she could see the base when katherine saw the engraved symbols she gasped in bewilderment but thats impossible the bottom of the pyramid was entirely covered with intricate carvings there was nothing there before im sure of it she had no idea what these symbols could possibly mean they seemed to span every mystical tradition including many she could not even place total chaos i have no idea what this means she said nor do i her captor said fortunately we have a specialist at our disposal he glanced at the crate lets ask him shall we he carried the pyramid toward the crate for a brief instant of hope katherine thought he was going to unclasp the lid instead he sat calmly on top of the box reached down and slid a small panel to one side revealing a plexiglas window in the top of the tank light langdon covered his eyes squinting into the ray of light that now streamed in from above as his eyes adjusted hope turned to confusion he was looking up through what appeared to be a window in the top of his crate through the window he saw a white ceiling and a fluorescent light without warning the tattooed face appeared above him peering down where is katherine langdon shouted let me out the man smiled your friend katherine is here with me the man said i have the power to spare her life your life as well but your time is short so i suggest you listen carefully langdon could barely hear him through the glass and the water had risen higher creeping across his chest are you aware the man asked that there are symbols on the base of the pyramid yes langdon shouted having seen the extensive array of symbols when the pyramid had lain on the floor upstairs but i have no idea what they mean you need to go to eight franklin square the answer is there thats what the capstone professor you and i both know the cia is waiting for me there i have no intention of walking into a trap besides i didnt need the street number there is only one building on that square that could possibly be relevant the almas shrine temple he paused staring down at langdon the ancient arabic order of nobles of the mystic shrine langdon was confused he was familiar with the almas temple but he had forgotten it was on franklin square the shriners are the order their temple sits atop a secret staircase it made no historical sense whatsoever but langdon was in no position at the moment to debate history yes he shouted that must be it the secret hides within the order youre familiar with the building absolutely langdon raised his throbbing head to keep his ears above the quickly rising liquid i can help you let me out so you believe you can tell me what this temple has to do with the symbols on the base of the pyramid yes let me just look at the symbols very well then lets see what you come up with hurry with the warm liquid rising around him langdon pushed up on the lid willing the man to unclasp it please hurry but the lid never opened instead the base of the pyramid suddenly appeared hovering above the plexiglas window langdon stared up in panic i trust this view is close enough for youthe man held the pyramid in his tattooed hands think fast professor im guessing you have less than sixty seconds chapter robert langdon had often heard it said that an animal when cornered was capable of miraculous feats of strength nonetheless when he threw his full force into the underside of his crate nothing budged at all around him the liquid continued rising steadily with no more than six inches of breathing room left langdon had lifted his head into the pocket of air that remained he was now facetoface with the plexiglas window his eyes only inches away from the underside of the stone pyramid whose baffling engraving hovered above him i have no idea what this means concealed for over a century beneath a hardened mixture of wax and stone dust the masonic pyramids final inscription was now laid bare the engraving was a perfectly square grid of symbols from every tradition imaginable alchemical astrological heraldic angelic magical numeric sigilic greek latin as a totality this was symbolic anarchy a bowl of alphabet soup whose letters came from dozens of different languages cultures and time periods total chaos symbologist robert langdon in his wildest academic interpretations could not fathom how this grid of symbols could be deciphered to mean anything at all order from this chaos impossible the liquid was now creeping over his adams apple and langdon could feel his level of terror rising along with it he continued banging on the tank the pyramid stared back at him tauntingly in frantic desperation langdon focused every bit of his mental energy on the chessboard of symbols what could they possibly mean unfortunately the assortment seemed so disparate that he could not even imagine where to begin theyre not even from the same eras in history outside the tank her voice muffled but audible katherine could be heard tearfully begging for langdons release despite his failure to see a solution the prospect of death seemed to motivate every cell in his body to find one he felt a strange clarity of mind unlike anything he had ever experienced think he scanned the grid intensely searching for some clue a pattern a hidden word a special icon anything at all but he saw only a grid of unrelated symbols chaos with each passing second langdon had begun to feel an eerie numbness overtaking his body it was as if his very flesh were preparing to shield his mind from the pain of death the water was now threatening to pour into his ears and he lifted his head as far as he could pushing it against the top of the crate frightening images began flashing before his eyes a boy in new england treading water at the bottom of a dark well a man in rome trapped beneath a skeleton in an overturned coffin katherines shouts were growing more frantic from all langdon could hear she was trying to reason with a madman insisting that langdon could not be expected to decipher the pyramid without going to visit the almas temple that building obviously holds the missing piece to this puzzle how can robert decipher the pyramid without all the information langdon appreciated her efforts and yet he felt certain that eight franklin square was not pointing to the almas temple the time line is all wrong according to legend the masonic pyramid was created in the mids decades before the shriners even existed in fact langdon realized it was probably before the square was even called franklin square the capstone could not possibly have been pointing to an unbuilt building at a nonexistent address whatever eight franklin square was pointing to it had to exist in unfortunately langdon was drawing a total blank he probed his memory banks for anything that could possibly fit the time line eight franklin square something that was in existence in langdon came up with nothing the liquid was trickling into his ears now fighting his terror he stared up at the grid of symbols on the glass i dont understand the connection in a petrified frenzy his mind began spewing all the farflung parallels it could generate eight franklin square squares this grid of symbols is a square the square and the compass are masonic symbols masonic altars are square squares have ninetydegree angles the water kept rising but langdon blocked it out eight franklin eight this grid is eightbyeight franklin has eight letters the order has eight letters is the rotated symbolfor infinity eight is the number of destruction in numerology langdon had no idea outside the tank katherine was still pleading but langdons hearing was now intermittent as the water was sloshing around his head impossible without knowing capstones message clearly the secret hides within then she was gone water poured into langdons ears blotting out the last of katherines voice a sudden womblike silence engulfed him and langdon realized he truly was going to die the secret hides within katherines final words echoed through the hush of his tomb the secret hides within strangely langdon realized he had heard these exact words many times before the secret hides within even now it seemed the ancient mysteries were taunting him the secret hides within was the core tenet of the mysteries urging man kind to seek god not in the heavens above but rather within himself the secret hides within it was the message of all the great mystical teachers the kingdom of god is within you said jesus christ know thyself said pythagoras know ye not that ye are gods said hermes trismegistus the list went on and on all the mystical teachings of the ages had attempted to convey this one idea the secret hides within even so mankind continued looking to the heavens for the face of god this realization for langdon now became an ultimate irony right now with his eyes facing the heavens like all the blind men who preceded him robert langdon suddenly saw the light it hit him like a bolt from above the secret hides within the order eight franklin square in a flash he understood the message on the capstone was suddenly crystal clear its meaning had been staring him in the face all night the text on the capstone like the masonic pyramid itself was a symbolon a code in pieces a message written in parts the capstones meaning was camouflaged in so simple a manner that langdon could scarcely believe he and katherine had not spotted it more astonishing still langdon now realized that the message on the capstone did indeed reveal exactly how to decipher the grid of symbols on the base of the pyramid it was so very simple exactly as peter solomon had promised the golden capstone was a potent talisman with the power to bring order from chaos langdon began pounding on the lid and shouting i know i know above him the stone pyramid lifted off and hovered away in its place the tattooed face reappeared its chilling visage staring down through the small window i solved it langdon shouted let me out when the tattooed man spoke langdons submerged ears heard nothing his eyes however saw the lips speak two words tell me i will langdon screamed the water almost to his eyes let me out ill explain everything its so simple the mans lips moved again tell me now or die with the water rising through the final inch of air space langdon tipped his head back to keep his mouth above the waterline as he did so warm liquid poured into his eyes blurring his vision arching his back he pressed his mouth against the plexiglas window then with his last few seconds of air robert langdon shared the secret of how to decipher the masonic pyramid as he finished speaking the liquid rose around his lips instinctively langdon drew a final breath and clamped his mouth shut a moment later the fluid covered him entirely reaching the top of his tomb and spreading out across the plexiglas he did it malakh realized langdon figured out how to solve the pyramid the answer was so simple so obvious beneath the window the submerged face of robert langdon stared up at him with desperate and beseeching eyes malakh shook his head at him and slowly mouthed the words thank you professor enjoy the afterlife chapter as a serious swimmer robert langdon had often wondered what it would feel like to drown he now knew he was going to learn firsthand although he could hold his breath longer than most people he could already feel his body reacting to the absence of air carbon dioxide was accumulating in his blood bringing with it the instinctual urge to inhale do not breathe the reflex to inhale was increasing in intensity with each passing moment langdon knew very soon he would reach what was called the breathhold breakpoint that critical moment at which a person could no longer voluntarily hold his breath open the lid langdons instinct was to pound and struggle but he knew better than to waste valuable oxygen all he could do was stare up through the blur of water above him and hope the world outside was now only a hazy patch of light above the plexiglas window his core muscles had begun burning and he knew hypoxia was setting in suddenly a beautiful and ghostly face appeared gazing down at him it was katherine her soft features looking almost ethereal through the veil of liquid their eyes met through the plexiglas window and for an instant langdon thought he was saved katherine then he heard her muted cries of horror and realized she was being held there by their captor the tattooed monster was forcing her to bear witness to what was about to happen katherine im sorry in this strange dark place trapped underwater langdon strained to comprehend that these would be his final moments of life soon he would cease to exist everything he was or had ever been or would ever be was ending when his brain died all of the memories held in his gray matter along with all of the knowledge he had acquired would simply evaporate in a flood of chemical reactions in this moment robert langdon realized his true insignificance in the universe it was as lonely and humbling a feeling as he had ever experienced almost thankfully he could feel the breathhold breakpoint arriving the moment was upon him langdons lungs forced out their spent contents collapsing in eager preparation to inhale still he held out an instant longer his final second then like a man no longer able to hold his hand to a burning stove he gave himself over to fate reflex overruled reason his lips parted his lungs expanded and the liquid came pouring in the pain that filled his chest was greater than langdon had ever imagined the liquid burned as it poured into his lungs instantly the pain shot upward into his skull and he felt like his head was being crushed in a vise there was great thundering in his ears and through it all katherine solomon was screaming there was a blinding flash of light and then blackness robert langdon was gone chapter its over katherine solomon had stopped screaming the drowning she had just witnessed had left her catatonic virtually paralyzed with shock and despair beneath the plexiglas window langdons dead eyes stared past her into empty space his frozen expression was one of pain and regret the last tiny air bubbles trickled out of his lifeless mouth and then as if consenting to give up his ghost the harvard professor slowly began sinking to the bottom of the tank where he disappeared into the shadows hes gone katherine felt numb the tattooed man reached down and with pitiless finality he slid the small viewing window closed sealing langdons corpse inside then he smiled at her shall we before katherine could respond he hoisted her griefstricken body onto his shoulder turned out the light and carried her out of the room with a few powerful strides he transported her to the end of the hall into a large space that seemed to be bathed in a reddishpurple light the room smelled like incense he carried her to a square table in the center of the room and dropped her hard on her back knocking the wind out of her the surface felt rough and cold is this stone katherine had hardly gotten her bearings before the man had removed the wire from her wrists and ankles instinctively she attempted to fight him off but her cramped arms and legs barely responded he now began strapping her to the table with heavy leather bands cinching one strap across her knees and then buckling a second across her hips pinning her arms at her sides then he placed a final strap across her sternum just above her breasts it had all taken only moments and katherine was again immobilized her wrists and ankles throbbed now as the circulation returned to her limbs open your mouth the man whispered licking his own tattooed lips katherine clenched her teeth in revulsion the man again reached out with his index finger and ran it slowly around her lips making her skin crawl she clenched her teeth tighter the tattooed man chuckled and using his other hand found a pressure point on her neck and squeezed katherines jaw instantly dropped open she could feel his finger entering her mouth and running along her tongue she gagged and tried to bite it but the finger was already gone still grinning he raised his moist fingertip before her eyes then he closed his eyes and once again rubbed her saliva into the bare circle of flesh on his head the man sighed and slowly opened his eyes then with an eerie calm he turned and left the room in the sudden silence katherine could feel her heart pounding directly over her an unusual series of lights seemed to be modulating from purple red to a deep crimson illuminating the rooms low ceiling when she saw the ceiling all she could do was stare every inch was covered with drawings the mindboggling collage above her appeared to depict the celestial sky stars planets and constellations mingled with astrological symbols charts and formulas there were arrows predicting elliptical orbits geometric symbols indicating angles of ascension and zodiacal creatures peering down at her it looked like a mad scientist had gotten loose in the sistine chapel turning her head katherine looked away but the wall to her left was no better a series of candles on medieval floor stands shed a flickering glow on a wall that was completely hidden beneath pages of text photos and drawings some of the pages looked like papyrus or vellum torn from ancient books others were obviously from newer texts mixed in were photographs drawings maps and schematics all of them appeared to have been glued to the wall with meticulous care a spiderweb of strings had been thumbtacked across them interconnecting them in limitless chaotic possibilities katherine again looked away turning her head in the other direction unfortunately this provided the most terrifying view of all adjacent to the stone slab on which she was strapped there stood a small side counter that instantly reminded her of an instrument table from a hospital operating room on the counter was arranged a series of objects among them a syringe a vial of dark liquid and a large knife with a bone handle and a blade hewn of iron burnished to an unusually high shine my god what is he planning to do to me chapter when cia systems security specialist rick parrish finally loped into nola kayes office he was carrying a single sheet of paper what took you so long nola demanded i told you to come down immediately sorry he said pushing up his bottlebottom glasses on his long nose i was trying to gather more information for you but just show me what youve got parrish handed her the printout its a redaction but you get the gist nola scanned the page in amazement im still trying to figure out how a hacker got access parrish said but it looks like a delegator spider hijacked one of our search forget that nola blurted glancing up from the page what the hell is the cia doing with a classified file about pyramids ancient portals and engraved symbolons thats what took me so long i was trying to see what document was being targeted so i traced the file path parrish paused clearing his throat this document turns out to be on a partition personally assigned to the cia director himself nola wheeled staring in disbelief satos boss has a file about the masonic pyramid she knew that the current director along with many other top cia executives was a highranking mason but nola could not imagine any of them keeping masonic secrets on a cia computer then again considering what she had witnessed in the last twentyfour hours anything was possible agent simkins was lying on his stomach ensconced in the bushes of franklin square his eyes were trained on the columned entry of the almas temple nothing no lights had come on inside and no one had approached the door he turned his head and checked on bellamy the man was pacing alone in the middle of the park looking cold really cold simkins could see him shaking and shivering his phone vibrated it was sato how overdue is our target she demanded simkins checked his chronograph target said twenty minutes its been almost forty somethings wrong hes not coming sato said its over simkins knew she was right any word from hartmann no he never checked in from kalorama heights i cant reach him simkins stiffened if this was true then something was definitely wrong i just called field support sato said and they cant find him either holy shit do they have a gps location on the escalade yeah a residential address in kalorama heights sato said gather your men were pulling out sato clicked off her phone and gazed out at the majestic skyline of her nations capital an icy wind whipped through her light jacket and she wrapped her arms around herself to stay warm director inoue sato was not a woman who often felt cold or fear at the moment however she was feeling both chapter malakh wore only his silk loincloth as he dashed up the ramp through the steel door and out through the painting into his living room i need to prepare quickly he glanced over at the dead cia agent in the foyer this home is no longer safe carrying the stone pyramid in one hand malakh strode directly to his firstfloor study and sat down at his laptop computer as he logged in he pictured langdon downstairs and wondered how many days or even weeks would pass before the submerged corpse was discovered in the secret basement it made no difference malakh would be long gone by then langdon has served his role brilliantly not only had langdon reunited the pieces of the masonic pyramid he had figured out how to solve the arcane grid of symbols on the base at first glance the symbols seemed indecipherable and yet the answer was simple staring them in the face malakhs laptop sprang to life the screen displaying the same email he had received earlier a photograph of a glowing capstone partially blocked by warren bellamys finger the secret hides within the order franklin square eight franklin square katherine had told malakh she had also admitted that cia agents were staking out franklin square hoping to capture malakh and also figure out what order was being referenced by the capstone the masons the shriners the rosicrucians none of these malakh now knew langdon saw the truth ten minutes earlier with liquid rising around his face the harvard professor had figured out the key to solving the pyramid the order eight franklin square he had shouted terror in his eyes the secret hides within the order eight franklin square at first malakh failed to understand his meaning its not an address langdon yelled his mouth pressed to the plexiglas window the order eight franklin square its a magic square then he said something about albrecht dьrer and how the pyramids first code was a clue to breaking this final one malakh was familiar with magic squares kameas as the early mystics called them the ancient text de occulta philosophia described in detail the mystical power of magic squares and the methods for designing powerful sigils based on magical grids of numbers now langdon was telling him that a magic square held the key to deciphering the base of the pyramid you need an eightbyeight magic square the professor had been yelling his lips the only part of his body above the liquid magic squares are categorized in orders a threebythree square is an order three a fourbyfour square is an order four you need an order eight the liquid had been about to engulf langdon entirely and the professor drew one last desperate breath and shouted out something about a famous mason an american forefather a scientist mystic mathematician inventor as well as the creator of the mystical kamea that bore his name to this day franklin in a flash malakh knew langdon was right now breathless with anticipation malakh sat upstairs at his laptop he ran a quick web search received dozens of hits chose one and began reading the order eight franklin square one of historys bestknown magic squares is the ordereight square published in by american scientist benjamin franklin and which became famous for its inclusion of neverbeforeseen bent diagonal summations franklins obsession with this mystical art form most likely stemmed from his personal associations with the prominent alchemists and mystics of his day as well as his own belief in astrology which were the underpinnings for the predictions made in his poor richards almanack malakh studied franklins famous creation a unique arrangement of the numbers through in which every row column and diagonal added up to the same magical constant the secret hides within the order eight franklin square malakh smiled trembling with excitement he grabbed the stone pyramid and flipped it over examining the base these sixtyfour symbols needed to be reorganized and arranged in a different order their sequence defined by the numbers in franklins magic square although malakh could not imagine how this chaotic grid of symbols would suddenly make sense in a different order he had faith in the ancient promise ordo ab chao heart racing he took out a sheet of paper and quickly drew an empty eightbyeight grid then he began inserting the symbols one by one in their newly defined positions almost immediately to his astonishment the grid began making sense order from chaos he completed the entire decryption and stared in disbelief at the solution before him a stark image had taken shape the jumbled grid had been transformed reorganized and although malakh could not grasp the meaning of the entire message he understood enough enough to know exactly where he was now headed the pyramid points the way the grid pointed to one of the worlds great mystical locations incredibly it was the same location at which malakh had always fantasized he would complete his journey destiny chapter the stone table felt cold beneath katherine solomons back horrifying images of roberts death continued to swirl through her mind along with thoughts of her brother is peter dead too the strange knife on the nearby table kept bringing flashes of what might lie in store for her as well is this really the end oddly her thoughts turned abruptly to her research to noetic science and to her recent breakthroughs all of it lost up in smoke she would never be able to share with the world everything she had learned her most shocking discovery had taken place only a few months ago and the results had the potential to redefine the way humans thought about death strangely thinking now of that experiment was bringing her an unexpected solace as a young girl katherine solomon had often wondered if there was life after death does heaven exist what happens when we die as she grew older her studies in science quickly erased any fanciful notions of heaven hell or the afterlife the concept of life after death she came to accept was a human construct a fairy tale designed to soften the horrifying truth that was our mortality or so i believed a year ago katherine and her brother had been discussing one of philosophys most enduring questions the existence of the human soul specifically the issue of whether or not humans possessed some kind of consciousness capable of survival outside of the body they both sensed that such a human soul probably did exist most ancient philosophies concurred buddhist and brahminical wisdom endorsed metempsychosis the transmigration of the soul into a new body after death platonists defined the body as a prison from which the soul escaped and the stoics called the soul apospasma tou theu a particle of godand believed it was recalled by god upon death the existence of the human soul katherine noted with some frustration was probably a concept that would never be scientifically proven confirming that a consciousness survived outside the human body after death was akin to exhaling a puff of smoke and hoping to find it years later after their discussion katherine had a strange notion her brother had mentioned the book of genesis and its description of the soul as neshemah a kind of spiritual intelligence that was separate from the body it occurred to katherine that the word intelligence suggested the presence of thought noetic science clearly suggested that thoughts had mass and so it stood to reason then that the human soul might therefore also have mass can i weigh a human soul the notion was impossible of course foolish even to ponder it was three days later that katherine suddenly woke up from a dead sleep and sat bolt upright in bed she jumped up drove to her lab and immediately began work designing an experiment that was both startlingly simple and frighteningly bold she had no idea if it would work and she decided not to tell peter about her idea until her work was complete it took four months but finally katherine brought her brother into the lab she wheeled out a large piece of gear that she had been keeping hidden in the back storage room i designed and built it myself she said showing peter her invention any guesses her brother stared at the strange machine an incubator katherine laughed and shook her head although it was a reasonable guess the machine did look a bit like the transparent incubators for premature babies one saw in hospitals this machine however was adult size a long airtight clear plastic capsule like some kind of futuristic sleeping pod it sat atop a large piece of electronic gear see if this helps you guess katherine said plugging the contraption into a power source a digital display lit up on the machine its numbers jumping around as she carefully calibrated some dials when she was done the display read kg a scale peter asked looking puzzled not just any scale katherine took a tiny scrap of paper off a nearby counter and laid it gently on top of the capsule the numbers on the display jumped around again and then settled on a new reading kg highprecision microbalance she said resolution down to a few micrograms peter still looked puzzled you built a precise scale for a person exactly she lifted the transparent lid on the machine if i place a person inside this capsule and close the lid the individual is in an entirely sealed system nothing gets in or out no gas no liquid no dust particles nothing can escape not the persons breath exhalations evaporating sweat body fluids nothing peter ran a hand through his thick head of silver hair a nervous mannerism shared by katherine hmm obviously a person would die in there pretty quickly she nodded six minutes or so depending on their breathing rate he turned to her i dont get it she smiled you will leaving the machine behind katherine led peter into the cubes control room and sat him down in front of the plasma wall she began typing and accessed a series of video files stored on the holographic drives when the plasma wall flickered to life the image before them looked like homevideo footage the camera panned across a modest bedroom with an unmade bed medication bottles a respirator and a heart monitor peter looked baffled as the camera kept panning and finally revealed near the center of the bedroom katherines scale contraption peters eyes widened what the the capsules transparent lid was open and a very old man in an oxygen mask lay inside his elderly wife and a hospice worker stood beside the pod the mans breathing was labored and his eyes were closed the man in the capsule was a science teacher of mine at yale katherine said he and i have kept in touch over the years hes been very ill he always said he wanted to donate his body to science so when i explained my idea for this experiment he immediately wanted to be a part of it peter was apparently mute with shock as he stared at the scene unfolding before them the hospice worker now turned to the mans wife its time hes ready the old woman dabbed her tearful eyes and nodded with a resolute calm okay very gently the hospice worker reached into the pod and removed the mans oxygen mask the man stirred slightly but his eyes remained closed now the worker wheeled the respirator and other equipment off to the side leaving the old man in the capsule totally isolated in the center of the room the dying mans wife now approached the pod leaned down and gently kissed her husbands forehead the old man did not open his eyes but his lips moved ever so slightly into a faint loving smile without his oxygen mask the mans breathing was quickly becoming more labored the end was obviously near with an admirable strength and calm the mans wife slowly lowered the transparent lid of the capsule and sealed it shut exactly as katherine had taught her peter recoiled in alarm katherine what in the name of god its okay katherine whispered theres plenty of air in the capsule she had seen this video dozens of times now but it still made her pulse race she pointed to the scale beneath the dying mans sealed pod the digital numbers read kg thats his body weight katherine said the old mans breathing became more shallow and peter inched forward transfixed this is what he wanted katherine whispered watch what happens the mans wife had stepped back and was now seated on the bed silently looking on with the hospice worker over the course of the next sixty seconds the mans shallow breathing grew faster until all at once as if the man himself had chosen the moment he simply took his last breath everything stopped it was over the wife and hospice worker quietly comforted each other nothing else happened after a few seconds peter glanced over at katherine in apparent confusion wait for it she thought redirecting peters gaze to the capsules digital display which still quietly glowed showing the dead mans weight then it happened when peter saw it he jolted backward almost falling out of his chair but thats he covered his mouth in shock i cant it was seldom that the great peter solomon was speechless katherines reaction had been similar the first few times she saw what had happened moments after the mans death the numbers on the scale had decreased suddenly the man had become lighter immediately after his death the weight change was minuscule but it was measurable and the implications were utterly mindboggling katherine recalled writing in her lab notes with a trembling hand there seems to exist an invisible material that exits the human body at the moment of death it has quantifiable mass which is unimpeded by physical barriers i must assume it moves in a dimension i cannot yet perceive from the expression of shock on her brothers face katherine knew he understood the implications katherine he stammered blinking his gray eyes as if to make sure he was not dreaming i think you just weighed the human soul there was a long silence between them katherine sensed that her brother was attempting to process all the stark and wondrous ramifications it will take time if what they had just witnessed was indeed what it seemed to be that is evidence that a soul or consciousness or life force could move outside the realm of the body then a startling new light had just been shed on countless mystical questions transmigration cosmic consciousness neardeath experiences astral projection remote viewing lucid dreaming and on and on medical journals were filled with stories of patients who had died on the operating table viewed their bodies from above and then been brought back to life peter was silent and katherine now saw he had tears in his eyes she understood she had cried too peter and katherine had lost loved ones and for anyone in that position the faintest hint of the human spirit continuing after death brought a glimmer of hope hes thinking of zachary katherine thought recognizing the deep melancholy in her brothers eyes for years peter had carried the burden of responsibility for his sons death he had told katherine many times that leaving zachary in prison had been the worst mistake of his life and that he would never find a way to forgive himself a slamming door drew katherines attention and suddenly she was back in the basement lying on a cold stone table the metal door at the top of the ramp had closed loudly and the tattooed man was coming back down she could hear him entering one of the rooms down the hall doing something inside and then continuing along the hall toward the room she was in as he entered she could see that he was pushing something in front of him something heavy on wheels as he stepped into the light she stared in disbelief the tattooed man was pushing a person in a wheelchair intellectually katherines brain recognized the man in the chair emotionally her mind could barely accept what she was looking at peter she didnt know whether to be overjoyed that her brother was alive or utterly horrified peters body had been shaved smooth his mane of thick silver hair was all gone as were his eyebrows and his smooth skin glistened as if it had been oiled he wore a black silk gown where his right hand should have been he had only a stump wrapped in a clean fresh bandage her brothers painladen eyes reached out to hers filled with regret and sorrow peter her voice cracked her brother tried to speak but made only muffled guttural noises katherine now realized he was bound to the wheelchair and had been gagged the tattooed man reached down and gently stroked peters shaved scalp ive prepared your brother for a great honor he has a role to play tonight katherines entire body went rigid no peter and i will be leaving in a moment but i thought youd want to say goodbye where are you taking him she said weakly he smiled peter and i must journey to the sacred mountain that is where the treasure lies the masonic pyramid has revealed the location your friend robert langdon was most helpful katherine looked into her brothers eyes he killed robert her brothers expression contorted in agony and he shook his head violently as if unable to bear any more pain now now peter the man said again stroking peters scalp dont let this ruin the moment say goodbye to your little sister this is your final family reunion katherine felt her mind welling with desperation why are you doing this she shouted at him what have we ever done to you why do you hate my family so much the tattooed man came over and placed his mouth right next to her ear i have my reasons katherine then he walked to the side table and picked up the strange knife he brought it over to her and ran the burnished blade across her cheek this is arguably the most famous knife in history katherine knew of no famous knives but it looked foreboding and ancient the blade felt razor sharp dont worry he said i have no intention of wasting its power on you im saving it for a more worthy sacrifice in a more sacred place he turned to her brother peter you recognize this knife dont you her brothers eyes were wide with a mixture of fear and disbelief yes peter this ancient artifact still exists i obtained it at great expense and i have been saving it for you at long last you and i can end our painful journey together with that he wrapped the knife carefully in a cloth with all of his other items incense vials of liquid white satin cloths and other ceremonial objects he then placed the wrapped items inside robert langdons leather bag along with the masonic pyramid and capstone katherine looked on helplessly as the man zipped up langdons daybag and turned to her brother carry this peter would you he set the heavy bag on peters lap next the man walked over to a drawer and began rooting around she could hear small metal objects clinking when he returned he took her right arm steadying it katherine couldnt see what he was doing but peter apparently could and he again started bucking wildly katherine felt a sudden sharp pinch in the crook of her right elbow and an eerie warmth ran down around it peter was making anguished strangled sounds and trying in vain to get out of the heavy chair katherine felt a cold numbness spreading through her forearm and fingertips below the elbow when the man stepped aside katherine saw why her brother was so horrified the tattooed man had inserted a medical needle into her vein as if she were giving blood the needle however was not attached to a tube instead her blood was now flowing freely out of it running down her elbow forearm and onto the stone table a human hourglass the man said turning to peter in a short while when i ask you to play your role i want you to picture katherine dying alone here in the dark peters expression was one of total torment she will stay alive the man said for about an hour or so if you cooperate with me quickly i will have enough time to save her of course if you resist me at all your sister will die here alone in the dark peter bellowed unintelligibly through his gag i know i know the tattooed man said placing a hand on peters shoulder this is hard for you but it shouldnt be after all this is not the first time you will abandon a family member he paused bending over and whispering in peters ear im thinking of course of your son zachary in soganlik prison peter pulled against his restraints and let out another muffled scream through the cloth in his mouth stop it katherine shouted i remember that night well the man taunted as he finished packing i heard the whole thing the warden offered to let your son go but you chose to teach zachary a lesson by abandoning him your boy learned his lesson all right didnt he the man smiled his loss was my gain the man now retrieved a linen cloth and stuffed it deep into katherines mouth death he whispered to her should be a quiet thing peter struggled violently without another word the tattooed man slowly backed peters wheelchair out of the room giving peter a long last look at his sister katherine and peter locked eyes one final time then he was gone katherine could hear them going up the ramp and through the metal door as they exited she heard the tattooed man lock the metal door behind him and continue on through the painting of the three graces a few minutes later she heard a car start then the mansion fell silent all alone in the dark katherine lay bleeding chapter robert langdons mind hovered in an endless abyss no light no sound no feeling only an infinite and silent void softness weightlessness his body had released him he was untethered the physical world had ceased to exist time had ceased to exist he was pure consciousness now a fleshless sentience suspended in the emptiness of a vast universe chapter the modified uh skimmed in low over the expansive rooftops of kalorama heights thundering toward the coordinates given to them by the support team agent simkins was the first to spot the black escalade parked haphazardly on a lawn in front of one of the mansions the driveway gate was closed and the house was dark and quiet sato gave the signal to touch down the aircraft landed hard on the front lawn amid several other vehicles one of them a security sedan with a bubble light on top simkins and his team jumped out drew their weapons and dashed up onto the porch finding the front door locked simkins cupped his hands and peered through a window the foyer was dark but simkins could make out the faint shadow of a body on the floor shit he whispered its hartmann one of his agents grabbed a chair off the porch and heaved it through the bay window the sound of shattering glass was barely audible over the roar of the helicopter behind them seconds later they were all inside simkins rushed to the foyer and knelt over hartmann to check his pulse nothing there was blood everywhere then he saw the screwdriver in hartmanns throat jesus he stood up and motioned to his men to begin a full search the agents fanned out across the first floor their laser sights probing the darkness of the luxurious house they found nothing in the living room or study but in the dining room to their surprise they discovered a strangled female security guard simkins was fast losing hope that robert langdon and katherine solomon were alive this brutal killer clearly had set a trap and if he had managed to kill a cia agent and an armed security guard then it seemed a professor and a scientist had no chance once the first floor was secure simkins sent two agents to search upstairs meanwhile he found a set of basement stairs off the kitchen and descended at the bottom of the stairs he threw on the lights the basement was spacious and spotless as if it were hardly ever used boilers bare cement walls a few boxes nothing here at all simkins headed back up to the kitchen just as his men were coming down from the second floor everyone shook their heads the house was deserted no one home and no more bodies simkins radioed sato with the allclear and the grim update when he got to the foyer sato was already climbing the stairs onto the porch warren bellamy was visible behind her sitting dazed and alone in the helicopter with satos titanium briefcase at his feet the os directors secure laptop provided her with worldwide access to cia computer systems via encrypted satellite uplinks earlier tonight she had used this computer to share with bellamy some kind of information that had stunned the man into cooperating fully simkins had no idea what bellamy had seen but whatever it was the architect had been visibly shellshocked ever since as sato entered the foyer she paused a moment bowing her head over hartmanns body a moment later she raised her eyes and fixed them on simkins no sign of langdon or katherine or peter solomon simkins shook his head if theyre still alive he took them with him did you see a computer in the house yes maam in the office show me simkins led sato out of the foyer and into the living room the plush carpet was covered with broken glass from the shattered bay window they walked past a fireplace a large painting and several bookshelves to an office door the office was wood paneled with an antique desk and a large computer monitor sato walked around behind the desk and eyed the screen immediately scowling damn it she said under her breath simkins circled around and looked at the screen it was blank whats wrong sato pointed to an empty docking station on the desk he uses a laptop he took it with him simkins didnt follow does he have information you want to see no sato replied her tone grave he has information i want nobody to see downstairs in the hidden basement katherine solomon had heard the sounds of helicopter blades followed by breaking glass and heavy boots on the floor above her she tried to cry out for help but the gag in her mouth made it impossible she could barely make a sound the harder she tried the faster the blood began flowing from her elbow she was feeling short of breath and a little dizzy katherine knew she needed to calm down use your mind katherine with all of her intention she coaxed herself into a meditative state robert langdons mind floated through the emptiness of space he peered into the infinite void searching for any points of reference he found nothing total darkness total silence total peace there was not even the pull of gravity to tell him which way was up his body was gone this must be death time seemed to be telescoping stretching and compressing as if it had no bearings in this place he had lost all track of how much time had passed ten seconds ten minutes ten days suddenly however like distant fiery explosions in faroff galaxies memories began to materialize billowing toward langdon like shock waves across a vast nothingness all at once robert langdon began to remember the images tore through him vivid and disturbing he was staring up at a face that was covered with tattoos a pair of powerful hands lifted his head and smashed it into the floor pain erupted and then darkness gray light throbbing wisps of memory langdon was being dragged half conscious down down down his captor was chanting something verbum significatium verbum omnificum verbum perdo chapter director sato stood alone in the study waiting while the cia satelliteimaging division processed her request one of the luxuries of working in the dc area was the satellite coverage with luck one of them might have been properly positioned to get photos of this home tonight possibly capturing a vehicle leaving the place in the last half hour sorry maam the satellite technician said no coverage of those coordinates tonight do you want to make a reposition request no thanks too late she hung up sato exhaled now having no idea how they would figure out where their target had gone she walked out to the foyer where her men had bagged agent hartmanns body and were carrying it toward the chopper sato had ordered agent simkins to gather his men and prepare for the return to langley but simkins was in the living room on his hands and knees he looked like he was ill you okay he glanced up an odd look on his face did you see this he pointed at the livingroom floor sato came over and looked down at the plush carpet she shook her head seeing nothing crouch down simkins said look at the nap of the carpet she did after a moment she saw it the fibers of the carpet looked like they had been mashed down depressed along two straight lines as if the wheels of something heavy had been rolled across the room the strange thing simkins said is where the tracks go he pointed satos gaze followed the faint parallel lines across the livingroom carpet the tracks seemed to disappear beneath a large floortoceiling painting that hung beside the fireplace what in the world simkins walked over to the painting and tried to lift it down from the wall it didnt budge its fixed he said now running his fingers around the edges hold on theres something underneath his finger hit a small lever beneath the bottom edge and something clicked sato stepped forward as simkins pushed the frame and the entire painting rotated slowly on its center like a revolving door he raised his flashlight and shined it into the dark space beyond satos eyes narrowed here we go at the end of a short corridor stood a heavy metal door the memories that had billowed through the blackness of langdons mind had come and gone in their wake a trail of redhot sparks was swirling along with the same eerie distant whisper verbum significatium verbum omnificum verbum perdo the chanting continued like the drone of voices in a medieval canticle verbum significatium verbum omnificum the words now tumbled through the empty void fresh voices echoing all around him apocalypsis franklin apocalypsis verbum apocalypsis without warning a mournful bell began tolling somewhere in the distance the bell rang on and on growing louder it tolled more urgently now as if hoping langdon would understand as if urging his mind to follow chapter the tolling bell in the clock tower rang for three full minutes rattling the crystal chandelier that hung above langdons head decades ago he had attended lectures in this wellloved assembly hall at phillips exeter academy today however he was here to listen to a dear friend address the student body as the lights dimmed langdon took a seat against the back wall beneath a pantheon of headmaster portraits a hush fell across the crowd in total darkness a tall shadowy figure crossed the stage and took the podium good morning the faceless voice whispered into the microphone everyone sat up straining to see who was addressing them a slide projector flashed to life revealing a faded sepia photograph a dramatic castle with a red sandstone facade high square towers and gothic embellishments the shadow spoke again who can tell me where this is england a girl declared in the darkness this facade is a blend of early gothic and late romanesque making this the quintessential norman castle and placing it in england at about the twelfth century wow the faceless voice replied someone knows her architecture quiet groans all around unfortunately the shadow added you missed by three thousand miles and half a millennium the room perked up the projector now flashed a fullcolor modern photo of the same castle from a different angle the castles seneca creek sandstone towers dominated the foreground but in the background startlingly close stood the majestic white columned dome of the us capitol building hold on the girl exclaimed theres a norman castle in dc since the voice replied which is when this next photo was taken a new slide appeared a blackandwhite interior shot depicting a massive vaulted ballroom furnished with animal skeletons scientific display cases glass jars with biological samples archaeological artifacts and plaster casts of prehistoric reptiles this wondrous castle the voice said was americas first real science museum it was a gift to america from a wealthy british scientist who like our forefathers believed our fledgling country could become the land of enlightenment he bequeathed to our forefathers a massive fortune and asked them to build at the core of our nation an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge he paused a long moment who can tell me the name of this generous scientist a timid voice in front ventured james smithson a whisper of recognition rippled through the crowd smithson indeed the man on stage replied peter solomon now stepped into the light his gray eyes flashing playfully good morning my name is peter solomon and i am secretary of the smithsonian institution the students broke into wild applause in the shadows langdon watched with admiration as peter captivated the young minds with a photographic tour of the smithsonian institutions early history the show began with smithsonian castle its basement science labs corridors lined with exhibits a salon full of mollusks scientists who called themselves the curators of crustaceans and even an old photo of the castles two most popular residents a pair of nowdeceased owls named diffusion and increase the halfhour slide show ended with an impressive satellite photo of the national mall now lined with enormous smithsonian museums as i said when i began solomon stated in conclusion james smithson and our forefathers envisioned our great country to be a land of enlightenment i believe today they would be proud their great smithsonian institution stands as a symbol of science and knowledge at the very core of america it is a living breathing working tribute to our forefathers dream for america a country founded on the principles of knowledge wisdom and science solomon clicked off the slides to an energetic round of applause the houselights came up along with dozens of eager hands with questions solomon called on a small redhaired boy in the middle mr solomon the boy said sounding puzzled you said our forefathers fled the religious oppression of europe to establish a country on the principles of scientific advancement thats correct but i was under the impression our forefathers were devoutly religious men who founded america as a christian nation solomon smiled my friends dont get me wrong our forefathers were deeply religious men but they were deists men who believed in god but in a universal and openminded way the only religious ideal they put forth was religious freedom he pulled the microphone from the podium and strode out to the edge of the stage americas forefathers had a vision of a spiritually enlightened utopia in which freedom of thought education of the masses and scientific advancement would replace the darkness of outdated religious superstition a blond girl in back raised her hand yes sir the girl said holding up her cell phone ive been researching you online and wikipedia says youre a prominent freemason solomon held up his masonic ring i could have saved you the data charges the students laughed yes well the girl continued hesitating you just mentioned outdated religious superstition and it seems to me that if anyone is responsible for propagating outdated superstitions it would be the masons solomon seemed unfazed oh how so well ive read a lot about masonry and i know youve got a lot of strange ancient rituals and beliefs this article online even says that masons believe in the power of some kind of ancient magical wisdom which can elevate man to the realm of the gods everyone turned and stared at the girl as if she were nuts actually solomon said shes right the kids all spun around and faced front eyes widening solomon suppressed a smile and asked the girl does it offer any other wikiwisdom about this magical knowledge the girl looked uneasy now but she began to read from the web site to ensure this powerful wisdom could not be used by the unworthy the early adepts wrote down their knowledge in code cloaking its potent truth in a metaphorical language of symbols myth and allegory to this day this encrypted wisdom is all around us encoded in our mythology our art and the occult texts of the ages unfortunately modern man has lost the ability to decipher this complex network of symbolism and the great truth has been lost solomon waited thats all the girl shifted in her seat actually there is a little bit more i should hope so please tell us the girl looked hesitant but she cleared her throat and continued according to legend the sages who encrypted the ancient mysteries long ago left behind a key of sorts a password that could be used to unlock the encrypted secrets this magical password known as the verbum significatium is said to hold the power to lift the darkness and unlock the ancient mysteries opening them to all human understanding solomon smiled wistfully ah yes the verbum significatium he stared into space for a moment and then lowered his eyes again to the blond girl and where is this wonderful word now the girl looked apprehensive clearly wishing she had not challenged their guest speaker she finished reading legend holds that the verbum significatium is buried deep underground where it waits patiently for a pivotal moment in history a moment when mankind can no longer survive without the truth knowledge and wisdom of the ages at this dark crossroads mankind will at last unearth the word and herald in a wondrous new age of enlightenment the girl turned off her phone and shrank down in her seat after a long silence another student raised his hand mr solomon you dont actually believe that right solomon smiled why not our mythologies have a long tradition of magic words that provide insight and godlike powers to this day children still shout abracadabra in hopes of creating something out of nothing of course weve all forgotten that this word is not a toy it has roots in ancient aramaic mysticism avrah kadabra meaning i create as i speak silence but sir the student now pressed surely you dont believe that a single word this verbum significatium whatever it is has the power to unlock ancient wisdom and bring about a worldwide enlightenment peter solomons face revealed nothing my own beliefs should not concern you what should concern you is that this prophecy of a coming enlightenment is echoed in virtually every faith and philosophical tradition on earth hindus call it the krita age astrologers call it the age of aquarius the jews describe the coming of the messiah theosophists call it the new age cosmologists call it harmonic convergence and predict the actual date december someone called yes unnervingly soon if youre a believer in mayan math langdon chuckled recalling how solomon ten years ago had correctly predicted the current spate of television specials predicting that the year would mark the end of the world timing aside solomon said i find it wondrous to note that throughout history all of mankinds disparate philosophies have all concurred on one thing that a great enlightenment is coming in every culture in every era in every corner of the world the human dream has focused on the same exact concept the coming apotheosis of man the impending transformation of our human minds into their true potentiality he smiled what could possibly explain such a synchronicity of beliefs truth said a quiet voice in the crowd solomon wheeled who said that the hand that went up belonged to a tiny asian boy whose soft features suggested he might be nepalese or tibetan maybe there is a universal truth embedded in everyones soul maybe we all have the same story hiding inside like a shared constant in our dna maybe this collective truth is responsible for the similarity in all of our stories solomon was beaming as he pressed his hands together and bowed reverently to the boy thank you everyone was quiet truth solomon said addressing the room truth has power and if we all gravitate toward similar ideas maybe we do so because those ideas are true written deep within us and when we hear the truth even if we dont understand it we feel that truth resonate within us vibrating with our unconscious wisdom perhaps the truth is not learned by us but rather the truth is recalled remembered recognized as that which is already inside us the silence in the hall was complete solomon let it sit for a long moment then quietly said in closing i should warn you that unveiling the truth is never easy throughout history every period of enlightenment has been accompanied by darkness pushing in opposition such are the laws of nature and balance and if we look at the darkness growing in the world today we have to realize that this means there is equal light growing we are on the verge of a truly great period of illumination and all of us all of you are profoundly blessed to be living through this pivotal moment of history of all the people who have ever lived in all the eras in history we are in that narrow window of time during which we will bear witness to our ultimate renaissance after millennia of darkness we will see our sciences our minds and even our religions unveil the truth solomon was about to get a hearty round of applause when he held up his hand for silence miss he pointed directly to the contentious blond girl in back with the cell phone i know you and i didnt agree on much but i want to thank you your passion is an important catalyst in the coming changes darkness feeds on apathy and conviction is our most potent antidote keep studying your faith study the bible he smiled especially the final pages the apocalypse she said absolutely the book of revelation is a vibrant example of our shared truth the last book of the bible tells the identical story as countless other traditions they all predict the coming unveiling of great wisdom someone else said but isnt the apocalypse about the end of the world you know the antichrist armageddon the final battle between good and evil solomon chuckled who here studies greek several hands went up what does the word apocalypse literally mean it means one student began and then paused as if surprised apocalypse means to unveil or to reveal solomon gave the boy a nod of approval exactly the apocalypse is literally a revealation the book of revealation in the bible predicts an unveiling of great truth and unimaginable wisdom the apocalypse is not the end of the world but rather it is the end of the world as we know it the prophecy of the apocalypse is just one of the bibles beautiful messages that has been distorted solomon stepped to the front of the stage believe me the apocalypse is coming and it will be nothing like what we were taught high over his head the bell began to toll the students erupted into bewildered and thunderous applause chapter katherine solomon was teetering on the edge of consciousness when she was jolted by the shock wave of a deafening explosion moments later she smelled smoke her ears were ringing there were muffled voices distant shouting footsteps suddenly she was breathing more clearly the cloth had been pulled from her mouth youre safe a mans voice whispered just hold on she expected the man to pull the needle out of her arm but instead he was yelling orders bring the medical kit attach an iv to the needle infuse lactated ringers solution get me a blood pressure as the man began checking her vital signs he said ms solomon the person who did this to you where did he go katherine tried to speak but she could not ms solomon the voice repeated where did he go katherine tried to pry her eyes open but she felt herself fading we need to know where he went the man urged katherine whispered three words in response although she knew they made no sense the sacred mountain director sato stepped over the mangled steel door and descended a wooden ramp into the hidden basement one of her agents met her at the bottom director i think youll want to see this sato followed the agent into a small room off the narrow hallway the room was brightly lit and barren except for a pile of clothing on the floor she recognized robert langdons tweed coat and loafers her agent pointed toward the far wall at a large casketlike container what in the world sato moved toward the container seeing now that it was fed by a clear plastic pipe that ran through the wall warily she approached the tank now she could see that it had a small slider on top she reached down and slid the covering to one side revealing a small portallike window sato recoiled beneath the plexiglas floated the submerged vacant face of professor robert langdon light the endless void in which langdon hovered was suddenly filled by a blinding sun rays of whitehot light streamed across the blackness of space burning into his mind the light was everywhere suddenly within the radiant cloud before him a beautiful silhouette appeared it was a face blurry and indistinct two eyes staring at him across the void streams of light surrounded the face and langdon wondered if he was looking into the face of god sato stared down into the tank wondering if professor langdon had any idea what had happened she doubted it after all disorientation was the entire purpose of this technology sensorydeprivation tanks had been around since the fifties and were still a popular getaway for wealthy new age experimenters floating as it was called offered a transcendental backtothewomb experience a kind of meditative aid that quieted brain activity by removing all sensory input light sound touch and even the pull of gravity in traditional tanks the person would float on his back in a hyperbuoyant saline solution that kept his face above the water so he could breathe in recent years however these tanks had taken a quantum leap oxygenated perfluorocarbons this new technology known as total liquid ventilation tlv was so counterintuitive that few believed it existed breathable liquid liquid breathing had been a reality since when leland c clark successfully kept alive a mouse that had been submerged for several hours in an oxygenated perfluorocarbon in tlv technology made a dramatic appearance in the movie the abyss although few viewers realized that they were watching real science total liquid ventilation had been born of modern medicines attempts to help premature babies breathe by returning them to the liquidfilled state of the womb human lungs having spent nine months in utero were no strangers to a liquidfilled state perfluorocarbons had once been too viscous to be fully breathable but modern breakthroughs had made breathable liquids almost the consistency of water the cias directorate of science and technology the wizards of langley as they were known within the intelligence community had worked extensively with oxygenated perfluorocarbons to develop technologies for the us military the navys elite deepocean diving teams found that breathing oxygenated liquid rather than the usual heliox or trimix gave them the ability to dive to much greater depths without risk of pressure sickness similarly nasa and the air force had learned that pilots equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus rather than a traditional oxygen tank could withstand far higher gforces than usual because liquid spread the gforce more evenly throughout the internal organs than gas did sato had heard that there were now extreme experience labs where one could try these total liquid ventilation tanks meditation machines as they were called this particular tank had probably been installed for its owners private experimentation although the addition of heavy lockable latches left little doubt in satos mind that this tank had also been used for darker applications an interrogation technique with which the cia was familiar the infamous interrogation technique of water boarding was highly effective because the victim truly believed he was drowning sato knew of several classified operations in which sensorydeprivation tanks like these had been used to enhance that illusion to terrifying new levels a victim submerged in breathable liquid could literally be drowned the panic associated with the drowning experience usually made the victim unaware that the liquid he was breathing was slightly more viscous than water when the liquid poured into his lungs he would often black out from fear and then awaken in the ultimate solitary confinement topical numbing agents paralysis drugs and hallucinogens were mixed with the warm oxygenated liquid to give the prisoner the sense he was entirely separated from his body when his mind sent commands to move his limbs nothing happened the state of being dead was terrifying on its own but the true disorientation came from the rebirthing process which with the aid of bright lights cold air and deafening noise could be extremely traumatic and painful after a handful of rebirths and subsequent drownings the prisoner became so disorientated that he had no idea if he was alive or dead and he would tell the interrogator absolutely anything sato wondered if she should wait for a medical team to extract langdon but she knew she didnt have time i need to know what he knows turn out the lights she said and find me some blankets the blinding sun had vanished the face had also disappeared the blackness had returned but langdon could now hear distant whispers echoing across the lightyears of emptiness muffled voices unintelligible words there were vibrations now as if the world were about to shake apart then it happened without warning the universe was ripped in two an enormous chasm opened in the void as if space itself had ruptured at the seams a grayish mist poured through the opening and langdon saw a terrifying sight disembodied hands were suddenly reaching for him grabbing his body trying to yank him out of his world no he tried to fight them off but he had no arms no fists or did he suddenly he felt his body materializing around his mind his flesh had returned and it was being seized by powerful hands that were dragging him upward no please but it was too late pain racked his chest as the hands heaved him through the opening his lungs felt like they were filled with sand i cant breathe he was suddenly on his back on the coldest hardest surface he could imagine something was pressing on his chest over and over hard and painful he was spewing out the warmth i want to go back he felt like he was a child being born from a womb he was convulsing coughing up liquid he felt pain in his chest and neck excruciating pain his throat was on fire people were talking trying to whisper but it was deafening his vision was blurred and all he could see was muted shapes his skin felt numb like dead leather his chest felt heavier now pressure i cant breathe he was coughing up more liquid an overwhelming gag reflex seized him and he gasped inward cold air poured into his lungs and he felt like a newborn taking his first breath on earth this world was excruciating all langdon wanted was to return to the womb robert langdon had no idea how much time had passed he could feel now that he was lying on his side wrapped in towels and blankets on a hard floor a familiar face was gazing down at him but the streams of glorious light were gone the echoes of distant chanting still hung in his mind verbum significatium verbum omnificum professor langdon someone whispered do you know where you are langdon nodded weakly still coughing more important he had begun to realize what was going on tonight chapter wrapped in wool blankets langdon stood on wobbly legs and stared down at the open tank of liquid his body had returned to him although he wished it had not his throat and lungs burned this world felt hard and cruel sato had just explained the sensorydeprivation tank adding that if she had not pulled him out he would have died of starvation or worse langdon had little doubt that peter had endured a similar experience peter is in the inbetween the tattooed man had told him earlier tonight he is in purgatory hamistagan if peter had endured more than one of those birthing processes langdon would not have been surprised if peter had told his captor anything he had wanted to know sato motioned for langdon to follow her and he did trudging slowly down a narrow hall deeper into this bizarre lair that he was now seeing for the first time they entered a square room with a stone table and eeriecolored lighting katherine was here and langdon heaved a sigh of relief even so the scene was worrisome katherine was lying on her back on a stone table bloodsoaked towels lay on the floor a cia agent was holding an iv bag above her the tube connected to her arm she was sobbing quietly katherine langdon croaked barely able to speak she turned her head looking disorientated and confused robert her eyes widened with disbelief and then joy but i saw you drown he moved toward the stone table katherine pulled herself to a seated position ignoring her iv tube and the medical objections of the agent langdon reached the table and katherine reached out wrapping her arms around his blanketclad body holding him close thank god she whispered kissing his cheek then she kissed him again squeezing him as though she didnt believe he was real i dont understand how sato began saying something about sensorydeprivation tanks and oxygenated perfluorocarbons but katherine clearly wasnt listening she just held langdon close robert she said peters alive her voice wavered as she recounted her horrifying reunion with peter she described his physical condition the wheelchair the strange knife the allusions to some kind of sacrifice and how she had been left bleeding as a human hourglass to persuade peter to cooperate quickly langdon could barely speak do you have any idea where they went he said he was taking peter to the sacred mountain langdon pulled away and stared at her katherine had tears in her eyes he said he had deciphered the grid on the bottom of the pyramid and that the pyramid told him to go to the sacred mountain professor sato pressed does that mean anything to you langdon shook his head not at all still he felt a surge of hope but if he got the information off the bottom of the pyramid we can get it too i told him how to solve it sato shook her head the pyramids gone weve looked he took it with him langdon remained silent a moment closing his eyes and trying to recall what he had seen on the base of the pyramid the grid of symbols had been one of the last images he had seen before drowning and trauma had a way of burning memories deeper into the mind he could recall some of the grid definitely not all of it but maybe enough he turned to sato and said hurriedly i may be able to remember enough but i need you to look up something on the internet she pulled out her blackberry run a search for the order eight franklin square sato gave him a startled look but began typing without questions langdons vision was still blurry and he was only now starting to process his strange surroundings he realized that the stone table on which they were leaning was covered with old bloodstains and the wall to his right was entirely plastered with pages of text photos drawings maps and a giant web of strings interconnecting them my god langdon moved toward the strange collage still clutching the blankets around his body tacked on the wall was an utterly bizarre collection of information pages from ancient texts ranging from black magic to christian scripture drawings of symbols and sigils pages of conspiracytheory web sites and satellite photos of washington dc scrawled with notes and question marks one of the sheets was a long list of words in many languages he recognized some of them as sacred masonic words others as ancient magic words and others from ceremonial incantations is that what hes looking for a word is it that simple langdons longstanding skepticism about the masonic pyramid was based largely on what it allegedly revealed the location of the ancient mysteries this discovery would have to involve an enormous vault filled with thousands upon thousands of volumes that had somehow survived the longlost ancient libraries in which they had once been stored it all seemed impossible a vault that big beneath dc now however his recollection of peters lecture at phillips exeter combined with these lists of magic words had opened another startling possibility langdon most definitely did not believe in the power of magic words and yet it seemed pretty clear that the tattooed man did his pulse quickened as he again scanned the scrawled notes the maps the texts the printouts and all the interconnected strings and sticky notes sure enough there was one recurring theme my god hes looking for the verbum significatium the lost word langdon let the thought take shape recalling fragments of peters lecture the lost word is what hes looking for thats what he believes is buried here in washington sato arrived beside him is this what you asked for she handed him her blackberry langdon looked at the eightbyeight grid of numbers on the screen exactly he grabbed a piece of scrap paper ill need a pen sato handed him one from her pocket please hurry inside the basement office of the directorate of science and technology nola kaye was once again studying the redacted document brought to her by syssec rick parrish what the hell is the cia director doing with a file about ancient pyramids and secret underground locations she grabbed the phone and dialed sato answered instantly sounding tense nola i was just about to call you i have new information nola said im not sure how this fits but ive discovered theres a redacted forget it whatever it is sato interrupted were out of time we failed to apprehend the target and i have every reason to believe hes about to carry out his threat nola felt a chill the good news is we know exactly where hes going sato took a deep breath the bad news is that hes carrying a laptop with him chapter less than ten miles away malakh tucked the blanket around peter solomon and wheeled him across a moonlit parking lot into the shadow of an enormous building the structure had exactly thirtythree outer columns each precisely thirtythree feet tall the mountainous structure was deserted at this hour and nobody would ever see them back here not that it mattered from a distance no one would think twice about a tall kindlylooking man in a long black coat taking a bald invalid for an evening stroll when they reached the rear entrance malakh wheeled peter up close to the security keypad peter stared at it defiantly clearly having no intention of entering the code malakh laughed you think youre here to let me in have you forgotten so soon that i am one of your brethren he reached out and typed the access code that he had been given after his initiation to the thirtythird degree the heavy door clicked open peter groaned and began struggling in the wheelchair peter peter malakh cooed picture katherine be cooperative and she will live you can save her i give you my word malakh wheeled his captive inside and relocked the door behind them his heart racing now with anticipation he pushed peter through some hallways to an elevator and pressed the call button the doors opened and malakh backed in pulling the wheelchair along with him then making sure peter could see what he was doing he reached out and pressed the uppermost button a look of deepening dread crossed peters tortured face shh malakh whispered gently stroking peters shaved head as the elevator doors closed as you well know the secret is how to die i cant remember all the symbols langdon closed his eyes doing his best to recall the precise locations of the symbols on the bottom of the stone pyramid but even his eidetic memory did not have that degree of recall he wrote down the few symbols he could remember placing each one in the location indicated by franklins magic square so far however he saw nothing that made any sense look katherine urged you must be on the right track the first row is all greek letters the same kinds of symbols are being arranged together langdon had noticed this too but he could not think of any greek word that fit that configuration of letters and spaces i need the first letter he glanced again at the magic square trying to recall the letter that had been in the number one spot near the lower left corner think he closed his eyes trying to picture the base of the pyramid the bottom row next to the lefthand corner what letter was there for an instant langdon was back in the tank racked with terror staring up through the plexiglas at the bottom of the pyramid now suddenly he saw it he opened his eyes breathing heavily the first letter is h langdon turned back to the grid and wrote in the first letter the word was still incomplete but he had seen enough suddenly he realized what the word might be µ pulse pounding langdon typed a new search into the blackberry he entered the english equivalent of this wellknown greek word the first hit that appeared was an encyclopedia entry he read it and knew it had to be right heredom n a significant word in high degree freemasonry from french rose croix rituals where it refers to a mythical mountain in scotland the legendary site of the first such chapter from the greek µ originating from hierosdomos greek for holy house thats it langdon exclaimed incredulous thats where they went sato had been reading over his shoulder and looked lost to a mythical mountain in scotland langdon shook his head no to a building in washington whose code name is heredom chapter the house of the temple known among its brethren as heredom had always been the crown jewel of the masonic scottish rite in america with its steeply sloped pyramidical roof the building was named for an imaginary scottish mountain malakh knew however there was nothing imaginary about the treasure hidden here this is the place he knew the masonic pyramid has shown the way as the old elevator slowly made its way to the third floor malakh took out the piece of paper on which he had reorganized the grid of symbols using the franklin square all the greek letters had now shifted to the first row along with one simple symbol the message could not have been more clear beneath the house of the temple heredom the lost word is here somewhere although malakh did not know precisely how to locate it he was confident that the answer lay in the remaining symbols on the grid conveniently when it came to unlocking the secrets of the masonic pyramid and of this building no one was more qualified to help than peter solomon the worshipful master himself peter continued to struggle in the wheelchair making muffled sounds through his gag i know youre worried about katherine malakh said but its almost over for malakh the end felt like it had arrived very suddenly after all the years of pain and planning waiting and searching the moment had now arrived the elevator began to slow and he felt a rush of excitement the carriage jolted to a stop the bronze doors slid open and malakh gazed out at the glorious chamber before them the massive square room was adorned with symbols and bathed in moonlight which shone down through the oculus at the pinnacle of the ceiling high above i have come full circle malakh thought the temple room was the same place in which peter solomon and his brethren had so foolishly initiated malakh as one of their own now the masons most sublime secret something that most of the brethren did not even believe existed was about to be unearthed he wont find anything langdon said still feeling groggy and disorientated as he followed sato and the others up the wooden ramp out of the basement there is no actual word its all a metaphor a symbol of the ancient mysteries katherine followed with two agents assisting her weakened body up the ramp as the group moved gingerly through the wreckage of the steel door through the rotating painting and into the living room langdon explained to sato that the lost word was one of freemasonrys most enduring symbols a single word written in an arcane language that man could no longer decipher the word like the mysteries themselves promised to unveil its hidden power only to those enlightened enough to decrypt it it is said langdon concluded that if you can possess and understand the lost word then the ancient mysteries will become clear to you sato glanced over so you believe this man is looking for a word langdon had to admit it sounded absurd at face value and yet it answered a lot of questions look im no specialist in ceremonial magic he said but from the documents on his basement walls and from katherines description of the untattooed flesh on his head id say hes hoping to find the lost word and inscribe it on his body sato moved the group toward the dining room outside the helicopter was warming up its blades thundering louder and louder langdon kept talking thinking aloud if this guy truly believes he is about to unlock the power of the ancient mysteries no symbol would be more potent in his mind than the lost word if he could find it and inscribe it on the top of his head a sacred location in itself then he would no doubt consider himself perfectly adorned and ritualistically prepared to he paused seeing katherine blanch at the thought of peters impending fate but robert she said weakly her voice barely audible over the helicopter blades this is good news right if he wants to inscribe the lost word on the top of his head before he sacrifices peter then we have time he wont kill peter until he finds the word and if there is no word langdon tried to look hopeful as the agents helped katherine into a chair unfortunately peter still thinks youre bleeding to death he thinks the only way to save you is to cooperate with this lunatic probably to help him find the lost word so what she insisted if the word doesnt exist katherine langdon said staring deeply into her eyes if i believed you were dying and if someone promised me i could save you by finding the lost word then i would find this man a word any word and then id pray to god he kept his promise director sato an agent shouted from the next room youd better see this sato hurried out of the dining room and saw one of her agents coming down the stairs from the bedroom he was carrying a blond wig what the hell mans hairpiece he said handing it to her found it in the dressing room have a close look the blond wig was much heavier than sato expected the skullcap seemed to be molded of a thick gel strangely the underside of the wig had a wire protruding from it gelpack battery that molds to your scalp the agent said powers a fiberoptic pinpoint camera hidden in the hair what sato felt around with her fingers until she found the tiny camera lens nestled invisibly within the blond bangs this things a hidden camera video camera the agent said stores footage on this tiny solidstate card he pointed to a stampsize square of silicon embedded in the skullcap probably motion activated jesus she thought so thats how he did it this sleek version of the flower in the lapel secret camera had played a key role in the crisis the os director was facing tonight she glared at it a moment longer and then handed it back to the agent keep searching the house she said i want every bit of information you can find on this guy we know his laptop is missing and i want to know exactly how he plans to connect it to the outside world while hes on the move search his study for manuals cables anything at all that might give us a clue about his hardware yes maam the agent hurried off time to move out sato could hear the whine of the helicopter blades at full pitch she hurried back to the dining room where simkins had now ushered warren bellamy in from the helicopter and was gathering intel from him about the building to which they believed their target had gone house of the temple the front doors are sealed from within bellamy was saying still wrapped in a foil blanket and shivering visibly from his time outside in franklin square the buildings rear entrance is your only way in its got a keypad with an access pin known only to the brothers whats the pin simkins demanded taking notes bellamy sat down looking too feeble to stand through chattering teeth he recited his access code and then added the address is sixteenth but youll want the access drive and parking area behind the building kind of tricky to find but i know exactly where it is langdon said ill show you when we get there simkins shook his head youre not coming professor this is a military the hell im not langdon fired back peters in there and that buildings a labyrinth without someone to lead you in youll take ten minutes to find your way up to the temple room hes right bellamy said its a maze there is an elevator but its old and loud and opens in full view of the temple room if you hope to move in quietly youll need to ascend on foot youll never find your way langdon warned from that rear entrance youre navigating through the hall of regalia the hall of honor the middle landing the atrium the grand stair enough sato said langdons coming chapter the energy was growing malakh could feel it pulsing within him moving up and down his body as he wheeled peter solomon toward the altar i will exit this building infinitely more powerful than when i entered all that remained now was to locate the final ingredient verbum significatium he whispered to himself verbum omnificum malakh parked peters wheelchair beside the altar and then circled around and unzipped the heavy daybag that sat on peters lap reaching inside he lifted out the stone pyramid and held it up in the moonlight directly in front of peters eyes showing him the grid of symbols engraved on the bottom all these years he taunted and you never knew how the pyramid kept her secrets malakh set the pyramid carefully on the corner of the altar and returned to the bag and this talisman he continued extracting the golden capstone did indeed bring order from chaos exactly as promised he placed the metal capstone carefully atop the stone pyramid and then stepped back to give peter a clear view behold your symbolon is complete peters face contorted and he tried in vain to speak good i can see you have something youd like to tell me malakh roughly yanked out the gag peter solomon coughed and gasped for several seconds before he finally managed to speak katherine katherines time is short if you want to save her i suggest you do exactly as i say malakh suspected she was probably already dead or if not very close it made no difference she was lucky to have lived long enough to say goodbye to her brother please peter begged his voice ragged send an ambulance for her i will do exactly that but first you must tell me how to access the secret staircase peters expression turned to one of disbelief what the staircase masonic legend speaks of stairs that descend hundreds of feet to the secret location where the lost word is buried peter now looked panicked you know the legend malakh baited a secret staircase hidden beneath a stone he pointed to the central altar a huge block of granite with a gilded inscription in hebrew god said let there be light and there was light obviously this is the right place the entrance to the staircase must be hidden on one of the floors beneath us there is no secret staircase in this building peter shouted malakh smiled patiently and motioned upward this building is shaped like a pyramid he pointed to the foursided vaulted ceiling that angled up to the square oculus in the center yes the house of the temple is a pyramid but what does peter i have all night malakh smoothed his white silk robe over his perfect body katherine however does not if you want her to live you will tell me how to access the staircase i already told you he declared there is no secret staircase in this building no malakh calmly produced the sheet of paper on which he had reorganized the grid of symbols from the base of the pyramid this is the masonic pyramids final message your friend robert langdon helped me decipher it malakh raised the paper and held it in front of peters eyes the worshipful master inhaled sharply when he saw it not only had the sixtyfour symbols been organized into clearly meaningful groups but an actual image had materialized out of the chaos an image of a staircase beneath a pyramid peter solomon stared in disbelief at the grid of symbols before him the masonic pyramid had kept its secret for generations now suddenly it was being unveiled and he felt a cold sense of foreboding in the pit of his stomach the pyramids final code at a glance the true meaning of these symbols remained a mystery to peter and yet he could immediately understand why the tattooed man believed what he believed he thinks there is a hidden staircase beneath the pyramid called heredom he misunderstands these symbols where is it the tattooed man demanded tell me how to find the staircase and i will save katherine i wish i could do that peter thought but the staircase is not real the myth of the staircase was purely symbolic part of the great allegories of masonry the winding staircase as it was known appeared on the seconddegree tracing boards it represented mans intellectual climb toward the divine truth like jacobs ladder the winding staircase was a symbol of the pathway to heaven the journey of man toward god the connection between the earthly and spiritual realms its steps represented the many virtues of the mind he should know that peter thought he endured all the initiations every masonic initiate learned of the symbolic staircase that he could ascend enabling him to participate in the mysteries of human science freemasonry like noetic science and the ancient mysteries revered the untapped potential of the human mind and many of masonrys symbols related to human physiology the mind sits like a golden capstone atop the physical body the philosophers stone through the staircase of the spine energy ascends and descends circulating connecting the heavenly mind to the physical body peter knew it was no coincidence that the spine was made up of exactly thirtythree vertebrae thirtythree are the degrees of masonry the base of the spine or sacrum literally meant sacred bone the body is indeed a temple the human science that masons revered was the ancient understanding of how to use that temple for its most potent and noble purpose unfortunately explaining the truth to this man was not going to help katherine at all peter gazed down at the grid of symbols and gave a defeated sigh youre right he lied there is indeed a secret staircase beneath this building and as soon as you send help to katherine ill take you to it the man with the tattoos simply stared at him solomon glared back eyes defiant either save my sister and learn the truth or kill us both and remain ignorant forever the man quietly lowered the paper and shook his head im not happy with you peter you failed your test you still take me for a fool do you truly believe i dont understand what it is i seek do you think i have not yet grasped my true potential with that the man turned his back and slipped off his robe as the white silk fluttered to the floor peter saw for the first time the long tattoo running up the mans spine dear god winding up from the mans white loincloth an elegant spiral staircase ascended the middle of his muscular back each stair was positioned on a different vertebra speechless peter let his eyes ascend the staircase all the way up to the base of the mans skull peter could only stare the tattooed man now tipped his shaved head backward revealing the circle of bare flesh on the pinnacle of his skull the virgin skin was bordered by a single snake looped in a circle consuming itself atonement slowly now the man lowered his head and turned to face peter the massive doubleheaded phoenix on his chest stared out through dead eyes i am looking for the lost word the man said are you going to help me or are you and your sister going to die you know how to find it malakh thought you know something youre not telling me peter solomon had revealed things under interrogation that he probably didnt even recall now the repeated sessions in and out of the deprivation tank had left him delirious and compliant incredibly when he spilled his guts everything he told malakh had been consistent with the legend of the lost word the lost word is not a metaphor it is real the word is written in an ancient language and has been hidden for ages the word is capable of bringing unfathomable power to anyone who grasps its true meaning the word remains hidden to this day and the masonic pyramid has the power to unveil it peter malakh now said staring into his captives eyes when you looked at that grid of symbols you saw something you had a revelation this grid means something to you tell me i will tell you nothing until you send help to katherine malakh smiled at him believe me the prospect of losing your sister is the least of your worries right now without another word he turned to langdons daybag and started removing the items he had packed in his basement then he began meticulously arranging them on the sacrificial altar a folded silk cloth pure white a silver censer egyptian myrrh a vial of peters blood mixed with ash a black crows feather his sacred stylus the sacrificial knife forged of iron from a meteorite in the desert of canaan you think i am afraid to die peter shouted his voice racked with anguish if katherine is gone i have nothing left youve murdered my entire family youve taken everything from me not everything malakh replied not yet he reached into the daybag and pulled out the laptop from his study he turned it on and looked over at his captive im afraid you have not yet grasped the true nature of your predicament chapter langdon felt his stomach drop as the cia helicopter leaped off the lawn banked hard and accelerated faster than he ever imagined a helicopter could move katherine had stayed behind to recuperate with bellamy while one of the cia agents searched the mansion and waited for a backup team before langdon left she had kissed him on the cheek and whispered be safe robert now langdon was holding on for dear life as the military helicopter finally leveled out and raced toward the house of the temple seated beside him sato was yelling up to the pilot head for dupont circle she shouted over the deafening noise well set down there startled langdon turned to her dupont thats blocks from the house of the temple we can land in the temple parking lot sato shook her head we need to enter the building quietly if our target hears us coming we dont have time langdon argued this lunatic is about to murder peter maybe the sound of the helicopter will scare him and make him stop sato stared at him with icecold eyes as i have told you peter solomons safety is not my primary objective i believe ive made that clear langdon was in no mood for another nationalsecurity lecture look im the only one on board who knows his way through that building careful professor the director warned you are here as a member of my team and i will have your complete cooperation she paused a moment and then added in fact it might be wise if i now apprised you fully of the severity of our crisis tonight sato reached under her seat and pulled out a sleek titanium briefcase which she opened to reveal an unusually complicatedlooking computer when she turned it on a cia logo materialized along with a login prompt as sato logged in she asked professor do you remember the blond hairpiece we found in the mans home yes well hidden within that wig was a tiny fiberoptic camera concealed in the bangs a hidden camera i dont understand sato looked grim you will she launched a file on the laptop one moment please decrypting file a video window popped up filling the entire screen sato lifted the briefcase and set it on langdons thighs giving him a frontrow seat an unusual image materialized on the screen langdon recoiled in surprise what the hell murky and dark the video was of a blindfolded man he was dressed in the garb of a medieval heretic being led to the gallows noose around his neck left pant leg rolled up to the knee right sleeve rolled up to the elbow and his shirt gaping open to reveal his bare chest langdon stared in disbelief he had read enough about masonic rituals to recognize exactly what he was looking at a masonic initiate preparing to enter the first degree the man was very muscular and tall with a familiar blond hairpiece and deeply tanned skin langdon recognized his features at once the mans tattoos had obviously been concealed beneath bronzing makeup he was standing before a fulllength mirror videotaping his reflection through the camera concealed in his wig but why the screen faded to black new footage appeared a small dimly lit rectangular chamber a dramatic chessboard floor of blackandwhite tile a low wooden altar flanked on three sides by pillars atop which burned flickering candles langdon felt a sudden apprehension oh my god filming in the erratic style of an amateur home video the camera now panned up to the periphery of the room to reveal a small group of men observing the initiate the men were dressed in ritual masonic regalia in the darkness langdon could not make out their faces but he had no doubt where this ritual was taking place the traditional layout of this lodge room could have been anywhere in the world but the powderblue triangular pediment above the masters chair revealed it as the oldest masonic lodge in dc potomac lodge no home of george washington and the masonic forefathers who laid the cornerstone for the white house and the capitol building the lodge was still active today peter solomon in addition to overseeing the house of the temple was the master of his local lodge and it was at lodges like this one that a masonic initiates journey always began where he underwent the first three degrees of freemasonry brethren peters familiar voice declared in the name of the great architect of the universe i open this lodge for the practice of masonry in the first degree a gavel rapped loudly langdon watched in utter disbelief as the video progressed through a quick series of dissolves featuring peter solomon performing some of the rituals starker moments pressing a shining dagger to the initiates bare chest threatening impalement should the initiate inappropriately reveal the mysteries of masonry describing the blackandwhite floor as representing the living and the dead outlining punishments that included having ones throat cut across ones tongue torn out by its roots and ones body buried in the rough sands of the sea langdon stared am i really witnessing this masonic initiation rites had remained shrouded in secrecy for centuries the only descriptions that had ever been leaked were written by a handful of estranged brothers langdon had read those accounts of course and yet to see an initiation with his own eyes this was a much different story especially edited this way langdon could already tell that the video was an unfair piece of propaganda omitting all the noblest aspects of the initiation and highlighting only the most disconcerting if this video were released langdon knew it would become an internet sensation over night the antimasonic conspiracy theorists would feed on this like sharks the masonic organization and especially peter solomon would find themselves embroiled in a firestorm of controversy and a desperate effort at damage control even though the ritual was innocuous and purely symbolic eerily the video included a biblical reference to human sacrifice the submission of abraham to the supreme being by proffering isaac his firstborn son langdon thought of peter and willed the helicopter to fly faster the video footage shifted now same room different night a larger group of masons looking on peter solomon was observing from the masters chair this was the second degree more intense now kneeling at the altar vowing to forever conceal the enigmas existing within freemasonry consenting to the penalty of having ones chest cavity ripped open and pulsing heart cast upon the surface of the earth as offal for the ravenous beasts langdons own heart was pulsing wildly now as the video shifted yet again another night a much larger crowd a coffinshaped tracing board on the floor the third degree this was the death ritual the most rigorous of all the degrees the moment in which the initiate was forced to face the final challenge of personal extinction this grueling interrogation was in fact the source of the common phrase to give someone the third degree and although langdon was very familiar with academic accounts of it he was in no way prepared for what he now saw the murder in violent rapid intercuts the video displayed a chilling victims pointofview account of the initiates brutal murder there were simulated blows to his head including one with a masons stone maul all the while a deacon mournfully told the story of the widows sonhiram abiff the master architect of king solomons temple who chose to die rather than reveal the secret wisdom he possessed the attack was mimed of course and yet its effect on camera was bloodcurdling after the deathblow the initiate now dead to his former selfwas lowered into his symbolic coffin where his eyes were shut and his arms were crossed like those of a corpse the masonic brothers rose and mournfully circled his dead body while a pipe organ played a march of the dead the macabre scene was deeply disturbing and it only got worse as the men gathered around their slain brother the hidden camera clearly displayed their faces langdon now realized that solomon was not the only famous man in the room one of the men peering down at the initiate in his coffin was on television almost daily a prominent us senator oh god the scene changed yet again outside now nighttime the same jumpy video footage the man was walking down a city street strands of blond hair blowing in front of the camera turning a corner the camera angle lowering to something in the mans hand a dollar bill a closeup focusing on the great seal the allseeing eye the unfinished pyramid and then abruptly pulling away to reveal a similar shape in the distance a massive pyramidical building with sloping sides rising to a truncated top the house of the temple a souldeep dread swelled within him the video kept moving the man hurrying toward the building now up the multitiered staircase toward the giant bronze doors between the two seventeenton sphinx guardians a neophyte entering the pyramid of initiation darkness now a powerful pipe organ played in the distance and a new image materialized the temple room langdon swallowed hard onscreen the cavernous space was alive with electricity beneath the oculus the black marble altar shone in the moonlight assembled around it seated on handtooled pigskin chairs awaited a somber council of distinguished thirtythirddegree masons present to bear witness the video now panned across their faces with slow and deliberate intention langdon stared in horror although he had not seen this coming what he was looking at made perfect sense a gathering of the most decorated and accomplished masons in the most powerful city on earth would logically include many influential and wellknown individuals sure enough seated around the altar adorned in their long silk gloves masonic aprons and glistening jewels were some of the countrys most powerful men two supreme court justices the secretary of defense the speaker of the house langdon felt ill as the video continued panning across the faces of those in attendance three prominent senators including the majority leader the secretary of homeland security and the director of the cia langdon wanted only to look away but he could not the scene was utterly mesmerizing alarming even to him in an instant he had come to understand the source of satos anxiety and concern now onscreen the shot dissolved into a single shocking image a human skull filled with dark crimson liquid the famed caput mortuum was being offered forth to the initiate by the slender hands of peter solomon whose gold masonic ring glinted in the candlelight the red liquid was wine and yet it shimmered like blood the visual effect was frightful the fifth libation langdon realized having read firsthand accounts of this sacrament in john quincy adamss letters on the masonic institution even so to see it happen to see it calmly witnessed by americas most powerful men this was as arresting an image as any langdon had ever seen the initiate took the skull in his hands his face reflected in the calm surface of the wine may this wine i now drink become a deadly poison to me he declared should i ever knowingly or willfully violate my oath obviously this initiate had intended to violate his oath beyond all imagination langdon could barely get his mind around what would happen if this video were made public no one would understand the government would be thrown into upheaval the airwaves would be filled with the voices of antimasonic groups fundamentalists and conspiracy theorists spewing hatred and fear launching a puritan witch hunt all over again the truth will be twisted langdon knew as it always is with the masons the truth was that the brotherhoods focus on death was in fact a bold celebration of life masonic ritual was designed to awaken the slumbering man inside lifting him from his dark coffin of ignorance raising him into the light and giving him eyes to see only through the death experience could man fully understand his life experience only through the realization that his days on earth were finite could he grasp the importance of living those days with honor integrity and service to his fellow man masonic initiations were startling because they were meant to be transformative masonic vows were unforgiving because they were meant to be reminders that mans honor and his word were all he could take from this world masonic teachings were arcane because they were meant to be universal taught through a common language of symbols and metaphors that transcended religions cultures and races creating a unified worldwide consciousness of brotherly love for a brief instant langdon felt a glimmer of hope he tried to assure himself that if this video were to leak out the public would be openminded and tolerant realizing that all spiritual rituals included aspects that would seem frightening if taken out of context crucifixion reenactments jewish circumcision rites mormon baptisms of the dead catholic exorcisms islamic niqab shamanic trance healing the jewish kaparot ceremony even the eating of the figurative body and blood of christ im dreaming langdon knew this video will create chaos he could imagine what would happen if the prominent leaders of russia or the islamic world were seen in a video pressing knives to bare chests swearing violent oaths performing mock murders lying in symbolic coffins and drinking wine from a human skull the global outcry would be instantaneous and overwhelming god help us onscreen now the initiate was raising the skull to his lips he tipped it backward draining the bloodred wine sealing his oath then he lowered the skull and gazed out at the assembly around him americas most powerful and trusted men gave contented nods of acceptance welcome brother peter solomon said as the image faded to black langdon realized he had stopped breathing without a word sato reached over closed the briefcase and lifted it off his lap langdon turned to her trying to speak but he could find no words it didnt matter understanding was written all over his face sato was right tonight was a nationalsecurity crisis of unimaginable proportions chapter dressed in his loincloth malakh padded back and forth in front of peter solomons wheelchair peter he whispered enjoying every moment of his captives horror you forgot you have a second family your masonic brothers and i will destroy them too unless you help me solomon looked almost catatonic in the glow of the laptop sitting atop his thighs please he finally stammered glancing up if this video gets out if malakh laughed if it gets out he motioned to the small cellular modem plugged into the side of his laptop im connected to the world you wouldnt i will malakh thought enjoying solomons horror you have the power to stop me he said and to save your sister but you have to tell me what i want to know the lost word is hidden somewhere peter and i know this grid reveals exactly where to find it peter glanced at the grid of symbols again his eyes revealing nothing perhaps this will help to inspire you malakh reached over peters shoulders and hit a few keys on the laptop an email program launched on the screen and peter stiffened visibly the screen now displayed an email that malakh had cued earlier tonight a video file addressed to a long list of major media networks malakh smiled i think its time we share dont you dont malakh reached down and clicked the send button on the program peter jerked against his bonds trying unsuccessfully to knock the laptop to the floor relax peter malakh whispered its a massive file it will take a few minutes to go out he pointed to the progress bar sending message complete if you tell me what i want to know ill stop the email and nobody will ever see this peter was ashen as the task bar inched forward sending message complete malakh now lifted the computer from peters lap and set it on one of the nearby pigskin chairs turning the screen so the other man could watch the progress then he returned to peters side and laid the page of symbols in his lap the legends say the masonic pyramid will unveil the lost word this is the pyramids final code i believe you know how to read it malakh glanced over at the laptop sending message complete malakh returned his eyes to peter solomon was staring at him his gray eyes blazing now with hatred hate me malakh thought the greater the emotion the more potent the energy that will be released when the ritual is completed at langley nola kaye pressed the phone to her ear barely able to hear sato over the noise of the helicopter they said its impossible to stop the file transfer nola shouted to shut down local isps would take at least an hour and if hes got access to a wireless provider killing the groundbased internet wont stop him from sending it anyway nowadays stopping the flow of digital information had become nearly impossible there were too many access routes to the internet between hard lines wifi hot spots cellular modems sat phones superphones and emailequipped pdas the only way to isolate a potential data leak was by destroying the source machine i pulled the spec sheet on the uh youre flying nola said and it looks like youre equipped with emp electromagneticpulse or emp guns were now commonplace among law enforcement agencies which used them primarily to stop car chases from a safe distance by firing a highly concentrated pulse of electromagnetic radiation an emp gun could effectively fry the electronics of any device it targeted cars cell phones computers according to nolas spec sheet the uh had a chassismounted lasersighted sixgigahertz magnetron with a fiftydbgain horn that yielded a tengigawatt pulse discharged directly at a laptop the pulse would fry the computers motherboard and instantly erase the hard drive emp will be useless sato yelled back target is inside a stone building no sight lines and thick em shielding do you have any indication yet if the video has gone out nola glanced at a second monitor which was running a continuous search for breaking news stories about the masons not yet maam but if it goes public well know within seconds keep me posted sato signed off langdon held his breath as the helicopter dropped from the sky toward dupont circle a handful of pedestrians scattered as the aircraft descended through an opening in the trees and landed hard on the lawn just south of the famous twotiered fountain designed by the same two men who created the lincoln memorial thirty seconds later langdon was riding shotgun in a commandeered lexus suv tearing up new hampshire avenue toward the house of the temple peter solomon was desperately trying to figure out what to do all he could see in his mind were the images of katherine bleeding in the basement and of the video he had just witnessed he turned his head slowly toward the laptop on the pigskin chair several yards away the progress bar was almost a third of the way filled sending message complete the tattooed man was now walking slow circles around the square altar swinging a lit censer and chanting to himself thick puffs of white smoke swirled up toward the skylight the mans eyes were wide now and he seemed to be in a demonic trance peter turned his gaze to the ancient knife that sat waiting on the white silk cloth spread across the altar peter solomon had no doubt that he would die in this temple tonight the question was how to die would he find a way to save his sister and his brotherhood or would his death be entirely in vain he glanced down at the grid of symbols when he had first laid eyes on the grid the shock of the moment had blinded him preventing his vision from piercing the veil of chaos to glimpse the startling truth now however the real significance of these symbols had become crystal clear to him he had seen the grid in an entirely new light peter solomon knew exactly what he needed to do taking a deep breath he gazed up at the moon through the oculus above then he began to speak all great truths are simple malakh had learned that long ago the solution that peter solomon was now explaining was so graceful and pure that malakh was sure that it could only be true incredibly the solution to the pyramids final code was far simpler than he had ever imagined the lost word was right before my eyes in an instant a bright ray of light pierced the murkiness of the history and myth surrounding the lost word as promised the lost word was indeed written in an ancient language and bore mystical power in every philosophy religion and science ever known to man alchemy astrology kabbalah christianity buddhism rosicrucianism freemasonry astronomy physics noetics standing now in this initiation chamber atop the great pyramid of heredom malakh gazed upon the treasure he had sought all these years and he knew he could not have prepared himself more perfectly soon i am complete the lost word is found in kalorama heights a lone cia agent stood amid a sea of garbage that he had dumped out of the trash bins that had been found in the garage ms kaye he said speaking to satos analyst on the phone good thinking to search his garbage i think i just found something inside the house katherine solomon was feeling stronger with every passing moment the infusion of lactated ringers solution had successfully raised her blood pressure and quelled her throbbing headache she was resting now seated in the dining room with explicit instructions to remain still her nerves felt frayed and she was increasingly anxious for news about her brother where is everybody the cias forensics team had not yet arrived and the agent who had stayed behind was still off searching the premises bellamy had been sitting with her in the dining room still wrapped in a foil blanket but he too had wandered off to look for any information that might help the cia save peter unable to sit idly katherine pulled herself to her feet teetered and then inched slowly toward the living room she found bellamy in the study the architect was standing at an open drawer his back to her apparently too engrossed in its contents to hear her enter she walked up behind him warren the old man lurched and turned quickly shutting the drawer with his hip his face was lined with shock and grief his cheeks streaked with tears whats wrong she glanced down at the drawer what is it bellamy seemed unable to speak he had the look of a man who had just seen something he deeply wished he had not whats in the drawer she demanded bellamys tearfilled eyes held hers for a long sorrowful moment finally he spoke you and i wondered why why this man seemed to hate your family katherines brow furrowed yes well bellamys voice caught i just found the answer chapter in the chamber at the top of the house of the temple the one who called himself malakh stood before the great altar and gently massaged the virgin skin atop his head verbum significatium he chanted in preparation verbum omnificum the final ingredient had been found at last the most precious treasures are often the simplest above the altar wisps of fragrant smoke now swirled billowing up from the censer the suffumigations ascended through the shaft of moonlight clearing a channel skyward through which a liberated soul could travel freely the time had come malakh retrieved the vial of peters darkened blood and uncorked it with his captive looking on he dipped the nib of the crows feather into the crimson tincture and raised it to the sacred circle of flesh atop his head he paused a moment thinking of how long he had waited for this night his great transformation was finally at hand when the lost word is written on the mind of man he is then ready to receive unimaginable power such was the ancient promise of apotheosis so far mankind had been unable to realize that promise and malakh had done what he could to keep it that way with a steady hand malakh touched the nib of the feather to his skin he needed no mirror no assistance only his sense of touch and his minds eye slowly meticulously he began inscribing the lost word inside the circular ouroboros on his scalp peter solomon looked on with an expression of horror when malakh finished he closed his eyes set down the feather and let the air out of his lungs entirely for the first time in his life he felt a sensation he had never known i am complete i am at one malakh had worked for years on the artifact that was his body and now as he neared his moment of final transformation he could feel every line that had ever been inscribed on his flesh i am a true masterpiece perfect and complete i gave you what you asked for peters voice intruded send help to katherine and stop that file malakh opened his eyes and smiled you and i are not quite finished he turned to the altar and picked up the sacrificial knife running his finger across the sleek iron blade this ancient knife was commissioned by god he said for use in a human sacrifice you recognized it earlier no solomons gray eyes were like stone it is unique and ive heard the legend legend the account appears in holy scripture you dont believe its true peter just stared malakh had spent a fortune locating and obtaining this artifact known as the akedah knife it had been crafted over three thousand years ago from an iron meteorite that had fallen to earth iron from heaven as the early mystics called it it was believed to be the exact knife used by abraham at the akedah the near sacrifice of his son isaac on mount moriah as depicted in genesis the knifes astounding history included possession by popes nazi mystics european alchemists and private collectors they protected and admired it malakh thought but none dared unleash its true power by using it for its real purpose tonight the akedah knife would fulfill its destiny the akedah had always been sacred in masonic ritual in the very first degree masons celebrated the most august gift ever offered to god the submission of abraham to the volitions of the supreme being by proffering isaac his firstborn the weight of the blade felt exhilarating in malakhs hand as he crouched down and used the freshly sharpened knife to sever the ropes binding peter to his wheelchair the bonds fell to the floor peter solomon winced in pain as he attempted to shift his cramped limbs why are you doing this to me what do you think this will accomplish you of all people should understand malakh replied you study the ancient ways you know that the power of the mysteries relies on sacrifice on releasing a human soul from its body it has been this way since the beginning you know nothing of sacrifice peter said his voice seething with pain and loathing excellent malakh thought feed your hatred it will only make this easier malakhs empty stomach growled as he paced before his captive there is enormous power in the shedding of human blood everyone understood that from the early egyptians to the celtic druids to the chinese to the aztecs there is magic in human sacrifice but modern man has become weak too fearful to make true offerings too frail to give the life that is required for spiritual transformation the ancient texts are clear though only by offering what is most sacred can man access the ultimate power you consider me a sacred offering malakh now laughed out loud you really dont understand yet do you peter gave him an odd look do you know why i have a deprivation tank in my home malakh placed his hands on his hips and flexed his elaborately decorated body which was still covered only by a loincloth i have been practicing preparing anticipating the moment when i am only mind when i am released from this mortal shell when i have offered up this beautiful body to the gods in sacrifice i am the precious one i am the pure white lamb peters mouth fell open but no words came out yes peter a man must offer to the gods that which he holds most dear his purest white dove his most precious and worthy offering you are not precious to me you are not a worthy offering malakh glared at him dont you see you are not the sacrifice peter i am mine is the flesh that is the offering i am the gift look at me i have prepared made myself worthy for my final journey i am the gift peter remained speechless the secret is how to die malakh now said masons understand that he pointed to the altar you revere the ancient truths and yet you are cowards you understand the power of sacrifice and yet you keep a safe distance from death performing your mock murders and bloodless death rituals tonight your symbolic altar will bear witness to its true power and its actual purpose malakh reached down and grasped peter solomons left hand pressing the handle of the akedah knife into his palm the left hand serves the darkness this too had been planned peter would have no choice in the matter malakh could fathom no sacrifice more potent and symbolic than one performed on this altar by this man with this knife plunged into the heart of an offering whose mortal flesh was wrapped like a gift in a shroud of mystical symbols with this offering of self malakh would establish his rank in the hierarchy of demons darkness and blood were where the true power lay the ancients knew this the adepts choosing sides consistent with their individual natures malakh had chosen sides wisely chaos was the natural law of the universe indifference was the engine of entropy mans apathy was the fertile ground in which the dark spirits tended their seeds i have served them and they will receive me as a god peter did not move he simply stared down at the ancient knife gripped in his hand i will you malakh taunted i am a willing sacrifice your final role has been written you will transform me you will liberate me from my body you will do this or you will lose your sister and your brotherhood you will truly be all alone he paused smiling down at his captive consider this your final punishment peters eyes rose slowly to meet malakhs killing you a punishment do you think i will hesitate you murdered my son my mother my entire family no malakh exploded with a force that startled even himself you are wrong i did not murder your family you did it was you who made the choice to leave zachary in prison and from there the wheels were in motion you killed your family peter not me peters knuckles turned white his fingers clenching the knife in rage you know nothing of why i left zachary in prison i know everything malakh fired back i was there you claimed you were trying to help him were you trying to help him when you offered him the choice between wealth or wisdom were you trying to help him when you gave him the ultimatum to join the masons what kind of father gives a child the choice between wealth or wisdom and expects him to know how to handle it what kind of father leaves his own son in a prison instead of flying him home to safety malakh now moved in front of peter and crouched down placing his tattooed face only inches from his face but most important what kind of father can look his own son in the eyes even after all these years and not even recognize him malakhs words echoed for several seconds in the stone chamber then silence in the abrupt stillness peter solomon seemed to have been jolted from his trance his face clouded now with a visage of total incredulity yes father its me malakh had waited years for this moment to take revenge on the man who had abandoned him to stare into those gray eyes and speak the truth that had been buried all these years now the moment was here and he spoke slowly longing to watch the full weight of his words gradually crush peter solomons soul you should be happy father your prodigal son has returned peters face was now as pale as death malakh savored every moment my own father made the decision to leave me in prison and in that instant i vowed that he had rejected me for the last time i was no longer his son zachary solomon ceased to exist two glistening teardrops welled suddenly in his fathers eyes and malakh thought they were the most beautiful thing he had ever seen peter choked back tears staring up at malakhs face as if seeing him for the very first time all the warden wanted was money malakh said but you refused it never occurred to you though that my money was just as green as yours the warden did not care who paid him only that he was paid when i offered to pay him handsomely he selected a sickly inmate about my size dressed him in my clothes and beat him beyond all recognition the photos you saw and the sealed casket you buried they were not mine they belonged to a stranger peters tearstreaked face contorted now with anguish and disbelief oh my god zachary not anymore when zachary walked out of prison he was transformed his adolescent physique and childlike face had drastically mutated when he flooded his young body with experimental growth hormones and steroids even his vocal cords had been ravaged transforming his boyish voice into a permanent whisper zachary became andros andros became malakh and tonight malakh will become his greatest incarnation of all at that moment in kalorama heights katherine solomon stood over the open desk drawer and gazed down at what could be described only as a fetishists collection of old newspaper articles and photographs i dont understand she said turning to bellamy this lunatic was obviously obsessed with my family but keep going urged bellamy taking a seat and still looking deeply shaken katherine dug deeper into the newspaper articles every one of which related to the solomon family peters many successes katherines research their mother isabels terrible murder zachary solomons widely publicized drug use incarceration and brutal murder in a turkish prison the fixation this man had on the solomon family was beyond fanatical and yet katherine saw nothing yet to suggest why it was then that she saw the photographs the first showed zachary standing kneedeep in azure water on a beach dotted with whitewashed houses greece the photo she assumed could have been taken only during zachs freewheeling drug days in europe strangely though zach looked healthier than he did in the paparazzi shots of an emaciated kid partying with the drug crowd he looked more fit stronger somehow more mature katherine never recalled him looking so healthy puzzled she checked the date stamp on the photo but thats impossible the date was almost a full year after zachary had died in prison suddenly katherine was flipping desperately through the stack all of the photos were of zachary solomon gradually getting older the collection appeared to be some kind of pictorial autobiography chronicling a slow transformation as the pictures progressed katherine saw a sudden and dramatic change she looked on in horror as zacharys body began mutating his muscles bulging and his facial features morphing from the obvious heavy use of steroids his frame seemed to double in mass and a haunting fierceness crept into his eyes i dont even recognize this man he looked nothing like katherines memories of her young nephew when she reached a picture of him with a shaved head she felt her knees begin to buckle then she saw a photo of his bare body adorned with the first traces of tattoos her heart almost stopped oh my god chapter right turn langdon shouted from the backseat of the commandeered lexus suv simkins swerved onto s street and gunned the vehicle through a treelined residential neighborhood as they neared the corner of sixteenth street the house of the temple rose like a mountain on the right simkins stared up at the massive structure it looked like someone had built a pyramid on top of romes pantheon he prepared to turn right on sixteenth toward the front of the building dont turn langdon ordered go straight stay on s simkins obeyed driving alongside the east side of the building at fifteenth langdon said turn right simkins followed his navigator and moments later langdon had pointed out a nearly invisible unpaved access road that bisected the gardens behind the house of the temple simkins turned in to the drive and gunned the lexus toward the rear of the building look langdon said pointing to the lone vehicle parked near the rear entrance it was a large van theyre here simkins parked the suv and killed the engine quietly everyone got out and prepared to move in simkins stared up at the monolithic structure you say the temple room is at the top langdon nodded pointing all the way to the pinnacle of the building that flat area on top of the pyramid is actually a skylight simkins spun back to langdon the temple room has a skylight langdon gave him an odd look of course an oculus to heaven directly above the altar the uh sat idling at dupont circle in the passenger seat sato gnawed at her fingernails awaiting news from her team finally simkinss voice crackled over the radio director sato here she barked were entering the building but i have some additional recon for you go ahead mr langdon just informed me that the room in which the target is most likely located has a very large skylight sato considered the information for several seconds understood thank you simkins signed off sato spit out a fingernail and turned to the pilot take her up chapter like any parent who had lost a child peter solomon had often imagined how old his boy would be now what he would look like and what he would have become peter solomon now had his answers the massive tattooed creature before him had begun life as a tiny precious infant baby zach curled up in a wicker bassinette taking his first fumbling steps across peters study learning to speak his first words the fact that evil could spring from an innocent child in a loving family remained one of the paradoxes of the human soul peter had been forced to accept early on that although his own blood flowed in his sons veins the heart pumping that blood was his sons own unique and singular as if randomly chosen from the universe my son he killed my mother my friend robert langdon and possibly my sister an icy numbness flooded peters heart as he searched his sons eyes for any connection anything familiar the mans eyes however although gray like peters were those of a total stranger filled with a hatred and a vengefulness that were almost otherworldly are you strong enough his son taunted glancing at the akedah knife gripped in peters hand can you finish what you started all those years ago son solomon barely recognized his own voice i i loved you twice you tried to kill me you abandoned me in prison you shot me on zachs bridge now finish it for an instant solomon felt like he was floating outside his own body he no longer recognized himself he was missing a hand was totally bald dressed in a black robe sitting in a wheelchair and clutching an ancient knife finish it the man shouted again the tattoos on his naked chest rippling killing me is the only way you can save katherine the only way to save your brotherhood solomon felt his gaze move to the laptop and cellular modem on the pigskin chair sending message complete his mind could not shake the images of katherine bleeding to death or of his masonic brothers there is still time the man whispered you know its the only choice release me from my mortal shell please solomon said dont do this you did this the man hissed you forced your child to make an impossible choice do you remember that night wealth or wisdom that was the night you pushed me away forever but ive returned father and tonight it is your turn to choose zachary or katherine which will it be will you kill your son to save your sister will you kill your son to save your brotherhood your country or will you wait until its too late until katherine is dead until the video is public until you must live the rest of your life knowing you could have stopped these tragedies time is running out you know what must be done peters heart ached you are not zachary he told himself zachary died long long ago whatever you are and wherever you came from you are not of me and although peter solomon did not believe his own words he knew he had to make a choice he was out of time find the grand staircase robert langdon dashed through darkened hallways winding his way toward the center of the building turner simkins remained close on his heels as langdon had hoped he burst out into the buildings main atrium dominated by eight doric columns of green granite the atrium looked like a hybrid sepulcher grecoromanegyptian with black marble statues chandelier fire bowls teutonic crosses doubleheaded phoenix medallions and sconces bearing the head of hermes langdon turned and ran toward the sweeping marble staircase at the far end of the atrium this leads directly to the temple room he whispered as the two men ascended as quickly and quietly as possible on the first landing langdon came facetoface with a bronze bust of masonic luminary albert pike along with the engraving of his most famous quote what we have done for ourselves alone dies with us what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal malakh had sensed a palpable shift in the atmosphere of the temple room as if all the frustration and pain peter solomon had ever felt was now boiling to the surface focusing itself like a laser on malakh yes it is time peter solomon had risen from his wheelchair and was standing now facing the altar gripping the knife save katherine malakh coaxed luring him toward the altar backing up and finally laying his own body down on the white shroud he had prepared do what you need to do as if moving through a nightmare peter inched forward malakh reclined fully now onto his back gazing up through the oculus at the wintry moon the secret is how to die this moment could not be any more perfect adorned with the lost word of the ages i offer myself by the left hand of my father malakh drew a deep breath receive me demons for this is my body which is offered for you standing over malakh peter solomon was trembling his tearsoaked eyes shone with desperation indecision anguish he looked one last time toward the modem and laptop across the room make the choice malakh whispered release me from my flesh god wants this you want this he laid his arms at his side and arched his chest forward offering up his magnificent doubleheaded phoenix help me shed the body that clothes my soul peters tearful eyes seemed to be staring through malakh now not even seeing him i killed your mother malakh whispered i killed robert langdon im murdering your sister im destroying your brotherhood do what you have to do peter solomons visage now contorted into a mask of absolute grief and regret he threw his head back and screamed in anguish as he raised the knife robert langdon and agent simkins arrived breathless outside the temple room doors as a bloodcurdling scream erupted from within it was peters voice langdon was certain peters cry was one of absolute agony im too late ignoring simkins langdon seized the handles and yanked open the doors the horrific scene before him confirmed his worst fears there in the center of the dimly lit chamber the silhouette of a man with a shaved head stood at the great altar he wore a black robe and his hand was clutching a large blade before langdon could move the man was driving the knife down toward the body that lay outstretched on the altar malakh had closed his eyes so beautiful so perfect the ancient blade of the akedah knife had glinted in the moonlight as it arched over him scented wisps of smoke had spiraled upward above him preparing a pathway for his soontobeliberated soul his killers lone scream of torment and desperation still rang through the sacred space as the knife came down i am besmeared with the blood of human sacrifice and parents tears malakh braced for the glorious impact his moment of transformation had arrived incredibly he felt no pain a thunderous vibration filled his body deafening and deep the room began shaking and a brilliant white light blinded him from above the heavens roared and malakh knew it had happened exactly as he had planned langdon did not remember sprinting toward the altar as the helicopter appeared overhead nor did he remember leaping with his arms outstretched soaring toward the man in the black robe trying desperately to tackle him before he could plunge the knife down a second time their bodies collided and langdon saw a bright light sweep down through the oculus and illuminate the altar he expected to see the bloody body of peter solomon on the altar but the naked chest that shone in the light had no blood on it at all only a tapestry of tattoos the knife lay broken beside him apparently having been driven into the stone altar rather than into flesh as he and the man in the black robe crashed together onto the hard stone floor langdon saw the bandaged nub on the end of the mans right arm and he realized to his bewilderment that he had just tackled peter solomon as they slid together across the stone floor the helicopters searchlights blazed down from above the chopper thundered in low its skids practically touching the expansive wall of glass on the front of the helicopter a strangelooking gun rotated aiming downward through the glass the red beam of its laser scope sliced through the skylight and danced across the floor directly toward langdon and solomon no but there was no gunfire from above only the sound of the helicopter blades langdon felt nothing but an eerie ripple of energy that shimmered through his cells behind his head on the pigskin chair the laptop hissed strangely he spun in time to see its screen suddenly flash to black unfortunately the last visible message had been clear sending message complete pull up damn it up the uh pilot threw his rotors into overdrive trying to keep his skids from touching any part of the large glass skylight he knew the six thousand pounds of lift force that surged downward from his rotors was already straining the glass to its breaking point unfortunately the incline of the pyramid beneath the helicopter was efficiently shedding the thrust sideways robbing him of lift up now he tipped the nose trying to skim away but the left strut hit the center of the glass it was only for an instant but that was all it took the temple rooms massive oculus exploded in a swirl of glass and wind sending a torrent of jagged shards plummeting into the room below stars falling from heaven malakh stared up into the beautiful white light and saw a veil of shimmering jewels fluttering toward him accelerating as if racing to shroud him in their splendor suddenly there was pain everywhere stabbing searing slashing razorsharp knives piercing soft flesh chest neck thighs face his body tightened all at once recoiling his bloodfilled mouth cried out as the pain ripped him from his trance the white light above transformed itself and suddenly as if by magic a dark helicopter was suspended above him its thundering blades driving an icy wind down into the temple room chilling malakh to the core and dispersing the wisps of incense to the distant corners of the room malakh turned his head and saw the akedah knife lying broken by his side smashed upon the granite altar which was covered in a blanket of shattered glass even after everything i did to him peter solomon averted the knife he refused to spill my blood with welling horror malakh raised his head and peered down along the length of his own body this living artifact was to have been his great offering but it lay in tatters his body was drenched in blood huge shards of glass protruding from his flesh in all directions weakly malakh lowered his head back to the granite altar and stared up through the open space in the roof the helicopter was gone now in its place a silent wintry moon wideeyed malakh lay gasping for breath all alone on the great altar chapter the secretis how to die malakh knew it had all gone wrong there was no brilliant light no wondrous reception only darkness and excruciating pain even in his eyes he could see nothing and yet he sensed movement all around him there were voices human voices one of them strangely belonging to robert langdon how can this be shes okay langdon kept repeating katherine is fine peter your sister is okay no malakh thought katherine is dead she must be malakh could no longer see could not tell if his eyes were even open but he heard the helicopter banking away an abrupt calm settled through the temple room malakh could feel the smooth rhythms of the earth becoming uneven as if the oceans natural tides were being disrupted by a gathering storm chao ab ordo unfamiliar voices were shouting now talking urgently with langdon about the laptop and video file its too late malakh knew the damage is done by now the video was spreading like wildfire into every corner of a shocked world destroying the future of the brotherhood those most capable of spreading the wisdom must be destroyed the ignorance of mankind is what helped the chaos grow the absence of light on earth is what nourished the darkness that awaited malakh i have done great deeds and soon i will be received as a king malakh sensed that a lone individual had quietly approached he knew who it was he could smell the sacred oils he had rubbed into his fathers shaved body i dont know if you can hear me peter solomon whispered in his ear but i want you to know something he touched a finger to the sacred spot atop malakhs skull what you wrote here he paused this is not the lost word of course it is malakh thought you convinced me of that beyond a doubt according to legend the lost word was written in a language so ancient and arcane that mankind had all but forgotten how to read it this mysterious language peter had revealed was in fact the oldest language on earth the language of symbols in the idiom of symbology there was one symbol that reigned supreme above all others the oldest and most universal this symbol fused all the ancient traditions in a single solitary image that represented the illumination of the egyptian sun god the triumph of alchemical gold the wisdom of the philosophers stone the purity of the rosicrucian rose the moment of creation the all the dominance of the astrological sun and even the omniscient allseeing eye that hovered atop the unfinished pyramid the circumpunct the symbol of the source the origin of all things this is what peter had told him moments ago malakh had been skeptical at first but then he had looked again at the grid realizing that the image of the pyramid was pointing directly at the lone symbol of the circumpunct a circle with a dot in its center the masonic pyramid is a map he thought recalling the legend which points to the lost word it seemed his father was telling the truth after all all great truths are simple the lost word is not a word it is a symbol eagerly malakh had inscribed the great symbol of the circumpunct on his scalp as he did so he felt an upwelling of power and satisfaction my masterpiece and offering are complete the forces of darkness were waiting for him now he would be rewarded for his work this was to be his moment of glory and yet at the last instant everything had gone horribly wrong peter was still behind him now speaking words that malakh could barely fathom i lied to you he was saying you left me no choice if i had revealed to you the true lost word you would not have believed me nor would you have understood the lost word is not the circumpunct the truth is said peter the lost word is known to all but recognized by very few the words echoed in malakhs mind you remain incomplete peter said gently placing his palm on top of malakhs head your work is not yet done but wherever you are going please know this you were loved for some reason the gentle touch of his fathers hand felt like it was burning through him like a potent catalyst that was initiating a chemical reaction inside malakhs body without warning he felt a rush of blistering energy surging through his physical shell as if every cell in his body were now dissolving in an instant all of his worldly pain evaporated transformation its happening i am gazing down upon myself a wreck of bloody flesh on the sacred slab of granite my father is kneeling behind me holding my lifeless head with his one remaining hand i feel an upwelling of rage and confusion this is not a moment for compassion it is for revenge for transformation and yet still my father refuses to submit refuses to fulfill his role refuses to channel his pain and anger through the knife blade and into my heart i am trapped here hovering tethered to my earthly shell my father gently runs a soft palm across my face to close my fading eyes i feel the tether release a billowing veil materializes around me thickening and dimming the light hiding the world from view suddenly time accelerates and i am plunging into an abyss far darker than any i have ever imagined here in the barren void i hear a whispering i sense a gathering force it strengthens mounting at a startling rate surrounding me ominous and powerful dark and commanding i am not alone here this is my triumph my grand reception and yet for some reason i am filled not with joy but rather with boundless fear it is nothing like i expect the force is churning now swirling around me with commanding strength threatening to tear me apart suddenly without warning the blackness gathers itself like a great prehistoric beast and rears up before me i am facing all the dark souls who have gone before i am screaming in infinite terror as the darkness swallows me whole chapter inside the national cathedral dean galloway sensed a strange change in the air he was not sure why but he felt as if a ghostly shadow had evaporated as if a weight had been lifted far away and yet right here alone at his desk he was deep in thought he was not sure how many minutes had passed when his phone rang it was warren bellamy peters alive his masonic brother said i just heard the news i knew youd want to know immediately hes going to be okay thank god galloway exhaled where is he galloway listened as bellamy recounted the extraordinary tale of what had transpired after they had left cathedral college but all of you are okay recuperating yes bellamy said there is one thing though he paused yes the masonic pyramid i think langdon may have solved it galloway had to smile somehow he was not surprised and tell me did langdon discover whether or not the pyramid kept its promise whether or not it revealed what legend always claimed it would reveal i dont know yet it will galloway thought you need to rest as do you no i need to pray chapter when the elevator door opened the lights in the temple room were all ablaze katherine solomons legs still felt rubbery as she hurried in to find her brother the air in this enormous chamber was cold and smelled of incense the scene that greeted her stopped her in her tracks in the center of this magnificent room on a low stone altar lay a bloody tattooed corpse a body perforated by spears of broken glass high above a gaping hole in the ceiling opened to the heavens my god katherine immediately looked away her eyes scanning for peter she found her brother sitting on the other side of the room being tended to by a medic while talking with langdon and director sato peter katherine called running over peter her brother glanced up his expression filling with relief he was on his feet at once moving toward her he was wearing a simple white shirt and dark slacks which someone had probably gotten for him from his office downstairs his right arm was in a sling and their gentle embrace was awkward but katherine barely noticed a familiar comfort surrounded her like a cocoon as it always had even in childhood when her protective older brother embraced her they held each other in silence finally katherine whispered are you okay i mean really she released him looking down at the sling and bandage where his right hand used to be tears welled again in her eyes im so so sorry peter shrugged as if it were nothing of consequence mortal flesh bodies dont last forever the important thing is that youre okay peters lighthearted response tore at her emotions reminding her of all the reasons she loved him she stroked his head feeling the unbreakable bonds of family the shared blood that flowed in their veins tragically she knew there was a third solomon in the room tonight the corpse on the altar drew her gaze and katherine shuddered deeply trying to block out the photos she had seen she looked away her eyes now finding robert langdons there was compassion there deep and perceptive as if langdon somehow knew exactly what she was thinking peter knows raw emotion gripped katherine relief sympathy despair she felt her brothers body begin trembling like a childs it was something she had never witnessed in her entire life just let it go she whispered its okay just let it go peters trembling grew deeper she held him again stroking the back of his head peter youve always been the strong one youve always been there for me but im here for you now its okay im right here katherine eased his head gently onto her shoulder and the great peter solomon collapsed sobbing in her arms director sato stepped away to take an incoming call it was nola kaye her news for a change was good still no signs of distribution maam she sounded hopeful im confident we would have seen something by now it looks like you contained it thanks to you nola sato thought glancing down at the laptop which langdon had seen complete its transmission a very close call at nolas suggestion the agent searching the mansion had checked the garbage cans discovering packaging for a newly purchased cellular modem with the exact model number nola had been able to crossreference compatible carriers bandwidths and service grids isolating the laptops most likely access node a small transmitter on the corner of sixteenth and corcoran three blocks from the temple nola quickly relayed the information to sato in the helicopter on approach toward the house of the temple the pilot had performed a lowaltitude flyover and pulsed the relay node with a blast of electromagnetic radiation knocking it offline only seconds before the laptop completed its transfer great work tonight sato said now get some sleep youve earned it thank you maam nola hesitated was there something else nola was silent a long moment apparently considering whether or not to speak nothing that cant wait till morning maam have a good night chapter in the silence of an elegant bathroom on the ground floor of the house of the temple robert langdon ran warm water into a tile sink and eyed himself in the mirror even in the muted light he looked like he felt utterly spent his daybag was on his shoulder again much lighter now empty except for his personal items and some crumpled lecture notes he had to chuckle his visit to dc tonight to give a lecture had turned out a bit more grueling than hed anticipated even so langdon had a lot to be grateful for peter is alive and the video was contained as langdon scooped handfuls of warm water onto his face he gradually felt himself coming back to life everything was still a blur but the adrenaline in his body was finally dissipating and he was feeling like himself again after drying his hands he checked his mickey mouse watch my god its late langdon exited the bathroom and wound his way along the curved wall of the hall of honor a gracefully arched passageway lined with portraits of accomplished masons us presidents philanthropists luminaries and other influential americans he paused at an oil painting of harry s truman and tried to imagine the man undergoing the rites rituals and studies required to become a mason there is a hidden world behind the one we all see for all of us you slipped away a voice said down the hall langdon turned it was katherine shed been through hell tonight and yet she looked suddenly radiant rejuvenated somehow langdon gave a tired smile hows he doing katherine walked up and embraced him warmly how can i ever thank you he laughed you know i didnt do anything right katherine held him for a long time peters going to be fine she let go and looked deep into langdons eyes and he just told me something incredible something wonderful her voice trembled with anticipation i need to go see it for myself ill be back in a bit what where are you going i wont be long right now peter wants to speak with you alone hes waiting in the library did he say why katherine chuckled and shook her head you know peter and his secrets but ill see you in a bit then she was gone langdon sighed heavily he felt like hed had enough secrets for one night there were unanswered questions of course the masonic pyramid and the lost word among them but he sensed that the answers if they even existed were not for him not as a nonmason mustering the last of his energy langdon made his way to the masonic library when he arrived peter was sitting all alone at a table with the stone pyramid before him robert peter smiled and waved him in id like a word langdon managed a grin yes i hear you lost one chapter the library in the house of the temple was dcs oldest public reading room its elegant stacks burgeoned with over a quarter of a million volumes including a rare copy of the ahiman rezon the secrets of a prepared brother in addition the library displayed precious masonic jewels ritual artifacts and even a rare volume that had been handprinted by benjamin franklin langdons favorite library treasure however was one few ever noticed the illusion solomon had shown him long ago that from the proper vantage point the librarys reading desk and golden table lamp created an unmistakable optical illusion that of a pyramid and shining golden capstone solomon said he always considered the illusion a silent reminder that the mysteries of freemasonry were perfectly visible to anyone and everyone if they were seen from the proper perspective tonight however the mysteries of freemasonry had materialized front and center langdon now sat opposite the worshipful master peter solomon and the masonic pyramid peter was smiling the word you refer to robert is not a legend it is a reality langdon stared across the table and finally spoke but i dont understand how is that possible what is so difficult to accept all of it langdon wanted to say searching his old friends eyes for any hint of common sense youre saying you believe the lost word is real and that it has actual power enormous power peter said it has the power to transform human kind by unlocking the ancient mysteries a word langdon challenged peter i cant possibly believe a word you will believe peter stated calmly langdon stared in silence as you know solomon continued standing now and pacing around the table it has long been prophesied that there will come a day when the lost word will be rediscovered a day when it will be unearthed and mankind will once again have access to its forgotten power langdon flashed on peters lecture about the apocalypse although many people erroneously interpreted apocalypse as a cataclysmic end of the world the word literally signified an unveiling predicted by the ancients to be that of great wisdom the coming age of enlightenment even so langdon could not imagine such a vast change being ushered in by a word peter motioned to the stone pyramid which sat on the table beside its golden capstone the masonic pyramid he said the legendary symbolon tonight it stands unified and complete reverently he lifted the golden capstone and set it atop the pyramid the heavy gold piece clicked softly into place tonight my friend you have done what has never been done before you have assembled the masonic pyramid deciphered all of its codes and in the end unveiled this solomon produced a sheet of paper and laid it on the table langdon recognized the grid of symbols that had been reorganized using the order eight franklin square he had studied it briefly in the temple room peter said i am curious to know if you can read this array of symbols after all you are the specialist langdon eyed the grid heredom circumpunct pyramid staircase langdon sighed well peter as you can probably see this is an allegorical pictogram clearly its language is metaphorical and symbolic rather than literal solomon chuckled ask a symbologist a simple question okay tell me what you see peter really wants to hear this langdon pulled the page toward him well i looked at it earlier and in simple terms i see that this grid is a picture depicting heaven and earth peter arched his eyebrows looking surprised oh sure at the top of the image we have the word heredom the holy housewhich i interpret as the house of god or heaven okay the downwardfacing arrow after heredom signifies that the rest of the pictogram clearly lies in the realm beneath heaven that being earth langdons eyes glided now to the bottom of the grid the lowest two rows those beneath the pyramid represent the earth itself terra firma the lowest of all the realms fittingly these lower realms contain the twelve ancient astrological signs which represent the primordial religion of those first human souls who looked to the heavens and saw the hand of god in the movement of the stars and planets solomon slid his chair closer and studied the grid okay what else on a foundation of astrology langdon continued the great pyramid rises from the earth stretching toward heaven the enduring symbol of lost wisdom it is filled with historys great philosophies and religions egyptian pythagorean buddhist hindu islamic judeochristian and on and on all flowing upward merging together funneling themselves up through the transformative gateway of the pyramid where they finally fuse into a single unified human philosophy he paused a single universal consciousness a shared global vision of god represented by the ancient symbol that hovers over the capstone the circumpunct peter said a universal symbol for god right throughout history the circumpunct has been all things to all people it is the sun god ra alchemical gold the allseeing eye the singularity point before the big bang the the great architect of the universe langdon nodded sensing this was probably the same argument peter had used in the temple room to sell the idea of the circumpunct as the lost word and finally peter asked what about the staircase langdon glanced down at the image of the stairs beneath the pyramid peter im sure you know as well as anyone this symbolizes the winding staircase of freemasonry leading upward out of the earthly darkness into the light like jacobs ladder climbing to heaven or the tiered human spine that connects mans mortal body to his eternal mind he paused as for the rest of the symbols they appear to be a blend of celestial masonic and scientific all lending support to the ancient mysteries solomon stroked his chin an elegant interpretation professor i agree of course that this grid can be read as allegory and yet his eyes flashed with deepening mystery this collection of symbols tells another story as well a story that is far more revealing oh solomon began pacing again circling the table earlier tonight inside the temple room when i believed i was going to die i looked at this grid and somehow i saw past the metaphor past the allegory into the very heart of what these symbols are telling us he paused turning abruptly to langdon this grid reveals the exact location where the lost word is buried come again langdon shifted uneasily in his chair suddenly fearing that the trauma of the evening had left peter disorientated and confused robert legend has always described the masonic pyramid as a map a very specific map a map that could guide the worthy to the secret location of the lost word solomon tapped the grid of symbols in front of langdon i guarantee you these symbols are exactly what legend says they are a map a specific diagram that reveals exactly where we will find the staircase that leads down to the lost word langdon gave an uneasy laugh treading carefully now even if i believed the legend of the masonic pyramid this grid of symbols cant possibly be a map look at it it looks nothing like a map solomon smiled sometimes all it takes is a tiny shift of perspective to see something familiar in a totally new light langdon looked again but saw nothing new let me ask you a question peter said when masons lay cornerstones do you know why we lay them in the northeast corner of a building sure because the northeast corner receives the first rays of morning light it is symbolic of the power of architecture to climb out of the earth into the light right peter said so perhaps you should look there for the first rays of light he motioned to the grid in the northeast corner langdon returned his eyes to the page moving his gaze to the upper right or northeast corner the symbol in that corner was a downwardpointing arrow langdon said trying to grasp solomons point which means beneath heredom no robert not beneath solomon replied think this grid is not a metaphorical maze its a map and on a map a directional arrow that points down means south langdon exclaimed startled exactly solomon replied grinning now with excitement due south on a map down is south moreover on a map the word heredom would not be a metaphor for heaven it would be the name of a geographic location the house of the temple youre saying this map is pointing due south of this building praise god solomon said laughing light dawns at last langdon studied the grid but peter even if youre right due south of this building could be anywhere on a longitude thats over twentyfour thousand miles long no robert you are ignoring the legend which claims the lost word is buried in dc that shortens the line substantially in addition legend also claims that a large stone sits atop the opening of the staircase and that this stone is engraved with a message in an ancient language as a kind of marker so the worthy can find it langdon was having trouble taking any of this seriously and while he didnt know dc well enough to picture what was due south of their current location he was pretty certain there was no huge engraved stone atop a buried staircase the message inscribed on the stone peter said is right here before our eyes he tapped the third row of the grid before langdon this is the inscription robert youve solved the puzzle dumbfounded langdon studied the seven symbols solved langdon had no idea whatsoever what these seven disparate symbols could possibly mean and he was damned sure they were not engraved anywhere in the nations capital particularly on a giant stone over a staircase peter he said i dont see how this sheds any light at all i know of no stone in dc engraved with this message solomon patted him on the shoulder you have walked past it and never seen it we all have it is sitting in plain view like the mysteries themselves and tonight when i saw these seven symbols i realized in an instant that the legend was true the lost word is buried in dc and it does rest at the bottom of a long staircase beneath an enormous engraved stone mystified langdon remained silent robert tonight i believe you have earned the right to know the truth langdon stared at peter trying to process what he had just heard youre going to tell me where the lost word is buried no solomon said standing up with a smile im going to show you five minutes later langdon was buckling himself into the backseat of the escalade beside peter solomon simkins climbed in behind the wheel as sato approached across the parking lot mr solomon the director said lighting a cigarette as she arrived ive just made the call you requested and peter asked through his open window i ordered them to give you access briefly thank you sato studied him looking curious i must say its a most unusual request solomon gave an enigmatic shrug sato let it go circling around to langdons window and rapping with her knuckles langdon lowered the window professor she said with no hint of warmth your assistance tonight while reluctant was critical to our success and for that i thank you she took a long drag on her cigarette and blew it sideways however one final bit of advice the next time a senior administrator of the cia tells you she has a nationalsecurity crisis her eyes flashed black leave the bullshit in cambridge langdon opened his mouth to speak but director inoue sato had already turned and was headed off across the parking lot toward a waiting helicopter simkins glanced over his shoulder stonefaced are you gentlemen ready actually solomon said just one moment he produced a small folded piece of dark fabric and handed it to langdon robert id like you to put this on before we go anywhere puzzled langdon examined the cloth it was black velvet as he unfolded it he realized he was holding a masonic hoodwink the traditional blindfold of a firstdegree initiate what the hell peter said id prefer you not see where were going langdon turned to peter you want to blindfold me for the journey solomon grinned my secret my rules chapter the breeze felt cold outside cia headquarters in langley nola kaye was shivering as she followed syssec rick parrish across the agencys moonlit central courtyard where is rick taking me the crisis of the masonic video had been averted thank god but nola still felt uneasy the redacted file on the cia directors partition remained a mystery and it was nagging at her she and sato would debrief in the morning and nola wanted all the facts finally she had called rick parrish and demanded his help now as she followed rick to some unknown location outside nola could not push the bizarre phrases from her memory secret location underground where the somewhere in washington dc the coordinates uncovered an ancient portal that led warning the pyramid holds dangerous decipher this engraved symbolon to unveil you and i agree parrish said as they walked that the hacker who spidered those keywords was definitely searching for information about the masonic pyramid obviously nola thought it turns out though the hacker stumbled onto a facet of the masonic mystery i dont think he expected what do you mean nola you know how the cia director sponsors an internal discussion forum for agency employees to share their ideas about all kinds of things of course the forums provided agency personnel a safe place to chat online about various topics and gave the director a kind of virtual gateway to his staff the directors forums are hosted on his private partition and yet in order to provide access to employees of all clearance levels theyre located outside the directors classified firewall what are you getting at she demanded as they rounded a corner near the agency cafeteria in a word parrish pointed into the darkness that nola glanced up across the plaza in front of them was a massive metal sculpture glimmering in the moonlight in an agency that boasted over five hundred pieces of original art this sculpture titled kryptos was by far the most famous greek for hidden kryptos was the work of american artist james sanborn and had become something of a legend here at the cia the work consisted of a massive sshaped panel of copper set on its edge like a curling metal wall engraved into the expansive surface of the wall were nearly two thousand letters organized into a baffling code as if this were not enigmatic enough positioned carefully in the area around the encrypted swall were numerous other sculptural elements granite slabs at odd angles a compass rose a magnetic lodestone and even a message in morse code that referenced lucid memory and shadow forces most fans believed that these pieces were clues that would reveal how to decipher the sculpture kryptos was art but it was also an enigma attempting to decipher its encoded secret had become an obsession for cryptologists both inside and outside the cia finally a few years back a portion of the code had been broken and it became national news although much of kryptos s code remained unsolved to this day the sections that had been deciphered were so bizarre that they made the sculpture only more mysterious it referenced secret underground locations portals that led into ancient tombs longitudes and latitudes nola could still recall bits and pieces of the deciphered sections the information was gathered and transmitted underground to an unknown location it was totally invisible hows that possible they used the earths magnetic field nola had never paid much attention to the sculpture or cared if it was ever fully deciphered at the moment however she wanted answers why are you showing me kryptos parrish gave her a conspiratorial smile and dramatically extracted a folded sheet of paper from his pocket voilа the mysterious redacted document you were so concerned about i accessed the complete text nola jumped you snooped the directors classified partition no thats what i was getting at earlier have a look he handed her the file nola seized the page and unfolded it when she saw the standard agency headers at the top of the page she cocked her head in surprise this document was not classified not even close employee discussion board kryptos compressed storage thread nola found herself looking at a series of postings that had been compressed into a single page for more efficient storage your keyword document rick said is some cipherpunks rambling about kryptos nola scanned down the document until she spotted a sentence containing a familiar set of keywords jim the sculpture says it was transmitted to a secret location underground where theinfo was hidden this text is from the directors online kryptos forum rick explained the forums been going for years there are literally thousands of postings im not surprised one of them happened to contain all the keywords nola kept scanning down until she spotted another posting containing keywords even though mark said the codes latlong headings point somewhere in washington dc the coordinates he used were off by one degreekryptos basically points back to itself parrish walked over to the statue and ran his palm across the cryptic sea of letters a lot of this code has yet to be deciphered and there are plenty of people who think the message might actually relate to ancient masonic secrets nola now recalled murmurs of a masonickryptos link but she tended to ignore the lunatic fringe then again looking around at the various pieces of the sculpture arranged around the plaza she realized that it was a code in pieces a symbolon just like the masonic pyramid odd for a moment nola could almost see kryptos as a modern masonic pyramid a code in many pieces made of different materials each playing a role do you think theres any way kryptos and the masonic pyramid might be hiding the same secret who knows parrish shot kryptos a frustrated look i doubt well ever know the whole message that is unless someone can convince the director to unlock his safe and sneak a peek at the solution nola nodded it was all coming back to her now when kryptos was installed it arrived with a sealed envelope containing a complete decryption of the sculptures codes the sealed solution was entrusted to then cia director william webster who locked it in his office safe the document was allegedly still there having been transferred from director to director over the years strangely nolas thoughts of william webster sparked her memory bringing back yet another portion of kryptos s deciphered text its buried out there somewhere who knows the exact location only ww although nobody knew exactly what was buried out there most people believed the ww was a reference to william webster nola had heard whispers once that it referred in fact to a man named william whiston a royal society theologian although she had never bothered to give it much thought rick was talking again ive got to admit im not really into artists but i think this guy sanborns a serious genius i was just looking online at his cyrillic projector project it shines giant russian letters from a kgb document on mind control freaky nola was no longer listening she was examining the paper where she had found the third key phrase in another posting right that whole section is verbatim from some famous archaeologists diary telling about the moment he dug down and uncovered an ancient portal that led to the tomb of tutankhamen the archaeologist who was quoted on kryptos nola knew was in fact famed egyptologist howard carter the next posting referenced him by name i just skimmed the rest of carters field notes online and it sounds like he found a clay tablet warning the pyramid holds dangerous consequences for anyone who disturbs the peace of the pharaoh a curse should we be worried nola scowled rick for gods sake this idiots pyramid reference isnt even right tutankhamen wasnt buried in a pyramid he was buried in the valley of the kings dont cryptologists watch the discovery channel parrish shrugged techies nola now saw the final key phrase guys you know im not a conspiracy theorist but jim and dave had better decipher this engraved symbolon to unveil its final secret before the world ends in ciao anyhow parrish said i figured youd want to know about the kryptos forum before you accused the cia director of harboring classified documentation about an ancient masonic legend somehow i doubt a man as powerful as the cia director has time for that sort of thing nola pictured the masonic video and its images of all the influential men participating in an ancient rite if rick had any idea in the end she knew whatever kryptos ultimately revealed the message definitely had mystical undertones she gazed up at the gleaming piece of art a threedimensional code standing silently at the heart of one of the nations premier intelligence agencies and she wondered if it would ever give up its final secret as she and rick headed back inside nola had to smile its buried out there somewhere chapter this is crazy blindfolded robert langdon could see nothing as the escalade sped southward along the deserted streets on the seat beside him peter solomon remained silent where is he taking me langdons curiosity was a mix of intrigue and apprehension his imagination in overdrive as it tried desperately to put the pieces together peter had not wavered from his claim the lost word buried at the bottom of a staircase thats covered by a massive engraved stone it all seemed impossible the stones alleged engraving was still lodged in langdons memory and yet the seven symbols as far as he could tell made no sense together at all the stonemasons square the symbol of honesty and being true the letters au the scientific abbreviation for the element gold the sigma the greek letter s the mathematical symbol for the sum of all parts the pyramid the egyptian symbol of man reaching heavenward the delta the greek letter d the mathematical symbol for change mercury as depicted by its most ancient alchemical symbol the ouroboros the symbol of wholeness and atonement solomon still insisted these seven symbols were a message but if this was true then it was a message langdon had no idea how to read the escalade slowed suddenly and turned sharply right onto a different surface as if into a driveway or access road langdon perked up listening intently for clues as to their whereabouts theyd been driving for less than ten minutes and although langdon had tried to follow in his mind he had lost his bearings quickly for all he knew they were now pulling back into the house of the temple the escalade came to a stop and langdon heard the window roll down agent simkins cia their driver announced i believe youre expecting us yes sir a sharp military voice replied director sato phoned ahead one moment while i move the security barricade langdon listened with rising confusion now sensing they were entering a military base as the car began moving again along an unusually smooth stretch of pavement he turned his head blindly toward solomon where are we peter he demanded do not remove your blindfold peters voice was stern the vehicle continued a short distance and again slowed to a stop simkins killed the engine more voices military someone asked for simkinss identification the agent got out and spoke to the men in hushed tones langdons door was suddenly being opened and powerful hands assisted him out of the car the air felt cold it was windy solomon was beside him robert just let agent simkins lead you inside langdon heard metal keys in a lock and then the creak of a heavy iron door swinging open it sounded like an ancient bulkhead where the hell are they taking me simkinss hands guided langdon in the direction of the metal door they stepped over a threshold straight ahead professor it was suddenly quiet dead deserted the air inside smelled sterile and processed simkins and solomon flanked langdon now guiding him blindly down a reverberating corridor the floor felt like stone beneath his loafers behind them the metal door slammed loudly and langdon jumped the locks turned he was sweating now beneath his blindfold he wanted only to tear it off they stopped walking now simkins let go of langdons arm and there was a series of electronic beeps followed by an unexpected rumble in front of them which langdon imagined had to be a security door sliding open automatically mr solomon you and mr langdon continue on alone ill wait for you here simkins said take my flashlight thank you solomon said we wont be long flashlight langdons heart was pounding wildly now peter took langdons arm in his own and inched forward walk with me robert they moved slowly together across another threshold and the security door rumbled shut behind them peter stopped short is something wrong langdon was suddenly feeling queasy and off balance i think i just need to take off this blindfold not yet were almost there almost where langdon felt a growing heaviness in the pit of his stomach i told you im taking you to see the staircase that descends to the lost word peter this isnt funny its not meant to be its meant to open your mind robert its meant to remind you that there are mysteries in this world that even you have yet to lay eyes upon and before i take one more step with you i want you to do something for me i want you to believe just for an instant believe in the legend believe that you are about to peer down a winding staircase that plunges hundreds of feet to one of humankinds greatest lost treasures langdon felt dizzy as much as he wanted to believe his dear friend he could not is it much farther his velvet hoodwink was drenched in sweat no only a few more steps actually through one last door ill open it now solomon let go of him for a moment and as he did so langdon swayed feeling lightheaded unsteady he reached out for stability and peter was quickly back at his side the sound of a heavy automatic door rumbled in front of them peter took langdons arm and they moved forward again this way they inched across another threshold and the door slid closed behind them silence cold langdon immediately sensed that this place whatever it was had nothing to do with the world on the other side of the security doors the air was dank and chilly like a tomb the acoustics felt dull and cramped he felt an irrational bout of claustrophobia settling in a few more steps solomon guided him blindly around a corner and positioned him precisely finally he said take off your blindfold langdon seized the velvet hoodwink and tore it from his face he looked all around to find out where he was but he was still blind he rubbed his eyes nothing peter its pitchblack yes i know reach in front of you theres a railing grasp it langdon groped in the darkness and found an iron railing now watch he could hear peter fumbling with something and suddenly a blazing flashlight beam pierced the darkness it was pointed at the floor and before langdon could take in his surroundings solomon directed the flashlight out over the railing and pointed the beam straight down langdon was suddenly staring into a bottomless shaft an endless winding staircase that plunged deep into the earth my god his knees nearly buckled and he gripped the railing for support the staircase was a traditional square spiral and he could see at least thirty landings descending into the earth before the flashlight faded to nothing i cant even see the bottom peter he stammered what is this place ill take you to the bottom of the staircase in a moment but before i do you need to see something else too overwhelmed to protest langdon let peter guide him away from the stairwell and across the strange little chamber peter kept the flashlight trained on the worn stone floor beneath their feet and langdon could get no real sense of the space around them except that it was small a tiny stone chamber they arrived quickly at the rooms opposite wall in which was embedded a rectangle of glass langdon thought it might be a window into a room beyond and yet from where he stood he saw only darkness on the other side go ahead peter said have a look whats in there langdon flashed for an instant on the chamber of reflection beneath the capitol building and how he had believed for a moment that it might contain a portal to some giant underground cavern just look robert solomon inched him forward and brace yourself because the sight will shock you having no idea what to expect langdon moved toward the glass as he neared the portal peter turned out the flashlight plunging the tiny chamber into total darkness as his eyes adjusted langdon groped in front of him his hands finding the wall finding the glass his face moving closer to the transparent portal still only darkness beyond he leaned closer pressing his face to the glass then he saw it the wave of shock and disorientation that tore through langdons body reached down inside and spun his internal compass upside down he nearly fell backward as his mind strained to accept the utterly unanticipated sight that was before him in his wildest dreams robert langdon would never have guessed what lay on the other side of this glass the vision was a glorious sight there in the darkness a brilliant white light shone like a gleaming jewel langdon now understood it all the barricade on the access road the guards at the main entrance the heavy metal door outside the automatic doors that rumbled open and closed the heaviness in his stomach the lightness in his head and now this tiny stone chamber robert peter whispered behind him sometimes a change of perspective is all it takes to see the light speechless langdon stared out through the window his gaze traveled into the darkness of the night traversing more than a mile of empty space dropping lower lower through the darkness until it came to rest atop the brilliantly illuminated stark white dome of the us capitol building langdon had never seen the capitol from this perspective hovering feet in the air atop americas great egyptian obelisk tonight for the first time in his life he had ridden the elevator up to the tiny viewing chamber at the pinnacle of the washington monument chapter robert langdon stood mesmerized at the glass portal absorbing the power of the landscape below him having ascended unknowingly hundreds of feet into the air he was now admiring one of the most spectacular vistas he had ever seen the shining dome of the us capitol rose like a mountain at the east end of the national mall on either side of the building two parallel lines of light stretched toward him the illuminated facades of the smithsonian museums beacons of art history science culture langdon now realized to his astonishment that much of what peter had declared to be true was in fact true there is indeed a winding staircase descending hundreds of feet beneath a massive stone the huge capstone of this obelisk sat directly over his head and langdon now recalled a forgotten bit of trivia that seemed to have eerie relevance the capstone of the washington monument weighed precisely thirtythree hundred pounds again the number more startling however was the knowledge that this capstones ultimate peak the zenith of this obelisk was crowned by a tiny polished tip of aluminum a metal as precious as gold in its day the shining apex of the washington monument was only about a foot tall the same size as the masonic pyramid incredibly this small metal pyramid bore a famous engraving laus deo and langdon suddenly understood this is the true message of the base of the stone pyramid the seven symbols are a transliteration the simplest of ciphers the symbols are letters the stonemasons square l the element gold au the greek sigma s the greek delta d alchemical mercury e the ouroboros o laus deo langdon whispered the wellknown latin phrase meaning praise godwas inscribed on the tip of the washington monument in script letters only one inch tall on full display and yet invisible to all laus deo praise god peter said behind him flipping on the soft lighting in the chamber the masonic pyramids final code langdon turned his friend was grinning broadly and langdon recalled that peter had actually spoken the words praise god earlier inside the masonic library and i still missed it langdon felt a chill to realize how apt it was that the legendary masonic pyramid had guided him here to americas great obelisk the symbol of ancient mystical wisdom rising toward the heavens at the heart of a nation in a state of wonder langdon began moving counterclockwise around the perimeter of the tiny square room arriving now at another viewing window north through this northwardfacing window langdon gazed down at the familiar silhouette of the white house directly in front of him he raised his eyes to the horizon where the straight line of sixteenth street ran due north toward the house of the temple i am due south of heredom he continued around the perimeter to the next window looking west langdons eyes traced the long rectangle of the reflecting pool to the lincoln memorial its classical greek architecture inspired by the parthenon in athens temple to athena goddess of heroic undertakings annuit coeptis langdon thought god favors our undertaking continuing to the final window langdon gazed southward across the dark waters of the tidal basin where the jefferson memorial shone brightly in the night the gently sloping cupola langdon knew was modeled after the pantheon the original home to the great roman gods of mythology having looked in all four directions langdon now thought about the aerial photos he had seen of the national mall her four arms outstretched from the washington monument toward the cardinal points of the compass i am standing at the crossroads of america langdon continued back around to where peter was standing his mentor was beaming well robert this is it the lost word this is where its buried the masonic pyramid led us here langdon did a double take he had all but forgotten about the lost word robert i know of nobody more trustworthy than you and after a night like tonight i believe you deserve to know what this is all about as promised in legend the lost word is indeed buried at the bottom of a winding staircase he motioned to the mouth of the monuments long stairwell langdon had finally started to get his feet back under him but now he was puzzled peter quickly reached into his pocket and pulled out a small object do you remember this langdon took the cubeshaped box that peter had entrusted to him long ago yes but im afraid i didnt do a very good job of protecting it solomon chuckled perhaps the time had come for it to see the light of day langdon eyed the stone cube wondering why peter had just handed it to him what does this look like to you peter asked langdon eyed the and recalled his first impression when katherine had unwrapped the package a cornerstone exactly peter replied now there are a few things you might not know about cornerstones first the concept of laying a cornerstone comes from the old testament langdon nodded the book of psalms correct and a true cornerstone is always buried beneath the ground symbolizing the buildings initial step upward out of the earth toward the heavenly light langdon glanced out at the capitol recalling that its cornerstone was buried so deep in the foundation that to this day excavations had been unable to find it and finally solomon said like the stone box in your hand many cornerstones are little vaults and have hollow cavities so that they can hold buried treasures talismans if you will symbols of hope for the future of the building about to be erected langdon was well aware of this tradition too even today masons laid cornerstones in which they sealed meaningful objects time capsules photos proclamations even the ashes of important people my purpose in telling you this solomon said glancing over at the stairwell should be clear you think the lost word is buried in the cornerstone of the washington monument i dont think robert i know the lost word was buried in the cornerstone of this monument on july in a full masonic ritual langdon stared at him our masonic forefathers buried a word peter nodded they did indeed they understood the true power of what they were burying all night langdon had been trying to wrap his mind around sprawling ethereal concepts the ancient mysteries the lost word the secrets of the ages he wanted something solid and despite peters claims that the key to it all was buried in a cornerstone feet beneath him langdon was having a hard time accepting it people study the mysteries for entire lifetimes and are still unable to access the power allegedly hidden there langdon flashed on dьrers melencolia i the image of the dejected adept surrounded by the tools of his failed efforts to unveil the mystical secrets of alchemy if the secrets can actually be unlocked they will not be found in one place any answer langdon had always believed was spread across the world in thousands of volumes encoded into writings of pythagoras hermes heraclitus paracelsus and hundreds of others the answer was found in dusty forgotten tomes on alchemy mysticism magic and philosophy the answer was hidden in the ancient library of alexandria the clay tablets of sumer and the hieroglyphs of egypt peter im sorry langdon said quietly shaking his head to understand the ancient mysteries is a lifelong process i cant imagine how the key could possibly rest within a single word peter placed a hand on langdons shoulder robert the lost word is not a word he gave a sage smile we only call it the word because thats what the ancients called it in the beginning chapter in thebeginning was the word dean galloway knelt at the great crossing of the national cathedral and prayed for america he prayed that his beloved country would soon come to grasp the true power of the word the recorded collection of the written wisdom of all the ancient masters the spiritual truths taught by the great sages history had blessed mankind with the wisest of teachers profoundly enlightened souls whose understanding of the spiritual and mental mysteries exceeded all understanding the precious words of these adepts buddha jesus muhammad zoroaster and countless others had been transmitted through history in the oldest and most precious of vessels books every culture on earth had its own sacred book its own word each one different and yet each one the same for christians the word was the bible for muslims the koran for jews the torah for hindus the vedas and on and on it went the word shall light the way for americas masonic forefathers the word had been the bible and yet few people in history have understood its true message tonight as galloway knelt alone within the great cathedral he placed his hands upon the word a wellworn copy of his own masonic bible this treasured book like all masonic bibles contained the old testament the new testament and a treasure trove of masonic philosophical writings although galloways eyes could no longer read the text he knew the preface by heart its glorious message had been read by millions of his brethren in countless languages around the world the text read time is a river and books are boats many volumes start down that stream only to be wrecked and lost beyond recall in its sands only a few a very few endure the testings of time and live to bless the ages following there is a reason these volumes survived while others vanished as a scholar of faith dean galloway had always found it astonishing that the ancient spiritual texts the most studied books on earth were in fact the least understood concealed within those pages there hides a wondrous secret one day soon the light would dawn and mankind would finally begin to grasp the simple transformative truth of the ancient teachings and take a quantum leap forward in understanding his own magnificent nature chapter the winding staircase that descends the spine of the washington monument consists of stone steps that spiral around an open elevator shaft langdon and solomon were making their way down langdon still grappling with the startling fact that peter had shared with him only moments ago robert buried within the hollow cornerstone of this monument our forefathers placed a single copy of the word the bible which waits in darkness at the foot of this staircase as they descended peter suddenly stopped on a landing and swung his flashlight beam to illuminate a large stone medallion embedded in the wall what in the world langdon jumped when he saw the carving the medallion depicted a frightening cloaked figure holding a scythe and kneeling beside an hourglass the figures arm was raised and his index finger was extended pointing directly at a large open bible as if to say the answer is in there langdon stared at the carving and then turned to peter his mentors eyes shone with mystery id like you to consider something robert his voice echoed down the empty stairwell why do you think the bible has survived thousands of years of tumultuous history why is it still here is it because its stories are such compelling reading of course not but there is a reason there is a reason christian monks spend lifetimes attempting to decipher the bible there is a reason that jewish mystics and kabbalists pore over the old testament and that reason robert is that there exist powerful secrets hidden in the pages of this ancient book a vast collection of untapped wisdom waiting to be unveiled langdon was no stranger to the theory that the scriptures contained a hidden layer of meaning a concealed message that was veiled in allegory symbolism and parable the prophets warn us peter continued that the language used to share their secret mysteries is a cryptic one the gospel of mark tells us unto you is given to know the mystery but it will be told in parable proverbs cautions that the sayings of the wise are riddles while corinthians talks of hidden wisdom the gospel of john forewarns i will speak to you in parable and use dark sayings dark sayings langdon mused knowing this strange phrase made numerous odd appearances in proverbs as well as in psalm i will open my mouth in a parable and utter dark sayings of old the concept of a dark saying langdon had learned did not mean that the saying was evil but rather that its true meaning was shadowed or obscured from the light and if you have any doubts peter added corinthians overtly tells us that the parables have two layers of meaning milk for babes and meat for menwhere the milk is a watereddown reading for infantile minds and the meat is the true message accessible only to mature minds peter raised the flashlight again illuminating the carving of the cloaked figure pointing intently at the bible i know you are a skeptic robert but consider this if the bible does not contain hidden meaning then why have so many of historys finest minds including brilliant scientists at the royal society become so obsessed with studying it sir isaac newton wrote more than a million words attempting to decipher the true meaning of the scripture including a manuscript that claimed he had extracted hidden scientific information from the bible langdon knew this was true and sir francis bacon peter continued the luminary hired by king james to literally create the authorized king james bible became so utterly convinced that the bible contained cryptic meaning that he wrote in his own codes which are still studied today of course as you know bacon was a rosicrucian and penned the wisdom of the ancients peter smiled even the iconoclastic poet william blake hinted that we should read between the lines langdon was familiar with the verse both read the bible day and night but thou read black where i read white and it wasnt just the european luminaries peter continued descending faster now it was here robert at the very core of this young american nation that our brightest forefathers john adams ben franklin thomas paine all warned of the profound dangers of interpreting the bible literally in fact thomas jefferson was so convinced the bibles true message was hidden that he literally cut up the pages and reedited the book attempting in his words to do away with the artificial scaffolding and restore the genuine doctrines langdon was well aware of this strange fact the jeffersonian bible was still in print today and included many of his controversial revisions among them the removal of the virgin birth and the resurrection incredibly the jeffersonian bible had been presented to every incoming member of congress during the first half of the nineteenth century peter you know i find this topic fascinating and i can understand that it might be tempting for bright minds to imagine the scriptures contain hidden meaning but it makes no logical sense to me any skilled professor will tell you that teaching is never done in code im sorry teachers teach peter we speak openly why would the prophets the greatest teachers in history obscure their language if they hoped to change the world why would they speak in code why not speak plainly so the world could understand peter glanced back over his shoulder as he descended looking surprised by the question robert the bible does not talk openly for the same reason the ancient mystery schools were kept hidden for the same reason the neophytes had to be initiated before learning the secret teachings of the ages for the same reason the scientists in the invisible college refused to share their knowledge with others this information is powerful robert the ancient mysteries cannot be shouted from the rooftops the mysteries are a flaming torch which in the hands of a master can light the way but which in the hands of a madman can scorch the earth langdon stopped short what is he saying peter im talking about the bible why are you talking about the ancient mysteries peter turned robert dont you see the ancient mysteries and the bible are the same thing langdon stared in bewilderment peter was silent for several seconds waiting for the concept to soak in the bible is one of the books through which the mysteries have been passed down through history its pages are desperately trying to tell us the secret dont you understand the dark sayings in the bible are the whispers of the ancients quietly sharing with us all of their secret wisdom langdon said nothing the ancient mysteries as he understood them were a kind of instruction manual for harnessing the latent power of the human mind a recipe for personal apotheosis he had never been able to accept the power of the mysteries and certainly the notion that the bible was somehow hiding a key to these mysteries was an impossible stretch peter the bible and the ancient mysteries are total opposites the mysteries are all about the god within you man as god the bible is all about the god above you and man as a powerless sinner yes exactly youve put your finger on the precise problem the moment mankind separated himself from god the true meaning of the word was lost the voices of the ancient masters have now been drowned out lost in the chaotic din of selfproclaimed practitioners shouting that they alone understand the word that the word is written in their language and none other peter continued down the stairs robert you and i both know that the ancients would be horrified if they saw how their teachings have been perverted how religion has established itself as a tollbooth to heaven how warriors march into battle believing god favors their cause weve lost the word and yet its true meaning is still within reach right before our eyes it exists in all the enduring texts from the bible to the bhagavad gita to the koran and beyond all of these texts are revered upon the altars of freemasonry because masons understand what the world seems to have forgotten that each of these texts in its own way is quietly whispering the exact same message peters voice welled with emotion know ye not that ye are gods langdon was struck by the way this famous ancient saying kept surfacing tonight he had reflected on it while talking to galloway and also at the capitol building while trying to explain the apotheosis of washington peter lowered his voice to a whisper the buddha said you are god yourself jesus taught that the kingdom of god is within you and even promised us the works i do you can do and greater even the first antipope hippolytus of rome quoted the same message first uttered by the gnostic teacher monoimus abandon the search for god instead take yourself as the starting place langdon flashed on the house of the temple where the masonic tylers chair bore two words of guidance carved across its back know thyself a wise man once told me peter said his voice faint now the only difference between you and god is that you have forgotten you are divine peter i hear you i do and id love to believe we are gods but i see no gods walking our earth i see no superhumansyou can point to the alleged miracles of the bible or any other religious text but they are nothing but old stories fabricated by man and then exaggerated over time perhaps peter said or perhaps we simply need our science to catch up with the wisdom of the ancients he paused funny thing is i believe katherines research may be poised to do just that langdon suddenly remembered that katherine had dashed off from the house of the temple earlier hey where did she go anyway shell be here shortly peter said grinning she went to confirm a wonderful bit of good fortune outside at the base of the monument peter solomon felt invigorated as he inhaled the cold night air he watched in amusement as langdon stared intently at the ground scratching his head and looking around at the foot of the obelisk professor peter joked the cornerstone that contains the bible is underground you cant actually access the book but i assure you its there i believe you langdon said appearing lost in thought its just i noticed something langdon stepped back now and surveyed the giant plaza on which the washington monument stood the circular concourse was made entirely of white stone except for two decorative courses of dark stone which formed two concentric circles around the monument a circle within a circle langdon said i never realized the washington monument stands at the center of a circle within a circle peter had to laugh he misses nothing yes the great circumpunct the universal symbol for god at the crossroads of america he gave a coy shrug im sure its just a coincidence langdon seemed far off gazing skyward now his eyes ascending the illuminated spire which shone stark white against the black winter sky peter sensed langdon was beginning to see this creation for what it truly was a silent reminder of ancient wisdom an icon of enlightened man at the heart of a great nation even though peter could not see the tiny aluminum tip at the top he knew it was there mans enlightened mind straining toward heaven laus deo peter langdon approached looking like a man whod endured some kind of mystical initiation i almost forgot he said reaching into his pocket and producing peters gold masonic ring ive been wanting to return this to you all night thank you robert peter held out his left hand and took the ring admiring it you know all the secrecy and mystery surrounding this ring and the masonic pyramid it had an enormous effect on my life when i was a young man the pyramid was given to me with the promise that it hid mystical secrets its mere existence made me believe there were great mysteries in the world it piqued my curiosity fueled my sense of wonder and inspired me to open my mind to the ancient mysteries he smiled quietly and slipped the ring into his pocket i now realize that the masonic pyramids true purpose was not to reveal the answers but rather to inspire a fascination with them the two men stood in silence for a long while at the foot of the monument when langdon finally spoke his tone was serious i need to ask you a favor peter as a friend of course anything langdon made his request firmly solomon nodded knowing he was right i will right away langdon added motioning to the waiting escalade okay but one caveat langdon rolled his eyes chuckling somehow you always get the last word yes and there is one final thing i want you and katherine to see at this hour langdon checked his watch solomon smiled warmly at his old friend it is washingtons most spectacular treasure and something very very few people have ever seen chapter katherine solomons heart felt light as she hurried up the hill toward the base of the washington monument she had endured great shock and tragedy tonight and yet her thoughts were refocused now if only temporarily on the wonderful news peter had shared with her earlier news she had just confirmed with her very own eyes my research is safe all of it her labs holographic data drives had been destroyed tonight but earlier at the house of the temple peter had informed her that he had been secretly keeping backups of all her noetic research in the smsc executive offices you know im utterly fascinated with your work he had explained and i wanted to follow your progress without disturbing you katherine a deep voice called out she looked up a lone figure stood in silhouette at the base of the illuminated monument robert she hurried over and hugged him i heard the good news langdon whispered you must be relieved her voice cracked with emotion incredibly the research peter had saved was a scientific tour de force a massive collection of experiments that proved human thought was a real and measurable force in the world katherines experiments demonstrated the effect of human thought on everything from ice crystals to randomevent generators to the movement of subatomic particles the results were conclusive and irrefutable with the potential to transform skeptics into believers and affect global consciousness on a massive scale everything is going to change robert everything peter certainly thinks so katherine glanced around for her brother hospital langdon said i insisted he go as a favor to me katherine exhaled relieved thank you he told me to wait for you here katherine nodded her gaze climbing the glowing white obelisk he said he was bringing you here something about laus deo he didnt elaborate langdon gave a tired chuckle im not sure i entirely understand it myself he glanced up at the top of the monument your brother said quite a few things tonight that i couldnt get my mind around let me guess katherine said ancient mysteries science and the holy scriptures bingo welcome to my world she winked peter initiated me into this long ago it fueled a lot of my research intuitively some of what he said made sense langdon shook his head but intellectually katherine smiled and put her arm around him you know robert i may be able to help you with that deep inside the capitol building architect warren bellamy was walking down a deserted hallway only one thing left to do tonight he thought when he arrived at his office he retrieved a very old key from his desk drawer the key was black iron long and slender with faded markings he slid it into his pocket and then prepared himself to welcome his guests robert langdon and katherine solomon were on their way to the capitol at peters request bellamy was to provide them with a very rare opportunity the chance to lay eyes upon this buildings most magnificent secret something that could be revealed only by the architect chapter high above the floor of the capitol rotunda robert langdon inched nervously around the circular catwalk that extended just beneath the ceiling of the dome he peered tentatively over the railing dizzied by the height still unable to believe it had been less than ten hours since peters hand had appeared in the middle of the floor below on that same floor the architect of the capitol was now a tiny speck some hundred and eighty feet below moving steadily across the rotunda and then disappearing bellamy had escorted langdon and katherine up to this balcony leaving them here with very specific instructions peters instructions langdon eyed the old iron key that bellamy had handed to him then he glanced over at a cramped stairwell that ascended from this level climbing higher still god help me these narrow stairs according to the architect led up to a small metal door that could be unlocked with the iron key in langdons hand beyond the door lay something that peter insisted langdon and katherine see peter had not elaborated but rather had left strict instructions regarding the precise hour at which the door was to be opened we have to wait to open the door why langdon checked his watch again and groaned slipping the key into his pocket he gazed across the gaping void before him at the far side of the balcony katherine had walked fearlessly ahead apparently unfazed by the height she was now halfway around the circumference admiring every inch of brumidis the apotheosis of washington which loomed directly over their heads from this rare vantage point the fifteenfoottall figures that adorned the nearly five thousand square feet of the capitol dome were visible in astonishing detail langdon turned his back to katherine faced the outer wall and whispered very quietly katherine this is your conscience speaking why did you abandon robert katherine was apparently familiar with the domes startling acoustical properties because the wall whispered back because robert is being a chicken he should come over here with me we have plenty of time before were allowed to open that door langdon knew she was right and reluctantly made his way around the balcony hugging the wall as he went this ceiling is absolutely amazing katherine marveled her neck craned to take in the enormous splendor of the apotheosis overhead mythical gods all mixed in with scientific inventors and their creations and to think this is the image at the center of our capitol langdon turned his eyes upward to the sprawling forms of franklin fulton and morse with their technological inventions a shining rainbow arched away from these figures guiding his eye to george washington ascending to heaven on a cloud the great promise of man becoming god katherine said its as if the entire essence of the ancient mysteries is hovering over the rotunda langdon had to admit not many frescoes in the world fused scientific inventions with mythical gods and human apotheosis this ceilings spectacular collection of images was indeed a message of the ancient mysteries and it was here for a reason the founding fathers had envisioned america as a blank canvas a fertile field on which the seeds of the mysteries could be sown today this soaring icon the father of our country ascending to heaven hung silently above our lawmakers leaders and presidents a bold reminder a map to the future a promise of a time when man would evolve to complete spiritual maturity robert katherine whispered her gaze still fixated on the massive figures of americas great inventors accompanied by minerva its prophetic really today mans most advanced inventions are being used to study mans most ancient ideas the science of noetics may be new but its actually the oldest science on earth the study of human thought she turned to him now her eyes filled with wonder and were learning that the ancients actually understood thought more profoundly than we do today makes sense langdon replied the human mind was the only technology the ancients had at their disposal the early philosophers studied it relentlessly yes the ancient texts are obsessed with the power of the human mind the vedas describe the flow of mind energy the pistis sophia describes universal consciousness the zohar explores the nature of mind spirit the shamanic texts predict einsteins remote influence in terms of healing at a distance its all there and dont even get me started about the bible you too langdon said chuckling your brother tried to convince me that the bible is encoded with scientific information it certainly is she said and if you dont believe peter read some of newtons esoteric texts on the bible when you start to understand the cryptic parables in the bible robert you realize its a study of the human mind langdon shrugged i guess id better go back and read it again let me ask you something she said clearly not appreciating his skepticism when the bible tells us to go build our temple a temple that we must build with no tools and making no noise what temple do you think its talking about well the text does say your body is a temple yes corinthians you are the temple of god she smiled at him and the gospel of john says the exact same thing robert the scriptures are well aware of the power latent within us and they are urging us to harness that power urging us to build the temples of our minds unfortunately i think much of the religious world is waiting for a real temple to be rebuilt its part of the messianic prophecy yes but that overlooks an important point the second coming is the coming of man the moment when mankind finally builds the temple of his mind i dont know langdon said rubbing his chin im no bible scholar but im pretty sure the scriptures describe in detail a physical temple that needs to be built the structure is described as being in two parts an outer temple called the holy place and an inner sanctuary called the holy of holies the two parts are separated from each other by a thin veil katherine grinned pretty good recall for a bible skeptic by the way have you ever seen an actual human brain its built in two parts an outer part called the dura mater and an inner part called the pia mater these two parts are separated by the arachnoid a veil of weblike tissue langdon cocked his head in surprise gently she reached up and touched langdons temple theres a reason they call this your temple robert as langdon tried to process what katherine had said he flashed unexpectedly on the gnostic gospel of mary where the mind is there is the treasure perhaps youve heard katherine said softly now about the brain scans taken of yogis while they meditate the human brain in advanced states of focus will physically create a waxlike substance from the pineal gland this brain secretion is unlike anything else in the body it has an incredible healing effect can literally regenerate cells and may be one of the reasons yogis live so long this is real science robert this substance has inconceivable properties and can be created only by a mind that is highly tuned to a deeply focused state i remember reading about that a few years back yes and on that topic youre familiar with the bibles account of manna from heaven langdon saw no connection you mean the magical substance that fell from heaven to nourish the hungry exactly the substance was said to heal the sick provide everlasting life and strangely cause no waste in those who consumed it katherine paused as if waiting for him to understand robert she prodded a kind of nourishment that fell from heaven she tapped her temple magically heals the body creates no waste dont you see these are code words robert temple is code for body heaven is code for mind jacobs ladder is your spine and manna is this rare brain secretion when you see these code words in scripture pay attention they are often markers for a more profound meaning concealed beneath the surface katherines words were coming out in rapidfire succession now explaining how this same magical substance appeared throughout the ancient mysteries nectar of the gods elixir of life fountain of youth philosophers stone ambrosia dew ojas soma then she launched into an explanation about the brains pineal gland representing the allseeing eye of god according to matthew she said excitedly when your eye is single your body fills with light this concept is also represented by the ajna chakra and the dot on a hindus forehead which katherine stopped short looking sheepish sorry i know im rambling i just find this all so exhilarating for years ive studied the ancients claims of mans awesome mental power and now science is showing us that accessing that power is an actual physical process our brains if used correctly can call forth powers that are quite literally superhuman the bible like many ancient texts is a detailed exposition of the most sophisticated machine ever created the human mind she sighed incredibly science has yet to scratch the surface of the minds full promise it sounds like your work in noetics will be a quantum leap forward or backward she said the ancients already knew many of the scientific truths were now rediscovering within a matter of years modern man will be forced to accept what is now unthinkable our minds can generate energy capable of transforming physical matter she paused particles react to our thoughts which means our thoughts have the power to change the world langdon smiled softly what my research has brought me to believe is this katherine said god is very real a mental energy that pervades everything and we as human beings have been created in that image im sorry langdon interrupted created in the image of mental energy exactly our physical bodies have evolved over the ages but it was our minds that were created in the image of god weve been reading the bible too literally we learn that god created us in his image but its not our physical bodies that resemble god its our minds langdon was silent now fully engrossed this is the great gift robert and god is waiting for us to understand it all around the world we are gazing skyward waiting for god never realizing that god is waiting for us katherine paused letting her words soak in we are creators and yet we naively play the role of the created we see ourselves as helpless sheep buffeted around by the god who made us we kneel like frightened children begging for help for forgiveness for good luck but once we realize that we are truly created in the creators image we will start to understand that we too must be creators when we understand this fact the doors will burst wide open for human potential langdon recalled a passage that had always stuck with him from the work of the philosopher manly p hall if the infinite had not desired man to be wise he would not have bestowed upon him the faculty of knowing langdon gazed up again at the image of the apotheosis of washington the symbolic ascent of man to deity the created becoming the creator the most amazing part katherine said is that as soon as we humans begin to harness our true power we will have enormous control over our world we will be able to design reality rather than merely react to it langdon lowered his gaze that sounds dangerous katherine looked startled and impressed yes exactly if thoughts affect the world then we must be very careful how we think destructive thoughts have influence too and we all know its far easier to destroy than it is to create langdon thought of all the lore about needing to protect the ancient wisdom from the unworthy and share it only with the enlightened he thought of the invisible college and the great scientist isaac newtons request to robert boyle to keep high silence about their secret research it cannot be communicated newton wrote in without immense damage to the world theres an interesting twist here katherine said the great irony is that all the religions of the world for centuries have been urging their followers to embrace the concepts of faith and belief now science which for centuries has derided religion as superstition must admit that its next big frontier is quite literally the science of faith and belief the power of focused conviction and intention the same science that eroded our faith in the miraculous is now building a bridge back across the chasm it created langdon considered her words for a long time slowly he raised his eyes again to the apotheosis i have a question he said looking back at katherine even if i could accept just for an instant that i have the power to change physical matter with my mind and literally manifest all that i desire im afraid i see nothing in my life to make me believe i have such power she shrugged then youre not looking hard enough come on i want a real answer thats the answer of a priest i want the answer of a scientist you want a real answer here it is if i hand you a violin and say you have the capability to use it to make incredible music i am not lying you do have the capability but youll need enormous amounts of practice to manifest it this is no different from learning to use your mind robert welldirected thought is a learned skill to manifest an intention requires laserlike focus full sensory visualization and a profound belief we have proven this in a lab and just like playing a violin there are people who exhibit greater natural ability than others look to history look to the stories of those enlightened minds who performed miraculous feats katherine please dont tell me you actually believe in the miracles i mean seriously turning water into wine healing the sick with the touch of a hand katherine took a long breath and blew it out slowly i have witnessed people transform cancer cells into healthy cells simply by thinking about them i have witnessed human minds affecting the physical world in myriad ways and once you see that happen robert once this becomes part of your reality then some of the miracles you read about become simply a matter of degree langdon was pensive its an inspiring way to see the world katherine but for me it just feels like an impossible leap of faith and as you know faith has never come easily for me then dont think of it as faith think of it simply as changing your perspective accepting that the world is not precisely as you imagine historically every major scientific breakthrough began with a simple idea that threatened to overturn all of our beliefs the simple statement the earth is round was mocked as utterly impossible because most people believed the oceans would flow off the planet heliocentricity was called heresy small minds have always lashed out at what they dont understand there are those who create and those who tear down that dynamic has existed for all time but eventually the creators find believers and the number of believers reaches a critical mass and suddenly the world becomes round or the solar system becomes heliocentric perception is transformed and a new reality is born langdon nodded his thoughts drifting now you have a funny look on your face she said oh i dont know for some reason i was just remembering how i used to canoe out into the middle of the lake late at night lie down under the stars and think about stuff like this she nodded knowingly i think we all have a similar memory something about lying on our backs staring up at the heavens opens the mind she glanced up at the ceiling and then said give me your jacket what he took it off and gave it to her she folded it twice and laid it down on the catwalk like a long pillow lie down langdon lay on his back and katherine positioned his head on half of the folded jacket then she lay down beside him two kids shoulder to shoulder on the narrow catwalk staring up at brumidis enormous fresco okay she whispered put yourself in that same mindset a kid lying out in a canoe looking up at the stars his mind open and full of wonder langdon tried to obey although at the moment prone and comfortable he was feeling a sudden wave of exhaustion as his vision blurred he perceived a muted shape overhead that immediately woke him is that possible he could not believe he hadnt noticed it before but the figures in the apotheosis of washington were clearly arranged in two concentric rings a circle within a circle the apotheosis is also a circumpunct langdon wondered what else he had missed tonight theres something important i want to tell you robert theres another piece to all this a piece that i believe is the single most astonishing aspect of my research theres more katherine propped herself on her elbow and i promise if we as humans can honestly grasp this one simple truth the world will change overnight katherine propped herself on her elbow and i promise if we as humans can honestly grasp this one simple truth the world will change overnight she now had his full attention i should preface this she said by reminding you of the masonic mantras to gather what is scattered to bring order from chaos to find atonement go on langdon was intrigued katherine smiled down at him we have scientifically proven that the power of human thought grows exponentially with the number of minds that share that thought langdon remained silent wondering where she was going with this idea what im saying is this two heads are better than one and yet two heads are not twice better they are many many times better multiple minds working in unison magnify a thoughts effect exponentially this is the inherent power of prayer groups healing circles singing in unison and worshipping en masse the idea of universal consciousness is no ethereal new age concept its a hardcore scientific reality and harnessing it has the potential to transform our world this is the underlying discovery of noetic science whats more its happening right now you can feel it all around you technology is linking us in ways we never imagined possible twitter google wikipedia and others all blend to create a web of interconnected minds she laughed and i guarantee you as soon as i publish my work the twitterati will all be sending tweets that say learning about noetics and interest in this science will explode exponentially langdons eyelids felt impossibly heavy you know i still havent learned how to send a twitter a tweet she corrected laughing im sorry never mind close your eyes ill wake you when its time langdon realized he had all but forgotten the old key the architect had given them and why they had come up here as a new wave of exhaustion engulfed him langdon shut his eyes in the darkness of his mind he found himself thinking about universal consciousness about platos writings on the mind of the world and gathering god jungs collective unconscious the notion was as simple as it was startling god is found in the collection of many rather than in the one elohim langdon said suddenly his eyes flying open again as he made an unexpected connection im sorry katherine was still gazing down at him elohim he repeated the hebrew word for god in the old testament ive always wondered about it katherine gave a knowing smile yes the word is plural exactly langdon had never understood why the very first passages of the bible referred to god as a plural being elohim the almighty god in genesis was described not as one but as many god is plural katherine whispered because the minds of man are plural langdons thoughts were spiraling now dreams memories hopes fears revelations all swirling above him in the rotunda dome as his eyes began to close again he found himself staring at three words in latin painted within the apotheosis e pluribus unum out of many one he thought slipping off into sleep epilogue robert langdon awoke slowly faces gazed down at him where am i a moment later he recalled where he was he sat up slowly beneath the apotheosis his back felt stiff from lying on the hard catwalk wheres katherine langdon checked his mickey mouse watch its almost time he pulled himself to his feet peering cautiously over the banister into the gaping space below katherine he called out the word echoed back in the silence of the deserted rotunda retrieving his tweed jacket from the floor he brushed it off and put it back on he checked his pockets the iron key the architect had given him was gone making his way back around the walkway langdon headed for the opening the architect had shown them steep metal stairs ascending into cramped darkness he began to climb higher and higher he ascended gradually the stairway became more narrow and more inclined still langdon pushed on just a little farther the steps had become almost ladderlike now the passage frighteningly constricted finally the stairs ended and langdon stepped up onto a small landing before him was a heavy metal door the iron key was in the lock and the door hung slightly ajar he pushed and the door creaked open the air beyond felt cold as langdon stepped across the threshold into murky darkness he realized he was now outside i was just coming to get you katherine said smiling at him its almost time when langdon recognized his surroundings he drew a startled breath he was standing on a tiny skywalk that encircled the pinnacle of the us capitol dome directly above him the bronze statue of freedom gazed out over the sleeping capital city she faced the east where the first crimson splashes of dawn had begun to paint the horizon katherine guided langdon around the balcony until they were facing west perfectly aligned with the national mall in the distance the silhouette of the washington monument stood in the earlymorning light from this vantage point the towering obelisk looked even more impressive than it had before when it was built katherine whispered it was the tallest structure on the entire planet langdon pictured the old sepia photographs of stonemasons on scaffolding more than five hundred feet in the air laying each block by hand one by one we are builders he thought we are creators since the beginning of time man had sensed there was something special about himself something more he had longed for powers he did not possess he had dreamed of flying of healing and of transforming his world in every way imaginable and he had done just that today the shrines to mans accomplishments adorned the national mall the smithsonian museums burgeoned with our inventions our art our science and the ideas of our great thinkers they told the history of man as creator from the stone tools in the native american history museum to the jets and rockets in the national air and space museum if our ancestors could see us today surely they would think us gods as langdon peered through the predawn mist at the sprawling geometry of museums and monuments before him his eyes returned to the washington monument he pictured the lone bible in the buried cornerstone and thought of how the word of god was really the word of man he thought about the great circumpunct and how it had been embedded in the circular plaza beneath the monument at the crossroads of america langdon thought suddenly of the little stone box peter had entrusted to him the cube he now realized had unhinged and opened to form the same exact geometrical form a cross with a circumpunct at its center langdon had to laugh even that little box was hinting at this crossroads robert look katherine pointed to the top of the monument langdon lifted his gaze but saw nothing then staring more intently he glimpsed it across the mall a tiny speck of golden sunlight was glinting off the highest tip of the towering obelisk the shining pinpoint grew quickly brighter more radiant gleaming on the capstones aluminum peak langdon watched in wonder as the light transformed into a beacon that hovered above the shadowed city he pictured the tiny engraving on the eastfacing side of the aluminum tip and realized to his amazement that the first ray of sunlight to hit the nations capital every single day did so by illuminating two words laus deo robert katherine whispered nobody ever gets to come up here at sunrise this is what peter wanted us to witness langdon could feel his pulse quickening as the glow atop the monument intensified he said he believes this is why the forefathers built the monument so tall i dont know if thats true but i do know this theres a very old law decreeing that nothing taller can be built in our capital city ever the light inched farther down the capstone as the sun crept over the horizon behind them as langdon watched he could almost sense all around him the celestial spheres tracing their eternal orbits through the void of space he thought of the great architect of the universe and how peter had said specifically that the treasure he wanted to show langdon could be unveiled only by the architect langdon had assumed this meant warren bellamy wrong architect as the rays of sunlight strengthened the golden glow engulfed the entirety of the thirtythreehundredpound capstone the mind of man receiving enlightenment the light then began inching down the monument commencing the same descent it performed every morning heaven moving toward earth god connecting to man this process langdon realized would reverse come evening the sun would dip in the west and the light would climb again from earth back to heaven preparing for a new day beside him katherine shivered and inched closer langdon put his arm around her as the two of them stood side by side in silence langdon thought about all he had learned tonight he thought of katherines belief that everything was about to change he thought of peters faith that an age of enlightenment was imminent and he thought of the words of a great prophet who had boldly declared nothing is hidden that will not be made known nothing is secret that will not come to light as the sun rose over washington langdon looked to the heavens where the last of the nighttime stars were fading out he thought about science about faith about man he thought about how every culture in every country in every time had always shared one thing we all had the creator we used different names different faces and different prayers but god was the universal constant for man god was the symbol we all shared the symbol of all the mysteries of life that we could not understand the ancients had praised god as a symbol of our limitless human potential but that ancient symbol had been lost over time until now in that moment standing atop the capitol with the warmth of the sun streaming down all around him robert langdon felt a powerful upwelling deep within himself it was an emotion he had never felt this profoundly in his entire life hope about the
