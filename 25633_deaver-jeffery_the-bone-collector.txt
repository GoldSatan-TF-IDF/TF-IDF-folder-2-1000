jeffery deaver the bone collector the first book in the lincoln rhyme series for my family dee danny julie ethel and nelson apples dont fall far and for diana too i king for a day the present in new york is so powerful that the past is lost john jay chapman one friday pm to saturday pm she wanted only to sleep the plane had touched down two hours late and thered been a marathon wait for the luggage and then the car service had messed up the limod left an hour ago so now they were waiting for a cab she stood in the line of passengers her lean body listing against the weight of her laptop computer john rattled on about interest rates and new ways of restructuring the deal but all she could think was friday night i wanna pull on my sweats and hit the hay gazing at the endless stream of yellow cabs something about the color and the similarity of the cars reminded her of insects and she shivered with the creepycrawly feeling she remembered from her childhood in the mountains when she and her brotherd find a gutkilled badger or kick over a redant nest and gaze at the wet mass of squirming bodies and legs tj colfax shuffled forward as the cab pulled up and squealed to a stop the cabbie popped the trunk but stayed in the car they had to load their own luggage which ticked john off he was used to people doing things for him tammie jean didnt care she was still occasionally surprised to find that she had a secretary to type and file for her she tossed her suitcase in closed the trunk and climbed inside john got in after her slammed the door and mopped his pudgy face and balding scalp as if the effort of pitching his suitbag in the trunk had exhausted him first stop east seventysecond john muttered through the divider then the upper west side tj added the plexiglas between the front and back seats was badly scuffed and she could hardly see the driver the cab shot away from the curb and was soon cruising down the expressway toward manhattan look john said thats why all the crowds he was pointing at a billboard welcoming delegates to the un peace conference which was starting on monday there were going to be ten thousand visitors in town tj gazed up at the billboard blacks and whites and asians waving and smiling there was something wrong about the artwork though the proportions and the colors were off and the faces all seemed pasty tj muttered body snatchers they sped along the broad expressway which glared an uneasy yellow under the highway lights past the old navy yard past the brooklyn piers john finally stopped talking and pulled out his texas instruments started crunching some numbers tj sat back in the seat looking at the steamy sidewalks and sullen faces of people sitting on the brownstone stoops overlooking the highway they seemed halfcomatose in the heat it was hot in the cab too and tj reached for the button to lower the window she wasnt surprised to find that it didnt work she reached across john his was broken too it was then that she noticed that the door locks were missing the door handles too her hand slid over the door feeling for the nub of the handle nothing it was as if someone had cut it off with a hacksaw what john asked well the doors how do we open them john was looking from one to the other when the sign for the midtown tunnel came and went hey john rapped on the divider you missed the turn wherere you going maybe hes going to take the queensboro tj suggested the bridge meant a longer route but avoided the tunnels toll she sat forward and tapped on the plexiglas using her ring are you taking the bridge he ignored them hey and a moment later they sped past the queensboro turnoff shit john cried wherere you taking us harlem ill bet hes taking us to harlem tj looked out the window a car was moving parallel to them passing slowly she banged on the window hard help she shouted please the cars driver glanced at her once then again frowning he slowed and pulled behind them but with a hard jolt the cab skidded down an exit ramp into queens turned into an alley and sped through a deserted warehouse district they mustve been going sixty miles an hour whatre you doing tj banged on the divider slow down where are oh god no john muttered look the driver had pulled on a ski mask what do you want tj shouted money well give you money still silence from the front of the cab tj ripped open her targus bag and pulled out her black laptop she reared back and slammed the corner of the computer into the window the glass held though the sound of the bang seemed to scare the hell out of the driver the cab swerved and nearly hit the brick wall of the building they were speeding past money how much i can give you a lot of money john sputtered tears dripping down his fat cheeks tj rammed the window again with the laptop the screen flew off under the force of the blow but the window remained intact she tried once more and the body of the computer split open and fell from her hands oh shit they both pitched forward violently as the cab skidded to a stop in a dingy unlit culdesac the driver climbed out of the cab a small pistol in his hand please no she pleaded he walked to the back of the cab and leaned down peering into the greasy glass he stood there for a long time as she and john scooted backwards against the opposite door their sweating bodies pressed together the driver cupped his hands against the glare from the streetlights and looked at them closely a sudden crack resonated through the air and tj flinched john gave a short scream in the distance behind the driver the sky filled with red and blue fiery streaks more pops and whistles he turned and gazed up as a huge orange spider spread over the city fireworks tj recalled reading in the times a present from the mayor and the un secretarygeneral for the conference delegates welcoming them to the greatest city on earth the driver turned back to the cab with a loud snap he pulled up on the latch and slowly opened the door the call was anonymous as usual so there was no way of checking back to see which vacant lot the rp meant central had radioed he said thirtyseven near eleven thats all reporting parties werent known for triple a directions to crime scenes already sweating though it was just nine in the morning amelia sachs pushed through a stand of tall grass she was walking the strip search what the crime scene people called it an sshaped pattern nothing she bent her head to the speakermike pinned to her navyblue uniform blouse portable cant find anything central you have a furtherto through crisp static the dispatcher replied nothing more on location but one thing the rp said he hoped the vic was dead k say again central the rp said he hoped the victim was dead for his sake k k hoped the vic was dead sachs struggled over a wilted chainlink and searched another empty lot nothing she wanted to quit call in a unfounded report and go back to the deuce which was her regular beat her knees hurt and she was hot as stew in this lousy august weather she wanted to slip into the port authority hang with the kids and have a tall can of arizona iced tea then at just a couple of hours away shed clean out her locker at midtown south and head downtown for the training session but she didnt couldnt blow off the call she kept going along the hot sidewalk through the gap between two abandoned tenements through another vegetationfilled field her long index finger pushed into her flattop uniform cap through the layers of long red hair piled high on her head she scratched compulsively then reached up underneath the cap and scratched some more sweat ran down her forehead and tickled and she dug into her eyebrow too thinking my last two hours on the street i can live with it as sachs stepped farther into the brush she felt the first uneasiness of the morning somebodys watching me the hot wind rustled the dry brush and cars and trucks sped noisily to and from the lincoln tunnel she thought what patrol officers often did this city is so damn loud somebody could come up right behind me kniferange away and id never know it or line up iron sights on my back she spun around quickly nothing but leaves and rusting machinery and trash climbing a pile of stones wincing amelia sachs thirtyone a mere thirtyone her mother would say was plagued by arthritis inherited from her grandfather as clearly as shed received her mothers willowy build and her fathers good looks and career the red hair was anybodys guess another jolt of pain as she eased through a tall curtain of dying bushes she was fortunate to stop herself one pace from a sheer thirtyfoot drop below her was a gloomy canyon cut deep into the bedrock of the west side through it ran the amtrak roadbed for trains bound north she squinted looking at the floor of the canyon not far from the railroad bed what is that a circle of overturned earth a small tree branch sticking out of the top it looked like oh my good lord she shivered at the sight felt the nausea rise prickling her skin like a wave of flame she managed to step on that tiny part inside her that wanted to turn away and pretend she hadnt seen this he hoped the victim was dead for his sake she ran toward an iron ladder that led down from the sidewalk to the roadbed she reached for the railing but stopped just in time shit the perp mightve escaped this way if she touched it she might screw up any prints hed left okay we do it the hard way breathing deeply to dull the pain in her joints she began climbing down the rock face itself slipping her issue shoes polished like silver for the first day of her new assignment into crevices cut in the stone she jumped the last four feet to the roadbed and ran to the grave oh man it wasnt a branch sticking out of the ground it was a hand the bodyd been buried vertical and the dirt piled on until just the forearm wrist and hand protruded she stared at the ring finger all the flesh had been whittled away and a womans diamond cocktail ring had been replaced on the bloody stripped bone sachs dropped to her knees and began to dig dirt flying under her dogpaddling hands she noticed that the uncut fingers were splayed stretched beyond where they could normally bend which told her that the vic had been alive when the last shovelful of dirt was spooned onto the face and maybe still was sachs dug furiously into the loosely packed earth cutting her hand on a bottle shard her dark blood mixing into the darker earth and then she came to the hair and a forehead below it a cyanotic bluishgray from the lack of oxygen digging further until she could see the dull eyes and the mouth which had twisted into a horrible grin as the vic had tried in the last few seconds to stay above the rising tide of black earth it wasnt a woman despite the ring he was a heavyset man in his fifties as dead as the soil he floated in backing away she couldnt take her eyes off his and nearly stumbled over a railroad track she could think of absolutely nothing for a full minute except what it mustve been like to die that way then come on honey you got yourself a homicide crime scene and youre first officer you know what to do adapt a is for arrest a known perp d is for detain material witnesses and suspects a is for assess the crime scene p is for what was p again she lowered her head to the mike portable to central furtherto ive got a by the train tracks at threeeight and eleven homicide k need detectives cs bus and tour doctor k roger perp in custody k no perp fiveeighteightfive k sachs stared at the finger the one whittled down to the bone the incongruous ring the eyes and the grin oh that fucking grin a shudder ripped through her body amelia sachs had swum among snakes in summercamp rivers and had boasted truthfully shed have no problem bungeejumping from a hundredfoot bridge but let her think of confinement think of being trapped immobile and the panic attackd grab her like an electric shock which was why sachs walked fast when she walked and why she drove cars like light itself when you move they cant getcha she heard a sound and cocked her head a rumble deep getting louder scraps of paper blowing along the roadbed of the tracks dust dervishes swirling about her like angry ghosts then a low wail fivefootnine patrol officer amelia sachs found herself facing down a thirtyton amtrak locomotive the red white and blue slab of steel approaching at a determined ten miles an hour hold up there she shouted the engineer ignored her sachs jogged onto the roadbed and planted herself right in the middle of the track spread her stance and waved her arms signaling him to stop the locomotive squealed to a halt the engineer stuck his head out the window you cant go through here she told him he asked her what she meant she thought he looked woefully young to be driving such a big train its a crime scene please shut off the engine lady i dont see any crimes but sachs wasnt listening she was looking up at a gap in the chainlink on the west side of the train viaduct at the top near eleventh avenue that would have been one way to get the body here without being seen parking on eleventh and dragging the body through the narrow alley to the cliff on thirtyseventh the cross street he could be spotted from two dozen apartment windows that train sir just leave it right there i cant leave it here please shut off the engine we dont shut off the engines of trains like this they run all the time and call the dispatcher or somebody have them stop the southbound trains too we cant do that now sir ive got the number of that vehicle of yours vehicle id suggest you do it immediately sachs barked whatre you going to do lady gimme a ticket but amelia sachs was once again climbing back up the stone walls her poor joints creaking her lips tasting limestone dust clay and her own sweat she jogged to the alley shed noticed from the roadbed and then turned around studying eleventh avenue and the javits center across it the hall was bustling with crowds spectators and press a huge banner proclaimed welcome un delegates but earlier this morning when the street was deserted the perp could easily have found a parking space along here and carried the body to the tracks undetected sachs strode to eleventh surveyed the sixlane avenue which was jammed with traffic lets do it she waded into the sea of cars and trucks and stopped the northbound lanes cold several drivers tried end runs and she had to issue two citations and finally drag trash cans out into the middle of the street as a barricade to make sure the good residents did their civic duty sachs had finally remembered the next of the first officers adapt rules p is for protect the crime scene the sound of angry horns began to fill the hazy morning sky soon supplemented by the drivers angrier shouts a short time later she heard the sirens join the cacophony as the first of the emergency vehicles arrived forty minutes later the scene was swarming with uniforms and investigators dozens of them a lot more than a hit in hells kitchen however gruesome the cause of death seemed to warrant but sachs learned from another cop this was a hot case a media groper the vic was one of two passengers whod arrived at jfk last night gotten into a cab and headed for the city theyd never arrived at their homes cnns watching the uniform whispered so amelia sachs wasnt surprised to see blond vince peretti chief of the central investigation and resource division which oversaw thecrime scene unit climb over the top of the embankment and pause as he brushed dust from his thousanddollar suit she was however surprised to see him notice her and gesture her over a faint smile on his cleancut face it occurred to her she was about to receive a nod of gratitude for her cliffhanger routine saved the fingerprints on that ladder boys maybe even a commendation in the last hour of the last day of patrol going out in a blaze of glory he looked her up and down patrolwoman youre no rookie are you im safe in making that assumption im sorry sir youre not a rookie i assume she wasnt not technically though she had only three years service under her belt unlike most of the other patrol officers her age they had nine or ten years in sachs had foundered for a few years before attending the academy im not sure what youre asking he looked exasperated and the smile vanished you were first officer yessir whyd you close down eleventh avenue what were you thinking of she looked along the broad street which was still blocked by her trashcan barricade shed gotten used to the honking but realized now it was really quite loud the line of cars extended for miles sir the first officers job is to arrest a perp detain any witnesses protect i know the adapt rule officer you closed the street to protect the crime scene yessir i didnt think the perp would park on the cross street he could be seen too easily from those apartments see there eleventh seemed like a better choice well it was a wrong choice there were no footprints on that side of the tracks and two sets going to the ladder that leads up to thirtyseven i closed thirtyseven too thats my point thats all that needed to be closed and the train he asked whyd you stop that well sir i thought that a train going through the scene might disturb evidence or something or something officer i didnt express myself very well sir i meant what about newark airport yessir she looked around for help there were officers nearby but they were busily ignoring the dressingdown what exactly about newark why didnt you shut that down too oh wonderful a schoolmarm her julia roberts lips grew taut but she said reasonably sir in my judgment it seemed likely that the new york thruway wouldve been a good choice too and the jersey pike and long island expressway i all the way to st louis those are likely means of escape she lowered her head slightly and stared back at peretti the two of them were exactly the same height though his heels were higher ive gotten calls from the commissioner he continued the head of the port authority the un secretarygenerals office the head of that expo he nodded toward the javits center weve fucked up the conference schedule a us senators speech and traffic on the entire west side the train tracks were fifty feet from the vic and the street you closed was a good two hundred feet away and thirty above i mean even hurricane eva didnt fuck up amtraks northeast corridor like this i just thought peretti smiled because sachs was a beautiful woman her foundering before attending the academy had involved steady assignments for the chantelle modeling agency on madison avenue the cop chose to forgive her patrolwoman sachs he glanced at the name tag on her chest flattened chastely by the american body armor vest an object lesson crime scene work is a balance itd be nice if we could cordon off the whole city after every homicide and detain about three million people but we cant do that i say this constructively for your edification actually sir she said brusquely im transferring out of patrol effective as of noon today he nodded smiled cheerfully then enough said but for the record it was your decision to stop the train and close the street yessir it was she said smartly no mistake about that he jotted this into a black watchbook with slashing strokes of his sweaty pen oh please now remove those garbage cans you direct traffic until the streets clear again you hear me without a yessir or nosir or any other acknowledgment she wandered to eleventh avenue and slowly began removing the garbage cans every single driver who passed her scowled or muttered something sachs glanced at her watch an hour to go i can live with it two with a terse flutter of wings the peregrine dropped onto the window ledge the light outside midmorning was brilliant and the air looked fiercely hot there you are the man whispered then cocked his head at the sound of the buzzer of the door downstairs is that him he shouted toward the stairs is it lincoln rhyme heard nothing in response and turned back to the window the birds head swiveled a fast jerky movement that the falcon nevertheless made elegant rhyme observed that its talons were bloody a piece of yellow flesh dangled from the black nutshell beak it extended a short neck and eased to the nest in movements reminiscent not of a birds but a snakes the falcon dropped the meat into the upturned mouth of the fuzzy blue hatchling im looking rhyme thought at the only living creature in new york city with no predator except maybe god himself he heard the footsteps come up the stairs slowly was that him he asked thom the young man answered no who was it the doorbell rang didnt it thoms eyes went to the window the birds back look bloodstains on your windowsill can you see them the female falcon inched into view bluegray like a fish iridescent her head scanned the sky theyre always together do they mate for life thom wondered aloud like geese rhymes eyes returned to thom who was bent forward at his trim youthful waist gazing at the nest through the spattered window who was it rhyme repeated the young man was stalling now and it irritated rhyme a visitor a visitor ha rhyme snorted he tried to recall when his last visitor had been here it must have been three months ago whod it been that reporter maybe or some distant cousin well peter taylor one of rhymes spinal cord specialists and blaine had been here several times but she of course was not a visitor its freezing thom complained his reaction was to open the window immediate gratification youth dont open the window rhyme ordered and tell me who the hells here its freezing youll disturb the bird you can turn the air conditioner down ill turn it down we were here first thom said further lifting the huge pane of window the birds moved in with full knowledge of you the falcons glanced toward the noise glaring but then they always glared they remained on the ledge lording over their domain of anemic ginkgo trees and alternatesideofthestreet parkers rhyme repeated who is it lon sellitto lon what was he doing here thom examined the room the place is a mess rhyme didnt like the fuss of cleaning he didnt like the bustle the noise of the vacuum which he found particularly irritating he was content here as it was this room which he called his office was on the second floor of his gothic townhouse on the upper west side of the city overlooking central park the room was large twentybytwenty and virtually every one of those feet was occupied sometimes he closed his eyes playing a game and tried to detect the smell of the different objects in the room here the thousands of books and magazines the tower of pisa stacks of photocopies the hot transistors of the tv the dustfrosted lightbulbs the cork bulletin boards vinyl peroxide latex upholstery three different kinds of singlemalt scotch falcon shit i dont want to see him tell him im busy and a young cop ernie banks no he was a baseball player right you really should let me clean you never notice how filthy someplace is till people come to call come to call my that sounds quaint victorian how does this sound tell em to get the hell out hows that for findesiècle etiquette a mess thom was speaking of the room but rhyme supposed he meant his boss too rhymes hair was black and thick as a twentyyearolds though he was twice that age but the strands were wild and bushy desperately in need of a wash and cut his face sprouted a dirtylooking three days growth of black beard and hed wakened with an incessant tickle in his ear which meant that those hairs needed trimming as well rhymes nails were long finger and toe and hed been wearing the same clothes for a week polkadotted pajamas godawful ugly his eyes were narrow deep brown and set in a face that blaine had told him on a number of occasions passionate and otherwise was handsome they want to talk to you thom continued they say its very important well bully for them you havent seen lon for nearly a year why does that mean i want to see him now have you scared off the bird ill be pissed if you have its important lincoln very important i recall you saying wheres that doctor he mightve called i was dozing earlier and you were out youve been awake since six am no he paused i woke up yes but then i dozed off i was sound asleep did you check messages thom said yes nothing from him he said hed be here midmorning and its just past eleven maybe well hold off notifying airsea rescue what do you say have you been on the phone rhyme asked abruptly maybe he tried to call while you were on i was talking to did i say anything rhyme asked now youre angry i didnt say you shouldnt be making phone calls you can do that youve always been able to do that my point is just that he mightve called while you were on the line no your point this morning is to be a shit there you go you know they have this thing call waiting you can get two calls at once i wish we had that what does my old friend lon want and his friend the baseball player ask them im asking you they want to see you thats all i know about something vayree important lincoln thom sighed the goodlooking young man ran his hand through his blond hair he wore tan slacks and a white shirt with a blue floral tie immaculately knotted when hed hired thom a year ago rhyme had said he could wear jeans and tshirts if he wanted but hed been dressed impeccably every day since rhyme didnt know why it contributed to the decision to keep the young man on but it had none of thoms predecessors had lasted more than six weeks the number of those who quit was exactly equal to the firees all right what did you tell them i told them to give me a few minutes to make sure you were decent then they could come up briefly you did that without asking me thank you very much thom retreated a few steps and called down the narrow stairway to the first floor come on gentlemen they told you something didnt they rhyme said youre holding out on me thom didnt answer and rhyme watched the two men approach as they entered the room rhyme spoke first he said to thom close the curtain youve already upset the birds way too much which really meant only that hed had enough of the sputtering sunlight mute with the foul sticky tape on her mouth she couldnt speak a word and that made her feel more helpless than the metal handcuffs tight on her wrists than the grip of his short strong fingers on her biceps the taxi driver still in his ski mask led her down the grimy wet corridor past rows of ducts and piping they were in the basement of an office building she had no idea where if i could talk to him tj colfax was a player the bitch of morgan stanleys third floor a negotiator money you want money ill get you money lots of it boy bushels she thought this a dozen times trying to catch his eye as if she could actually force the words into his thoughts pleeeeeeeease she begged silently and began thinking about the mechanics of cashing in her k and giving him her retirement fund oh please she remembered last night the man turning back from the fireworks dragging them from the cab handcuffing them hed thrown them into the trunk and theyd begun driving again first over rough cobblestones and broken asphalt then smooth roads then rough again she heard the whir of wheels on a bridge more turns more rough roads finally the cab stopped and the driver got out and seemed to open a gate or some doors he drove into a garage she thought all the sounds of the city were cut off and the cars bubbling exhaust rose in volume reverberating off close walls then the cab trunk opened and the man pulled her out he yanked the diamond ring off her finger and pocketed it then he led her past walls of spooky faces faded paintings of blank eyes staring at her a butcher a devil three sorrowful children painted on the crumbling plaster dragged her down into a moldy basement and dumped her on the floor he clopped upstairs leaving her in the dark surrounded by a sickening smell rotting flesh garbage there shed lain for hours sleeping a little crying a lot shed wakened abruptly at a loud sound a sharp explosion nearby then more troubled sleep a half hour ago hed come for her again led her to the trunk and theyd driven for another twenty minutes here wherever here was they now walked into a dim basement room in the center was a thick black pipe he handcuffed her to it then gripped her feet and pulled them out straight in front of her propping her in a sitting position he crouched and tied her legs together with thin rope it took several minutes he was wearing leather gloves then he rose and gazed at her for a long moment bent down and tore her blouse open he walked around behind her and she gasped feeling his hands on her shoulders probing squeezing her shoulder blades crying pleading through the tape knowing what was coming the hands moved down along her arms and then under them and around the front of her body but he didnt touch her breasts no as the hands spidered across her skin they seemed to be searching for her ribs he prodded them and stroked tj shivered and tried to pull away he gripped her tight and caressed some more pressing hard feeling the give of the bone he stood she heard receding footsteps for a long moment there was silence except for the groans of air conditioners and elevators then she barked a frightened grunt at a sound right behind her a repetitive noise wsssh wsssh very familiar but something she couldnt place she tried to turn to see what he was doing but couldnt what was it listening to the rhythmic sound over and over and over it took her right back to her mothers house wsssh wsssh saturday morning in the small bungalow in bedford tennessee it was the only day her mother didnt work and she devoted most of it to housecleaning tj would wake up to a hot sun and stumble downstairs to help her wsssh as she cried at this memory she listened to the sound and wondered why on earth he was sweeping the floor and with such careful precise strokes of the broom he saw surprise and discomfort on their faces something you dont find very often with new york city homicide cops lon sellitto and young banks jerry not ernie sat where rhyme gestured with his bushcrowned head twin dusty uncomfortable rattan chairs rhyme had changed considerably since sellitto had last been here and the detective didnt hide his shock very well banks had no benchmark against which to judge what he was seeing but he was shocked nonetheless the sloppy room the vagrant gazing at them suspiciously the smell too certainly the visceral aroma surrounding the creature lincoln rhyme now was he immensely regretted letting them up why didnt you call first lon you wouldve told us not to come true thom crested the stairs and rhyme preempted him no thom we wont be needing you hed remembered that the young man always asked guests if they wanted something to drink or eat such a goddamn martha stewart silence for a moment large rumpled sellitto a twentyyear vet glanced down into a box beside the bed and started to speak whatever hed been about to say was cut off by the sight of disposable adult diapers jerry banks said i read your book sir the young cop had a bad hand when it came to shaving lots of nicks and what a charming cowlick in his hair my good lord he cant be more than twelve the more worn the world gets rhyme reflected the younger its inhabitants seem to be which one well your crime scene manual of course but i meant the picture book the one a couple years ago there were words too it was mostly words in fact did you read them oh well sure banks said quickly a huge stack of remaindered volumes of the scenes of the crime sat against one wall of his room i didnt know you and lon were friends banks added ah lon didnt trot out the yearbook show you the pictures strip his sleeve and show his scars and say these wounds i had with lincoln rhyme sellitto wasnt smiling well i can give him even less to smile about if he likes the senior detective was digging through his attaché case and what does he have in there how long were you partnered banks asked making conversation theres a verb for you rhyme said and looked at the clock we werent partners sellitto said i was homicide he was head of ird oh banks said even more impressed running the central investigation and resource division was one of the most prestigious jobs in the department yeah rhyme said looking out the window as if his doctor might be arriving via falcon the two musketeers in a patient voice which infuriated rhyme sellitto said seven years off and on we worked together and good years they were rhyme intoned thom scowled but sellitto missed the irony or more likely ignored it he said we have a problem lincoln we need some help snap the stack of papers landed on the bedside table some help the laugh exploded from the narrow nose elaine had always suspected was the product of a surgeons vision though it was not she also thought his lips were too perfect add a scar shed once joked and during one of their fights she nearly had and why he wondered does her voluptuous apparition keep rising today hed wakened thinking about his ex and had felt compelled to write her a letter which was on the computer screen at that moment he now saved the document on the disk silence filled the room as he entered the commands with a single finger lincoln sellitto asked yessir some help from me i heard banks kept an inappropriate smile on his face while he shuffled his butt uneasily in the chair ive got an appointment in well any minute now rhyme said an appointment a doctor really banks asked probably to murder the silence that loomed again sellitto not sure where the conversation was going asked and howve you been banks and sellitto hadnt asked about his health when theyd arrived it was a question people tended to avoid when they saw lincoln rhyme the answer risked being a very complicated and almost certainly an unpleasant one he said simply ive been fine thanks and you betty were divorced sellitto said quickly really she got the house and i got half a kid the chunky cop said this with forced cheer as if hed used the line before and rhyme supposed there was a painful story behind the breakup one he had no desire to hear still he wasnt surprised that the marriage had tanked sellitto was a workhorse he was one of the hundred or so firstgrade detectives on the force and had been for years he got the grade when they were handed out for merit not just time served hed worked close to eighty hours a week rhyme hadnt even known he was married for the first few months theyd worked together where you living now rhyme asked hoping a nice social conversation would tucker them out and send them on their way brooklyn the heights i walk to work sometimes you know those diets i was always on the tricks not dieting its exercise he didnt look any fatter or thinner than the lon sellitto of three and a half years ago or the sellitto of fifteen years ago for that matter so collegiate banks said a doctor you were saying for a a new form of treatment rhyme finished the dwindling question exactly good luck thank you so much it was am well past midmorning tardiness is inexcusable in a man of medicine he watched bankss eyes twice scan his legs he caught the pimply boy a second time and wasnt surprised to see the detective blush so rhyme said im afraid i dont really have time to help you but hes not here yet right the doctor asked lon sellitto in the same bulletproof tone hed used to puncture homicide suspects cover stories thom appeared at the doorway with a coffeepot prick rhyme mouthed lincoln forgot to offer you gentlemen something thom treats me like a child if the bootie fits the aide retorted all right rhyme snapped have some coffee ill have some mothers milk too early thom said the bar isnt open and weathered rhymes glowering face quite well again bankss eyes browsed rhymes body maybe hed been expecting just skin and bones but the atrophying had stopped not long after the accident and his first physical therapists had exhausted him with exercise thom too who may have been a prick at times and an old mother hen at others was a damn good pt he put rhyme through passive rom exercises every day taking meticulous notes on the goniometry measurements of the range of motion that he applied to each joint in rhymes body carefully checking the spasticity as he kept the arms and legs in a constant cycle of abduction and adduction rom work wasnt a miracle but it built up some tone cut down on debilitating contractures and kept the blood flowing for someone whose muscular activities had been limited to his shoulders head and left ring finger for three and a half years lincoln rhyme wasnt in such bad shape the young detective looked away from the complicated black ecu control sitting by rhymes finger hardwired to another controller sprouting conduit and cables which ran to the computer and a wall panel a quads life is wires a therapist had told rhyme a long time ago the rich ones at least the lucky ones sellitto said there was a murder early this morning on the west side weve had reports of some homeless men and women disappearing over the past month banks said at first we thought it might be one of them but it wasnt he added dramatically the vic was one of those people last night rhyme trained a blank expression on the young man with the dotted face those people he doesnt watch the news thom said if youre talking about the kidnapping he hasnt heard you dont watch the news sellitto laughed youre the sob read four papers a day and recorded the local news to watch when he got home blaine told me you called her katie couric one night when you were making love i only read literature now rhyme said pompously and falsely thom added literature is news that stays news rhyme ignored him sellitto said man and woman coming back from business on the coast got into a yellow cab at jfk never made it home there was a report about eleventhirty this cab was driving down the bqe in queens white male and female passenger in the back seat looked like they were trying to break a window out pounding on the glass nobody got tags or medallion this witness who saw the cab any look at the driver no the woman passenger no sign of her eleven fortyone rhyme was furious with dr william berger nasty business he muttered absently sellitto exhaled long and loud go on go on rhyme said he was wearing her ring banks said who was wearing what the vic they found this morning he was wearing the womans ring the other passengers youre sure it was hers had her initials inside so youve got an unsub rhyme continued who wants you to know hes got the woman and shes still alive whats an unsub thom asked when rhyme ignored him sellitto said unknown subject but you know how he got it to fit banks asked a little wideeyed for rhymes taste her ring i give up cut the skin off the guys finger all of it down to the bone rhyme gave a faint smile ah hes a smart one isnt he whys that smart to make sure nobody came by and took the ring it was bloody right a mess hard to see the ring in the first place then aids hepatitis even if somebody noticed a lot of folksd take a pass on that trophy whats her name lon the older detective nodded to his partner who flipped open his watchbook tammie jean colfax she goes by tj twentyeight works for morgan stanley rhyme observed that banks too wore a ring a school ring of some sort the boy was too polished to be just a highschool and academy grad no whiff of army about him wouldnt be surprised if the jewelry bore the name yale a homicide detective what was the world coming to the young cop cupped his coffee in hands that shook sporadically with a minuscule gesture of his own ring finger on the everest jennings ecu panel to which his left hand was strapped rhyme clicked through several settings turning the ac down he tended not to waste controls on things like heating and airconditioning he reserved it for necessities like lights the computer and his pageturning frame but when the room got too cold his nose ran and thats fucking torture for a quad no ransom note rhyme asked nothing youre the case officer rhyme asked sellitto under jim polling yeah and we want you to review the cs report another laugh me i havent looked at a crime scene report in three years what could i possibly tell you you could tell us tons linc whos head of ird now vince peretti the congressmans boy rhyme recalled have him review it a moments hesitation wed rather have you whos we the chief yours truly and how rhyme asked smiling like a schoolgirl does captain peretti feel about this vote of no confidence sellitto stood and paced through the room glancing down at the stacks of magazines forensic science review harding boyle scientific equipment company catalog the new scotland yard forensic investigation annual american college of forensic examiners journal report of the american society of crime lab directors crc press forensics journal of the international institute of forensic science look at them rhyme said the subscriptions lapsed ages ago and theyre all dusty everything in heres fucking dusty linc why dont you get off your lazy ass and clean this pigsty up banks looked horrified rhyme squelched the burst of laughter that felt alien inside him his guard had slipped and irritation had dissolved into amusement he momentarily regretted that he and sellitto had drifted apart then he shot the feeling dead he grumbled i cant help you sorry weve got the peace conference starting on monday we what conference at the un ambassadors heads of state therell be ten thousand dignitaries in town you heard about that thing in london two days ago thing rhyme repeated caustically somebody tried to bomb the hotel where unesco was meeting the mayors scared shitless somebodys going to move on the conference here he doesnt want ugly post headlines theres also the little problem rhyme said astringently that miss tammie jean might not be enjoying her trip home either jerry tell him some details whet his appetite banks turned his attention from rhymes legs to his bed which was rhyme readily admitted by far the more interesting of the two especially the control panel it looked like something off the space shuttle and cost just about as much ten hours after theyre snatched we find the male passenger john ulbrecht shot and buried alive in the amtrak roadbed near thirtyseventh and eleventh well we find him dead hed been buried alive bullet was a banks looked up and added the honda accord of slugs meaning thered be no wily deductions about the unsub from exotic weaponry this banks seems smart rhyme thought and all he suffers from is youth which he might or might not outgrow lincoln rhyme believed he himself had never been young rifling on the slug rhyme asked six lands and grooves left twist so hes got himself a colt rhyme said and glanced over the crime scene diagram again you said he the young detective continued actually its they what unsubs therere two of them there were two sets of footprints between the grave and the base of an iron ladder leading up to the street banks said pointing to the cs diagram any prints on the ladder none it was wiped did a good job of it the footprints go to the grave and back to the ladder anyway there had to be two of em to schlepp the vic he weighed over two hundred pounds one man couldntve done it keep going they got him to the grave dropped him in shot him and buried him went back to the ladder climbed it and vanished shot him in the grave rhyme inquired yep there was no blood trail anywhere around the ladder or the path to the grave rhyme found himself mildly interested but he said what do you need me for sellitto grinned ragged yellow teeth we got ourselves a mystery linc a buncha pe that doesnt make any fucking sense at all so it was a rare crime scene when every bit of physical evidence made sense naw this is real weird read the report please ill put it here hows this thing work sellitto looked at thom who fitted the report in the pageturning frame i dont have time lon rhyme protested thats quite a contraption banks offered looking at the frame rhyme didnt respond he glanced at the first page then read it carefully moved his ring finger a precise millimeter to the left a rubber wand turned the page reading thinking well this is odd who was in charge of the scene peretti himself when he heard the vic was one of the taxi people he came down and took over rhyme continued to read for a minute the unimaginative words of cop writing held his interest then the doorbell rang and his heart galloped with a great shudder his eyes slipped to thom they were cold and made clear that the time for banter was over thom nodded and went downstairs immediately all thoughts of cabdrivers and pe and kidnapped bankers vanished from the sweeping mind of lincoln rhyme its dr berger thom announced over the intercom at last at long last well im sorry lon ill have to ask you to leave it was good seeing you again a smile interesting case this one is sellitto hesitated then rose but will you read through the report lincoln tell us what you think rhyme said you bet then leaned his head back against the pillow quads like rhyme who had full headandneck movement could activate a dozen controls just by threedimensional movements of the head but rhyme shunned headrests there were so few sensuous pleasures left to him that he was unwilling to abdicate the comfort of nestling his head against his twohundreddollar down pillow the visitors had tired him out not even noon and all he wanted to do was sleep his neck muscles throbbed in agony when sellitto and banks were at the door rhyme said lon wait the detective turned one thing you should know youve only found half the crime scene the important one is the other one the primary scene his house thats where hell be and itll be hard as hell to find why do you think theres another scene because he didnt shoot the vic at the grave he shot him there at the primary scene and thats probably where hes got the woman itll be underground or in a very deserted part of the city or both because banks rhyme preempted the young detectives question he wouldnt risk shooting someone and holding a captive there unless it was quiet and private maybe he used a silencer no traces of rubber or cotton baffling on the slug rhyme snapped but how could the manve been shot there banks countered i mean there wasnt any blood spatter at the scene i assume the victim was shot in the face rhyme announced well yes banks answered putting a stupid smile on his own howd you know very painful very incapacitating very little blood with a rarely lethal if you miss the brain with the vic in that shape the unsub could lead him around wherever he wanted i say unsub singular because theres only one of them a pause but there were two sets of prints banks nearly whispered as if he were defusing a land mine rhyme sighed the solesre identical they were left by the same man making the trip twice to fool us and the prints going north are the same depth as the prints going south so he wasnt carrying a twohundredpound load one way and not the other was the vic barefoot banks flipped through his notes socks okay then the perp was wearing the vics shoes for his clever little stroll to the ladder and back if he didnt come down the ladder how did he get to the grave he led the man along the train tracks themselves probably from the north therere no other ladders to the roadbed for blocks in either direction but there are tunnels running parallel to the tracks rhyme continued they hook up with the basements of some of the old warehouses along eleventh avenue a gangster during prohibition owney madden had them dug so he could slip shipments of bootleg whisky onto new york central trains going up to albany and bridgeport but why not just bury the vic near the tunnel why risk being seen schlepping the guy all the way to the overpass impatient now you do get what hes telling us dont you banks started to speak then shook his head he had to put the body where itd be seen rhyme said he needed someone to find it thats why he left the hand in the air hes waving at us to get our attention sorry you may have only one unsub but hes plenty smart enough for two theres an access door to a tunnel somewhere nearby get down there and dust it for prints there wont be any but youll have to do it just the same the press you know when the story starts coming out well good luck gentlemen now youll have to excuse me lon yes dont forget about the primary crime scene whatever happens youll have to find it and fast thanks linc just read the report rhyme said of course he would and observed that they believed the lie completely three he had the best bedside manner rhyme had ever encountered and if anyone had had experience with bedside manners it was lincoln rhyme hed once calculated hed seen seventyeight degreed cardcarrying doctors in the past three and a half years nice view berger said gazing out the window isnt it beautiful though because of the height of the bed rhyme could see nothing except a hazy sky sizzling over central park that and the birds had been the essence of his view since hed moved here from his last rehab hospital two and half years ago he kept the shades drawn most of the time thom was busy rolling his boss the maneuver helped keep his lungs clear and then catheterizing rhymes bladder which had to be done every five or six hours after spinal cord trauma sphincters can be stuck open or they can be stuck closed rhyme was fortunate that his got jammed closed fortunate that is provided someone was around to open up the uncooperative little tube with a catheter and ky jelly four times a day dr berger observed this procedure clinically and rhyme paid no heed to the lack of privacy one of the first things crips get over is modesty while theres sometimes a halfhearted effort at draping shrouding the body when cleaning evacuating and examining serious crips real crips macho crips dont care at rhymes first rehab center after a patient had gone to a party or been on a date the night before all the wardmates would wheel over to his bed to check the patients urine output which was the barometer of how successful the outing had been one time rhyme earned his fellow crips undying admiration by registering a staggering ccs he said to berger check out the ledge doctor i have my own guardian angels well hawks peregrine falcons usually they nest higher i dont know why they picked me to live with berger glanced at the birds then turned away from the window let the curtain fall back the aviary didnt interest him he wasnt a large man but he looked fit a runner rhyme guessed he seemed to be in his late forties but the black hair didnt have a trace of gray in it and he was as goodlooking as any news anchor thats quite a bed you like it the bed was a clinitron a huge rectangular slab it was an airfluidized support bed and contained nearly a ton of siliconecoated glass beads pressurized air flowed through the beads which supported rhymes body if he had been able to feel it would have felt as if he was floating berger was sipping the coffee that rhyme had ordered thom to fetch and that the young man had brought rolling his eyes whispering arent we suddenly social before retreating the doctor asked rhyme you were a policeman you were telling me yes i was head of forensics for the nypd were you shot nope searching a crime scene some workmend found a body at a subwaystop construction site it was a young patrolman whod disappeared six months before we had a serial killer shooting cops i got a request to work the case personally and when i was searching it a beam collapsed i was buried for about four hours someone was actually going around murdering policemen killed three and wounded another one the perp was a cop himself dan shepherd a sergeant working patrol berger glanced at the pink scar on rhymes neck the telltale insignia of quadriplegia the entrance wound for the ventilator tube that remains embedded in the throat for months after the accident sometimes for years sometimes forever but rhyme had thanks to his own mulish nature and his therapists herculean efforts weaned himself off the ventilator he now had a pair of lungs on him that he bet could keep him underwater for five minutes so a cervical trauma c ah yes c is the demilitarized zone of spinal cord injuries an sci above the fourth cervical vertebra might very well have killed him below c he would have regained some use of his arms and hands if not his legs but trauma to the infamous fourth kept him alive though virtually a total quadriplegic hed lost the use of his legs and arms his abdominal and intercostal muscles were mostly gone and he was breathing primarily from his diaphragm he could move his head and neck his shoulders slightly the only fluke was that the crushing oak beam had spared a single minuscule strand of motor neuron which allowed him to move his left ring finger rhyme spared the doctor the soap opera of the year following the accident the month of skull traction tongs gripping holes drilled into his head and pulling his spine straight twelve weeks of the halo device the plastic bib and steel scaffolding around his head to keep the neck immobile to keep his lungs pumping a large ventilator for a year then a phrenic nerve stimulator the catheters the surgery the paralytic ileus the stress ulcers hypotension and bradycardia bedsores turning into decubitus ulcers contractures as the muscle tissue began to shrink and threatened to steal away the precious mobility of his finger the infuriating phantom pain burns and aches in extremities that could feel no sensation he did however tell berger about the latest wrinkle autonomic dysreflexia the problem had been occurring more often recently pounding heartbeat offthecharts blood pressure raging headaches it could be brought on by something as simple as constipation he explained that nothing could be done to prevent it except avoiding stress and physical constriction rhymes sci specialist dr peter taylor had become concerned with the frequency of the attacks the last one a month ago was so severe that taylor d given thom instructions in how to treat the condition without waiting for medical help and insisted that the aide program the doctors number into the phones speed dialer taylor had warned that a severe enough bout could lead to a heart attack or stroke berger took in the facts with some sympathy then said before i got into my present line i specialized in geriatric orthopedics mostly hip and joint replacements i dont know much neurology what about chances for recovery none the conditions permanent rhyme said perhaps a little too quickly he added you understand my problem dont you doctor i think so but id like to hear it in your words shaking his head to clear a renegade strand of hair rhyme said everyone has the right to kill himself berger said i think id disagree with that in most societies you may have the power but not the right theres a difference rhyme exhaled a bitter laugh im not much of a philosopher but i dont even have the power thats why i need you lincoln rhyme had asked four doctors to kill him theyd all refused hed said okay hed do it himself and simply stopped eating but the process of wasting himself to death became pure torture it left him violently stomachsick and racked with unbearable headaches he couldnt sleep so hed given up on that and during the course of a hugely awkward conversation asked thom to kill him the young man had grown tearful the only time hed shown that much emotion and said he wished he could hed sit by and watch rhyme die hed refuse to revive him but he wouldnt actually kill him then a miracle if you could call it that after the scenes of the crime had come out reporters had appeared to interview him one article in the new york times contained this stark quotation from author rhyme no im not planning any more books the fact is my next big project is killing myself its quite a challenge ive been looking for someone to help me for the past six months that screechingstop line got the attention of the nypd counseling service and several people from rhymes past most notably blaine who told him he was nuts to consider it he had to quit thinking only about himself just like when theyd been together and now that she was here she thought she should mention that she was remarrying the quotation also caught the attention of william berger whod called unexpectedly one night from seattle after a few moments of pleasant conversation berger explained that hed read the article about rhyme then a hollow pause and hed asked ever hear of the lethe society rhyme had it was a proeuthanasia group hed been trying to track down for months it was far more aggressive than safe passage or the hemlock society our volunteers are wanted for questioning in dozens of assisted suicides throughout the country berger explained we have to keep a low profile he said he wanted to follow up on rhymes request berger refused to act quickly and theyd had several conversations over the past seven or eight months today was their first meeting theres no way you can pass by yourself pass short of gene harrods approach no and even thats a little iffy harrod was young man in boston a quad who decided he wanted to kill himself unable to find anyone to help him he finally committed suicide the only way he was able to with the little control he had he set a fire in his apartment and when it was blazing drove his wheelchair into it setting himself aflame he died of thirddegree burns the case was often raised by righttodeathers as an example of the tragedy that antieuthanasia laws can cause berger was familiar with the case and shook his head sympathetically no thats no way for anyone to die he assayed rhymes body the wires the control panels what are your mechanical skills rhyme explained about the ecus the e j controller that his ring finger operated the sipandpuff control for his mouth the chin joysticks and the computer dictation unit that could type out words on the screen as he spoke them but everything has to be set up by someone else berger asked for instance someone would have to go to the store buy a gun mount it rig the trigger and hook it up to your controller yes making that person guilty of a conspiracy to commit murder as well as manslaughter what about your equipment rhyme asked its effective equipment what you use to uhm do the deed its very effective ive never had a patient complain rhyme blinked and berger laughed rhyme joined him if you cant laugh about death what can you laugh about take a look you have it with you hope blossomed in rhymes heart it was the first time hed felt that warm sensation in years the doctor opened his attaché case and rather ceremonially rhyme thought set out a bottle of brandy a small bottle of pills a plastic bag and a rubber band whats the drug seconal nobody prescribes it anymore in the old days suicide was a lot easier these babiesd do the trick no question now its almost impossible to kill yourself with modern tranquilizers halcion librium dalmane xanax you may sleep for a long time but youre going to wake up eventually and the bag ah the bag berger picked it up thats the emblem of the lethe society unofficially of course its not like we have a logo if the pills and the brandy arent enough then we use the bag over the head with a rubber band around the neck we add a little ice inside because it gets pretty hot after a few minutes rhyme couldnt take his eyes off the trio of implements the bag thick plastic like a painters drop cloth the brandy was cheap he observed and the drugs generic thiss a nice house berger said looking around central park west do you live on disability some ive also done consulting for the police and the fbi after the accident the construction company that was doing the excavating settled for three million they swore there was no liability but theres apparently a rule of law that a quadriplegic automatically wins any lawsuits against construction companies no matter who was at fault at least if the plaintiff comes to court and drools and you wrote that book right i get some money from that not a lot it was a betterseller not a bestseller berger picked up a copy of the scenes of the crime flipped through it famous crime scenes look at all this he laughed there are what forty fifty scenes fiftyone rhyme had revisited in his mind and imagination since hed written it after the accident as many old crime scenes in new york city as he could recall some solved some not hed written about the old brewery the notorious tenement in five points where thirteen unrelated murders were recorded on a single night in about charles aubridge deacon who murdered his mother on july during the civil war draft riots claiming former slaves had killed her and fueling the rampage against blacks about architect stanford whites lovetriangle murder atop the original madison square garden and about judge craters disappearance about george metesky the mad bomber of the s and murph the surf who boosted the star of india diamond nineteenthcentury building supplies underground streams butlers schools berger recited flipping through the book gay baths chinatown whorehouses russian orthodox churches how dyou learn all this about the city rhyme shrugged in his years as head of ird hed studied as much about the city as he had about forensics its history politics geology sociology infrastructure he said criminalistics doesnt exist in a vacuum the more you know about your environment the better you can apply just as he heard the enthusiasm creep into his voice he stopped abruptly furious with himself that hed been foxed so easily nice try dr berger rhyme said stiffly ah come on call me bill please rhyme wasnt going to be derailed ive heard it before take a big clean smooth piece of paper and write down all the reasons why i should kill myself and then take another big clean smooth piece of paper and write all the reasons why i shouldnt words like productive useful interesting challenging come to mind big words tendollar words they dont mean shit to me besides i couldnt pick up a fucking pencil to save my soul lincoln berger continued kindly i have to make sure youre the appropriate candidate for the program candidate program ah the tyranny of euphemism rhyme said bitterly doctor ive made up my mind id like to do it today now as a matter of fact why today rhymes eyes had returned to the bottles and the bag he whispered why not whats today august twentythird thats as good a day to die as any the doctor tapped his narrow lips i have to spend some time talking to you lincoln if im convinced that you really want to go ahead i do rhyme said noting as he often did how weak our words sound without the body gestures to accompany them he wanted desperately to lay his hand on bergers arm or lift his palms beseechingly without asking if he could berger pulled out a packet of marlboros and lit a cigarette he took a folding metal ashtray from his pocket and opened it up crossed his thin legs he looked like a foppish frat boy at an ivy league smoker lincoln you understand the problem here dont you sure he understood it was the very reason why berger was here and why one of rhymes own doctors hadnt done the deed hastening an inevitable death was one thing nearly onethird of practicing doctors who treated terminal patients had prescribed or administered fatal doses of drugs most prosecutors turned a blind eye toward them unless a doctor flaunted it like kevorkian but a quad a hemi a para a crip oh that was different lincoln rhyme was forty years old hed been weaned off the ventilator barring some insidious gene in the rhyme stock there was no medical reason why he couldnt live to eighty berger added let me be blunt lincoln i also have to be sure this isnt a setup setup prosecutors ive been entrapped before rhyme laughed the new york attorney generals a busy man hes not going to wire a crip to bag himself a euthanasist glancing absently at the crime scene report ten feet southwest of victim found in a cluster on a small pile of white sand a ball of fiber approximately six centimeters in diameter offwhite in color the fiber was sampled in the energydispersive xray unit and found to consist of absi alooh no source was indicated and the fibers could not be individuated sample sent to fbi pert office for analysis i just have to be careful berger continued this is my whole professional life now i gave up orthopedics completely anyway its more than a job ive decided to devote my life to helping others end theirs adjacent to this fiber approximately three inches away were found two scraps of paper one was common newsprint with the words three pm printed in times roman type in ink consistent with that used in commercial newspapers the other scrap appeared to be the corner of a page from a book with the page number printed on it the typeface was garamond and the paper was calendared als and subsequent ninhydrin analysis reveal no latent frictionridge prints on either individuation was not possible several things nagged rhyme the fiber for one why hadnt peretti caught on as to what it was it was so obvious and why was this pe the newspaper scraps and the fiber all clustered together something was wrong here lincoln sorry i was saying youre not a burn victim in unbearable pain youre not homeless youve got money youve got talent your police consulting that helps a lot of people if you want one you could have a yes productive life ahead of you a long life long yes thats the problem a long life he was tired of being on good behavior he snapped but i dont want a long life its as simple as that berger said slowly if theres the slightest chance you mightve regretted your decision well see im the one whod have to live with it not you whos ever certain about something like this eyes slipping back to the report an iron bolt was found on top of the scraps of paper it was a hex bolt headstamped with the letters ce two inches long clockwise twist in diameter ive got a busy schedule for the next few days berger said looking at his watch it was a rolex well death has always been lucrative lets take an hour or so now talk for a while then have a coolingoff day and ill come back something was nagging at rhyme an infuriating itch the curse of all quads though in this case it was an intellectual itch the kind that had plagued rhyme all his life say doctor i wonder if you could do me a favor that report there could you flip through it see if you could find a picture of a bolt berger hesitated a picture a polaroid itll be glued in somewhere toward the back the turning frame takes too long berger lifted the report out of the frame and turned the pages for rhyme there stop as he gazed at the photo a twinge of urgency pricked at him oh not here not now please no im sorry could you flip back to the page where we were berger did rhyme said nothing and read carefully the paper scraps three pm page rhymes heart was pounding sweat popped out on his head he heard a frantic buzzing in his ears heres a headline for the tabloids man dies during talk with death doc berger blinked lincoln are you all right the mans canny eyes examined rhyme carefully as casually as he could rhyme said you know doctor im sorry but theres something ive got to take care of berger nodded slowly uncertainly affairs arent in order after all smiling nonchalant im just wondering if i could ask you to come back in a few hours careful here if he senses purpose hell mark you down nonsuicidal take his bottles and his plastic bag and fly back to starbucks land opening a date book berger said the rest of the day isnt good then tomorrow no im afraid mondays the earliest day after tomorrow rhyme hesitated lord his souls desire was finally within his grasp what hed dreamed of every day for the past year yes or no decide finally rhyme heard himself say all right monday plastering a hopeless smile on his face what exactlys the problem a man i used to work with he asked for some advice i wasnt paying as much attention to it as i should have i have to call him no it wasnt dysreflexia at all or an anxiety attack lincoln rhyme was feeling something he hadnt felt in years he was in one big fucking hurry could i ask you to send thom up here i think hes downstairs in the kitchen yes of course id be happy to rhyme could see something odd in bergers eyes what was it caution maybe it almost seemed like disappointment but there was no time to think about it now as the doctors footsteps receded down the stairs rhyme shouted in a booming baritone thom thom what the young mans voice called call lon get him back here now rhyme glanced at the clock it was after noon they had less than three hours four the crime scene was staged lincoln rhyme said lon sellitto had tossed his jacket off revealing a savagely wrinkled shirt he now leaned back arms crossed against a table strewn with papers and books jerry banks was back too and his paleblue eyes were on rhymes the bed and its control panel no longer interested him sellitto frowned but what storys the unsub tryin to sell us at crime scenes especially homicides perps often monkeyed with pe to lead investigators astray some were clever about it but most werent like the husband who beat his wife to death then tried to make it look like a robbery though he only thought to steal her jewelry leaving his gold bracelets and diamond pinkie ring on his dresser thats whats so interesting rhyme continued its not about what happened lon its whats going to happen sellitto the skeptic asked what makes you think so the scraps of paper they mean three oclock today today look nodding toward the report an impatient jerk of his head that one scrap says three pm banks pointed out but the others a page number why do you think it means today its not a page number rhyme lifted an eyebrow they still didnt get it logic the only reason to leave clues was to tell us something if thats the case then has to be something more than just a page number because theres no clue as to what book its from well if its not a page number what is it silence exasperated rhyme snapped its a date eight twentythree august twentythird somethings going to happen at three pm today now the ball of fiber its asbestos asbestos sellitto asked in the report the formula its hornblende silicon dioxide that is asbestos why peretti sent it to the fbi is beyond me so we have asbestos on a railbed where there shouldnt be any and weve got an iron bolt with decaying oxidation on the head but none on the threads that means its been bolted someplace for a long time and just recently removed maybe it was overturned in the dirt banks offered when he was digging the grave rhyme said no in midtown the bedrocks close to the surface which means so are the aquifers all the soil from thirtyfourth street up to harlem contains enough moisture to oxidize iron within a few days itd be completely rusted not just the head if itd been buried no it was unbolted from someplace carried to the scene and left there and that sand come on whats white sand doing on a train roadbed in midtown manhattan the soil composition there is loam silt granite hardpan and soft clay banks started to speak but rhyme cut him off abruptly and what were these things doing all clustered together oh hes telling us something our unsub you bet he is banks what about the access door you were right the young man said they found one about a hundred feet north of the grave broken open from the inside you were also right about the prints zip and no tire tracks or trace evidence either a lock of dirty asbestos a bolt a torn newspaper the scene rhyme asked intact released lincoln rhyme the crip with the killer lungs exhaled a loud hiss of air disgusted who made that mistake i dont know sellitto said lamely watch commander probably it was peretti rhyme understood then youre stuck with what youve got whatever clues as to who the kidnapper was and what he had in mind were either in the report or gone forever trampled under the feet of cops and spectators and railroad workers spadework canvassing the neighborhood around the scene interviewing witnesses cultivating leads traditional detective work was done leisurely but crime scenes themselves had to be worked like mad lightning rhyme would command his officers in ird and hed fired more than a few csu techs who hadnt moved fast enough for his taste peretti ran the scene himself he asked peretti and a full complement full complement rhyme asked wryly whats a full complement sellitto looked at banks who said four techs from photo four from latents eight searchers me tour doctor eight crime scene searchers theres a bell curve in processing a crime scene two officers are considered the most efficient for a single homicide by yourself you can miss things three and up you tend to miss more things lincoln rhyme had always searched scenes alone he let the latents people do the print work and photo do the snapshooting and videoing but he always walked the grid by himself peretti rhyme had hired the young man son of a wealthy politico six seven years ago and hed proved a good bythebook cs detective crime scene is considered a plum and theres always a long waiting list to get into the unit rhyme took perverse pleasure in thinning the ranks of applicants by offering them a look at the family album a collection of particularly gruesome crimescene photos some officers would blanch some would snicker some handed the book back eyebrows raised as if asking so what and those were the ones that lincoln rhyme would hire perettid been one of them sellitto had asked a question rhyme found the detective looking at him he repeated youll work with us on this wont you lincoln work with you he coughed a laugh i cant lon no im just spitting out a few ideas for you youve got it run with it thom get me berger he was now regretting the decision to postpone his têteàtête with the death doctor maybe it wasnt too late he couldnt bear the thought of waiting another day or two for his passing and monday he didnt want to die on monday it seemed common say please thom all right the young aide said hands raised in surrender rhyme glanced at the spot on his bedside table where the bottle the pills and the plastic bag had sat so very close but like everything else in this life wholly out of lincoln rhymes reach sellitto made a phone call cocked his head as the call was answered he identified himself the clock on the wall clicked to twelvethirty yessir the detectives voice sank into a respectful whisper the mayor rhyme guessed about the kidnapping at kennedy ive been talking to lincoln rhyme yessir he has some thoughts on it the detective wandered to the window staring blankly at the falcon and trying to explain the inexplicable to the man running the most mysterious city on earth he hung up and turned to rhyme he and the chief both want you linc they asked specifically wilson himself rhyme laughed lon look around the room look at me does it seem like i could run a case not a normal case no but this isnt a very normal one now is it im sorry i just dont have time that doctor the treatment thom did you call him havent yet will in just a minute now do it now thom looked at sellitto walked to the door stepped outside rhyme knew he wasnt going to call bugger the world banks touched a dot of razor scar and blurted just give us some thoughts please this unsub you said he sellitto waved him silent he kept his eyes on rhyme oh you prick rhyme thought the old silence how we hate it and hurry to fill it how many witnesses and suspects had caved under hot thick silences just like this well he and sellitto had been a good team rhyme knew evidence and lon sellitto knew people the two musketeers and if there was a third it was the purity of unsmiling science the detectives eyes dipped to the crime scene report lincoln what do you thinks going to happen today at three i dont have any idea rhyme pronounced dontcha cheap lon ill get you for that finally rhyme said hes going to kill her the woman in the taxi and in some real bad way i guarantee you something thatll rival getting buried alive jesus thom whispered from the doorway why couldnt they just leave him alone would it do any good to tell them about the agony he felt in his neck and shoulders or about the phantom pain far weaker and far eerier roaming through his alien body about the exhaustion he felt from the daily struggle to do well everything about the most overwhelming fatigue of all from having to rely on someone else maybe he could tell them about the mosquito thatd gotten into the room last night and strafed his head for an hour rhyme grew dizzy with fatigue nodding it away until the insect finally landed on his ear where rhyme let it stab him since that was a place he could rub against the pillow for relief from the itch sellitto lifted an eyebrow today rhyme sighed one day thats it thanks linc we owe you sellitto pulled up a chair next to the bed nodded banks to do the same now gimme your thoughts whats this assholes game rhyme said not so fast i dont work alone fair enough who dyou want on board a tech from ird whoevers the best in the lab i want him here with the basic equipment and we better get some tactical boys emergency services oh and i want some phones rhyme instructed glancing at the scotch on his dresser he remembered the brandy berger had in his kit no way was he going out on cheap crap like that his final exit number would be courtesy of either sixteenyearold lagavulin or opulent macallan aged for decades or why not both banks pulled out his own cellular phone what kind of lines just landlines in here of course not rhyme barked sellitto said he means he wants people to make calls from the big building oh call downtown sellitto ordered have em give us three or four dispatchers lon rhyme asked whos doing the spadework on the death this morning banks stifled a laugh the hardy boys a glare from rhyme took the smile off his face detectives bedding and saul sir the boy added quickly but then sellitto grinned too the hardy boys everybody calls em that you dont know em linc theyre from the homicide task force downtown they look kind of alike is the thing banks explained and well their delivery is a little funny i dont want comedians no theyre good sellitto said the best canvassers we got you know that beast napped that eightyearold girl in queens last year bedding and saul did the canvass interviewed the entire hood took twentytwo hundred statements it was causa them we saved her when we heard the vic this morning was the passenger from jfk chief wilson himself put em on board whatre they doing now witnesses mostly around the train tracks and sniffing around about the driver and the cab rhyme yelled to thom in the hallway did you call berger no of course you didnt the word insubordination mean anything to you at least make yourself useful bring that crime scene report closer and start turning the pages he nodded toward the turning frame that damn things an edsel arent we in a sunny mood today the aide spat back hold it up higher im getting glare he read for a minute then looked up sellitto was on the phone but rhyme interrupted him whatever happens at three today if we can find where hes talking about its going to be a crime scene ill need someone to work it good sellitto said ill call peretti toss him a bone i know his nosell be out of joint cause were tiptoeing around him rhyme grunted did i ask for peretti but hes the ird golden boy banks said i dont want him rhyme muttered theres somebody else i want sellitto and banks exchanged glances the older detective smiled brushing pointlessly at his wrinkled shirt whoever you want linc you got him remember youre king for a day staring at the dim eye tj colfax darkhaired refugee from the hills of eastern tennessee nyu business school grad quickasawhip currency trader had just swum out of a deep dream her tangled hair stuck to her cheeks sweat crawling in veins down her face and neck and chest she found herself looking into the black eye a hole in a rusty pipe about six inches across from which a small access plate had been removed she sucked mildewy air through her nose her mouth was still taped shut tasting plastic the hot adhesive bitter and john she wondered where was he refusing to think about the loud crack shed heard last night in the basement shed grown up in eastern tennessee and knew what gunshots sounded like please she prayed for her boss let him be all right stay calm she raged to herself you fucking start to cry again you remember what happened in the basement after the gunshot shed lost it completely breaking down sobbing in panic and had nearly suffocated right calm look at the black eye in the pipe pretend its winking at you the eye of your guardian angel tj sat on the floor surrounded by a hundred pipes and ducts and snakes of conduit and wires hotter than her brothers diner hotter than the back seat of jule whelans nova ten years ago water dripped stalactites drooped from the ancient girders above her head a halfdozen tiny yellow bulbs were the only illumination above her head directly above was a sign she couldnt read it clearly though she caught the red border at the end of whatever the message might have been was a fat exclamation point she struggled once more but the cuffs held her tight pinching against the bone from her throat rose a desperate cry an animals cry but the thick tape on her mouth and the insistent churning of machinery swallowed up the sound no one couldve heard her the black eye continued to stare youll save me wont you she thought suddenly the silence was broken by a clanging slam an iron bell far away like a ships door slamming shut the noise came from the hole in the pipe from her friendly eye she jerked the cuffs against the pipe and tried to stand but she couldnt move more than a few inches okay dont panic just relax youll be all right it was then that she happened to see the sign above her head in her jockeying for slack shed straightened up slightly and moved her head to the side this gave her an oblique view of the words oh no oh jesus in my heart the tears began again she imagined her mother her hair pulled back from her round face wearing her cornflowerblue housedress whispering be all raht honey love doan you worry but she didnt believe the words she believed what the sign said extreme danger superheated steam under high pressure do not remove plate from pipe call consolidated edison for access extreme danger the black eye gaped at her the eye that opened into the heart of the steam pipe it stared directly at the pink flesh of her chest from somewhere deep inside the pipe came another clink of metal on metal workers hammering tightening old joints as tammie jean colfax cried and cried she heard another clink then a distant groan very faint and it seemed to her through her tears that the black eye finally winked five heres the situation lincoln rhyme announced weve got a kidnap victim and a three pm deadline no ransom demands sellitto supplemented rhymes synopsis then turned aside to answer his chirping phone jerry rhyme said to banks brief them about the scene this morning there were more people hovering in lincoln rhymes dark room than in recent memory oh after the accident friends had sometimes stopped by unannounced the odds were pretty good that rhymed be home of course but hed discouraged that and hed stopped returning phone calls too growing more and more reclusive drifting into solitude hed spend his hours writing his book and when he was uninspired to write another one reading and when that grew tedious there were rental movies and payperview and music and then hed given up tv and the stereo and spent hours staring at the art prints the aide had dutifully taped up on the wall opposite the bed finally they too had come down solitude it was all he craved and oh how he missed it now pacing looking tense was compact jim polling lon sellitto was the case officer but an incident like this needed a captain on board and polling had volunteered for the job the case was a time bomb and could nuke careers in a heartbeat so the chief and the dep coms were happy to have him intercept the flak theyd be practicing the fine art of distancing and when the betacams rolled their press conferences would be peppered with words like delegated and assigned and taking the advice of and theyd be fast to glance at polling when it came time to field the hardball questions rhyme couldnt imagine why any cop in the world would volunteer to head up a case like this one polling was an odd one the little man had pummeled his way through midtown north precinct as one of the citys most successful and notorious homicide detectives known for his bad temper hed gotten into serious trouble when hed killed an unarmed suspect but hed managed amazingly to pull his career together by getting a conviction in the shepherd case the copserialkiller case the one in which rhymed been injured promoted to captain after that very public collar polling went through one of those embarrassing midlife changes giving up blue jeans and sears suits for brooks brothers today he wore navyblue calvin klein casual and began his dogged climb toward a plush corner office high in one police plaza another officer leaned against a nearby table crewcut rangy bo haumann was a captain and head of the emergency services unit nypds swat team banks finished his synopsis just as sellitto pushed disconnect and folded his phone the hardy boys anything more on the cab polling asked nothing theyre still beating bushes any sign she was fucking somebody she shouldntve been polling asked maybe a psycho boyfriend naw no boyfriends just dated a few guys casually no stalkers it looks like and still no ransom calls rhyme asked no the doorbell rang thom went to answer it rhyme looked toward the approaching voices a moment later the aide escorted a uniformed police officer up the stairs she appeared very young from a distance but as she drew closer he could see she was probably thirty or so she was tall and had that sullen equine beauty of women gazing out from the pages of fashion magazines we see others as we see ourselves and since the accident lincoln rhyme rarely thought of people in terms of their bodies he observed her height trim hips fiery red hair somebody elsed weigh those features and say what a knockout but for rhyme that thought didnt occur to him what did register was the look in her eyes not the surprise obviously nobodyd warned he was a crip but something else an expression hed never seen before it was as if his condition was putting her at ease the exact opposite of how most people reacted as she walked into the room she was relaxing officer sachs rhyme asked yessir she said catching herself just as she was about to extend a hand detective rhyme sellitto introduced her to polling and haumann shed know about the latter two by reputation if nothing else and now her eyes grew cautious once more she took in the room the dust the gloominess glanced at one of the art posters it was partially unrolled lying under a table nighthawks by edward hopper the lonely people in a diner late at night that one had been the last to come down rhyme briefly explained about the pm deadline sachs nodded calmly but rhyme could see the flicker of what fear disgust in her eyes jerry banks fingers encumbered by a class ring but not a wedding band was attracted immediately by the lamp of her beauty and offered her a particular smile but sachss single glance in response made clear that no matches were being made here and probably never would be polling said maybe its a trap we find the place hes leading us to walk in and theres a bomb i doubt it sellitto said shrugging why go to all this trouble if you want to kill cops all you gotta do is find one and fucking shoot him awkward silence for a moment as polling looked quickly from sellitto to rhyme the collective thought registered that it was on the shepherd case that rhyme had been injured but faux pas meant nothing to lincoln rhyme he continued i agree with lon but id tell any search and surveillance or hrt teams to keep an eye out for ambush our boy seems to be writing his own rules sachs looked again at the poster of the hopper painting rhyme followed her gaze maybe the people in the diner really werent lonely he reflected come to think of it they all looked pretty damn content weve got two types of physical evidence here rhyme continued standard pe what the unsub didnt mean to leave behind hair fibers fingerprints maybe blood shoeprints if we can find enough of it and if were lucky thatll lead us to the primary crime scene thats where he lives or his hideyhole sellitto offered something temporary a safe house rhyme mused nodding bet youre right lon he needs someplace to operate out of he continued then theres the planted evidence apart from the scraps of paper which tell us the time and date weve got the bolt the wad of asbestos and the sand a fucking scavenger hunt haumann growled and ran a hand through his slick buzz cut he looked just like the drill sergeant rhyme recalled hed been so i can tell the brass theres a chance of getting the vic in time polling asked i think so yes the captain made a call and wandered to the corner of the room as he talked when he hung up he grunted the mayor the chiefs with im theres gonna be a press conference in an hour and i gotta be there to make sure their dicksre in their pants and their fliesre zipped anything more i can tell the big boys sellitto glanced at rhyme who shook his head not yet the detective said polling gave sellitto his cellular phone number and left literally jogging out the door a moment later a skinny balding man in his thirties ambled up the stairs mel cooper was as goofylooking as ever the nerdy neighbor in a sitcom he was followed by two younger cops carrying a steamer trunk and two suitcases that seemed to weigh a thousand pounds each the officers deposited their heavy loads and left mel detective cooper walked up to rhyme and gripped his useless right hand the only physical contact today with any of his guests rhyme noted he and cooper had worked together for years with degrees in organic chemistry math and physics cooper was an expert both in identification frictionridge prints dna and forensic reconstruction and in pe analysis hows the worlds foremost criminalist cooper asked him rhyme scoffed goodnaturedly the title had been bestowed on him by the press some years ago after the surprising news that the fbi had selected him a city cop as adviser in putting together pert their physical evidence response team not satisfied with forensic scientist or forensic specialist reporters dubbed rhyme a criminalist the word had actually been around for years first applied in the united states to the legendary paul leland kirk who ran the uc berkeley school of criminology the school the first in the country had been founded by the even more legendary chief august vollmer the handle had recently become chic and when techs around the country sidled up to blondes at cocktail parties now they described themselves as criminalists not forensic scientists everybodys nightmare cooper said you get into a cab and turns out theres a psycho behind the wheel and the whole worlds watching the big apple causa that conference wondered if they might not bring you out of retirement for this one hows your mother rhyme asked still complaining about every ache and pain still healthier than me cooper lived with the elderly woman in the queens bungalow where hed been born his passion was ballroom dancing the tango his specialty cop gossip being what it is thered been speculation around ird as to the mans sexual preference rhyme had had no interest in his employees personal lives but had been as surprised as everyone else to finally meet greta coopers steady girlfriend a stunning scandinavian who taught advanced mathematics at columbia cooper opened the large trunk which was padded with velvet he lifted out parts for three large microscopes and began assembling them oh house current he glanced at the outlets disappointed he pushed his metalrimmed glasses up on his nose thats because its a house mel i assumed you lived in a lab wouldnt have been surprised rhyme stared at the instruments gray and black battered similar to the ones hed lived with for over fifteen years a standard compound microscope a phasecontrast scope and a polarizedlight model cooper opened the suitcases which contained a mr wizard assortment of bottles and jars and scientific instruments in a flash words came back to rhyme words that had once been part of his daily vocabulary edta vacuum bloodcollection tubes acetic acid orthotolidine luminol reagent magnabrush ruhemanns purple phenomenon the skinny man looked around the room looks just like your office used to lincoln how do you find anything say i need some room here thom rhyme moved his head toward the least cluttered table they moved aside magazines and papers and books revealing a tabletop rhyme had not seen in a year sellitto gazed at the crime scene report whatta we call the unsub we dont have a case number yet rhyme glanced at banks pick a number any number banks suggested the page number well the date i mean unsub good as any sellitto jotted this on the report uhm excuse me detective rhyme it was the patrolwoman whod spoken rhyme turned to her i was supposed to be at the big building at noon coptalk for one police plaza officer sachs hed forgotten about her momentarily you were first officer this morning at that homicide by the railroad tracks thats right i took the call when she spoke she spoke to thom im here officer rhyme reminded sternly barely controlling his temper over here it infuriated him when people talked to him through others through healthy people her head swiveled quickly and he saw the lesson had been learned yessir she said a soft tone in her voice but ice in her eyes im decommissioned just call me lincoln would you just get it over with please hows that he asked the reason why you brought me here im sorry i wasnt thinking if you want a written apology ill do it only im late for my new assignment and i havent had a chance to call my commander apology rhyme asked the thing is i didnt have any real crime scene experience i was sort of flying by the seat of my pants what are you talking about stopping the trains and closing eleventh avenue it was my fault the senator missed his speech in new jersey and that some of the senior un people didnt make it in from newark airport in time for their meetings rhyme was chuckling do you know who i am well ive heard of you of course i thought you were dead rhyme asked no i didnt mean that though she had she continued quickly we all used your book in the academy but we dont hear about you personally i mean she looked up at the wall and said stiffly in my judgment as first officer i thought it was best to stop the train and close the street to protect the scene and thats what i did sir call me lincoln and youre i your first name amelia amelia after the aviatrix nosir a family name amelia i dont want an apology you were right and vince peretti was wrong sellitto stirred at this indiscretion but lincoln rhyme didnt care he was after all one of the few people in the world who could stay flat on his ass when the president of the united states himself walked into the room he continued peretti worked the scene like the mayor was looking over his shoulder and thats the anumberone way to screw it up he had too many people he was dead wrong to let the trains and traffic move and he should never have released the scene as early as he did if wed kept the tracks secure who knows we mightve just found a credit card receipt with a name on it or a big beautiful thumbprint that may be sellitto said delicately but lets just keep it to ourselves giving silent orders his eyes swiveling toward sachs and cooper and young jerry banks rhyme snorted an irreverent laugh then turned back to sachs whom he caught like banks that morning staring at his legs and body under the apricotcolored blanket he said to her i asked you here to work the next crime scene for us what no speaking through interpreters this time work for us he said shortly the next crime scene but she laughed im not ird im patrol ive never done cs work this is an unusual case as detective sellitto himselfll tell you its real weird right lon true if it was a classic scene i wouldnt want you but we need a fresh pair of eyes on this one she glanced at sellitto who said nothing i just id be no good at it im sure all right rhyme said patiently the truth she nodded i need somebody whos got the balls to stop a train in its tracks to protect a scene and to put up with the heat afterwards thank you for the opportunity sir lincoln but rhyme said shortly lon officer the detective grunted to sachs youre not being given any options here youve been assigned to this case to assist at the crime scene sir i have to protest im transferring out of patrol today ive got a medical transfer effective an hour ago medical rhyme inquired she hesitated glancing unwilling at his legs again i have arthritis do you rhyme asked chronic arthritis im sorry to hear that she continued quickly i only took that call this morning because someone was home sick i didnt plan on it yes well i had other plans too lincoln rhyme said now lets look at some evidence six the bolt remembering the classic crime scene rule analyze the most unusual evidence first thom turned the plastic bag over and over in his hands as rhyme studied the metal rod half rusted half not dull worn youre sure about the prints you tried smallparticle reagent thats the best for pe exposed to the elements yup mel cooper confirmed thom rhyme ordered get this hair out of my eyes comb it back i told you to comb it back this morning the aide sighed and brushed at the tangled black strands watch it he whispered ominously to his boss and rhyme jerked his head dismissively mussing his hair further amelia sachs sat sullenly in the corner her legs rested under the chair in a sprinters starting position and sure enough she looked like she was just waiting for the gun rhyme turned back to the bolt when he headed ird rhyme had started assembling databases like the federal autopaintchip index or the batfs tobacco files hed set up a bulletstandards file fibers cloth tires shoes tools motor oil transmission fluid hed spent hundreds of hours compiling lists indexed and crossreferenced even during rhymes obsessive tenure though ird had never gotten around to cataloging hardware he wondered why not and he was angry at himself for not taking the time to do it and angrier still at vince peretti for not thinking of it either we need to call every bolt manufacturer and jobber in the northeast no in the country ask if they make a model like this and who they sell to fax a description and picture of the bolt to our dispatchers at communications hell there could be a million of them banks said every ace hardware and sears in the country i dont think so rhyme responded its got to be a viable clue he wouldnt have left it if it was useless theres a limited source of these bolts i bet you sellitto made a call and looked up a few minutes later ive got you dispatchers lincoln four of them where do we get a list of manufacturers get a patrolman down to fortysecond street rhyme replied public library they have corporate directories there until we get one have the dispatchers start working through the businesstobusiness yellow pages sellitto repeated this into the phone rhyme glanced at the clock it was onethirty now the asbestos for an instant the word glowed in his mind he felt a jolt in places where no jolts could be felt what was familiar about asbestos something hed read or heard about recently it seemed though lincoln rhyme no longer trusted his sense of time when you lie on your back frozen in place month after month after month time slows to neardeath he might be thinking of something hed read two years ago what do we know about asbestos he mused no one answered but that didnt matter he answered himself as he preferred to do anyway asbestos was a complex molecule silicate polymer it doesnt burn because like glass its already oxidized when hed run crime scenes of old murders working with forensic anthropologists and odontologists rhyme often found himself in asbestosinsulated buildings he remembered the peculiar taste of the face masks theyd had to wear during the excavation in fact he now recalled itd been during an asbestosremoval cleanup at the city hall subway stop three and a half years ago that crews found the body of one of the policemen murdered by dan shepherd dumped in a generator room as rhyme had bent down over it slowly to lift a fiber from the officers lightblue blouse hed heard the crack and groan of the oak beam the mask had probably saved him from choking to death on the dust and dirt that caved in around him maybe hes got her at a cleanup site sellitto said could be rhyme agreed sellitto ordered his young assistant call epa and city environmental find out if therere any sites where cleanups going on right now the detective made the call bo rhyme asked haumann you have teams to deploy ready to roll the esu commander confirmed though i gotta tell you weve got over half the force tied up with this un thing theyre on loan to the secret service and un security got some epa info here banks gestured to haumann and they retired to a corner of the room they moved aside several stacks of books as haumann unfurled one of esus tactical maps of new york something clattered to the floor banks jumped jesus from the angle where he lay rhyme couldnt see what had fallen haumann hesitated then bent down and retrieved the bleached piece of spinal column and replaced it on the table rhyme felt several pairs of eyes on him but he said nothing about the bone haumann leaned over the map as banks on the phone fed him information about asbestoscleanup sites the commander marked them in grease pencil there appeared to be a lot of them scattered all over the five boroughs of the city it was discouraging we have to narrow it down more lets see the sand rhyme said to cooper scope it tell me what you think sellitto handed the evidence envelope to the tech who poured the contents out onto an enamel examination tray the glistening powder left a small cloud of dust there was also a stone worn smooth which slid into the center of the pile lincoln rhymes throat caught not at what he saw he didnt yet know what he was looking at but at the flawed nerve impulse that shot from his brain and died halfway to his useless right arm urging it to grab a pencil and to probe the first time in a year or so hed felt that urge it nearly brought tears into his eyes and his only solace was the memory of the tiny bottle of seconal and the plastic bag that dr berger carried with him images that hovered like a saving angel over the room he cleared his throat print it what cooper asked the stone sellitto looked at him inquiringly the rock doesnt belong there rhyme said apples and oranges i want to know why print it using porcelaintipped forceps cooper picked up the stone and examined it he slipped on goggles and hit the rock with a beam from a polilight a power pack the size of a car battery with a light wand attached nothing cooper said vmd vacuum metal deposition is the cadillac of techniques for raising latent prints on nonporous surfaces it evaporates gold or zinc in a vacuum chamber containing the object to be tested the metal coats the latent print making the whorls and peaks very visible but cooper didnt have a vmd with him what do you have asked rhyme not pleased sudan black stabilized physical developer iodine amido black dfo and gentian violet magnabrush hed also brought ninhydrin for raising prints on porous surfaces and a super glue frame for smooth surfaces rhyme recalled the stunning news that had swept the forensic community some years ago a technician working in a us army forensic lab in japan had used super glue to fix a broken camera and found to his amazement that the fumes from the adhesive raised latent fingerprints better than most chemicals made for that purpose this was the method cooper now used with forceps he set the rock in a small glass box and put a dab of glue on the hot plate inside a few minutes later he lifted the rock out weve got something he said he dusted it with longwavelength uv powder and hit it with the beam from the polilight wand a print was clearly visible dead center cooper photographed it with polaroid cu a camera he showed the picture to rhyme hold it closer rhyme squinted as he examined it yes he rolled it rolling prints rocking a finger onto a surface produced an impression different from one made by picking up an object it was a subtle difference in the width of the friction ridges at various points on the pattern but one that rhyme now recognized clearly and look whats that he mused that line there was a faint crescent mark above the print itself it looks almost like yep rhyme said her fingernail you wouldnt normally get that but ill bet he tipped the stone just to make sure it got picked up it left an oil impression like a friction ridge why would he do that sachs asked once more miffed that nobody seemed to be picking up these points as fast as he was rhyme explained tersely hes telling us two things first hes making sure we know the victims a woman in case we didnt make the connection between her and the body this morning why do that banks asked to up the ante rhyme said make us sweat more hes let us know theres a woman at risk hes valuated the victims just like we all do even though we claim we dont rhyme happened to glance at sachss hands he was surprised to see that for such a beautiful woman her fingers were a mess four ended in fleshy bandaids and several others were chewed to the quick the cuticle of one was caked with brown blood he noticed too the red inflammation of the skin beneath her eyebrows from plucking them he assumed and a scratch mark beside her ear all selfdestructive habits therere a million ways to do yourself in besides pills and armagnac rhyme announced the other thing hes telling us i already warned you about he knows evidence hes saying dont bother with regular forensic pe i wont be leaving any thats what he thinks of course but well find something you bet we will suddenly rhyme frowned the map we need the map thom the aide blurted what map you know what map i mean thom sighed not a clue lincoln glancing out the window and speaking half to himself rhyme mused the railroad underpass the bootleg tunnels and access doors the asbestos thosere all old he likes historical new york i want the randel map which is where the research files for my book where else thom dug through folders and pulled out a photocopy of a long horizontal map of manhattan this that yes it was the randel survey drawn in for the commissioners of the city to plan out the grid of streets in manhattan the map had been printed horizontally with battery park south to the left and harlem north to the right laid out this way the island resembled the body of a dog leaping its narrow head lifted for an attack pin it up there good as the aide did rhyme blurted thom were going to deputize you give him a shiny badge or something lon lincoln he muttered we need you come on havent you always wanted to be sam spade or kojak only judy garland the aide replied jessica fletcher then youll be writing the profile come on now get out that mont blanc youre always letting stick vainly out of your shirt pocket the young man rolled his eyes as he lifted his parker pen and took a dusty yellow pad from a stack under one of the tables no ive got a better idea rhyme announced put up one of those posters those art posters tape it up backwards and write on the back in marker write big now so i can see it thom selected a monet lily pads and mounted it to the wall on the top the criminalist ordered write unsub then four columns appearance residence vehicle other beautiful now lets start what do we know about him sellitto said vehicle hes got a yellow cab right and under other add that he knows cs crime scene procedures which sellitto added maybe means hes had his turn in the barrel hows that thom asked he might have a record the detective explained banks said should we add that hes armed with a colt fuck yes his boss confirmed rhyme contributed and he knows frs what thom asked friction ridges fingerprints thats what they are you know ridges on our hands and feet to give us traction and put down that hes probably working out of a safe house good job thom look at him hes a born law enforcer thom glowered and stepped away from the wall brushing at his shirt which had picked up a stringy cobweb from the wall there we go folks sellitto said our first look at mr rhyme turned to mel cooper now the sand what can we tell about it cooper lifted the goggles onto his pale forehead he poured a sample onto a slide and slipped it under the polarizedlight scope he adjusted dials hmm this is curious no birefringence polarizing microscopes show birefringence the double refraction of crystals and fibers and some other materials seashore sand birefringes dramatically so it isnt sand rhyme muttered its something ground up can you individuate it individuation the goal of the criminalist most physical evidence can be identified but even if you know what it is there are usually hundreds or thousands of sources it might have come from individuated evidence is something that could have come from only one source or a very limited number of sources a fingerprint a dna profile a paint chip that fits into a missing spot on the perps car like a jigsawpuzzle piece maybe the tech responded if i can figure out what it is ground glass rhyme suggested glass is essentially melted sand but the glassmaking process alters the crystalline structure you dont get birefringence with ground glass cooper examined the sample closely no i dont think its glass i dont know what it is i wish i had an edx here a popular crime lab tool was a scanning electron microscope married to an energydispersive xray unit it determined what elements were in trace samples found at crime scenes get him one rhyme ordered sellitto then looked around the room we need more equipment i want a vacuum metal fingerprint unit too and a gcms a gas chromatograph broke down substances into their component elements and mass photospectrometry used light to identify each one of them these instruments let criminalists test an unknown sample as small as one millionth of a gram and compare it against a database of a hundred thousand known substances cataloged by identity and name brand sellitto phoned the wish list in to the csu lab but we cant wait for the fancy toys mel youll have to do it the oldfashioned way tell me more about our phony sand its mixed with a little dirt theres loam flecks of quartz feldspar and mica but minimal leaf and decomposedplant fragments flecks here of what could be bentonite bentonite rhyme was pleased thats a volcanic ash that builders use in slurry when theyre digging foundations in watery areas of the city where the bedrocks deep it prevents caveins so were looking for a developed area thats on or near the water probably south of thirtyfourth street north of that the bedrocks much closer to the surface and they dont need slurry cooper moved the slide if i had to guess id say this is mostly calcium wait something fibrous here the knob turned and rhyme wouldve paid anything to be looking through that eyepiece flashed back to all the evenings hed spent with his face pressed against the gray sponge rubber watching fibers or flecks of humus or blood cells or metal shavings swim into and out of focus heres something else a larger granule three layers one similar to horn then two layers of calcium slightly different colors the other ones translucent three layers rhyme spat out angrily hell its a seashell he felt furious with himself he should have thought of that yep thats it cooper was nodding oyster i think the oyster beds around the city were mostly off the coasts of long island and new jersey rhyme had hoped that the unsub would limit the geographic area of the search to manhattan where the victim that morning was found he muttered if hes opening up the whole metro area the searchll be hopeless cooper said im looking at something else i think its lime but very old granular concrete maybe rhyme suggested possibly yes i dont get the shells then cooper added reflectively around new york the oyster bedsre full of vegetation and mud this is mixed with concrete and theres virtually no vegetable matter at all rhyme barked suddenly edges what are the edges of the shell like mel the tech gazed into the eyepiece fractured not worn thiss been pulverized by dry pressure not eroded by water rhymes eyes slipped over the randel map scanning right and left focusing on the leaping dogs rump got it he cried in f w woolworth built the sixtystory structure that still bears his name terracottaclad covered with gargoyles and gothic sculpture for sixteen years it was the worlds tallest building because the bedrock in that part of manhattan was more than a hundred feet below broadway workmen had to dig deep shafts to anchor the building it wasnt long after the groundbreaking that workmen discovered the remains of manhattan industrialist talbott soames whod been kidnapped in the mans body was found buried in a thick bed of what looked like white sand but was really ground oyster shells a fact the tabloids had a heyday with noting the obese tycoons obsession with rich food the shells were so common along the lower eastern tip of manhattan theyd been used for landfill they were what had given pearl street its name shes downtown somewhere rhyme announced probably the east side and maybe near pearl shell be underground about five to fifteen feet down maybe a construction site maybe a basement an old building or tunnel crosscheck the epa diagram jerry sellitto instructed where theyre doing asbestos cleanup along pearl nothing the young officer held up the map he and haumann were working from therere threedozen cleanup sites in midtown harlem and the bronx but nothing downtown asbestos asbestos rhyme mused again what was so familiar about it it was pm bo weve got to move get your people down there and start a search all the buildings along pearl street water street too man the cop sighed thats beaucoup buildings he started for the door rhyme said to sellitto lon you better go too thiss going to be a photo finish theyll need all the searchers they can get amelia i want you down there too look ive been thinking officer sellitto snapped you got your orders a faint glower crossed her beautiful face rhyme said to cooper mel you drive over here in a bus an rrv he answered the citys big crime scene buses were large vans filled with instruments and evidencecollection supplies better equipped than the entire labs of many small towns but when rhyme was running ird hed ordered smaller crime scene vehicles station wagons basically containing the essential collectionandanalysis equipment the rapid response vehicles looked placid but rhyme had bullied transportation into getting them fitted with turbocharged police interceptor engines they often beat patrols squad cars to the scene on more than one occasion the first officer was a seasoned crime scene tech which is every prosecutors dream give amelia the keys cooper handed them to sachs who stared briefly at rhyme then wheeled and hurried down the stairs even her footsteps sounded angry all right lon whats on your mind sellitto glanced at the empty hallway and walked up close to rhyme you really want pd for this pd i mean her sachs pds a nickname for what dont say it around her ticks her off her dad was a beat cop for forty years so they call her the portables daughter you dont think i shouldve picked her naw i dont why dyou want her because she climbed down a thirtyfoot embankment so she wouldnt contaminate the scene she closed a major avenue and an amtrak line thats initiative come on linc i know a dozen cs copsd do something like that well shes the one i wanted and rhyme gave sellitto a grave look reminding him subtly but without debate what the terms of this bargain had been all ill say is the detective muttered i just talked to polling perettis fucking outa joint about being flanked and if no ill say when the brass finds out somebody from patrols walking the grid at the scene therell be fucking trouble probably rhyme said softly gazing at the profile poster but i have a feeling thats going to be the least of our trouble today and let his weary head ease back into the thick down pillow seven the station wagon raced toward the dark sooty canyons of wall street downtown new york amelia sachss fingers danced lightly on the steering wheel as she tried to imagine where tj colfax might be held captive finding her seemed hopeless the approaching financial district had never looked so enormous so full of alleys so filled with manholes and doorways and buildings peppered with black windows so many places to hide a hostage in her mind she saw the hand sticking out of the grave beside the railroad tracks the diamond ring sitting on the bloody bone of a finger sachs recognized the type of jewelry she called them consolation rings the sort lonely rich girls bought themselves the sort shed be wearing if she were rich speeding south dodging bicycle messengers and cabs even on this glaring afternoon under a choked sun this was a spooky part of town the buildings cast grim shadows and were coated with grime dark as dried blood sachs took a turn at forty skidding on the spongy asphalt and punched the pedal to bring the station wagon back up to sixty excellent engine she thought and decided to see how well the wagon handled at seventy years before while her old man slept he worked the threetoeleven watch usually teenage amie sachs would palm the keys to his camaro and tell her mother rose she was going shopping did she want anything from the fort hamilton pork store and before her mother could say no but you take the train youre not driving the girl would disappear out the door fire up the

frantic and angry and would lecture the girl about smashing up her beautiful face and ruining her chances to make a million dollars at modeling things grew even worse when she got her drivers license sachs now sliced between two doubleparked trucks hoping that neither a passenger nor a driver would open his door in a doppler whisper she was past them when you move they cant getcha lon sellitto kneaded his rotund face with blunt fingertips and paid no attention to the indy driving he talked with his partner about the case like an accountant discussing a balance sheet as for banks though he was no longer stealing infatuated glances at sachss eyes and lips and had taken to checking the speedometer every minute or so they skidded in a frantic turn past the brooklyn bridge she thought again of the woman captive picturing tjs long elegant nails while she tapped her own picked fingers on the wheel she saw again in her mind the image that refused to go away the white birch branch of a hand sticking up out of the moist grave the single bloody bone hes kind of loony she blurted suddenly to change the direction of her thoughts who sellitto asked rhyme banks added ask me he looks like howard hughess kid brother yeah well that surprised me the older detective admitted wasnt looking too good used to be a handsome guy but well you know after what hes been through how come if you drive like this sachs youre a portable where i got assigned they didnt ask they told me just like you did she reflected was he really as good as that rhyme better most csu guys in new york handle two

a cop took a leak at a scene and flushed the toilet man rhyme went ballistic told him to get his ass down to the basement and bring back whatever was in the sewer trap sellitto laughed the cop he had rank he said im not doing that im a lieutenant and rhyme said got news youre a plumber now i could go on and on fuck officer you doing eighty they streaked past the big building and she thought achingly thats where i oughta be right now meeting fellow information officers sitting through the training session soaking up the airconditioning she steered expertly around a taxi that was oozing through a red light jesus this is hot dust hot stink hot gas hot the ugly hours of the city tempers spurted like gray water shooting from hydrants up in harlem two christmases ago she and her boyfriend had an abbreviated holiday celebration from pm to midnight the only mutual free time their watches allowed in the fourdegree night she and nick sitting at rockefeller center outside near the skating rink drinking coffee and brandy theyd agreed theyd rather have a week of cold than a single hot august day finally streaking down pearl she spotted haumanns command post leaving eightfoot skid marks sachs put the rrv into a slot between his car and an ems bus damn you drive good sellitto climbed out for some reason sachs was delighted to notice jerry bankss sweaty fingerprints remained prominently on the window when he pushed the rear door open ems officers and patrol uniforms were everywhere fifty or sixty of them and more were on their way it seemed as if the entire attention of police plaza was focused on downtown new york sachs found herself thinking idly that if anybody wanted to try an assassination or to take over gracie mansion or a consulate thisd be the time to do it haumann trotted up to the station wagon he said to sellitto were doing doortodoor seeing about construction along pearl nobody knows anything about asbestos work and nobodys heard any calls for help sachs started to climb out but haumann said no officer your ordersre to stay here with the cs vehicle she got out anyway yessir who exactly said that detective rhyme i just talked to him youre supposed to call in to central when youre at the cp haumann was walking away sellitto and banks hurried toward the command post detective sellitto sachs called he turned she said excuse me detective the thing is whos my watch commander whom i reporting to he said shortly youre reporting to rhyme she laughed but i cant be reporting to him sellitto gazed at her blankly i mean arent there liability issues or something jurisdiction hes a civilian i need somebody a shield to report to sellitto said evenly officer listen up were all reporting to lincoln rhyme i dont care whether hes a civilian or hes the chief or hes the fucking caped crusader got that but you wanna complain do it in writing and do it tomorrow and he was gone sachs stared after him for a moment then returned to the front seat of the wagon and called in to central that she was at the scene awaiting instructions she laughed grimly as the woman reported tenfour portable be advised detective rhyme will be in touch shortly k detective rhyme tenfour k sachs responded and looked in the back of the wagon wondering idly what was in the black suitcases twoforty pm the phone rang in rhymes townhouse thom answered its a dispatcher from headquarters put em through the speakerphone burst to life detective rhyme you dont remember me but i worked at ird when you were there civilian did phone detail then emma rollins of course howre the youngsters emma rhyme had a memory of a large cheerful black woman supporting five children with two jobs he recalled her blunt finger stabbing buttons so hard she once actually broke one of the governmentissue phones jeremys starting college in a couple weeks and doras still acting or she thinks she is the little onesre doing just fine lon sellitto recruited you did he nosir i heard you were working on the case and i booted some child back to emmas taking this job i told her whatve you got for us were working out of a directory of companies making bolts and a book that lists places wholesaling them heres what we found it was the letters did it the ones stamped on the bolt the ce theyre made special for con ed hell of course theyre marked that way because theyre a

use it you never ordered it i didnt no well i need it well we dont have it do something i want to be able to make calls i think theres a manual ecu somewhere thom dug through a box against the wall he found a small electronic console and plugged one end into the phone and the other into a stalk control that mounted next to rhymes cheek thats too awkward well its all weve got if wed hooked up the infrared above your eyebrow like i suggested you couldve been making phonesex calls for the past two years too many fucking wires rhyme spat out his neck spasmed suddenly and knocked the controller out of reach fuck suddenly this minute task not to mention their mission seemed impossible to lincoln rhyme he was exhausted his neck hurt his head his eyes particularly they stung and this was more painful to him he felt a chip of urge to rub the backs of his fingers across his closed lids a tiny gesture of relief something the rest of the world did every day thom replaced the joystick rhyme summoned patience from somewhere and asked his aide how does it work theres the screen see it on the controller just move the stick till its on a number wait one second and its programmed in then do the next number the same way when youve got all seven push the stick here to dial he snapped its not working just practice we dont have time thom snarled ive been answering the phone for you way too long all right rhyme said lowering his voice his way of apology ill practice later could you please get me con ed and i need to speak to a supervisor the rope hurt and the cuffs hurt but it was the noise that scared her the most tammie jean colfax felt all the sweat in her body run down her face and chest and arms as she struggled to saw the handcuff links back and forth on the rusty bolt her wrists were numb but it seemed to her that she was wearing through some of the chain she paused exhausted and twitched her arms this way and that to keep a cramp at bay she listened again it was she thought the sound of workmen tightening bolts and hammering parts into place final taps of hammers she imagined they were just finishing up their job on the pipe and thinking of going home dont go she cried to herself dont leave me as long as the men were there working she was safe a final bang then ringing silence git on outa thayr girl gon mamma tj cried for several minutes thinking of her family back in eastern tennessee her nostrils clogged but as she began to choke she blew her nose violently felt an explosion of tears and mucus then she was breathing again it gave her confidence strength she began to saw once more i appreciate the urgency detective but i dont know how i can help you we use bolts all over the city oil lines gas lines all right rhyme said tersely and asked the con ed supervisor at the companys headquarters on fourteenth street do you insulate wiring with asbestos a hesitation weve cleaned up ninety percent of that the woman said defensively ninety five people could be so irritating i understand that i just need to know if theres still any asbestos used for insulation no she said adamantly well never for electricity just the steam and thats the smallest percentage of our service steam it was the leastknown and the scariest of the citys utilities con ed heated water to degrees then shot it through a hundredmile network of pipes running under manhattan the blistering steam itself was superheated about degrees and rocketed through the city at seventyfive miles an hour rhyme now recalled an article in the paper didnt you have a break in the line last week yessir but there was no asbestos leak that site had been cleaned years ago but there is asbestos around some of your pipes in the system downtown she hesitated well where was the break rhyme continued quickly broadway a block north of chambers wasnt there an article in the times about it i dont know maybe yes and did the article mention asbestos it did she admitted but it just said that in the past asbestos contaminationd been a problem the pipe that broke was it does it cross pearl street farther south well let me see yes it does at hanover street on the north side he pictured tj colfax the woman with the thin fingers and long nails about to die and the steams going back on at three thats right any minute now it cant rhyme shouted somebodys tampered with the line you cant turn that steam back on cooper looked up uneasily from his microscope the supervisor said well i dont know rhyme barked to thom call lon tell him shes in a basement at hanover and pearl the north side he told him about the steam get the fire department there too heatprotective outfits rhyme shouted into the speakerphone call the work crews now they cant turn that steam back on they cant he repeated the words absently detesting his exquisite imagination which showed in an endless loop the womans flesh growing pink then red then splitting apart under the fierce clouds of sputtering white steam in the station wagon the radio crackled it was three minutes to three by sachss watch she answered the call portable k forget the officialese amelia rhyme said we dont have time i we think we know where she is hanover and pearl she glanced over her shoulder and saw dozens of esu officers running flatout toward an old building do you want me to theyll look for her you have to get ready to work the scene but i can help no i want you to go to the back of the station wagon theres a suitcase in it labeled zero two take it with you and in a small black case theres a polilight you saw one in my room mel was using it take that too in the suitcase marked zero three youll find a headset and stalk mike plug it into your motorola and get over to the building where the officers are call me back when youre rigged channel thirtyseven ill be on a landline but youll be patched through to me channel thirtyseven the special ops citywide frequency the priority frequency what she asked but the dead radio did not respond she had a long black halogen flashlight on her utility belt so she left the bulky twelvevolter in the back of the wagon and grabbed the polilight and the heavy suitcase it must have weighed fifty pounds just what my damn joints need she adjusted her grip and teeth clamped together against the pain hurried toward the intersection sellitto breathless ran to the building banks joined them you hear the older detective asked sachs nodded this is it she asked sellitto nodded toward the alley he had to take her in this way the lobbys got a guard station they now trotted down the shadowy cobblestoned canyon steaming hot smelling of piss and garbage battered blue dumpsters sat nearby there sellitto shouted those doors the cops fanned out running three of the four doors were locked tight from the inside the fourth had been jimmied open and was now chained shut the chain and lock were new thiss it sellitto reached for the door hesitated thinking probably about fingerprints then he grabbed the handle and yanked it opened a few inches but the chain held tight he sent three of the uniforms around to the front to get into the basement from the inside one cop worked a cobblestone loose from the alley floor and began pounding on the door handle a halfdozen blows a dozen he winced as his hand struck the door blood gushed from a torn finger a fireman ran up with a halligan tool a combination pickax and crowbar he rammed the end into the chain and ripped the padlock open sellitto looked at sachs expectantly she gazed back well go officer he barked what didnt he tell you who rhyme hell shed forgotten to plug in the headset she fumbled it finally got it plugged in heard amelia where im here are you at the building yes go inside they shut the steam off but i dont know if it was in time take a medic and one esu trooper go to the boiler room youll probably see her right away the colfax woman walk to her but not directly not in a straight line from the door to her i dont want you to disturb any footprints he mightve left understand yes she nodded emphatically not thinking that he couldnt see her gesturing the medic and an emergency services trooper after her sachs stepped forward into the murky corridor shadows everywhere the groan of machinery dripping water amelia rhyme said yes we were talking about ambush before from what i know about him now i dont think thats the case hes not there amelia that would be illogical but keep your shooting hand free illogical okay now go fast eight a murky cavern hot black damp the three of them moved quickly down the filthy hallway toward the only doorway sachs could see a sign said boiler room she was behind the esu officer who wore full body armor and helmet the medic was in the rear her right knuckles and shoulder throbbed from the weight of the suitcase she shifted it to her left hand nearly dropped it and readjusted her grip they continued to the door there the swat officer pushed inside and swung his machine gun around the dimly lit room a flashlight was attached to the barrel and it cast a line of pale light in the shreds of steam sachs smelled moisture mold and another scent loathsome click amelia the staticky burst of rhymes voice scared the absolute hell out of her where are you amelia with a shaking hand she turned down the volume inside she gasped is she alive sachs rocked on her feet staring at the sight she squinted not sure at first what she was seeing then she understood oh no whispering feeling the nausea the sickening boiledmeat smell wafted around her but that wasnt the worst of it neither was the sight of the womans skin bright red almost orange peeling off in huge scales the face completely stripped of skin no what brought the dread home was the angle of tj colfaxs body the impossible twisting of her limbs and torso as shed tried to get away from the spray of ravaging heat he hoped the vic was dead for his sake is she alive rhyme repeated no sachs whispered i dont see how no is the room secure sachs glanced at the officer whod heard the transmission and nodded scene secure rhyme told her i want the esu trooper out then you and the medic go check on her sachs gagged once on the smell and forced herself to control the reflex she and the medic walked in an oblique path to the pipe he bent unemotionally forward and felt the womans neck he shook his head amelia rhyme asked her second body in the line of duty both in one day the medic said dcds sachs nodded said formally into the mike we have a deceased confirmed dead at the scene scalded to death rhyme asked looks like it tied to the wall a pipe handcuffed hands behind feet tied with clothesline ducttape gag he opened the steam pipe she was only a couple of feet from it god rhyme continued back the medic out the way you came to the door watch where you put your feet she did this staring at the body how could the skin be so red like a boiled crab shell all right amelia youre going to work the scene open the suitcase she said nothing kept staring amelia are you at the door amelia what she shouted are you at the door his voice was so fucking calm so different from the snide demanding voice of the man she remembered in the bedroom calm and something else she didnt know what yes im at the door you know this is crazy utterly insane rhyme agreed almost cheerfully is the suitcase open she flipped up the lid and glanced inside pliers and forceps a flex mirror on a handle cotton balls eyedroppers pinking sheers pipettes spatulas scalpels what is all this a dustbuster cheesecloth envelopes sifting screens brushes scissors plastic and paper bags metal cans bottles percent nitric acid ninhydrin silicone iodide frictionridgeprinting supplies impossible into the mike she said i dont think you believed me detective i really dont know anything about cs work eyes on the womans ruined body water dripped off her peeled nose a bit of white bone showed through the cheek and her face was drawn into an anguished grin just like the vic that morning i believed you amelia he said dismissively now the case is open he was calm and he sounded what yes that was the tone seductive he sounds like a lover i hate him she thought its wrong to hate a cripple but i fucking hate him youre in the basement right yessir listen youve got to call me lincoln were going to know each other very well by the time this is over which is gonna be about sixty minutes tops youll find some rubber bands in the suitcase if im not mistaken i see some put them around your shoes where the ball of your foot is if theres any confusion as to footprints youll know which ones are yours okay done take some evidence bags and envelopes put a dozen of each in your pocket can you use chopsticks what did you say you live in the city right you ever go to mott street for general tsaos chicken cold noodles with sesame paste her gorge rose at the talk of food she refused to glance at the woman dangling in front of her i can use chopsticks she said icily look in the suitcase im not sure youll find them they kept them there when i was running scenes i dont see any well youll find some pencils put those in your pocket now youre going to walk a grid cover every inch are you ready yes first tell me what you see one big room maybe twenty by thirty full of rusted pipes cracked concrete floor wallsre brick mold any boxes anything on the floor no its empty except for the pipes oil tanks the boiler theres the sand the shells a pile of it spilling out of a crack in the wall and theres some gray stuff too stuff he jumped i dont recognize that word whats stuff a burst of anger tore through her she calmed and said its the asbestos but not wadded up like this morning its in crumbling sheets good now the first sweep youre looking for footprints and any staged clues that hes left for us you think he left more oh ill betcha rhyme said put on the goggles and use the polilight keep it low grid the room every inch get going you know how to walk a grid yes how she bristled i dont need to be tested ah humor me how back and forth in one direction then back and forth in the perpendicular direction each step no more than one foot in length she hadnt known that i know she said go ahead the polilight flashed on with an eerie otherworldly glow she knew it was something called an als alternative light source and that it made fingerprints and semen and blood and some shoeprints fluoresce the brilliant bilegreen light made shadows dance and jump and more than once she nearly drew down on a dark form that turned out to be a mere phantom of darkness amelia rhymes voice was sharp she jumped again yes what do you see any footprints she continued to stare at the floor i uh no i see streaks in the dust or something she cringed at the careless word but rhyme unlike peretti that morning paid no attention he said so he swept up afterwards she was surprised yeah thats it broom marks howd you know rhyme laughed a jarring sound to sachs in this rank tomb and he said he was smart enough to cover his tracks this morning no reason to stop now oh hes good this boy is but were good too keep going sachs bent over her joints on fire and began the search she covered every square foot of the floor nothing here nothing at all he picked up on the note of finality in her voice youve only just started amelia crime scenes are threedimensional remember that what you mean is theres nothing on the floor now search the walls start with the spot farthest away from the steam and cover every inch she slowly circled the horrible marionette in the center of the room she thought of a maypole game shed played at some brooklyn street feast when she was six or seven as her father proudly took home movies circling slowly it was an empty room and yet there were a thousand different places to search hopeless impossible but it wasnt on a ledge about six feet above the floor she found the next set of clues she barked a fast laugh got something here in a cluster yes a big splinter of dark wood chopsticks what she asked the pencils use them to pick it up is it wet everything in heres wet sure it would be the steam put it in a paper evidence bag plastic keeps the moisture in and in this heat bacteriall destroy the trace evidence what else is there he asked eagerly its i dont know hairs i think short trimmed a little pile of them loose or attached to skin loose theres a role of twoinch tape in the suitcase m pick them up with that sachs lifted most of the hairs placed them in a paper envelope she studied the ledge around the hairs i see some stains looks like rust or blood she thought to hit the spot with the polilight theyre fluorescing can you do a presumptive blood test no lets just assume its blood could it be the victims doesnt seem to be its too far away and theres no trail to her body does it lead anywhere looks like it to a brick in the wall its loose no prints on it im going to move it aside i oh jesus sachs gasped and stumbled back a foot or two nearly fell what rhyme asked she eased forward staring in disbelief amelia talk to me its a bone a bloody bone human i dont know she answered how would i i dont know recent kill looks like it about two inches long and two in diameter theres blood and flesh on it its been sawn off jesus who the fuckd do something dont get rattled what if he got it from another victim then we better find im pretty damn soon amelia bag it plastic for the bone as she did this he asked any other staged clues he sounded concerned no thats all hairs a bone and a splinter of wood hes not making it very easy is he should i bring it back to your office rhyme was laughing hed like us to call it quits but no were not through yet lets find out a little more about unsub but theres nothing here oh yes there is amelia theres his address and his phone number and his description and his hopes and aspirations theyre all around you she was furious at his professors tone and remained silent you have the flashlight ive got my issue halogen no he grumbled issue lights are too narrow you need the twelvevolt broad beam well i didnt bring it she snapped should i go back and get it no time check out the pipes she searched for ten minutes climbing up to the ceiling and with the powerful light she illuminated spots that perhaps hadnt been lit in fifty years no i dont see a thing go back to the door hurry she hesitated and returned okay im here now close your eyes what do you smell smell did you say smell was he crazy always smell the air at a crime scene it can tell you a hundred things she kept her eyes wide and breathed in she said well i dont know what i smell thats not an acceptable answer she exhaled in exasperation and hoped the hiss was coming through his telephone loud and clear she jammed her lids closed inhaled fought the nausea again mold mustiness the smell of hot water from the steam you dont know where its from just describe it hot water the womans perfume are you sure its hers well no are you wearing any no how bout aftershave the medic the esu officer i dont think so no describe it dry like gin take a guess mans aftershave or womans perfume what had nick worn arrid extra dry i dont know she said mans walk to the body she glanced once at the pipe then down to the floor i do it lincoln rhyme said she did the peeling skin was like blackandred birch smell her neck its all i mean there isnt much skin left im sorry amelia but you have to do it we have to see if its her perfume she did inhaled gagged nearly vomited im going to puke she thought just like nick and me that night at panchos done in by those damn frozen daiquiris two hardass cops swigging down sissy drinks with blue plastic swordfish swimming in them do you smell the perfume here it comes gagging again no no she closed her eyes concentrated on her aching joints the most painful one her knee and miraculously the wave of nausea passed its not her perfume good so maybe our boys vain enough to wear a lot of aftershave that could be a socialclass indicator or maybe he wants to cover up some other smell he mightve left garlic cigars fish whisky well have to see now amelia listen carefully what i want you to be him oh psychoshit just what i need i really dont think we have time for this theres never enough time in crime scene work rhyme continued soothingly but that doesnt stop us just get into his head youve been thinking the way we think i want you to think the way he does well how do i do that use your imagination thats why god gave us one now youre him youve got her cuffed and gagged you take her into the room there you cuff her to the pipe you scare her youre enjoying this how do you know hes enjoying it youre enjoying it not him how do i know because nobody goes to this much trouble to do something they dont enjoy now you know your way around youve been here before why dyou think that you had to check it out earlier to find a deserted place with a feeder pipe from the steam system and to get the clues he left by the train tracks sachs was mesmerized by his fluid low voice she forgot completely that his body was destroyed oh right you take the steampipe cover off what are you thinking i dont know that i want to get it over with get out but the words were hardly out of her mouth before she thought wrong and she wasnt surprised when she heard rhymes tongue click in her headset do you really he asked no i want to make it last yes i think thats exactly what you want youre thinking about what the steam will do to her what else do you feel i a thought formed in her mind vague she saw the woman struggling to free herself saw something else some one else him she thought unsub but what about him she was close to understanding what what but suddenly the thought vanished gone i dont know she whispered do you feel any urgency or are you pretty cool about what youre doing im in a hurry i have to leave the cops could be here at any minute but i still what shhhh she ordered and scanned the room again looking for whatever had put the seed of the vanished thought in her mind the room was swimming a black starry night swirls of darkness and distant jaundiced lights lord dont let me faint maybe he there thats it sachss eyes were following the steam pipe she was looking at another access plate in a shadowy alcove of the room it would have been a better hiding place for the girl you couldnt see it from the doorway if you were walking past and the second plate had only four bolts on it not eight like the one he chose why not that pipe then she understood he doesnt want i dont want to leave just yet because i want to keep an eye on her why do you think that he inquired echoing her own words just moments before theres another pipe i couldve chained her to but i picked the one that was in the open so you could see her i think so why maybe to make sure she cant get away maybe to make sure the gags tight i dont know good amelia but what does it mean how can we use that fact sachs looked around the room for the place where hed have the best view of the girl without being seen it turned out to be a shadowy spot between two large heatingoil tanks yes she said excitedly looking at the floor he was here forgetting the roleplaying he swept up she scanned the area with the bile glow of the polilight wand no footprints she said disappointed but as she lifted the light to shut it off a smudge glowed on one of the tanks ive got a print she announced a print you get a better view of the girl if you lean forward and support yourself on a tank thats what he did im sure only its weird lincoln its deformed his hand she shivered looking at the monstrous palm in the suitcase theres an aerosol bottle labeled dfo its a fluorescent stain spray that on the print hit the polilight and shoot the image with the onetoone polaroid she told him when shed finished this and he said now dustbust the floor between the tanks if were lucky he scratched off a hair or chewed a fingernail my habits sachs thought it was one of the things that had finally ruined her modeling career the bloody nail the worried eyebrow shed tried and tried and tried to stop finally gave up discouraged bewildered that a tiny habit could change the direction of your life so dramatically bag the vacuum filter in paper yes paper now the body amelia what well youve got to process the body her heart sank somebody else please have somebody else do it she said not until the mes finished thats the rule no rules today amelia were making up our own the medical examinerll get her after us sachs approached the woman you know the routine yes she stepped close to the destroyed body then froze hands inches from the victims skin i cant do it she shuddered told herself to keep going but she couldnt the muscles werent responding sachs you there she couldnt answer i cant do this it was as simple as that impossible i cant sachs and then she looked into herself and somehow saw her father in uniform stooping low on the hot pitted sidewalk of west fortysecond street sliding his arm around a scabby drunk to help him home then was seeing her nick as he laughed and drank beer in a bronx tavern with a hijacker whod kill him in a second if he knew the young cop was working undercover the two men in her life doing what they had to do amelia these two images bobbed in her thoughts and why they calmed her or where that calm came from she couldnt begin to guess im here she said to lincoln rhyme and went about her business as shed been taught taking the nail scrapings combing the hair pubic and head telling rhyme what she did as she did it ignoring the dull orbs of eyes ignoring the crimson flesh trying to ignore the smell get her clothing rhyme said cut off everything put a sheet of newsprint under them first to pick up any trace that falls off should i check the pockets no well do that here wrap them up in the paper sachs cut the blouse and skirt off the panties she reached out for what she thought was the womans bra dangling from her chest it felt curious disintegrating in her fingers then like a slap she realized what she held and she gave a short scream it wasnt cloth it was skin amelia are you all right yes she gasped im fine describe the restraints duct tape for the gag two inches wide standardissue cuffs for hands clothesline for the feet polilight her body he mightve touched her with his bare hands look for prints she did nothing okay now cut the clothesline but not through the knot bag it in plastic sachs did then rhyme said we need the cuffs okay ive got a cuff key no amelia dont open them what the cuff lock mechanism is one of the best ways to pick up trace from the perp well howm i supposed to get them off without a key she laughed theres a razor saw in the suitcase you want me to cut off the cuffs there was a pause rhyme said no not the cuffs amelia well what do you want me to oh you cant be serious her hands you have to he was irritated at her reluctance okay thats it sellitto and pollingve picked a nutcase for a partner maybe their careersre tanking but im not going down with them forget it amelia its just another way to collect evidence why did he sound so reasonable she thought desperately for excuses theyll get blood all over them if i cut her hearts not beating besides he added like a tv chef the bloodll be cooked into a solid the gorge rising again go on amelia go to the suitcase get the saw in the lid he added a frosty please whyd you have me scrape under her nails i couldve just brought you back her hands amelia we need the cuffs we have to open them here and we cant wait for the me it has to be done she walked back to the doorway unsnapped the thongs lifted the wickedlooking saw from the case she stared at the woman frozen in her tortured pose in the center of the vile room amelia amelia outside the sky was still clogged with stagnant yellow air and the buildings nearby were covered with soot like charred bones but sachs had never been so glad to be out in the city air as now the cu suitcase in one hand the razor saw in the other the headset dangling dead around her neck sachs ignored the huge crowd of cops and spectators staring at her and walked straight toward the station wagon as she passed sellitto she handed him the saw without pausing practically tossed it to him if he wants it done that badly tell him he can damn well walk down here and do it himself ii locards principle in real life you only get one shot at the homicide crime scene vernon j geberth lieutenant commander ret new york police department nine saturday pm to saturday pm ive got myself into a situation here sir the man across the desk looked like a tv shows idea of a bigcity deputy police commissioner which happened to be his rank white hair a temperate jowl goldrimmed glasses posture to die for now whats the problem officer dep com randolph c eckert looked down his long nose with a gaze that sachs recognized immediately his nod to equality was to be as stern with the female officers as with the male ones ive got a complaint sir she said stiffly you heard about that taxi kidnapping case he nodded ah has that got the city in double dutch she believed that was a schoolchilds game of jump rope but wouldnt presume to correct a deputy commissioner that damn un conference he continued and the whole worlds watching its unfair people dont talk about crime in washington or detroit well detroit they do say chicago never no its new york that people thump on richmond virginia had more murders per capita than we did last year i looked it up and id rather

his bedroom really thats our cp a civilians bedroom is your command post id appreciate anything you can do sir ive waited a long time for that transfer cut her hands off my good lord she stood and walked to the door and out into one of the corridors that would soon be her new assignment the feeling of relief took only a little longer to arrive than shed expected he stood at the bottleglass window watching a pack of wild dogs prowl though the lot across the street he was on the first floor of this old building a marbleclad federal dating to the early s surrounded by vacant lots and tenements some abandoned some occupied by paying tenants though most by squatters this old mansion had been empty for years the bone collector took the piece of emery paper in his hand once more and continued to rub he looked down at his handiwork then out the window again his hands in their circular motion precise the tiny scrap of sandpaper whispering shhhhh shhhhh like a mother hushing her child a decade ago the days of promise in new york some crazy artist had moved in here hed filled the dank twostory place with broken and rusting antiques wroughtiron grilles hunks of crown molding and framed squares of spidered stained glass scabby columns some of the artists work remained on the walls frescoes on the old plaster murals never completed of workers children angstridden lovers round emotionless faces the mans motif stared blankly as if the souls had been nipped out of their smooth bodies the painter was never very successful even after the most ironclad of marketing ideas his own suicide and the bank foreclosed on the building several years ago shhhhh the bone collector had stumbled across the place last year and hed known immediately that this was home the desolation of the neighborhood was certainly important to him it was obviously practical but there was another appeal more personal the lot across the street during some excavation several years ago a backhoe had unearthed a load of human bones it turned out this had been one of the citys old cemeteries newspaper articles about it suggested the graves might contain the remains not only of federal and colonial new yorkers but manate and lenape indians as well he now set aside what hed been smoothing with the emery paper a carpal the delicate palm bone and picked up the wrist which hed carefully detached from the radius and ulna last night just before leaving for kennedy airport to collect the first victims it had been drying for over a week and most of the flesh was gone but it still took some effort to separate the elaborate cluster of bones they snapped apart with faint plops like fish breaking the surface of a lake oh the constables they were a lot better than hed anticipated hed been watching them search along pearl street wondering if theyd ever figure out where hed left the woman from the airport astonished when they suddenly ran toward the right building hed guessed it would take two or three victims until they got a feel for the clues they hadnt saved her of course but they might have a minute or two earlier would have made all the difference as with so much in life the navicular the lunate the hamate the capitate the bones intertwined like a greek puzzle ring came apart under his strong fingers he picked bits of flesh and tendon off them he selected the greater multiangulum at the base of where the thumb had once been and began to sand once more shhhhh shhhhhhh the bone collector squinted as he looked outside and imagined he saw a man standing beside one of the old graves it must have been his imagination because the man wore a bowler hat and was dressed in mustardcolored gabardine he rested some dark roses beside the tombstone and then turned away from it dodging the horses and carriages on his way to the elegantly arched bridge over the collect pond outlet at canal street whod he been visiting parents a brother family whod died of consumption or in one of the terrible influenza epidemics thatd been ravaging the city recently recently no not recently of course a hundred years ago thats what he meant he squinted and looked again no sign of the carriages or the horses or the man with the bowler hat though theyd seemed as real as flesh and blood however real they are shhhhh shhhhhh it was intruding again the past he was seeing things thatd happened before that had happened then as if they were now he could control it he knew he could but as he gazed out the window he realized that of course there was no before or after not for him he drifted back and forth through time a day five years a hundred years or two like a dried leaf on a windy day he looked at his watch it was time to leave setting the bone on the mantel he washed his hands carefully like a surgeon then for five minutes he ran a pethair roller over his clothes to pick up any bone dust or dirt or body hairs that might lead the constables to him he walked into the carriage house past the halffinished painting of a moonfaced butcher in a bloody white apron the bone collector started to get into the taxi but then changed his mind unpredictability is the best defense this time hed take the carriage the sedan the ford he started it he drove into the street closed and locked the garage door behind him no before or after as he passed the cemetery the pack of dogs glanced up at the ford then returned to scuffling through the brush looking for rats and nosing madly for water in the unbearable heat no then or now he took the ski mask and gloves from his pocket set them on the seat beside him as he sped out of the old neighborhood the bone collector was going hunting ten something had changed about the room but she couldnt quite decide what lincoln rhyme saw it in her eyes we missed you amelia he said coyly errands she looked away from him apparently nobodyd told my new commander i wouldnt be showing up for work today i thought somebody ought to ah yes she was gazing at the wall slowly figuring it out in addition to the basic instruments that mel cooper had brought with him there was now a scanning electron microscope fitted with the xray unit notation and hotstage scope setups for testing glass a comparison microscope a densitygradient tube for soil testing and a hundred beakers jars and bottles of chemicals and in the middle of the room coopers pride the computerized gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer along with another computer online with coopers own terminal at the ird lab sachs stepped over the thick cables snaking downstairs house current worked yes but the amperage was too taxed for the bedroom outlets alone and in that slight sidestep an elegant practiced maneuver rhyme observed how truly beautiful she was certainly the most beautiful woman hed ever seen in the police department ranks for a brief instant he found her immeasurably appealing people said that sex was all in the mind and rhyme knew that this was true cutting the cord didnt stop the urge he remembered still with a faint crunch of horror a night six months after the accident he and blaine had tried just to see what happened theyd disclaimed trying to be casual no big deal but it had been a big deal sex is a messy business to start with and when you add catheters and bags to the equation you need a lot of stamina and humor and a better foundation than theyd had mostly though what killed the moment and killed it fast was her face he saw in elaine chapman rhymes tough game smile that she was doing it from pity and that stabbed him in the heart he filed for divorce two weeks later elaine had protested but she signed the papers on the first goround sellitto and banks had returned and were organizing the evidence sachs had collected she looked on mildly interested rhyme said to her the latents unit only found eight other recent partials and they belong to the two maintenance men in the building oh he nodded broadly only eight hes complimenting you thom explained enjoy it thats the most youll ever get out of him no translations needed please and thank you thom she responded im happy i could help pleasant as could be well what was this rhyme had fully expected her to storm into his room and fling the evidence bags onto his bed maybe the saw itself or even the plastic bag containing the vics severed hands hed been looking forward to a real knockdown dragout people rarely take the gloves off when they fight with a crip hed been thinking of that look in her eyes when shed met him perhaps evidence of some ambiguous kinship between them but no he saw now he was wrong amelia sachs was like everybody else patting him on the head and looking for the nearest exit with a snap his heart turned to ice when he spoke it was to a cobweb high on the far wall weve been talking about the deadline for the next victim officer there doesnt seem to be specific time what we think sellitto continued whatever this pricks got planned for the next one is something ongoing he doesnt know exactly when the time of death will be lincoln thought maybe hes buried some poor sob someplace where theres not much air sachss eye narrowed slightly at this rhyme noticed it burial alive if youve got to have a phobia thats as good as any they were interrupted by two men in gray suits who climbed the stairs and walked into the bedroom as if they lived here we knocked one of them said we rang the bell said the other no answer they were in their forties one taller than the other but both with the same sandycolored hair they bore identical smiles and before the brooklyn drawl destroyed the image rhyme had thought hayseed farm boys one had an honesttogod dusting of freckles along the bridge of his pale nose gentlemen sellitto introduced the hardy boys detectives bedding and saul the spadework team their skill was canvassing interviewing people who live near a crime scene for wits and leads it was a fine art but one that rhyme had never learned had no desire to he was content to unearth hard facts and hand them off to officers like these who armed with the data became living lie detectors who could shred perps best cover stories neither of them seemed to think it was the least bit weird to be reporting to a bedridden civilian saul the taller of them the frecklee said weve found thirtysix eight if you count a couple of crackheads which he doesnt i do subjects interviewed all of them havent had much luck most of em blind deaf amnesiacs you know the usual no sign of the taxi combed the west side zero zip bedding but tell them the good news we found a wit a witness banks asked eagerly fantastic rhyme considerably less enthusiastic said go on round the tod this morning at the train tracks he saw a man walk down eleventh avenue turn suddenly he said added nofreckle bedding and go through an alley that led to the train underpass he just stood there for a while looking down rhyme was troubled by this that doesnt sound like our boy hes too smart to risk being seen like that but saul continued raising a finger and glancing at his partner there was only one window in the whole hood you could see the place from which is where our wit happened to be standing up early bless his heart before he remembered he was angry with her rhyme asked well amelia hows it feel im sorry her attention returned from the window to be right rhyme said you pegged eleventh avenue not thirtyseventh she didnt know how to respond but rhyme turned immediately back to the twins description our wit couldnt say much was on the sauce already he said it was a smallish guy no hair color race probably white wearing rhyme asked something dark best he could say and doing what sellitto asked i quote he just like stood there looking down i thought he gonna jump you know in front of a train looked at his watch a couple times and then finally left said he kept looking around like he didnt want to be seen what had he been doing rhyme wondered watching the victim die or was this before he planted the body checking to see if the roadbed was deserted sellitto asked walked or drove walked we checked every parking lot and garage in the neighborhood but thats near the convention center so you got parking coming out your ears therere so many lots the attendants stand in the street with orange flags and wave cars in and causa the expo half of them were full by seven we got a list of about nine hundred tags sellitto shook his head follow up on it its delegated said bedding but i betcha thiss one unsub who aint putting cars in lots the detective continued or getting parking tickets rhyme nodded his agreement and asked the building at pearl street one or both of the twins said thats next on our list were on our way rhyme caught sachs checking her watch which sat on her white wrist near her ruddy fingers he instructed thom to add these new characteristics of the unsub to the profile chart you want to interview that guy banks asked the one by the railroad no i dont trust witnesses rhyme said bombastically i want to get back to work he glanced at mel cooper hairs blood bone and a sliver of wood the bone first rhyme instructed morgen young monelle gerger opened her eyes and slowly sat up in the sagging bed in her two years in east greenwich village shed never gotten used to morning her round twentyoneyearold body eased forward and she got a blast of unrelenting august sunlight in her bleary eyes mein gott shed left the club at five home at six made love with brian until seven what time was it now early morning she was sure she squinted at the clock oh fourthirty in the afternoon not so früh morgens after all coffee or laundry it was around this time of day that shed wander over to dojos for a veggieburger breakfast and three cups of their tough coffee there shed meet people she knew clubbies like herself downtown people but shed let a lot of things go lately the domestic things and so now she pulled on two baggy tshirts to hide her chubby figure and jeans hung five or six chains around her neck and grabbed the laundry basket tossed the wisk onto it monelle undid the three dead bolts barring the door she hefted the laundry basket and walked down the dark staircase of the residence hall at the basement level she paused irgend was stimmt hier nicht feeling uneasy monelle looked around the deserted stairway the murky corridors whats different the light thats it the bulbs in the hallre burned out no she looked closely they were missing fucking kidsll steal anything shed moved in here the deutsche haus because it was supposedly a haven for german artists and musicians it turned out to be just another filthy wayoverpriced east village walkup like all the other tenements around here the only difference was that she could bitch to the manager in her native tongue she continued through the basement door into the incinerator room which was so dark she had to grope her way along the wall to make sure she didnt trip over the junk on the floor pushing open the door she stepped into the corridor that led to the laundry room a shuffling a skitter she turned quickly and saw nothing but motionless shadows all she heard was the sound of traffic the groans of an old old building through the dimness past stacks of boxes and discarded chairs and tables under wires caked with greasy dust monelle continued toward the laundry room no bulbs here either she was uneasy recalling something that hadnt occurred to her for years walking with her father down a narrow alley off lange strasse near the obermain brücke on their way to the zoo she must have been five or six her father had suddenly gripped her by the shoulder and pointed to the bridge and told her matteroffactly that a hungry troll lived underneath it when they crossed it on their way home he warned theyd have to walk quickly she now felt a ripple of panic rise up her spine to her crewcut blond hair stupid trolls she continued down the dank corridor listening to the humming of some electrical equipment far off she heard a song by the feuding brothers in oasis the laundry room was dark well if those bulbs were gone that was it shed go upstairs and pound on herr neischens door until he came running shed given him hell for the broken latches on the front and back doors and for the beerguzzling kids he never kicked off the front stoop shed give him hell for the missing bulbs too she reached inside and flicked the switch brilliant white light three large bulbs glowed like suns revealing a room that was filthy but empty monelle strode up to the bank of four machines and dumped the whites in one the colors in the next she counted out quarters dropped them into slots and shoved the levers forward nothing monelle jiggled the lever then hit the machine itself no response shit this gottverdammte building then she saw the power cord some idiot had unplugged the machines she knew who neischen had a twelveyearold son who was responsible for most of the carnage around the building when shed complained about something last year the little shitd tried to kick her she picked up the cord and crouched reaching behind the machine to find the outlet she plugged it in and felt the mans breath on her neck nein he was sandwiched between the wall and the back of the washer barking a fast scream she caught a glimpse of ski mask and dark clothes then his hand clamped down on her arm like an animals jaws she was off balance and he easily jerked her forward she tumbled to the floor hitting her face on the rough concrete and swallowed the scream forming in her throat he was on her in an instant pinning her arms to the concrete slapping a piece of thick gray tape over her mouth hilfe nein bitte nicht bitte nicht he wasnt large but he was strong he easily rolled her over onto her stomach and she heard the ratcheting of the handcuffs closing on her wrists then he stood up for a long moment no sound but the drip of water the rasp of monelles breath the click of a small motor somewhere in the basement waiting for the hands to touch her body to tear off her clothes she heard him walk to the doorway to make sure they were alone oh he had complete privacy she knew furious with herself she was one of the few residents who used the laundry room most of them avoided it because it was so deserted so close to the back doors and windows so far away from help he returned and rolled her over onto her back whispered something she couldnt make out then hanna hanna its a mistake he thinks im somebody else she shook her head broadly trying to make him understand this but then looking at his eyes she stopped even though he wore a ski mask it was clear that something was wrong he was upset he scanned her body shaking his head he closed his gloved fingers around her big arms squeezed her thick shoulders grabbed a pinch of fat she shivered in pain thats what she saw disappointment hed caught her and now he wasnt sure he wanted her after all he reached into his pocket and slowly withdrew his hand the click of the knife opening was like an electric shock it started a jag of sobbing nein nein nein a hiss of breath escaped from his teeth like wind through winter trees he crouched over her debating hanna he whispered what am i going to do then suddenly he made a decision he put the knife away and yanked her to her feet then led her out to the corridor and through the rear door the one with the broken lock shed been hounding herr neischen for weeks to fix eleven a criminalist is a renaissance man hes got to know botany geology ballistics medicine chemistry literature engineering if he knows facts that ash with a high strontium content probably came from a highway flare that faca is portuguese for knife that ethiopian diners use no utensils and eat with their right hands exclusively that a slug with five landandgroove rifling marks right twist could not have been fired by a colt pistol if he knows these things he may just make the connection that places an unsub at the crime scene one subject all criminalists know is anatomy and this was certainly a specialty of lincoln rhymes for he had spent the past three and a half years enmeshed in the quirky logic of bone and nerve he now glanced at the evidence bag from the steam room dangling in jerry bankss hand and announced leg bone not human so its not from the next vic it was a ring of bone about two inches around sawn through evenly there was blood in the tracks left by the saw blade a mediumsized animal rhyme continued large dog sheep goat itd support id guess a hundred to a hundred fifty pounds of weight lets make sure the bloods from an animal though still could be the vics perps had been known to beat or stab people to death with bones rhyme himself had had three such cases the weapons had been a beef knuckle bone a deers leg bone and in one disturbing case the victims own ulna mel cooper ran a geldiffusion test for blood origin well have to wait a bit for the results he explained apologetically unsub appearance caucasian male slight build dark clothing residence prob has safe house vehicle yellow cab other knows cs proc possibly has record knows fr prints gun colt amelia rhyme said maybe you could help us here use the eye loupe and look the bone over carefully tell us what you see not the microscope she asked he thought shed protest but she stepped forward to the bone peered at it with curiosity too much magnification rhyme explained she put on the goggles and bent over the white enamel tray cooper turned on a gooseneck lamp the cutting marks rhyme said is it hacked up or are they even theyre pretty even a power saw rhyme wondered if the animal had been alive when hed done this see anything unusual she pored over the bone for a moment muttered i dont know i dont think so it just looks like a hunk of bone it was then that thom walked past and glanced at the tray thats your clue thats funny funny rhyme said funny sellitto asked you got a theory no theory he bent down and smelled it its osso bucco what veal shank i made it for you once lincoln osso bucco braised veal shank he looked at sachs and grimaced he said it needed more salt goddamn sellitto cried he bought it at a grocery store if were lucky rhyme said he bought it at his grocery store cooper confirmed that the precipitin test showed negative for human blood on the samples sachs had collected probably bovine he said but whats he trying to tell us banks asked rhyme had no idea lets keep going oh anything on the chain and padlock cooper glanced at the hardware in a crisp plastic bag nobody namestamps chain anymore so were out of luck there the locks a securepro middleoftheline model it isnt very secure and definitely not professional how long dit take to break it three whole seconds sellitto said see no serial numbers and its sold in every hardware and variety store in the country key or combination rhyme asked combination call the manufacturer ask them if we take it apart and reconstruct the combination from the tumblers will that tell us which shipment it was in and where it went to banks whistled man thats a long shot rhymes glare sent a ferocious blush across his face and the enthusiasm in your voice detective tells me youre just the one to handle the job yessir the young man held up his cellular phone defensively im on it rhyme asked is that blood on the chain sellitto said one of our boys cut himself pretty bad trying to break the lock off so its contaminated rhyme scowled he was trying to save her sachs said to him i understand that was good of him its still contaminated rhyme glanced back at the table beside cooper prints cooper said hed checked it and found only sellittos print on the links all right the splinter of wood amelia found check for prints i did sachs said quickly at the scene pd rhyme reflected she didnt seem to be the nickname sort beautiful people rarely were lets try the heavy guns just to be sure rhyme said and instructed cooper use dfo or ninhydrin then hit it with the nityag the what banks asked a neodymiumyttrium aluminum garnet laser the tech spritzed the splinter with liquid from a plastic spray bottle and trained the laser beam on the wood he slipped on tinted goggles and examined it carefully nothing he shut off the light and examined the splinter closely it was about six inches long dark wood there were black smears on it like tar and it was impregnated with dirt he held it with forceps i know lincoln likes the chopstick approach cooper said but i always ask for a fork when i go to ming wa s you could be crushing the cells the criminalist grumbled i could be but im not cooper responded what kind of wood rhyme wondered want to run a spodogram no its oak no question saw or plane marks rhyme leaned forward suddenly his neck spasmed and the cramp that bolted through the muscles was unbearable he gasped closed his eyes and twisted his neck stretching he felt thoms strong hands massaging the muscles the pain finally faded lincoln sellitto asked you okay rhyme breathed deeply fine its nothing here cooper brought the piece of wood over to the bed lowered the magnifying goggles over rhymes eyes rhyme examined the specimen cut in the direction of the grain with a frame saw therere big variations in the cuts so id guess it was a post or beam milled over a hundred years ago steam saw probably hold it closer mel i want to smell it he held the splinter under rhymes nose creosote coaltar distillation used for weatherproofing wood before lumber companies started pressuretreating piers docks railroad ties maybe weve got a train buff here sellitto said remember the tracks this morning could be rhyme ordered check for cellular compression mel the tech examined the splinter under the compound microscope its compressed all right but with the grain not against it not a railroad tie this is from a post or column weightbearing a bone an old wooden post i see dirt embedded in the wood that tell us anything cooper set a large pad of newsprint on the table tore the cover off he held the splinter over the pad and brushed some dirt from cracks in the wood he examined the speckles lying on the white paper a reverse constellation you have enough for a densitygradient test rhyme asked in a dg test dirt is poured into a tube containing liquids of different specific gravities the soil separates and each particle hangs suspended according to its own gravity rhyme had established a very extensive library of densitygradient profiles for dirt from all over the five boroughs unfortunately the test only worked with a fair amount of soil cooper didnt think they had enough we could try it but wed have to use the entire sample and if it didnt work we wouldnt have anything left for other tests rhyme instructed him to do a visual then analyze it in the gcms the chromatographspectrometer the technician brushed some dirt onto a slide he gazed at it for a few minutes under the compound microscope this is strange lincoln its topsoil with an unusually high level of vegetation in it but its in a curious form very deteriorated very decomposed he looked up and rhyme noticed the dark lines under his eyes from the eyepieces he remembered that after hours of lab work the marks were quite pronounced and that occasionally a forensic tech would emerge from the ird lab only to be greeted by a chorus of rocky raccoon burn it rhyme ordered cooper mounted a sample in the gcms unit the machine rumbled to life and there was a hiss a minute or two while were waiting rhyme said the bone i keep wondering about the bone scope it mel cooper carefully set the bone onto the examination stage of the compound microscope he went over it carefully whoa got something here what very small transparent hand me the hemostat cooper said to sachs nodding at a pair of gripper tweezers she handed them to him and he carefully probed in the marrow of the bone he lifted something out a tiny piece of regenerated cellulose cooper announced cellophane rhyme said tell me more stretch and pinch marks id say he didnt leave it intentionally there are no cut edges its not inconsistent with heavyduty cello cooper said not inconsistent rhyme scowled i dont like his hedges we have to hedge lincoln cooper said cheerfully associate with suggest i particularly hate not inconsistent very versatile cooper said the boldest ill be is that its probably commercial butcher or grocery store cellophane not saran wrap definitely not genericbrand wrap jerry banks walked inside from the hallway bad news the securepro company doesnt keep any records on combinations a machine sets them at random ah but interesting they said they get calls from the police all the time about their products and youre the first one whos ever thought of tracing a lock through the combination how interesting can it be if its a dead end rhyme grumbled and turned to mel cooper who was shaking his head as he stared at the gcms computer what got that soil sample result but im afraid the machine might be on the fritz the nitrogens off the charts we should run it again use more sample this time rhyme instructed him to go ahead his eyes turned back to the bone mel how recent was the kill he examined some scrapings under the electron microscope minimal bacteria clusters bambi here was recently deceased looks like or just out of the fridge about eight hours so our perp just bought it rhyme said or a month ago and froze it sellitto suggested no cooper said it hasnt been frozen theres no evidence of tissue damage from ice crystals and it hasnt been refrigerated that long its not desiccated modern refrigerators dehydrate food its a good lead rhyme said lets get to work on it get to work sachs laughed are you saying we call up all the grocery stores in the city and find out who sold veal bones yesterday no rhyme countered in the past two days you want the hardy boys let them keep doing what theyre doing call emma downtown if shes still working and if she isnt get her back to the office with the other dispatchers and put them on overtime get her a list of every grocery chain in town ill bet our boy isnt buying groceries for a family of four so have emma limit the list to customers buying five items or less warrants banks asked anybody balks well get a warrant sellitto said but lets try without who knows some citizens might actually cooperate im told it happens but how are the stores going to know who bought veal shanks sachs asked she was no longer as aloof as she had been there was an edge in her voice rhyme wondered if her frustration might be a symptom of what he himself had often felt the burdensome weight of the evidence the essential problem for the criminalist is not that theres too little evidence but that theres too much checkout scanners rhyme said they record purchases on computer for inventory and restocking go ahead banks i see something just crossed your mind speak up i wont send you to siberia this time well only the chains have scanners sir the young detective offered therere hundreds of independents and butcher shops that dont good point but i think he wouldnt go to a small shop anonymitys important to him hell be doing his buying at big stores impersonal sellitto called communications and explained to emma what they needed lets get a polarized shot of the cellophane rhyme said to cooper the technician put the minuscule fragment in a polarizing scope then fitted the polaroid camera to the eyepiece and took a shot it was a colorful picture a rainbow with gray streaks through it rhyme examined it this pattern told them nothing by itself but it could be compared with other cello samples to see if they came from a common source rhyme had a thought lon get a dozen emergency service officers over here on the double here sellitto asked were going to put an operation together youre sure about that the detective asked yes i want them now all right he nodded to banks who made the call to haumann now what about the other planted clue those hairs amelia found cooper poked through them with a probe then mounted several in the phasecontrast microscope this instrument shot two light sources at a single subject the second beam delayed slightly out of phase so the sample was both illuminated and set off by shadow its not human cooper said ill tell you that right now and theyre guard hairs not down hairs from the animals coat he meant what kind dog veal calf banks suggested once again youthfully enthusiastic check the scales rhyme ordered meaning the microscopic flakes that make up the outer sheath of a strand of hair cooper typed on his computer keyboard and a few seconds later thumbnail images of scaly rods popped onto the screen this is thanks to you lincoln remember the database at ird rhyme had compiled a huge collection of micrographs of different types of hair i do yes mel but they were in threering binders when i saw em last how d you get them on the computer scanmaster of course jpeg compressed jaypeg what was that in a few years technology had soared beyond rhyme amazing and as cooper examined the images lincoln rhyme wondered again what hed been wondering all day the question that kept floating to the surface why the clues the human creature is so astonishing but count on it before anything else to be just that a creature a laughing animal a dangerous one a clever one a scared one but always acting for a reason a motive that will move the beast toward its desires scientist lincoln rhyme didnt believe in chance or randomness or frivolity even psychopaths had their own logic twisted though it may have been and he knew there was a reason unsub spoke to them only in this cryptic way cooper called got it rodent probably a rat and the hairs were shaved off thats a hell of a clue banks said therere a million rats in the city that doesnt pin down anyplace whats the point of telling us that sellitto closed his eyes momentarily and muttered something under his breath sachs didnt notice the look she glanced at rhyme curiously he was surprised that she hadnt figured out what the kidnappers message was but he said nothing he saw no reason to share this horrifying bit of knowledge with anyone else for the time being james schneiders seventh victim or eighth should you choose to number poor angelic little maggie oconnor among them was the wife of a hardworking immigrant who had established the familys modest habitation near hester street on the lower east side of the city it was thanks to the courage of this unfortunate woman that the constables and the police discovered the identity of the criminal hanna goldschmidt was of germanjewish extraction and was held in high esteem by the closeknit community in which she her husband and their six children one had died at birth lived the bone collector drove through the streets slowly careful to remain under the speed limit though he knew perfectly well that the traffic cops in new york wouldnt stop you for something as minor as speeding he paused at a light and glanced up at another un billboard his eyes took in the bland smiling faces like the eerie faces painted on the walls of the mansion and then looked beyond it at the city around him he was occasionally surprised to look up and find the buildings so massive the stone cornices so high aloft the glass so smooth the cars so sleek the people so scrubbed the city he knew was dark low smoky smelling of sweat and mud horses would trample you roving gangs of hoodlums some as young as ten or eleven would knock you on the head with a shillelagh or sap and make off with your pocket watch and billfold this was the bone collectors city sometimes though he found himself just like this driving a spiffy silver taurus xl along a smooth asphalt road listening to wnyc and irritated like all new yorkers when he missed a green light wondering why the hell didnt the city let you make right turns on red he cocked his head heard several thumps from the trunk of the car but there was so much ambient noise that no one would hear hannas protests the light changed it is of course exceptional even in these enlightened times for a woman to venture forth into the city streets in the evening unaccompanied by a gentleman and in those days it was more exceptional still yet on this unfortunate night hanna had no choice but to quit her abode for a brief time her youngest had a fever and with her husband praying devoutly at a nearby synagogue she issued forth into the night to secure a poultice for the childs fiery forehead as she closed the door she said to her eldest daughter lock tight the bolt behind me i shall return soon but alas she would not be true to those words for only moments later she chanced to encounter james schneider the bone collector looked around at the shabby streets here this area near where hed buried the first victim was hells kitchen on the west side of the city once the bastion of irish gangs now populated more and more with young professionals ad agencies photo studios and stylish restaurants he smelled manure and wasnt the least surprised when suddenly a horse reared in front of him then he noticed that the animal wasnt an apparition from the s but was being hitched to one of the hansom cabs that cruised central park charging very twentiethcentury fees their stables were located here he laughed to himself though it was a hollow sound one can only speculate as to what occurred for there were no witnesses but we can picture the horror all too clearly the villain drew the struggling woman into an alley and stabbed her with a dagger his cruel intent not to kill but to subdue as was his wont but such was the strength in good mrs goldschmidts soul thinking as she surely was of her fledglings back in the nest that she surprised the monster by assaulting him ferociously she struck him repeatedly about the face and ripped hair from his head she freed herself momentarily and from her mouth issued an horrendous scream the cowardly schneider struck her several times more and fled the brave woman staggered to the sidewalk and collapsed where she died in the arms of a constable who had responded to the alarm neighbors had raised this story appeared in a book which was with the bone collector now resting in his hip pocket crime in old new york he couldnt explain his overwhelming attraction to the slim volume if he had to describe his relation to this book he would have to say he was addicted to it seventyfive years old and still in remarkable shape a bookbinding jewel it was his goodluck charm and his talisman hed found it at a small branch of the public library and committed one of the few larcenies of his life by slipping it into his raincoat one day and strolling out of the building hed read the chapter on schneider a hundred times and virtually had it memorized driving slowly they were almost there when hannas poor weeping husband huddled over her lifeless body he looked upon her face one last time before she was taken to the funeral home for in the jewish faith it is dictated that the dead must be interred as quickly as possible and he noticed upon her porcelain cheek a bruise in the shape of a curious emblem it was a round symbol and appeared to be a crescent moon and a cluster of what might be taken to be stars hovering over the same the constable exclaimed that this must have been an imprint made by the ring of the heinous butcher himself when he struck the poor victim detectives enlisted the aid of an artist and he sketched a picture of the impression the good reader is referred to plate xxii rounds were made of jewelers in the city and several names and addresses were secured of men who had bought such rings in the recent past two of the gentlemen purchasing these rings were beyond suspicion being as they were a deacon of a church and another a learned professor at a fine university yet the third was a man of whom the constables had long harbored suspicion of nefarious activity to wit one james schneider this gentleman had at one time been influential in several benevolent organizations in the city of manhattan the consumptives assistance league and the pensioners welfare society most notably he had come under the eye of the constabulary when several elderly charges from said groups vanished not long after schneider paid them calls he was never charged with any offense but soon after the investigations he dropped from sight in the aftermath of hanna goldschmidts heinous murder a still search of the dubious haunts of the city revealed no abode where schneider might be found the constables posted broadsides throughout the downtown and riverfront areas setting forth the description of the villain but he could not be apprehended a true tragedy to be sure in light of the carnage that was soon to befall the city at his vile hands the streets were clear the bone collector drove into the alley he opened the warehouse door and drove down a wooden ramp into a long tunnel after making sure the place was deserted he walked to the back of the car he opened the trunk and pulled hanna out she was fleshy fat like a bag of limp mulch he grew angry again and he carried her roughly down another wide tunnel traffic from the west side highway sped over them he listened to her wheezing and was just reaching out to loosen the gag when he felt her shudder and go completely limp gasping for breath with the effort of carrying her he rested her on the floor of the tunnel and eased the tape off her mouth air dribbled in weakly had she just fainted he listened to her heart it seemed to be beating fine he cut the clothesline binding her ankles leaned forward and whispered hanna kommen sie mit mir mit hanna goldschmidt nein she muttered her voice trailing to silence he leaned closer lightly slapped her face hanna you must come with me and she screamed mein name ist nicht hanna then kicked him square in the jaw a burst of yellow light flashed through his head and he leapt sideways two or three feet trying to keep his balance hanna sprang up raced blindly down a dark corridor but he was after her fast he tackled her before shed gotten ten yards away she fell hard he did too grunting as he lost his breath he lay on his side for a minute consumed with pain struggling to breathe gripping her tshirts as she thrashed lying on her back hands still cuffed the girl used the only weapon she had one of her feet which she lifted in the air and brought down hard onto his hand a spike of pain shot through him and his glove flew off she lifted her strong leg again and only her bad aim saved him from her heel which slammed so hard into the ground it wouldve broken bones if shed connected so nicht he growled madly and grabbed her by the throat with his bare hand and squeezed until she squirmed and whined and then stopped squirming and whining she trembled several times and went still when he listened to her heart the beating was very faint no tricks this time he snatched up his glove pulled it on and dragged her back through the tunnel to the post bound her feet once more and put a new piece of tape on her mouth as she came to his hand was straying over her body she gasped at first and shrank away as he caressed the flesh behind her ear her elbow her jaw there werent many other places he wanted to touch her she was so padded it disgusted him yet beneath the skin he gripped her leg firmly her wide eyes stared as he fumbled in his pocket and the knife appeared without a moments hesitation he cut through her skin down to the yellowwhite bone she screamed through the tape a manic wail and kicked hard but he held her tight enjoying this hanna the girl sobbed and groaned loudly so he had to lower his ear to her leg to hear the delicious sound of the tip of the blade scraping back and forth on the bone skrisssss then he took her arm they locked eyes for a moment and she shook her head pathetically begging in silence his gaze dropped to her pudgy forearm and again the cut was deep her whole body went rigid with the pain another wild muted scream again he lowered his head like a musician listening to the sound of the blade scraping the ulna back and forth skrisssss skrisssss it was some moments later that he realized shed fainted finally he pried himself away and returned to the car he planted the next clues then took the broom from the trunk and carefully swept over their footsteps he drove up the ramp parked left the engine running and climbed out once more carefully sweeping away the tire tracks he paused and looked back down the tunnel staring at her just staring suddenly a rare smile crossed the bone collectors lips he was surprised that the first of the guests had already shown up a dozen pairs of tiny red eyes two dozen then three it seemed they were gazing at hannas bloody flesh with curiosity and what might have been hunger though that could have been his imagination lord knew it was vivid enough twelve mel go through the colfax womans clothes amelia would you help him she offered him another pleasant nod the sort meant for polite society rhyme realized he was really quite angry with her at the techs direction she pulled on latex gloves gently opened the clothing and ran a horsehair brush through the garments above large sheets of clean newsprint tiny flecks fell out cooper picked them up on tape and examined them through the compound scope not much he reported the steam took care of most of the trace i see a little soil not enough to dg wait excellent ive got a couple of fibers look at these well i cant rhyme thought angrily navy blue acrylicandwool blend id guess it isnt coarse enough to be carpet and its not lobed so its clothing in this heat hes not going to be wearing thick socks or a sweater ski mask thatd be my bet cooper said rhyme reflected so hes serious about giving us a chance to save them if he was bent on killing it wouldnt matter if they saw him or not sellitto added also means the asshole thinks he can get away doesnt have suicide on his mind might just give us some bargaining power if hes got hostages when we nail him i like that optimism of yours lon rhyme said thom answered the buzzer and a moment later jim polling climbed the stairs looking disheveled and harried well shuttling between press conferences the mayors office and the federal building would do that to you too bad about the trout sellitto called to him then explained to rhyme jimmy heres one of those real fishermen ties his own flies and everything me i go out on a party boat with a sixpack and im happy well nail this fucker then worry about the fish polling said helping himself to the coffee thom had left by the window he looked outside and blinked in surprise to find two large birds staring at him he turned back to rhyme and explained that because of the kidnapping hed had to postpone a fishing trip to vermont rhyme had never fished never had the time or inclination for any hobbies but he found he envied polling the serenity of fishing appealed to him it was a sport you could practice in solitude crip sports tended to be inyourface athletics competitive proving things to the world and to yourself wheelchair basketball tennis marathons rhyme decided if he had to have a sport itd be fishing though casting a line with a single finger was probably beyond modern technology polling said the press is calling him a serial kidnapper if the bootie fits rhyme reflected and the mayors going nuts wants to call in the feds i talked the chief into sitting tight on that one but we cant lose another vic well do our best rhyme said caustically polling sipped the black coffee and stepped close to the bed you okay lincoln rhyme said fine polling appraised him for a moment longer then nodded to sellitto brief me we got another press conference in a half hour you see the last one hear what that reporter asked what did we think the vics family felt about her being scalded to death banks shook his head man i nearly decked the fucker polling said three and a half years ago rhyme recalled during the copkiller investigation the captain had smashed a news crews videocam when the reporter wondered if polling was being too aggressive in his investigations just because the suspect dan shepherd was a member of the force polling and sellitto retired to a corner of rhymes room and the detective filled him in when the captain descended the stairs this time rhyme noticed he wasnt half as buoyant as he had been okay cooper announced weve got a hair it was in her pocket the whole shaft rhyme asked without much hope and was not surprised when cooper sighed sorry no bulb without a bulb attached hair isnt individuated evidence its merely class evidence you cant run a dna test and link it to a specific person still it has good probative value the famous canadian mounties study a few years ago concluded that if a hair found at the scene matches a suspects hair the odds are around to that hes the one who left it the problem with hair though is that you cant deduce much about the person it belonged to sex is almost impossible to determine and race cant be reliably established age can be estimated only with infant hair color is deceptive because of wide pigmentation variations and cosmetic dyes and since everybody loses dozens of hairs every day you cant even tell if the suspect is going bald check it against the vics do a scale count and medulla pigmentation comparison rhyme ordered a moment later cooper looked up from the scope its not hers the colfax womans description asked rhyme light brown no kink so id say not negroid pigmentation suggests its not mongoloid so caucasian rhyme said nodding at the chart on the wall confirms what the wit said head or body hair theres little diameter variation and a uniform pigment distribution its head hair length three centimeters thom asked if he should add to the profile that the kidnapper had brown hair rhyme said no well wait for some corroboration just write down that we know he wears a ski mask navy blue fingernail scrapings mel cooper examined the trace but found nothing useful the print you found the one on the wall lets take a look at it could you show it to me amelia sachs hesitated then carried the polaroid over to him your monster rhyme said it was a large deformed palm indeed grotesque not with the elegant swirls and bifurcations of friction ridges but a mottled pattern of tiny lines its a wonderful picture youre a virtual edward weston amelia but unfortunately its not a hand those arent ridges its a glove leather old right mel the technician nodded thom write down that he has an old pair of gloves rhyme said to the others were starting to get some ideas about him hes not leaving his fr prints at the scene but he is leaving glove prints if we find the glove in his possession we can still place him at the scene hes smart but not brilliant sachs asked and what do brilliant criminals wear cottonlined suede rhyme said then asked wheres the filter from the vacuum the technician emptied the cone filter like one from a coffeemaker onto a sheet of white paper trace evidence das and reporters and juries loved obvious clues bloody gloves knives recently fired guns love letters semen and fingerprints but lincoln rhymes favorite evidence was trace the dust and effluence at crime scenes so easily overlooked by perps but the vacuum had captured nothing helpful all right rhyme said lets move on lets look at the handcuffs sachs stiffened as cooper opened the plastic bag and slid the cuffs out onto a sheet of newsprint there was as rhyme had predicted minimal blood the tour doctor from the medical examiners office had done the honors with the razor saw after an nypd lawyer had faxed a release to the me cooper examined the cuffs carefully boyd keller bottom of the line no serial number he sprayed the chrome with dfo and hit the polilight no prints just a smudge from the glove lets open them up cooper used a generic cuff key to click them open with a lenscleaning air puffer he blew into the mechanism youre still mad at me amelia rhyme said about the hands the question caught her off guard i wasnt mad she said after a moment i thought it was unprofessional what you were suggesting do you know who edmond locard was she shook her head a frenchman born in he founded the university of lyons institute of criminalistics he came up with the one rule i lived by when i ran ird locards exchange principle he thought that whenever two human beings come into contact something from one is exchanged to the other and vice versa maybe dust blood skin cells dirt fibers metallic residue it might be tough to find exactly whats been exchanged and even harder to figure out what it means but an exchange does occur and because of that we can catch our unsubs this bit of history didnt interest her in the least youre lucky mel cooper said to sachs not looking up he was going to have you and the medic do a spot autopsy and examine the contents of her stomach it wouldve been helpful rhyme said avoiding her eyes i talked him out of it cooper said autopsy sachs said sighing as if nothing about rhyme could surprise her why she isnt even here he thought angrily her minds a thousand miles away ah cooper said found something i think its a bit of the glove cooper mounted a fleck on the compound microscope examined it leather reddishcolored polished on one side red thats good sellitto said to sachs he explained the wilder their clothes the easier it is to find the perp they dont teach you that at the academy bet sometime ill tell you bout the time we collared jimmy plaid from the gambino crew you remember that jerry you could spot those pants a mile away the young detective said cooper continued the leathers desiccated not much oil in the grain you were right too about them being old what kind of animal id say kidskin high quality if they were new it might mean he was rich rhyme grumbled but since theyre old he mightve found them on the street or bought them secondhand no snappy deductions from s accessorizing looks like okay thom just add to the profile that the gloves are reddish kidskin what else do we have he wears aftershave sachs reminded him forgot that good maybe to cover up another scent unsubs do that sometimes write it down thom what did it smell like again amelia you described it dry like gin what about the clothesline rhyme asked cooper examined it ive seen this before plastic several dozen interior filaments composed of six to ten different plastic types and one no two metallic filaments i want a manufacturer and source cooper shook his head impossible too generic damn rhyme muttered and the knot now thats unusual very efficient see how it loops around twice pvc is the hardest cord to tie and this knot aint going anywhere they have a knot file downtown no inexcusable he thought sir rhyme turned to banks i do some sailing out of westport rhyme said well as a matter of fact yeah howd you know if there were a forensic test for location of origin jerry banks would turn up positive for connecticut lucky guess it isnt nautical i dont recognize it thats good to know hang it up there rhyme nodded toward the wall next to the polaroid of the cellophane and the monet poster well get to it later the doorbell rang and thom disappeared to answer it rhyme had a bad moment thinking that perhaps it was dr berger returning to tell him he was no longer interested in helping him with their project but the heavy thud of boots told rhyme who had come acalling the emergency services officers all large all somber dressed in combat gear entered the room politely and nodded to sellitto and banks they were men of action and rhyme bet that behind the twenty still eyes were ten very bad reactions to the sight of a man laid up forever on his back gentlemen youve heard about the kidnapping last night and the death of the victim this afternoon he continued through the affirmative muttering our unsub has another victim we have a lead in the case and i need you to hit locations around the city and secure evidence immediately and simultaneously one man one location you mean one mustachioed officer asked uncertainly no backup you wont need it all due respect sir im not inclined to go into any tactical situation without backup a partner at least i dont think therell be any firefights the targets are the major chain grocery stores in town grocery stores not every store just one of every chain j gs shoprite food warehouse what exactly are we going to do buy veal shanks what one package at each store im afraid ill have to ask you to pay from your own pocket gentlemen but the cityll reimburse you oh and we need them asap she lay on her side immobile her eyes had grown accustomed to the dimness of the old tunnel and she could see the little fuckers moving closer one in particular she kept her eye on monelles leg stung like a bitch but most of the pain was in her arm from where hed cut deep into her skin because it was cuffed behind her she couldnt see the wound didnt know how much shed bled but it must have been a lot she was very faint and could feel the sticky ooze all over her arms and side the sound of scratching needlish claws on concrete the graybrown lumps rustling in the shadows the rats continued to twitch their way toward her there must have been a hundred of them she forced herself to stay completely still and kept her eyes on the big black one schwarzie she called him he was in the front moving back and forth studying her monelle gerger had been around the world twice by the time she was nineteen shed hitched through sri lanka and cambodia and pakistan through nebraska where women stared at her eyebrow rings and braless boobs with contempt through iran where men stared at her bare arms like dogs in heat shed slept in city parks in guatemala city and spent three days with rebel forces in nicaragua after getting lost on the way to a wildlife refuge but shed never been so scared as now mein gott and what scared her the most was what she was about to do to herself one rat ran close a small one its brown body zipping forward backing up moving forward again a few inches rats were scary she decided because they were more like reptiles than rodents a snaky nose and snaky tail and those fucking red eyes behind him was schwarzie the size of a small cat he rose up on his haunches and stared at what fascinated him watching waiting then the little one attacked scurrying on his four needlish feet ignoring her muffled scream he darted fast and straight quick as a roach he tore a bite from her cut leg the wound stung like fire monelle squealed in pain yes but from anger too i dont fucking want you she slammed her heel into his back with a dull crunch he quivered once and lay still another one raced up to her neck ripped away a bite then leapt back staring at her twitching his nose as if he were running his tongue around his little rat mouth savoring her flavor dieser schmerz she shivered as the searing burn radiated from the bite dieser schmerz the pain monelle forced herself to lie still again the tiny attacker poised for another run but suddenly he twitched and turned away monelle saw why schwarzie was finally easing to the front of the pack he was coming after what he wanted good good he was the one shed been waiting for because he hadnt seemed interested in the blood or her flesh hed padded up close twenty minutes before fascinated by the silver tape across her mouth the smaller rat scurried back into the swarming bodies as schwarzie eased forward on his obscenely tiny feet paused then advanced again six feet five then three she remained completely still breathing as shallowly as she dared afraid the inhalation would scare him off schwarzie paused padded forward again then stopped two feet away from her head dont move a muscle his back was humped high and his lips kept retracting over his brown and yellow teeth he moved another foot closer and stopped eyes darting sat up rubbed his clawed paws together eased forward again monelle gerger played dead another six inches vorwärts come on then he was at her face she smelled garbage and oil on his body feces rotten meat he sniffed and she felt the unbearable tickle of whiskers on her nose as his tiny teeth emerged from his mouth and began to chew the tape for five minutes he gnawed around her mouth once another rat scooted in sank his teeth into her ankle she closed her eyes to the pain and tried to ignore it schwarzie chased him away then stood in the shadows studying her vorwärts schwarzie come on slowly he padded back to her tears running down her cheek monelle reluctantly lowered her mouth to him chewing chewing come on she felt his vile hot breath in her mouth as he broke through the tape and began to rip off larger chunks of the shiny plastic he pulled the pieces from his mouth and squeezed them greedily in his front claws big enough now she wondered it would have to be she couldnt take any more slowly she lifted her head up one millimeter at a time schwarzie blinked and leaned forward curiously monelle spread her jaws and heard the wonderful sound of the ripping tape she sucked air deep into her lungs she could breathe again and she could shout for help bitte helfen sie mir please help me schwarzie backed away startled by her ragged howl dropping his precious silver tape but he didnt go very far he stopped and turned back rose on his pudgy haunches ignoring his black humped body she kicked the post she was tied to dust and dirt floated down like gray snow but the wood didnt give a bit she screamed until her throat burned bitte help me the sticky rush of traffic swallowed the sound stillness for a moment then schwarzie started toward her again he wasnt alone this time the slimy pack followed his lead twitching nervous but drawn steadily by the tempting smell of her blood bone and wood wood and bone mel what do you have there rhyme was nodding toward the computer attached to the chromatograph spectrometer cooper had once more retested the dirt theyd found in the splinter of wood its still nitrogenrich off the charts three separate tests the results all the same a diagnostic check of the unit showed it was working fine cooper reflected and said that much nitrogen maybe a firearms or ammunition manufacturer thatd be connecticut not manhattan rhyme looked at the clock how fast time had raced past today how slowly it had moved for the past three and a half years he felt as if hed been awake for days and days the young detective pored over the map of manhattan moving aside the pale vertebra that had fallen to the floor earlier the disk had been left here by rhymes sci specialist peter taylor an early appointment with the man the doctor had examined him expertly then sat back in the rustling rattan chair and pulled something out of his pocket showandtell time the doctor had said rhyme had glanced at taylor s open hand thiss a fourth cervical vertebra just like the one in your neck the one that broke see the little tails on the end the doctor turned it over and over for a moment then asked what do you think of when you see it rhyme respected taylor who didnt treat him like a child or a moron or a major inconvenience but that day he hadnt been in the mood to play the inspiration game he hadnt answered taylor continued anyway some of my patients think it looks like a stingray some say its a spaceship or an airplane or a truck whenever i ask that question people usually compare it to something big nobody ever says oh a hunk of calcium and magnesium see they dont like the idea that something so insignificant has made their lives pure hell rhyme had glanced back at the doctor skeptically but the placid grayhaired medico was an old hand at sci patients and he said kindly dont tune me out lincoln taylor had held the disk up close to rhymes face youre thinking its unfair this little thing causing you so much grief but forget that forget it i want you to remember what it was like before the accident the good and bad in your life happiness sadness you can feel that again the doctors face had grown still but frankly all i see now is somebody whos given up taylor had left the vertebra on the bedside table accidentally it seemed but then rhyme realized the act was calculated over the past months while rhyme was trying to decide whether or not to kill himself hed stared at the tiny disk it became an emblem for taylor s argument the proliving argument but in the end that side lost the doctors words as valid as they might be couldnt overcome the burden of pain and heartache and exhaustion lincoln rhyme felt day after day after day he now looked away from the disk to amelia sachs and said i want you to think about the scene again i told you everything i saw not saw i want to know what you felt rhyme remembered the thousands of times hed run crime scenes sometimes a miracle would happen hed be looking around and somehow ideas about the unsub would come to him he couldnt explain how the behaviorists talked about profiling as if theyd invented it but criminalists had been profiling for hundreds of years walk the grid walk where hes walked find what hes left behind figure out what hes taken with him and youll come away from the scene with a profile as clear as a portrait tell me he prodded what did you feel uneasy tense hot she shrugged i dont know i really dont sorry if hed been mobile rhyme would have leapt from the bed grabbed her shoulders and shaken her shouted but you know what im talking about i know you do why wont you work with me why are you ignoring me then he understood something that she was there in the steamy basement hovering over tjs ruined body smelling the vile smell he saw it in the way her thumb flicked a bloody cuticle he saw it in the way she maintained the nomansland of politeness between the two of them she detested being in that vile basement and she hated him for reminding her that part of her was still there youre walking through the room he said i really dont think i can be any more help play along he said forcing his temper down he smiled tell me what you thought her face went still and she said its just thoughts impressions everybodyd have but you were there everybody wasnt tell us it was scary or something she seemed to regret the clumsy word unprofessional i felt somebody watching you he asked this surprised her yes thats exactly it rhyme had felt it himself many times hed felt it three and a half years ago bending down over the decomposing body of the young policeman picking a fiber off the uniform hed been positive that someone was nearby but there was no one just a large oak beam that chose that moment to groan and splinter and come crashing down on the fulcrum of lincoln rhymes fourth cervical vertebra with the weight of the earth what else did you think amelia she wasnt resisting anymore her lips were relaxed her eyes drifting over the curled nighthawks poster the diners lonely or contentedly alone she said well i remember saying to myself man this place is old it was like those pictures you see of turnofthecentury factories and things and i wait rhyme barked lets think about that old his eyes strayed to the randel survey map hed commented before on the unsubs interest in historical new york the building where tj colfax had died was old too and so was the tunnel for the railroad where theyd found the first body the new york central trains used to run aboveground thered been so many crossing fatalities that eleventh avenue had earned the name death avenue and the railroad had finally been forced to move the tracks belowground and pearl street he mused to himself was a major byway in early new york whys he so interested in old things he asked sellitto is terry dobyns still with us oh the shrink yeah we worked a case last year come to think of it he asked about you said he called you a couple times and you never right right right rhyme said get him over here i want his thoughts on s patterns now amelia what else did you think she shrugged but far too nonchalantly nothing no and where did she keep her feelings he wondered recalling something blaine had said once seeing a gorgeous woman walking down fifth avenue the more beautiful the package the harder it is to unwrap i dont know all right i remember one thing i thought but it doesnt mean anything its not like a professional observation professional its a bitch when you set your own standards aint it amelia lets hear it he said to her when you were having me pretend to be him and i found where he stood to look back at her keep going well i thought for a moment it seemed that tears threatened to fill her beautiful eyes they were iridescent blue he noticed instantly she controlled herself i wondered did she have a dog the colfax woman a dog whyd you wonder that she hesitated a moment then said this friend of mine a few years ago we were talking about getting a dog when well if we moved in together i always wanted one a collie it was funny that was the kind my friend wanted too even before we knew each other a dog rhymes heart popped like beetles on a summer screen door and i thought that woman tj rhyme said tj sachs continued i just thought how sad it was if she had any pets she wouldnt be coming home to them and playing with them anymore i didnt think about her boyfriends or husbands i thought about pets but why that thought dogs pets why i dont know why silence finally she said i suppose seeing her tied up there and i was thinking how he stood to the side to watch her just standing between the oil tanks it was like he was watching an animal in a pen rhyme glanced at the sine waves on the gcms computer screen animals nitrogen shit rhyme blurted heads turned toward him its shit staring at the screen yes of course cooper said replastering his strands of hair all the nitrogen its manure and its old manure at that suddenly lincoln rhyme had one of those moments hed reflected on earlier the thought just burst into his mind the image was of lambs sellitto asked lincoln you okay a lamb sauntering down the street it was like he was watching an animal thom sellitto was saying is he all right in a pen rhyme could picture the carefree animal a bell around its neck a dozen others behind lincoln thom said urgently youre sweating are you all right shhhhh the criminalist ordered he felt the tickle running down his face inspiration and heart failure the symptoms are oddly similar think think bones wooden posts and manure yes he whispered a judas lamb leading the flock to slaughter stockyards rhyme announced to the room shes being held in a stockyard thirteen there are no stockyards in manhattan the past lon rhyme reminded him old things turn him on get his juices flowing we should think of old stockyards the older the better in researching his book rhyme had read about a murder that gentleman mobster owney madden was accused of committing gunning down a rival bootlegger outside his hells kitchen townhouse madden was never convicted not for this particular murder at any rate he took the stand and in his melodious britishaccented voice lectured the courtroom about betrayal this entire case has been trumped up by my rivals who are speaking lies about me your honor do you know what they remind me of in my neighborhood in hells kitchen the flocks of lambs were led through the streets from the stockyards to the slaughterhouses on fortysecond street and you know who led them not a dog not a man but one of theirs a judas lamb with a bell around its neck hed lead the flock up that ramp but then hed stop and the rest of them would go on inside im an innocent lamb and those witnesses against me theyre the judases rhyme continued call the library banks they must have a historian the young detective flipped open his cellular phone and called his voice dropped a tone or two as he spoke after he explained what they needed he stopped speaking and gazed at the map of the city well rhyme asked theyre finding someone theyve got he lowered his head as someone answered and the young man repeated his request he started nodding and announced to the room ive got two locations no three unsub appearance caucasian male slight build dark clothingold gloves reddish kidskin aftershave to cover up other scent ski mask navy blue residence prob has safe house vehicle yellow cab other knows cs proc possibly has record knows fr prints gun colt ties vics w unusual knots old appeals to him who is it rhyme barked whore you talking to the curator of the city archives he says thereve been three major stockyard areas in manhattan one on the west side around sixtieth street one in harlem in the s or s and on the lower east side during the revolution we need addresses banks addresses listening hes not sure why cant he look it up tell him to look it up banks responded he heard you sir he says in what look them up in what they didnt have yellow pages back then hes looking at old demographic maps of commercial neighborhoods without street names rhyme groused obviously have him guess thats what hes doing hes guessing rhyme called well we need him to guess fast banks listened nodding what what what what around sixtieth street and tenth the young officer said a moment later lexington near the harlem river and then where the delancey farm was is that near delancey street of course it is from little italy all the way to the east river lots of territory miles cant he narrow it down around catherine street lafayette walker hes not sure near the courthouses sellitto said and told banks get haumanns teams moving divide em up hit all three neighborhoods the young detective made the call then looked up what now we wait rhyme said sellitto muttered i fucking hate waiting sachs asked rhyme can i use your phone rhyme nodded toward the one on his bedside table she hesitated you have one in there she pointed to the hallway rhyme nodded with perfect posture she walked out of the bedroom in the hallway mirror he could see her solemn making the precious phone call who he wondered boyfriend husband daycare center why had she hesitated before mentioning her friend when she told them about the collie there was a story behind that rhyme bet whomever she was calling wasnt there he noticed her eyes turn to darkblue pebbles when there was no answer she looked up and caught rhyme gazing at her in the dusty glass she turned her back the phone slipped to the cradle and she returned to his room there was silence for a full five minutes rhyme lacked the mechanism most people have for bleeding off tension hed been a manic pacer when he was mobile drove the officers in ird crazy now his eyes energetically scanned the randel map of the city as sachs dug beneath her patrol cap and scratched at her scalp invisible mel cooper cataloged evidence calm as a surgeon all but one of the people in the room jumped inordinately when sellittos phone brayed he listened his face broke into a grin got it one of haumanns squads is at eleventh and sixtieth they can hear a womans screams coming from somewhere around there they dunno where for sure theyre doing a doortodoor get your running shoes on rhyme ordered sachs he saw her face sag she glanced at rhymes phone as if it might be ringing with a reprieve call from the governor at any minute then a look at sellitto who was poring over the esu tactical map of the west side amelia rhyme said we lost one thats too bad but we dont have to lose any more if you saw her she whispered if you only saw what he did to her oh but i have amelia he said evenly his eyes relentless and challenging ive seen what happened to tj ive seen what happens to bodies left in hot trunks for a month ive seen what a pound of c does to arms and legs and faces i worked the happy land social club fire over eighty people burned to death we took polaroids of the vics faces or what was left of them for their families to identify because theres no way in hell a human being could walk past those rows of bodies and stay sane except us we didnt have any choice he inhaled against the excruciating pain that swept through his neck see if youre going to get by in this business amelia if youre going to get by in life youre going to have to learn to give up the dead one by one the others in the room had stopped what they were doing and were looking at the two of them no pleasantries now from amelia sachs no polite smiles she tried for a moment to make her gaze cryptic but it was transparent as glass her fury at him out of proportion to his comment roiled through her her long face folded under the dark energy she swept aside a lock of lazy red hair and snatched the headset from the table at the top of the stairs she paused and looked at him with a withering glance reminding rhyme that there was nothing colder than a beautiful womans cold smile and for some reason he found himself thinking welcome back amelia whatcha got you got goodies you got a story you got pictures the scruff sat in a bar on the east side of manhattan third avenue which is to the city what strip malls are to the burbs this was a dingy tavern soon to be rockin with yuppies on the make but now it was the refuge of badly dressed locals eating suppers of questionable fish and limp salads the lean man skin like knotty ebony wore a very white shirt and a very green suit he leaned closer to the scruff you got news you got secret codes you got letters you got shit man ha youre not laughing when you say ha said fred dellray really dellret but that had been generations ago he was six foot four rarely smiled despite the jabberwocky banter and was a star special agent in the manhattan office of the fbi no man im not laughing so whatve you got dellray squeezed the end of a cigarette which perched over his left ear it takes time man the scruff a short man scratched his greasy hair but you aint got time time is precious time is fleeing and time is one thing you aint got dellray put his huge hand under the table on which sat two coffees and squeezed the scruffs thigh until he whined six months ago the skinny little guy had been caught trying to sell automatic ms to a couple of rightwing crazies who whether they actually were or not also happened to be undercover batf agents the feds hadnt wanted the scruff himself of course the greasy little wildeyed thing they wanted whoever was supplying the guns atf swam upstream a ways but no great busts were forthcoming and so they gave him to dellray the bureaus numero uno snitch handler to see if he might be some use so far though hed proved to be just an irritating mousy little skel who didnt apparently have news secret codes or even shit for the feds the only way were dropping down a charge any charge is you give us something beautiful and sticky are we all together on that i dont have nothing for youse guys right now is what im saying just now not true not true you gotchaself somethin i can see it in your face youre knowing something mon a bus pulled up outside with a hiss of brake air a crowd of pakistanis climbed from the open door man that fucking un conference the scruff muttered what the fuck they coming here for this citys too crowded already all them foreigners fucking conference you little skel you little turd dellray snapped whatcha got against world peace nothin now tell me something good i dont know nothin good who you talking to here dellray grinning devilishly im the chameleon i can smilen be happy or i can frown and play squeezie no man no the scruff squealed shit that hurts cut it out the bartender looked over at them and a short glance from dellray sent him back to polishing polished glasses all right maybe i know one thing but i need help i need squeezie time again fuck you man just fuck you oh thats mighty smart dialogue dellray shot back you sound like in those bad movies you know the bad guy and the good guy finally meet like stallone and somebody and all they can say to each other is fuck you man no fuck you no fuck you now youre gonna tell me something useful are we all together on that and just stared at the scruff until he gave up okay heres what it is im trusting you man im yeah yeah yeah whatcha got i was talking to jackie you know jackie i know jackie an he was telling me what was he telling you he was telling me he heard anything anybody got coming in or going out this week dont do it the airports so what was coming in or going out more s i told you man there wasnt nothing i had im telling you what jackie told you right man just in general you know the scruff turned big brown eyes on dellray would i lie to you dont ever lose your dignity the agent warned solemnly pointing a stern finger at the scruffs chest now whats this about airports which one kennedy la guardia i dont know all i know is words up that somebody was gonna be at a airport here somebody who was pretty bad gimme a name dont got a name wheres jackie dunno south africa i think maybe liberia whats all this mean dellray squeezed his cigarette again i guess just there was a chance something was going down you know so nobody should be having shipments coming in then you guess the scruff cringed but dellray wasnt thinking about tormenting the little man any longer he was hearing alarm bells jackie an arms broker both bureaus had known about for a year might have heard something from one of his clients soldiers in africa and central europe and militia cells in america about some terrorist hit at the airports dellray normally wouldntve thought anything about this except for that kidnapping at jfk last night he hadnt paid much attention to it it was nypds case but now he was also thinking about that botched fragging at the unesco meeting in london the other day yo boy dint tell you anything more no man nothing more hey im hungry can we eat somethin remember what i told you about dignity quit moaning dellray stood up i gotta make a call the rrv skidded to a stop on sixtieth street sachs snagged the crimescene suitcase the polilight and the big twelvevolt flashlight did you get her in time sachs called to an esu trooper is she all right no one answered at first then she heard the screams whats going on she muttered running breathless up to the large door which had been battered in by emergency services it opened onto a wide driveway that descended underneath an abandoned brick building shes still there thats right why demanded a shocked amelia sachs they told us not to go in not to go in shes screaming cant you hear her an esu cop said they told us to wait for you they no not they at all lincoln rhyme that son of a bitch we were supposed to find her the officer said youre supposed to go in she clicked the headset on rhyme she barked are you there no answer you goddamn coward give up the dead sonofabitch as furious as shed been storming down the stairs in his townhouse a few minutes ago she was twice as angry now sachs glanced behind her and noticed a medic standing beside an ems bus you come with me he took a step forward and saw her draw her weapon he stopped whoa time out the medic said i dont have to go in until the areas secure now move she spun around and he must have seen more muzzle than he wanted he grimaced and hurried after her from underground they heard aiiiiihilfe then sobbing jesus sachs started to run toward the looming doorway twelve feet high smoky blackness inside she heard in her head youre him amelia what are you thinking go away she said silently but lincoln rhyme didnt go away youre a killer and a kidnapper amelia where would you walk what would you touch forget it im going to save her hell with the crime scene mein gott fleece somevon pleece help go sachs shouted to herself sprint hes not in here youre safe get her go she picked up the pace her utility belt clanking as she ran then twenty feet down the tunnel she pulled up debating she didnt like which side won oh fuck she spat out she set down the suitcase and opened it up she blurted to the medic you whats your name the uneasy young man answered tad walsh i mean whats going on he glanced down into the murk oh bitte helfen sie mir cover me sachs whispered cover you wait a minute i dont do that take the gun all right whatm i supposed to cover you from thrusting the automatic into his hand she dropped to her knees safetys off be careful she grabbed two rubber bands and slipped them over her shoes taking the pistol back she ordered him to do the same with unsteady hands he slipped the bands on im just thinking quiet he could still be here wait a minute now maam the medic whispered this aint in my job description its not in mine either hold the light she handed him the flashlight but if hes here hes probably gonna shoot at the light i mean thats what id shoot at then hold it up high over my shoulder ill go in front if anybody gets shot itll be me then whatta i do tad sounded like a teenager i myselfd run like hell sachs muttered now follow me and keep that beam steady lugging the black cs suitcase in her left hand holding her weapon in front of her she gazed at the floor as they moved into the darkness she saw the familiar broom marks again just like at the other scene bitte nicht bitte nicht bitte there was a brief scream then silence what the hells going on down there tad whispered shhhh sachs hissed they walked slowly sachs blew on her fingers gripping the glock to dry the slick sweat and carefully eyed the random targets of wooden pillars shadows and discarded machinery picked out by the flashlight held unsteadily in tads hand she found no footprints of course not hes smart but were smart too she heard lincoln rhyme say in her thoughts and she told him to shut up slower now five more feet a pause then moving slowly forward trying to ignore the girls moans she felt it again that sensation of being watched the slippery crawl of the iron sights tracking you the body armor she reflected wouldnt stop a fullmetal jacket half the bad guys used black talons anyway so a leg or arm shot would kill you just as efficiently as a chest hit and a lot more painfully nick had told her how one of those bullets could open up a human body one of his partners hit by two of the vicious slugs had died in his arms above and behind thinking of him she remembered one night lying against nicks solid chest gazing at the silhouette of his handsome italian face on her pillow as he told her about hostagerescue entry somebody inside wants to nail you when you go in theyll do it from above and behind shit she dropped to a crouch spinning around and aiming the glock toward the ceiling ready to empty the entire clip what tad whispered cowering what the emptiness gaped at her nothing and breathed deeply stood up dont do that there was a gurgling noise ahead of them jesus came tads high voice again i hate this this guys a pussy she thought i know that cause hes saying everything i want to she stopped shine the light up there ahead oh my everloving sachs finally understood the hairs shed found at the last scene she remembered the look that had passed between sellitto and rhyme hed known then what the unsub had planned hed known this was what was happening to her and still hed told esu to wait she hated him that much more in front of them a pudgy girl lolled on the floor in a pool of blood she glanced toward the light with glazed eyes and passed out just as a huge black rat big as a housecat crawled up onto her belly and moved toward the girls fleshy throat it bared its dingy teeth to take a bite from the girls chin sachs smoothly lifted the chunky black glock her left palm circling under the butt for support she aimed carefully shooting is breathing inhale out squeeze sachs fired her weapon for the first time in the line of duty four shots the huge black rat standing on the girls chest exploded she hit one more on the floor behind and another one that panicking raced toward sachs and the medic the others vanished silently fast as water on sand jesus the medic said you couldve hit the girl from thirty feet sachs snorted not hardly the radio burst to life and haumann asked if they were under fire negative sachs replied just shooing a few rats roger k she took the flashlight from the medic and shining it low started forward its all right miss sachs called youll be all right the girls eyes opened head flipping from side to side bitte bitte she was very pale her blue eyes clung to sachs as if she was afraid to look away bitte bitte pleece her voice rose to a wild keening and she began to sob and thrash in terror as the medic pressed bandages on her wounds sachs cradled her bloody blond head whispering youll be all right honey youll be all right youll be all right fourteen the office high above downtown manhattan looked out over jersey the crap in the air made the sunset absolutely beautiful we gotta we cant gotta fred dellray repeated and sipped his coffee even worse than in the restaurant where the scruff and hed been sitting not long before take it away from em theyll live with it its a local case responded the fbis assistant special agent in charge of the manhattan office the asac was a meticulous man who could never work undercover because when you saw him you thought oh look an fbi agent its not local theyre treating it local but its a big case were down eighty men because of the un thing and thiss related to it dellray said im positive then well tell un security let everybody oh dont give me that look un security un security say you ever heara the words oxymoron billy you see that picture of the scene this morning the hand comin outa the dirt and all the skin cut offa that finger thats a sick fuck out there nypds keeping us informed the asac said smartly weve got behavioral on call if they want oh jesus christ on the merry cross behavioral on call we gotta catch this ripper billy catch him not figger out his ticktocky workings tell me what your snitch said again dellray knew a crack in a rock when he saw one wasnt going to let it seal up again rapid fire now about the scruff and jackie in johannesburg or monrovia and the hushed word throughout the illicit arms trade that something was going down at a new york airport this week so stay clear its him dellray said gotta be nypds got a task force together not antiterror i made calls nobody at at there knows zippo about it to nypd its dead tourists equal bad public relations i want this case billy and fred dellray said the one word hed never uttered in his eight years of undercover work please what groundsre you talking ohoh bullshit question dellray said stroking his index finger like a scolding teacher lessee we got ourselves that spiffy new antiterrorism bill but thats not enough for you you want jurisdiction ill give you jurisdiction a port authority felony kidnapping i can fucking argue that this pricks driving a taxi so hes affecting interstate commerce we dont want to play those games do we billy youre not listening dellray i can recite the us code in my sleep thank you i want to know if were going to take over what we tell people and make everybody happy cause remember after this unsubs bagged and tagged were going to have to keep working with nypd im not going to send my big brother to beat up their big brother even though i can anytime i want lon sellittos running the case and hes a good man a lieutenant dellray snorted he tugged the cigarette out from behind his ear and held it under his nostrils for a moment jim pollings in charge dellray reared back with mock horror polling little adolph the you have the right to remain silent cause ima hit you upside the motherfuckin head polling him the asac had no response for that he said sellittos good a real workhorse ive been with him on two oc task forces that unsubs grabbing bodies right and left and this here boys betting hes going to work his way up meaning we got senators in town we got congressmen we got heads of state i think these folk hes grabbing nowre just for practice you been talking to behavioral and not telling me its what i smell dellray couldnt resist touching his lean nose the asac blew air from his cleanshaven federal agent cheeks whos the ci dellray had trouble thinking of the scruff as a confidential informant which sounded like something out of a dashiell hammett novel most cis were skels short for skeletons meaning scrawny disgusting little hustlers which fit the scruff to a t hes a tick dellray admitted but jackie this guy he heard it froms solid i know you want it fred i understand the asac said this with some sympathy because he knew exactly what was behind dellrays request even as a boy in brooklyn dellray had wanted to be a cop it hadnt mattered much to him what kind of cop as long as he could spend twentyfour hours a day doing it but soon after joining the bureau he found his calling undercover work teamed with his straight man and guardian angel toby dolittle dellray was responsible for sending a large number of perps away for a very long time the sentences totaled close to a thousand years they kin call us the millennium team tobyo he declared to his partner once the clue to dellrays success was his nickname the chameleon bestowed after in the space of twentyfour hours he played a braindead cluckhead in a harlem crack house and a haitian dignitary at a dinner in the panamanian consulate complete with diagonal red ribbon on his chest and impenetrable accent the two of them were regularly loaned out to atf or dea and occasionally city police departments drugs and guns were their specialty though they had a minor in jacked merchandise the irony of undercover work is that the better you are the earlier the retirement word gets around and the big boys the perps worth going after become harder to fox dolittle and dellray found themselves working less in the field and more as handlers of informants and other undercover agents and while it wasnt dellrays first choice nothing excited him like the street it still got him out of the office more often than most sas in the bureau it had never occurred to him to request a transfer until two years ago a warm april morning in new york dellray was just about to leave the office to catch a plane at la guardia when he got a phone call from the assistant director of the bureau in washington the fbi is a nest of hierarchy and dellray couldnt imagine why the big man himself was calling until he heard the ads somber voice break the news that toby dolittle along with an assistant us attorney from manhattan had been on the ground floor of the oklahoma city federal building that morning preparing for the deposition session that dellray himself was just about to depart for their bodies were being flown back to new york the next day which was the same day that dellray put in the first of his rft forms requesting a transfer to the bureaus antiterror division the bombing had been the crime of crimes to fred dellray who when no one was looking devoured books on politics and philosophy he believed there was nothing essentially unamerican about greed or lust hey those qualities were encouraged everywhere from wall street to capitol hill and if people making a business of greed or lust sometimes stepped over the border of legality dellray was pleased to track them down but he never did so with personal animosity but to murder people for their beliefs hell to murder children before they even knew what they believed my god that was a stab at the heart of the country sitting in his tworoom sparsely furnished brooklyn apartment after tobys funeral dellray decided that this was the kind of crime he wanted a crack at but unfortunately the chameleons reputation preceded him the bureaus best undercover agent was now their best handler running agents and cis throughout the east coast his bosses simply couldnt afford to let him go to one of the more quiescent departments of the fbi dellray was a minor legend personally responsible for some of the bureaus greatest recent successes so it was with considerable regret that his persistent requests were turned down the asac was well aware of this history and he now added a sincere i wish i could help out fred im sorry but all dellray heard in these words was the rock cracking a little further and so the chameleon pulled a persona off the rack and stared down his boss he wished he still had his fake gold tooth street man dellray was a tough hombre with one motherfucker of a mean stare and in that look was the unmistakable message anybody on the street would know instinctively i done for you now you do for me finally the smarmy asac said lamely its just that we need something somethin a hook the asac said we dont have a hook a reason to take the case away from nypd he meant politics politics polifuckingtics dellray lowered his head but the eyes brown as polish didnt waver a millimeter from the asac he cut the skin off that vics finger this morning billy clean down to the bone then buried him alive two scrubbed federalagent hands met beneath a crisp jaw the asac said slowly heres a thought theres a deputy commissioner at nypd names eckert you know him hes a friend of mine the girl lay on her back on a stretcher eyes closed conscious but groggy still pale an iv of glucose ran into her arm now that shed been rehydrated she was coherent and surprisingly calm all things considered sachs walked back to the gates of hell and stood looking down into the black doorway she clicked on the radio and called lincoln rhyme this time he answered hows the scene look rhyme asked casually her answer was a curt we got her out if youre interested ah good how is she not good but alive right barely youre upset because of the rats arent you amelia she didnt answer because i didnt let bos men get her right away are you there amelia im here there are five contaminants of crime scenes rhyme explained she noticed hed gone into his low seductive tone again the weather the victims family the suspect souvenir hunters the last is the worst guess what it is you tell me other cops if id let esu in they couldve destroyed all the trace you know how to handle a scene now and ill bet you preserved everything just fine sachs needed to say i dont think shell ever be the same after this the rats were all over her yes i imagine they were thats their nature their nature but five minutes or ten wasnt going to make any difference she click she shut off the radio and walked to walsh the medic i want to interview her is she too groggy not yet we gave her locals to stitch the lacerations and the bites shell want some demerol in a half hour or so sachs smiled and crouched down beside her hi how you doing the girl fat but very pretty nodded can i ask you some questions yes pleece i want you get him sellitto arrived and ambled up to them he smiled down at the girl who gazed at him blankly he proffered a badge she had no interest in and identified himself you all right miss the girl shrugged sweating fiercely in the muggy heat sellitto nodded sachs aside polling been here havent seen him maybe hes at lincolns no i just called there hes gotta get to city hall pronto whats the problem sellitto lowered his voice his doughy face twisted up a fuckup our transmissionsre supposed to be secure but those fucking reporters somebodys got an unscrambler or something they heard we didnt go in right away to get her he nodded toward the girl well we didnt sachs said harshly rhyme told esu to wait until i got here the detective winced man i hope they dont have that on tape we need polling for damage control he nodded to the girl interviewed her yet no just about to with some regret sachs clicked on the radio and heard rhymes urgent voice you there this goddamn thing doesnt im here sachs said coolly what happened interference i guess im with the vic the girl blinked at the exchange and sachs smiled im not talking to myself gestured toward the mike police headquarters whats your name monelle monelle gerger she looked at her bitten arm pulled up a dressing and examined a wound interview her fast rhyme instructed then work the scene hand covering the microphone stalk sachs whispered fiercely to sellitto this man is a pain in the ass to work for sir humor him officer amelia rhyme barked answer me were interviewing her all right she snapped sellitto asked can you tell us what happened monelle began to talk a disjointed story about being in the laundry room of a residence hall in the east village hed been hiding waiting for her what residence hall sellitto asked the deutsche haus its you know mostly german expatriates and students what happened then sellitto continued sachs noted that although the big detective appeared gruffer more ornery than rhyme he was really the more compassionate of the two he threwed me in the trunk of car and drove here did you get a look at him the woman closed her eyes sachs repeated the question and monelle said she hadnt he was as rhyme had guessed wearing a navyblue ski mask und gloves describe them they were dark she didnt remember what color any unusual characteristics the kidnapper no he was white i could tell that did you see the license plate of the taxi sellitto asked was the girl asked drifting into her native tongue did you see sachs jumped as rhyme interrupted das nummernschild thinking how the hell does he know all this she repeated the word and the girl shook her head no then squinted what you mean taxi wasnt he driving a yellow cab taxicab nein no it was regular car hear that lincoln yup our boys got another set of wheels and he put her in the trunk so its not a station wagon or hatchback sachs repeated this the girl nodded like a sedan any idea of the make or color sellitto continued monelle answered light i think maybe silver or gray or that you know what is it light brown beige she nodded maybe beige sachs added for rhymes benefit sellitto asked was there anything in the trunk anything at all tools clothes suitcases monelle said there wasnt it was empty rhyme had a question what did it smell like the trunk sachs relayed the query i dont know oil and grease no it smelled clean so maybe a new car rhyme reflected monelle dissolved into tears for a moment then shook her head sachs took her hand and finally she continued we drove for long time seemed like long time youre doing fine honey sachs said rhymes voice interrupted tell her to strip what take her clothes off i will not have the medics give her a robe we need her clothes amelia but sachs whispered shes crying please rhyme said urgently its important sellitto nodded and sachs tightlipped explained to the girl about the clothes and was surprised when monelle nodded she was it turned out eager to get out of the bloody garments anyway giving her privacy sellitto walked away to confer with bo haumann monelle put on a gown the medic offered her and one of the plainclothes detectives covered her with his sportscoat sachs bagged the jeans and tshirts got them sachs said into the radio now shes got to walk the scene with you rhyme said what but make sure shes behind you so she doesnt contaminate any pe sachs looked at the young woman huddling on a gurney beside the two ems buses shes in no shape to do that he cut her all the way to the bone so shed bleed and the ratsd get her is she mobile probably but you know what shes just been through she can give you the route they walked she can tell you where he stood shes going to the er she lost a lot of blood a hesitation he said pleasantly just ask her but his joviality was fake and sachs heard just impatience she could tell that rhyme was a man who wasnt used to coddling people who didnt have to he was someone used to having his own way he persisted just once around the grid you can go fuck yourself lincoln rhyme its important i know nothing from the other end of the line she was looking at monelle then she heard a voice no her voice say to the girl im going down there to look for evidence will you come with me the girls eyes nailed sachs deep in her heart tears burst no no no i am not doing that bitte nicht oh bitte nicht sachs nodded squeezed the womans arm she began to speak into the mike steeling herself for his reaction but rhyme surprised her by saying all right amelia let it go just ask her what happened when they arrived the girl explained how shed kicked him and escaped into an adjoining tunnel i kick him again she said with some satisfaction knock off his glove then he get all pissed and strangle me he without the glove on rhyme blurted sachs repeated the question and monelle said yes prints excellent rhyme shouted his voice distorting in the mike when did it happen how long ago monelle guessed about an hour and a half hell rhyme muttered prints on skin last an hour ninety minutes tops can you print skin amelia i never have before well youre about to but fast in the cs suitcase therell be a packet labeled kromekote pull out a card she found a stack of glossy fivebyseven cards similar to photographic paper got it do i dust her neck no press the card glossy side down against her skin where she thinks he touched her press for about three seconds sachs did this as monelle stoically gazed at the sky then as rhyme instructed she dusted the card with metallic powder using a puffy magnabrush well rhyme asked eagerly its no good a shape of a finger but no visible ridges should i pitch it never throw away anything at a crime scene sachs he lectured sternly bring it back i want to see it anyway one thing i am thinking i forget said monelle he touch me you mean he molested you sachs asked gently rape no no not in a sex way he touch my shoulder face behind my ear elbow he squeezed me i dont know why you hear that lincoln he touched her but it didnt seem like he was getting off on it yes und and one thing i am forgetting monelle said he spoke german not good like he only study it in school and he call me hanna called her what hanna sachs repeated into the mike do you know why she asked the girl no but thats all he call me he seemed to like saying the name did you get that lincoln yes i did now do the scene times awasting as sachs stood monelle suddenly reached up and gripped her wrist miss sachs you are german she smiled and answered a long time ago a couple generations monelle nodded she pressed sachss palm to her cheek vielen dank thank you miss sachs danke schön fifteen the three esu halogens clicked to light bringing an eerie tide of white glare to the grim tunnel alone now at the scene sachs gazed at the floor for a moment something had changed what she drew her weapon again dropped into a crouch hes here she whispered stepping behind one of the posts what rhyme asked hes come back there were some dead rats here theyre gone she heard rhymes laughter whats so funny no amelia their friends took the bodies away their friends had a case up in harlem once dismembered decomposed body a lot of the bones were hidden in a big circle around the torso the skull was in an oil drum toes underneath piles of leaves had the borough in an uproar the press was talking about satanists serial killers guess who the perp turned out to be no idea she said stiffly the vic himself it was a suicide raccoons rats and squirrels made off with the remains like trophies nobody knows why but they love their souvenirs now where are you at the foot of the ramp what do you see a wide tunnel two side tunnels narrower flat ceiling supported by wooden posts the postsre all battered and nicked the floors old concrete covered with dirt unsub page of appearance caucasian male slight build dark clothingold gloves reddish kidskin aftershave to cover up other scent residence prob has safe house vehicle yellow cab recent model sedan other knows cs proc possibly has record knows fr prints gun colt unsub page of appearance ski mask navy blue gloves are dark residence vehicle lt gray silver beige other ties vics w unusual knots old appeals to him called one vic hanna knows basic german and manure looks like it in the center right in front of mes the post she was tied to windows none no doors either she looked over the wide tunnel the floor disappearing into a black universe a thousand miles away she felt the crawl of hopelessness its too big theres too much space to cover amelia relax ill never find anything here i know it seems overwhelming but just keep in mind that therere only three types of pe that were concerned about objects body materials and impressions thats all its less daunting if you think of it that way easy for you to say and the scene isnt as big as it looks just concentrate on the places they walked go to the post sachs walked the path staring down the esu lights were brilliant but they also made the shadows starker revealing a dozen places the kidnapper could hide a chill trickled down her spine stay close lincoln she thought reluctantly im pissed sure but i wanna hear you breathe or something she paused shone the polilight over the ground is it all swept he asked yes just like before the body armor chafed her breasts despite the sports bra and undershirt and as hot as it was outside it was unbearable down here her skin prickled and she felt a ravenous desire to scratch under her vest im at the post vacuum the area for trace sachs ran the dustbuster hating the noise it covered up any sound of approaching footsteps guns cocking knives being drawn involuntarily she looked behind her once twice nearly dropped the vacuum as her hand strayed to her gun sachs looked at the impression in the dust of where monelles body had lain im him im dragging her along she kicks me i stumble monelle could have kicked in only one direction away from the ramp the unsub didnt fall shed said which meant he mustve landed on his feet sachs walked a yard or two into the gloom bingo sachs shouted what tell me footprints he missed a spot sweeping up not hers no she was wearing running shoes these are smooth soles like dress shoes two good prints well know what size feet hes got no they wont tell us that soles can be larger or smaller than the uppers but it may tell us something in the cs bag theres an electrostatic printer its a small box with a wand on it therell be some sheets of acetate next to it separate the paper lay the acetate on the print and run the wand over it she found the device and made two images of the prints carefully slipped them into a paper envelope sachs returned to the post and heres a bit of straw from the broom from sorry sachs said quickly we dont know where its from a bit of straw im picking it up and bagging it getting good with these pencils hey lincoln you son of a bitch know what im doing to celebrate my permanent retirement from crime scene detail im going out for chinese the esu halogens didnt reach into the side tunnel where monelle had run sachs paused at the daynight line then plunged forward into the shadows the flashlight beam swept the floor in front of her talk to me amelia there isnt much to see he swept up here too jesus he thinks of everything what do you see just marks in the dust i tackle her i bring her down im mad furious i try to strangle her sachs stared at the ground heres something knee prints when he was strangling her he must have straddled her waist he left knee prints and he missed them when he swept electrostatic them she did quicker this time getting the hang of the equipment she was slipping the print into the envelope when something caught her eye another mark in the dust what is that lincoln im looking at the spot where it looks like the glove fell here when they were struggling she clicked on the polilight and couldnt believe what she saw a print ive got a fingerprint what rhyme asked incredulous its not hers nope couldnt be i can see the dust where she was lying her hands were cuffed the whole time its where he picked up the glove he probably thought hed swept here but missed it its a big fat beautiful one stain it light it and shoot the son of a bitch on the onetoone it took her only two tries to get a crisp polaroid she felt like shed found a hundreddollar bill in the street vacuum the area and then go back to the post walk the grid he told her she slowly walked the floor back and forth one foot at a time dont forget to look up he reminded her i once caught an unsub because of a single hair on the ceiling hed loaded a round in a true and the blowback pasted a hair from his hand on the crown molding im looking its a tile ceiling dirty nothing else nowhere to stash anything no ledges or doorways wherere the staged clues he asked i dont see anything back and forth five minutes passed six seven maybe he didnt leave any this time sachs suggested maybe monelles the last no rhyme said with certainty then behind one of the wooden pillars a flash caught her eye heres something in the corner yep here they are shoot it fore you touch it she took a photograph and then picked up a wad of white cloth with the pencils womens underwear wet semen i dont know she said wondering if he was going to ask her to smell it rhyme ordered try the polilight proteins will fluoresce she fetched the light turned it on it illuminated the cloth but the liquid didnt glow no bag it in plastic what else he asked eagerly a leaf long thin pointed at one end it had been cut sometime ago and was dry and turning brown she heard rhyme sigh in frustration therere about eight thousand varieties of deciduous vegetation in manhattan he explained not very helpful whats underneath the leaf why does he think theres anything there but there was a scrap of newsprint blank on one side the other was printed with a drawing of the phases of the moon the moon rhyme mused any prints spray it with ninhydrin and scan it fast with the light a blast of the polilight revealed nothing thats all silence for a moment whatre the clues sitting on oh i dont know you have to know well the ground she answered testily dirt what else would they be sitting on is it like all the rest of the dirt around there yes then she looked closely hell it was different well not exactly its a different color was he always right rhyme instructed bag it in paper as she scooped up the grains he said amelia yeah hes not there rhyme said reassuringly i guess i heard something in your voice im fine she said shortly im smelling the air i smell blood mold and mildew and the aftershave again the same as before yes wheres it coming from sniffing the air sachs walked in a spiral the maypole again until she came to another wooden post here its strongest right here whats here amelia youre my legs and my eyes remember one of these wooden columns like the kind she was tied to about fifteen feet away so he might have rested against it any prints she sprayed it with ninhydrin and shone the light on it no but the smells very strong sample a portion of the post where its the strongest theres a mototool in the case black a portable drill take a sampling bit its like a hollow drill bit and mount it in the tool theres something called a chuck its a i own a drill press she said tersely oh rhyme said she drilled a piece of the post out then flicked sweat from her forehead bag it in plastic she asked he told her yes she felt faint lowered her head and caught her breath no fucking air in here anything else rhyme asked nothing that i can see im proud of you amelia come on back and bring your treasures with you sixteen careful rhyme barked im an expert at this is it new or old shhh thom said oh for christs sake the blade is it old or new dont breathe ah there we go smooth as a babys butt the procedure was not forensic but cosmetic thom was giving rhyme his first shave in a week he had also washed his hair and combed it straight back a half hour before waiting for sachs and the evidence to arrive rhyme had sent cooper out of the room while thom slicked up a catheter with ky and wielded the tube after that business had been completed thom had looked at him and said you look like shit you realize that i dont care why would i care realizing suddenly that he did how bout a shave the young man had asked we dont have time rhymes real concern was that if dr berger saw him groomed hed be less inclined to go ahead with the suicide a disheveled patient is a despondent patient and a wash no weve got company now lincoln finally rhyme had grumbled all right and lets lose those pajamas what do you say theres nothing wrong with them but that meant all right too now scrubbed and shaved dressed in jeans and a white shirt rhyme ignored the mirror his aide held in front of him take that away remarkable improvement lincoln rhyme snorted derisively im going for a walk until they get back he announced and settled his head back into the pillow mel cooper turned to him with a perplexed expression in his head thom explained your head i imagine it rhyme continued thats quite a trick cooper said i can walk through any neighborhood i want and never get mugged hike in the mountains and never get tired climb a mountain if i want go windowshopping on fifth avenue of course the things i see arent necessarily there but so what neither are the stars hows that cooper asked the starlight we see is thousands or millions of years old by the time it gets to earth the stars themselvesve moved theyre not where we see them rhyme sighed as the exhaustion flooded over him i suppose some of them have already burned out and disappeared he closed his eyes hes making it harder not necessarily rhyme answered lon sellitto sellitto banks and sachs had just returned from the stockyard scene underwear the moon and a plant cheerfully pessimistic jerry banks said thats not exactly a road map dirt too rhyme reminded ever appreciative of soil have any idea what they mean sellitto asked not yet rhyme said wheres polling sellitto muttered he still hasnt answered his page havent seen him rhyme said a figure appeared in the doorway as i live and breathe rumbled the strangers smooth baritone rhyme nodded the lankyman inside he was somberlooking but his lean face suddenly cracked into a warm smile as it tended to do at odd moments terry dobyns was the sum total of the nypds behavioral science department hed studied with the fbi behaviorists down at quantico and had degrees in forensic science and psychology the psychologist loved opera and touch football and when lincoln rhyme had awakened in the hospital after the accident three and a half years ago dobyns had been sitting beside him listening to aïda on a walkman hed then spent the next three hours conducting what turned out to be the first of many counseling sessions about rhymes injury now whats this i recall the textbooks sayin bout people who dont return phone calls analyze me later terry you hear about our unsub a bit dobyns said looking rhyme over he wasnt an md but he knew physiology you all right lincoln looking a little peaked im getting a bit of a workout today rhyme admitted and i could use a nap you know what a lazy sob i am yeah right youre the mand call me at three in the morning with some question about a perp and couldnt understand why i was in the sack so whats up you fishin for a profile whatever you can tell usll help sellitto briefed dobyns who as rhyme recalled from the days they worked together never took notes but managed to retain everything he heard inside a head crowned with darkred hair the psychologist paced in front of the wall chart glancing up at it occasionally as he listened to the detectives rumbling voice he held up a finger interrupting sellitto the victims the victims theyve all been found underground buried in a basement in the stockyard tunnel right rhyme confirmed go on sellitto continued explaining about the rescue of monelle gerger fine all right dobyns said absently then braked to a halt and turned to the wall again he spread his legs and hands on hips gazed at the sparse facts about unsub tell me more about this idea of yours lincoln that he likes old things i dont know what to make of it so far his clues have something to do with historical new york building materials from the turn of the century the stockyards the steam system dobyns stepped forward suddenly and tapped the profile hanna tell me about hanna amelia rhyme asked she told dobyns how the unsub had referred to monelle gerger as hanna for no apparent reason she said he seemed to like saying the name and speaking to her in german and he took a bit of a chance to nap her didnt he dobyns noted the cab at the airport that was safe for him but hiding in a laundry room he mustve been real motivated to snatch somebody german dobyns twined some ruddy hair around a lengthy finger and flopped down in one of the squeaky rattan chairs stretched his feet out in front of him okay try this on for size the underground thats the key it tells me hes somebody whos hiding something and when i hear that i start thinking hysteria hes not acting hysterical sellitto said hes pretty damn calm and calculating not hysteria in that sense its a category of mental disorders the condition manifests when something traumatic happens in a patients life and the subconscious converts that trauma into something else its an attempt to protect the patient with traditional conversion hysteria you see physical symptoms nausea pain paralysis but i think here were dealing with a related problem dissociation thats what we call it when the reaction to the trauma affects the mind not the physical body hysterical amnesia fugue states and multiple personalities jekyll and hyde melcooper played straight man this time beating banks to the punch well i dont think hes got true multiple personalities dobyns continued thats a very rare diagnosis and the classic mult pers is young and has a lower iq than your boy he nodded at the profile chart hes slick and hes smart clearly an organized offender dobyns stared out the window for a moment this is interesting lincoln i think your unsub pulls on his other personality when it suits him when he wants to kill and thats important why two reasons first it tells us something about his main personality hes someone whos been trained maybe at his job maybe his upbringing to help people not hurt them a priest a counselor politician social worker and two i think it means hes found himself a blueprint if you can find out what it is maybe you can get a lead to him what kind of blueprint he may have wanted to kill for a long time but he didnt act until he found himself a role model maybe from a book or movie or somebody he actually knows its someone he can identify with someone whose own crimes in effect give him permission to kill now im going out on a limb here climb rhyme said climb his obsession with history tells me that his personality is a character from the past real life that i couldnt say maybe fictional maybe not hanna whoever she is figures in the story somewhere germany too or german americans any idea what mightve set him off freud felt it was caused by what else sexual conflict at the oedipal stage nowadays the consensus is that developmental glitchesre only one cause any trauma can trigger it and it doesnt have to be a single event it could be a personality flaw a long series of personal or professional disappointments hard to say his eyes glowed as they gazed at the profile but i sure hope you bag him alive lincoln id love the chance to get him on the couch for a few hours thom are you writing this down yes bwana but one question rhyme began dobyns whirled around id say its the question lincoln why is he leaving the clues right yep why the clues think about what hes done hes talking to you not rambling incoherently like son of sam or the zodiac killer hes not schizophrenic hes communicating in your language the language of forensics why more pacing eyes flipping over the chart all i can think of is that he wants to share the guilt see its hard for him to kill it becomes easier if he makes us accomplices if we dont save the vics in time their deaths are partly our fault but thats good isnt it rhyme asked it means hell keep giving us clues that are solvable otherwise if the puzzles too hard hes not sharing the burden well thats true dobyns said smiling no longer but theres another factor at work too sellitto supplied the answer serial activity escalates right dobyns confirmed how can he strike more often banks muttered every three hours isnt fast enough oh hell find a way the psychologist continued most likely hell start targeting multiple victims the psychologists eyes narrowed say you all right lincoln there were beads of sweat on the criminalists forehead and hed been squinting his eyes hard just tired a lot of excitement for an old crip one last thing the profile of the victimss vital in serial crimes but here weve got different sexes ages and economic classes all white but hes been preying in a predominantly white pool so thats not statistically significant with what we know so far we cant figure out why hes taken these particular people if you can you might just get ahead of him thanks terry rhyme said stick around for a while sure lincoln if youd like then rhyme ordered lets look at the pe from the stockyard scene whatve we got the underwear mel cooper assembled the bags that sachs had brought back from the scene he glanced at the one containing the underwear katrina fashions damore line he announced one hundred percent cotton elastic band cloth made in the us they were cut and sewn in taiwan you can tell that just by looking at them sachs asked incredulous naw i was reading he answered pointing at the label oh the cops laughed hes telling us hes got another woman then sachs asked probably rhyme said cooper opened the bag dont know what the liquid is ill do a chromatograph rhyme asked thom to hold up the scrap of paper with the phases of the moon on it he studied it closely a scrap like this was wonderful individuated evidence you could fit it to the sheet itd been torn from and link the two as closely as fingerprints the problem here of course was that they had no original piece of paper he wondered if theyd ever find it the unsub might have destroyed it once hed torn this bit out yet lincoln rhyme preferred to think not he liked to picture it somewhere just waiting to be found the way he always pictured source evidence the automobile the paint chip had scraped off of the finger that had lost the nail the gun barrel that had discharged the rifled slug found in the victims body these sources always close to the unsub took on personalities of their own in rhymes mind they could be imperious or cruel or mysterious phases of the moon rhyme asked dobyns if their unsub could be driven to act cyclically no the moon isnt in a major phase right now were four days past new so the moons mean something else if theyre even moons in the first place sachs said pleased with herself and rightly so rhyme thought he said good point amelia maybe hes talking about circles about ink about paper about geometry the planetarium rhyme realized that she was staring at him maybe just realizing now that hed shaved and his hair was combed his clothes changed and what was her mood now he wondered angry at him or disengaged he couldnt tell at the moment amelia sachs was as cryptic as unsub the beeping of the fax machine sounded in the hallway thom went to get it and returned a moment later with two sheets of paper its from emma rollins he announced he held the sheets up for rhyme to see our grocery scanner survey eleven stores in manhattan sold veal shanks to customers buying fewer than five items in the last two days he started to write on the poster then glanced at rhyme the names of the stores of course well need them for crossreferencing later thom wrote them down on the profile chart bway nd shoprite bway th anderson foods greenwich bank shoprite nd ave ndrd grocery world battery park city j gs emporium nd ave anderson foods th lex food warehouse th ave th shoprite houston lafayette shoprite th ave houston j gs emporium greenwich franklin grocery world that narrows it down sachs said to the entire city patience said restless lincoln rhyme mel cooper was examining the straw that sachs had found nothing unique here he tossed it aside is it new rhyme asked if it was they might crossreference stores that had sold brooms and veal shanks on the same day but cooper said thought of that its six months old or older he began shaking the trace evidence in the german girls clothing out over a piece of newsprint several things here he said poring over the sheet dirt enough for a densitygradient nope just dust really probably from the scene cooper looked over the rest of the effluence hed brushed off the bloodstained clothing brick dust whys there so much brick from the rats i shot the wall was brick you shot them at the scene rhyme winced sachs said defensively well yes they were all over her he was angry but he let it go adding just all kinds of contaminants from gunfire lead arsenic carbon silver and here another bit of reddish leather from the glove and weve got another fiber a different one criminalists love fibers this was a tiny gray tuft barely visible to the naked eye excellent rhyme announced and what else and heres the photo of the scene sachs said and the fingerprints the one from her throat and from where he picked up the glove she held them up good rhyme said looking them over carefully there was a sheen of reluctant triumph on her face the rush of winning which is the flip side of hating yourself for being unprofessional rhyme was studying the polaroids of the prints when he heard footsteps on the stairs and jim polling arrived he entered the room did a doubletake at the spiffedup lincoln rhyme and strode to sellitto i was just at the scene he said you saved the vic great job guys he nodded toward sachs to show the noun included her too but the pricks napped another one ors about to rhyme muttered gazing at the prints were working on the clues right now banks said jim ive been trying to track you down sellitto said i tried the mayors office i was with the chief had to fucking beg for some extra searchers got another fifty men pulled off un security detail captain theres something we got to talk about we gotta problem something happened at the last scene a voice as yet unheard from boomed through the room problem who got a problem we dont got no problems here do we none aytall rhyme looked up at the tall thin man in the doorway he was jet black and wore a ridiculous green suit and shoes that shone like brown mirrors rhymes heart plummeted dellray lincoln rhyme new yorks own ironside hey lon and jim polling hows it hangin buddy behind dellray were a halfdozen other men and a woman rhyme knew in a heartbeat why the federal agents were here dellray scanned the officers in the room his attention alighting momentarily on sachs then flying away what do you want polling asked dellray said havent you guessed gemmuns youre outa business we closin you up yessir just like a bookie seventeen one of us thats how dellray was looking at lincoln rhyme as he walked around the bed some people did this paralysis was a club and they crashed the party with jokes nods winks you know i love you man cause im makin funna you lincoln rhyme had learned that this attitude got tiring very very quickly lookit that dellray said poking at the clinitron thats something outa star trek commander riker get your ass in the shuttle go away dellray polling said its our case and hows dis here patient doing dr crusher the captain was stepping forward a rooster the lanky fbi agent towered over dellray you listening go away man ima get me one of those rhyme lay my ass down in it watcha game seriously lincoln how you doin been a few years did they knock rhyme asked thom no they didnt knock you didnt knock rhyme said so may i suggest that you leave gotta warrant dellray murmured flicking papers in his breast pocket amelia sachss right index fingernail worried her thumb which was on the verge of bleeding dellray looked around the room he was clearly impressed at their impromptu lab but strangled the feeling fast were taking over sorry in twenty years of policing rhyme had never seen a peremptory takeover like this unsub page of appearance caucasian male slight build dark clothing residence prob has safe house located near bway nd anderson foods greenwich bank th lex vehicle yellow

soc worker counselor fuck this dellray sellitto began you passed on the case the agent swiveled his glossy black face around until he was looking down at the detective passed passed i never got no ringaling about it djou call me no then who dropped the dime well sellitto surprised glanced at polling who said you got an advisory thats all weve gotta send you on the defensive now too an advisory yeah and hey how xactly was that delivered would that have been by pony express bookrate mail tell me jim whats the good of an overnight advisory when theres an ongoing operation polling said we didnt see the need we dellray asked quickly like a surgeon spotting a microscopic tumor i didnt see the need polling snapped i told the mayor to keep it a local operation weve got it under control now fuck off dellray and you thought you could wrap it up in time for the eleven oclock news rhyme was startled when polling shouted what we thought was none of your goddamn business its our fucking case he knew about the captains legendary temper but hed never seen it in action actually its ouur fucking case now dellray strolled past the table that held coopers equipment rhyme said dont do this fred were getting a handle on this guy work with us but dont take it away this unsub isnt like anything youve ever seen dellray smiled lets see whats the latest i hear about this fucking case that youve got a civvy doin the rensics the agent forewent a glance at the clinitron bed you got a portable doing crime scene you got soldiers out buying groceries evidence standards frederick rhyme reminded stridently thats sop dellray looked disappointed but esu lincoln all those taxpayer dollars then theres cutting up people like texaschainsaw how had that news got out everyone was sworn to secrecy on the dismemberment issue and whatsis i hear bout haumanns boys found the vic but dint go in and save her right away channel five had a big ear mike on it got her screaming for a good five minutes fore you sent somebody in he glanced at sellitto with a wry grin lon my man would thatve been the problem you were just talking about theyd come so far rhyme was thinking they were getting a feel for him starting to learn the unsubs language starting to see him with a burst of surprise he understood that he was once again doing what he loved after all these years and now somebody was going to take it away from him anger rippled inside him take the case fred rhyme grumbled but dont cut us out dont do it you lost two vics dellray reminded we lost one sellitto corrected looking uneasily at polling who was still fuming nothing we coulda done about the first he was a calling card dobyns arms crossed merely observed the argument but jerry banks leapt in weve got his routine down now we arent going to lose any more you are if esus gonna sit around listenin to vics scream their heads off sellitto said it was my my decision rhyme sang out mine but youre civvy lincoln so it couldnt have been your decision it mighta been your suggestion it mighta been your recommendation but i dont think it was your decision dellrays attention had turned to sachs again his eyes on her he said to rhyme you told peretti not to run the scene thats mighty curious lincoln whyd you go and do something like that rhyme said im better than he is perettis not a happy boy scout nosir he and i had a chin wag with eckert eckert the dep com how was he involved and with one glance at sachs at the evasive blue eyes framed by strands of mussed red hair he knew how rhyme nailed her with a look which she promptly avoided and he said to dellray lets see peretti wasnt he the one opened up traffic on the spot where the unsubd stood to watch the first vic wasnt he the one released the scene before wed had a chance to pick up any serious trace the scene my own sachs here had the foresight to seal off my sachs had it right and vince peretti and everybody else had it wrong yes she did she was gazing at her thumb a look that bespoke seeing a familiar sight and slipped a kleenex from her pocket wrapped it around the bloody digit dellray summarized you shoulda called us at the beginning just get out polling muttered something snapped in his eyes and his voice rose get the hell out he screamed even cool dellray blinked and eased back as the spittle flew from the captains mouth rhyme frowned at polling there was a chance they might salvage something of the case but not if polling had a tantrum jim the captain ignored him out he shouted again you are not taking over our case and startling everyone in the room polling leapt forward grabbed the agent by his green lapels and shoved him against the wall after a moment of stunned silence dellray simply pushed the captain back with his fingertips and took out a cellular phone he offered it to polling call the mayor or chief wilson polling eased instinctively away from dellray a short man putting some distance between himself and a tall one you want the case you fucking got it the captain strode to the stairs and then down them the front door slammed jesus fred sellitto said work with us we can nail this scumbag we need the bureaus at said dellray now sounding like reason itself youre not set up for the terrorist angle what terrorist angle rhyme asked the un peace conference snitch o mine said word was up that something was gonna go down at the airport where he snatched the vics i wouldnt profile him as a terrorist dobyns said whatevers going on inside hims psychologically motivated its not ideological well fact is quantico and usre pegging him one way preciate that you feel different but thiss how were handling it rhyme gave up fatigue was spiriting him away he wished sellitto and his scarfaced assistant had never shown up this morning he wished hed never met amelia sachs wished he wasnt wearing the ridiculous crisp white shirt which felt stiff at his neck and felt like nothing below it he realized that dellray was speaking to him im sorry rhyme cocked a muscular eyebrow dellray asked i mean couldnt politics be a motive too motive doesnt interest me rhyme said evidence interests me dellray glanced again at coopers table so the cases ours we all together on that whatre our options sellitto asked you back us up with searchers or you can drop out altogether thats about all thats left well take the pe now you dont mind banks hesitated give em it sellitto ordered the young cop picked up the evidence bags from the most recent scene slipped them into a large plastic bag dellray held his hands out banks glanced at the lean fingers and tossed the bag onto the table walking back to the far side of the room the cop side lincoln rhyme was a demilitarized zone between them and amelia sachs stood riveted at the foot of rhymes bed dellray said to her officer sachs after a pause her eyes on rhyme she responded yes commissioner eckert wants ya tcome with us for debriefing bout the crime scenes he said something about starting your new assignment on monday she nodded dellray turned to rhyme and said sincerely dontcha worry lincoln were gonna git him next you hear his head gonna be on a stake at the gates to the city he nodded to his fellow agents who packed up the evidence and headed downstairs from the hallway dellray called to sachs you coming officer she stood with her hands together like a schoolgirl at a party she regretted shed come to in a minute dellray vanished down the stairs those pricks banks muttered flinging his watchbook onto the table can you believe that sachs rocked on her heels better get going amelia rhyme said your carriage awaits lincoln walking closer to the bed its all right he said you did what you had to do i have no business doing cs work she blurted i never wanted to and you wont be doing it anymore that works out well doesnt it she started to walk to the door then turned and blurted you dont care about anything but the evidence do you sellitto and banks stirred but she ignored them say thom could you show amelia out sachs continued this is all just a game to you isnt it monelle who her eyes flared there see you dont even remember her name monelle gerger the girl in the tunnel she was just a part of the puzzle to you there were rats crawling all over her and you said thats their nature thats their nature shes never going to be the same again and all you cared about was your precious evidence in living victims he droned lecturing rodent wounds are always superficial as soon as the first lil critter drooled on her she needed rabies vaccine what did a few more bites matter why dont we ask her opinion sachss smile was different now it had turned pernicious like those of the nurses and therapy aides who hated crips they walked around rehab wards with smiles like this well he hadnt been happy with the polite amelia sachs hed wanted the feisty one answer me something rhyme why did you really want me thom our guest has overstayed her welcome would you lincoln the aide began thom rhyme snapped believe i asked you to do something because i dont know shit sachs blurted thats why you didnt want a real cs tech because then you wouldnt be in charge but me you can send me here send me there ill do exactly what you want and i wont bitch and moan ah the troops mutiny rhyme said lifting his eyes to the ceiling but im not one of the troops i never wanted this in the first place i didnt want it either but here we are in bed together well one of us and he knew his cold smile was far far icier than any she could muster why youre just a spoiled brat rhyme hey officer time out here sellitto barked but she kept going you cant walk your crime scenes anymore and im sorry about that but youre risking an investigation just to massage your ego and i say fuck that she grabbed her patrol hat and stormed out of the room he expected to hear a slamming door from downstairs maybe breaking glass but there was a faint click and then silence as jerry banks retrieved his watchbook and thumbed through it with more concentration than was needed sellitto said lincoln im sorry i nothing to it rhyme said yawning excessively in the false hope that it would calm his stinging heart nothing at all the cops stood beside the halfempty table for a few moments difficult silence then cooper said better get packed up he hefted a black scope case onto the table and began to unscrew an eyepiece with the loving care of a musician disassembling his saxophone well thom rhyme said its after sunset you know what that tells me bars open their war room was impressive it beat lincoln rhymes bedroom hands down half a floor at the federal building three dozen agents computers and electronic panels out of some tom clancy movie the agents looked like lawyers or investment bankers white shirts ties crisp was the word that came to mind and amelia sachs in the center conspicuous in her navyblue uniform soiled with rat blood dust and grainy shit from cattle dead a hundred years she was no longer shaking from her blowup with rhyme and though her mind kept reeling with a hundred things she wanted to say wished she had said she forced herself to concentrate on what was happening around her a tall agent in an immaculate gray suit was conferring with dellray two large men heads down solemn she believed he was the special agent in charge of the manhattan office thomas perkins but she didnt know for certain a patrol officer has as much contact with the fbi as a dry cleaner or insurance salesman does he seemed humorless efficient and kept glancing at a large map of manhattan pinned to the wall perkins nodded several times as dellray briefed him then he stepped up to a fiberboard table filled with manila folders looked over the agents and began to speak if i could have your attention ive just been in communication with the director and the ag in washington youve all heard about the kennedy airport unsub by now its an unusual profile kidnapping absent a sexual element is rarely the basis for serial activity in fact thiss the first unsub of the sort weve had in the southern district in light of the possible connection with the events at the un this week were coordinating with headquarters quantico and the secretarygenerals office weve been told to be completely proactive on this case its getting prioritization at the highest level the sac glanced at dellray who said weve taken over the case from the nypd but well be using them for backup and person power we have the crime scene officer here to brief us on the scenes dellray sounded completely different here not a shred of superfly have you vouchered the pe perkins asked sachs sachs admitted that she hadnt we were working on saving the vics the sac was troubled by this at trial otherwise solid cases tanked regularly because of slipups in recording the chain of custody of the physical evidence it was the first thing the perps defense lawyers wailed on make sure you do that before you leave yessir what a look on rhymes face when he guessed i bitched to eckert and got them shut down what a look my sachs figured it out my sachs preserved the scene she worried a nail again stop it she told herself as she always did and continued to dig into the flesh the pain felt good thats what the therapists never understood the sac said agent dellray could you brief the room as regards the approach well be taking dellray looked from the sac to the other agents and continued at this moment we have field agents hitting every major terrorist cell in the city and pursuing whatever leads we can find thatll get us to the unsubs residence all cis all undercover agents itll mean compromising some existing operations but weve decided its worth the risk our job here is to be rapid response youll break out into groups of six agents each and be ready to move on any lead youll have complete hostagerescue and barricadeentry support sir sachs said perkins looked up frowning apparently one didnt interrupt briefings until the approved q a break yes what is it officer well im just wondering sir what about the victim who that german girl you think we should interview her again no sir i meant the next victim perkins responded oh well certainly stay cognizant of the fact that there may be other targets sachs continued hes got one now he does the sac glanced at dellray who shrugged perkins asked sachs how do you know well i dont exactly know sir but he left clues at the last scene and he wouldntve done that if he didnt have another vic or was just about to snatch one noted officer the sac continued were going to mobilize as fast as we can to make sure nothing happens to them dellray said to her we think its best to focus on the beast himself detective sachs perkins began im not a detective sir im assigned to patrol yes well the sac continued looking at the stacks of files if you could just give us some of your bullet points that would be helpful thirty agents watching her two women among them just tell us whatcha saw dellray said gripping an unlit cigarette between prominent teeth she gave them a synopsis of her searches of the crime scenes and the conclusions rhyme and terry dobyns had come to most of the agents were troubled by the unsubs curious mo like a goddamn game an agent muttered one asked if the clues had any political messages they could decipher well sir we really dont think hes a terrorist sachs persisted perkins turned his highpowered attention toward her let me ask you officer you concede hes smart this unsub very smart couldnt he be doublebluffing how do you mean you i should say the nypds thinking is that hes just a nutcase i mean a criminal personality but isnt it possible hes smart enough to make you think that when something elses going on like what take those clues he left couldnt they be diversions no sir theyre directions sachs said leading us to the vics i understand that quick thomas perkins said but by doing that hes also leading us away from other targets right she hadnt considered that i suppose its possible and chief wilsons been pulling men off un security detail right and left to work the kidnapping this unsub might be keeping everyone distracted which leaves him free for his real mission sachs remembered that shed had a similar thought herself earlier in the day watching all the searchers along pearl street and thatd be the un we think so dellray said the perps behind the unesco bombing attempt in london might want to try again meaning rhyme was going off in the completely wrong direction it eased the weight of her guilt somewhat now officer could you itemize the evidence for us perkins asked dellray gave her an inventory sheet of everything shed found and she went through it item by item as she spoke sachs was aware of bustling activity around her some agents taking calls some standing and whispering to other agents some taking notes but when glancing down at the sheet she added then i picked up this fingerprint of his at the last scene she realized that the room had fallen utterly silent she looked up every face in the office was staring at her in what could pass for shock if federal agents were capable of that she glanced helplessly at dellray who cocked his head you saying you gotchaself a print well yes his glove fell off in a struggle with the last vic and when he picked it up he brushed against the floor where is it dellray asked quickly jesus one agent called why didnt you say anything well i find it find it somebody else called a murmur ran through the room her hands shaking sachs dug through the evidence bags and handed dellray the polaroid of the fingerprint he held it up looked carefully showed it to someone who she guessed was a frictionridge expert good the agent offered its definitely agrade sachs knew that prints were rated a b and c the lower category being unacceptable to most law enforcement agencies but whatever pride she felt in her evidencegathering skills was crushed by their collective dismay that she hadnt mentioned it before this then everything started to happen at once dellray handed off to an agent who jogged to an elaborate computer in the corner of the office and rested the polaroid on a large curved bed of something called an optiscan another agent turned on the computer and started typing in commands as dellray snatched up the phone he tapped his foot impatiently and then lowered his head as somewhere the call was answered ginnie sdellray thiss gonna be a trueblue pain but i needya to shut down all afis northeast region requests and give the one im sending priority i got perkins here hell okay it and if that aint enough ill call the man in washington himself its the un thing sachs knew the bureaus automated fingerprint identification system was used by police departments throughout the country thats what dellray would be braking to a halt at the moment the agent at the computer said its scanned were transmitting now how longs it gonna take ten fifteen minutes dellray pressed his dusty fingers together please please please all around her was a cyclone of activity sachs heard voices talking about weapons helicopters vehicles antiterror negotiators phone calls clattering keyboards maps unrolling pistols being checked perkins was on the phone talking to the hostagerescue people or the director or the mayor maybe the president who knew sachs said to dellray i didnt know the print was that big a deal salways a big deal least with afis now it is used to be you dusted for prints mostly for show let the vics and the press know you were doing something youre kidding naw not a bit take new york city you do a cold search thats when you dont have any suspects you do a cold search manually itd take a tech fifty years to go through all the print cards no foolin an automated search fifteen minutes used to be youd id a suspect maybe two three percent of the time now were running close to twenty twentytwo percent oh yup printsre golden dincha tell rhyme about it he knew sure and he didnt get all hands on board my oh my the mans slipping say officer sac perkins called holding his hand over the phone ill ask you to complete those chainofcustody cards now i want to get the pe off to pert the physical evidence response team sachs remembered that lincoln rhyme had been the one the feds hired to help put it together ill do that sure mallory kemple take that pe to an office and get our guest some coc cards you have a pen officer yes i do she followed the two men into a small office clicking her ballpoint nervously while they hunted down and returned with a pack of federalissue chainofcustody cards she sat down and broke the package open the voice behind her was the hip dellray the persona that seemed the eagerest to break out in the car on the way here someone had referred to him as the chameleon and she was beginning to see why we call perkins the big dict nyup not dick like youre thinking dict like dictionary but don worry over him hes smartern an agent sandwich and bettern that hes pulled strings all the way to dc which is where strings gotta be pulled in cases like this dellray ran his cigarette beneath his nose as if it were a fine cigar you know officer youre foxy smart doing whatchre doing which is getting out of major crimes you dont want it the lean black face glossy and wrinkled only about the eyes seemed sincere for the first time since shed met him best thing you ever did going into public affairs youll do some good there and it wont turn you to dust thats what happens you bet this job turns you to dust one of the last victims of james schneiders mad compulsion a young man named ortega had come to manhattan from mexico city where political unrest the muchheralded populist uprising which had begun the year before had made commerce difficult at best yet the ambitious entrepreneur had been in the city no more than one week when he vanished from sight it was learned that he was last seen in front of a west side tavern and authorities immediately suspected that he was yet another victim of schneiders sadly this was discovered to be the case the bone collector cruised the streets for fifteen minutes around nyu washington square plenty of people hanging out but kids mostly students in summer school skateboarders it was festive weird singers jugglers acrobats it reminded him of the museums down on the bowery popular in the s they werent museums at all of course but arcades teeming with burlesque shows exhibits of freaks and daredevils and vendors selling everything from french postcards to splinters of the true cross he slowed once or twice but nobody wanted a cab or could afford one he turned south schneider tied bricks to señor ortegas feet and rolled him under a pier into the hudson river so the foul water and the fish might reduce his body to mere bone the corpse was found two weeks after he had vanished and so it was never known whether or not the unfortunate victim was alive or had full use of his senses when he was thrown into the drink yet it is suspected that this was so for schneider cruelly shortened the rope so that señor ortegas face was inches below the surface of davy joness locker his hands undoubtedly thrashed madly about as he gazed upward at the air that would have been his salvation the bone collector saw a sickly young man standing by the curb aids he thought but your bones are healthy and so prominent your bonesll last forever the man didnt want a cab and the taxi cruised past the bone collector hungrily gazing at his thin frame in the rearview mirror he looked back to the street just in time to swerve around an elderly man whod stepped off the curb his thin arm raised to flag down the cab the man leapt back as best he could and the cab skidded to a stop just past him the man opened the back door and leaned inside you should look where youre going he said this instructionally not with anger sorry the bone collector muttered contritely the elderly man hesitated for a moment looked up the street but saw no other taxis he climbed in the door slammed shut thinking old and thin the skin would ride on his bones like silk so where to he called east side you got it he said as he pulled on the ski mask and spun the wheel sharply right the cab sped west iii the portables daughter overturn overturn overturn is the maxim of new york the very bones of our ancestors are not permitted to lie quiet a quarter of a century and one generation of men seem studious to remove all relics of those which preceded them philip hone mayor of new york diary eighteen saturday pm to sunday am hit me again lon rhyme drank through a straw sellitto from a glass both took the smoky liquor neat the detective sank down in the squeaky rattan chair and rhyme decided he looked a little like peter lorre in casablanca terry dobyns was gone after offering some acerbic psychological insights about narcissism and those employed by the federal government jerry banks had left too mel cooper continued to painstakingly disassemble and pack up his equipment this is good lincoln sellitto sipped his scotch goddamn i cant afford this shit how olds it i think that ones twenty the detective eyed the tawny liquor hell this was a woman shed be legal and then some tell me something lon polling that little tantrum of his what was that all about little jimmy sellitto laughed hes in trouble now hes the one ran interference to take peretti off the case and keep it out of the feds hands really went out on a limb asking for you too that took some doing there were noses outa joint over that i dont mean you personally just a civilian in on a hot case like this polling asked for me i thought it was the chief yeah but it was polling put the bug in his ear in the first place he called soon as he heard thered been a taking and there was some bogus pe on the scene and wanted me rhyme wondered this was curious rhyme hadnt had any contact with polling over the past few years not since the copkiller case in which rhyme had been hurt it had been polling whod run the case and eventually collared dan shepherd you seem surprised sellitto said that he asked for me i am we werent on the best of terms didnt used to be anyway whys that i d him an nypd complaint form five six years ago when he was a lieutenant i found him interrogating a suspect right in the middle of a secure scene contaminated it i blew my stack put in a report and it got cited at one of his ia reviews the one where he popped the unarmed suspect well i guess alls forgiven cause he wanted you bad lon make a phone call for me would you sure no thom said lifting the phone out of the detectives hand make him do it himself i didnt have time to learn how it works rhyme said nodding toward the dialing ecu thom had hooked up earlier you didnt spend the time big difference whore you calling berger no youre not thom said its late ive been reading clocks for a while now rhyme replied coolly call him hes staying at the plaza no i asked you to call him here the aide slapped a slip of paper down on the far edge of the table but rhyme read it easily god may have taken much from lincoln rhyme but hed given him the eyesight of a young man he went through the process of dialing with his cheek on the control stalk it was easier than hed thought but he purposely took a long time and muttered as he did it infuriatingly thom ignored him and went downstairs berger wasnt in his hotel room rhyme disconnected mad that he wasnt able to slam the phone down problem sellitto asked no rhyme grumbled where is he rhyme thought testily it was late berger ought to be at his hotel room by now rhyme was stabbed with an odd feeling jealousy that his death doctor was out helping someone else die sellitto suddenly chuckled softly rhyme looked up the cop was eating a candy bar hed forgotten that junk foodd been the staple of the big mans diet when they were working together i was thinking remember bennie ponzo the oc task force ten twelve years ago yeah rhyme had enjoyed organizedcrime work the perps were pros the crime scenes challenging and the vics were rarely innocent who was that mel cooper asked hitman outa bay ridge sellitto said remember after we booked him the candy sandwich rhyme laughed nodding whats the story cooper asked sellitto said okay were down at central booking lincoln and me and a couple other guys and bennie remember he was a big guy he was sitting all hunched over feeling his stomach all of a sudden he goes yo im hungry i wanna candy sandwich and were like looking at each other and i go whats a candy sandwich and he looks at me like im from mars and goes what the fuck you think it is ya take a hershey bar ya put it between two slices of bread and ya eat it thats a fucking candy sandwich they laughed sellitto held out the bar to cooper who shook his head then to rhyme who felt a sudden impulse to take a bite itd been over a year since hed had chocolate he avoided food like that sugar candy troublesome food the little things about life were the biggest burdens the ones that saddened and exhausted you the most okay youll never scubadive or hike the alps so what a lot of people dont but everybody brushes their teeth and goes to the dentist gets a filling takes the train home everybody picks a hunk of peanut from out behind a molar when nobodys looking everybody except lincoln rhyme he shook his head to sellitto and drank a long swallow of scotch his eyes slid back to the computer screen recalling the goodbye letter to elaine hed been composing when sellitto and banks had interrupted him that morning there were some other letters he wanted to write as well the one he was putting off writing was to pete taylor the spinal cord trauma specialist most of the time taylor and rhyme had talked not about the patients condition but about death the doctor was an ardent opponent of euthanasia rhyme felt he owed him a letter to explain why hed decided to go ahead with the suicide and amelia sachs the portables daughter would get a note too he decided crips are generous crips are kind crips are iron crips are nothing if not forgiving dear amelia my dear amelia amelia dear officer sachs inasmuch as we have had the pleasure of working together i would like to take this opportunity to state that although i consider you a betraying judas ive forgiven you furthermore i wish you well in your future career as a kisser of the medias ass whats her story lon sachs aside from the fact shes got a ballbuster temper i didnt know about she married naw a face and bod like that youda thought some goodlookin hunk woulda snagged her by now but she doesnt even date we heard she was going with somebody a few years ago but she never talks about it he lowered his voice lipstick lesboss what the rumor is but i dont know from that my social lifes picking up women at the laundromat on saturday night hey it works what can i say youll have to learn to give up the dead rhyme was thinking about the look on her face when hed said that to her what was that all about then he grew angry with himself for spending any time thinking about her and took a good slug of scotch the doorbell rang then footsteps on the stairs rhyme and sellitto glanced toward the doorway the sound was from the boots of a tall man wearing cityissue jodhpurs and a blue helmet one of nypds elite mounted police he handed a bulky envelope to sellitto and returned down the stairs the detective opened it lookit what we got here he poured the contents onto the table rhyme glanced up with irritation three or four dozen plastic evidence bags all labeled each contained a patch of cellophane from the packages of veal shanks theyd sent esu to buy a note from haumann he read to l rhyme l sellitto from b haumann tsrf whats at cooper asked the police department is a nest of initials and acronyms rmp remote mobile patrol is a squad car ied improvised explosive device is a bomb but tsrf was a new one rhyme shrugged sellitto continued to read chuckling tactical supermarket response force re veal shanks citywide search discovered fortysix subjects all of which were apprehended and neutralized with minimal force we read them their rights and have transported same to detention facility in the kitchen of officer t p giancarlos mother upon completion of interrogation a halfdozen suspects will be transferred to your custody heat at for thirty minutes rhyme laughed then sipped more scotch savoring the flavor this was one thing hed miss the smoky breath of the liquor though in the peace of senseless sleep how could you miss anything just like evidence take away the baseline standard and you have nothing to judge the loss against youre safe for all eternity cooper fanned out some of the samples fortysix samples of the cello one from each chain and the major independents rhyme gazed at the samples the odds were good for class identification individuation of cellophaned be a bitch the scrap found on the veal bone clue wouldnt of course exactly match one of these but because parent companies buy identical supplies for all their stores you might learn in which chain bought the veal and narrow down the neighborhoods he might live in maybe he should call the bureaus physicalevidence team and no no remember its their fucking case now rhyme commanded cooper bundle them up and ship them to our federal brethren rhyme tried shutting down his computer and hit the wrong button with his sometimes ornery ring finger the speakerphone came on with a loud wail of squelch shit rhyme muttered darkly fucking machinery uneasy with rhymes sudden anger sellitto glanced at his glass and joked hell linc scotch this goods supposed to make you mellow got news thom replied sourly he is mellow he parked close to the huge drainpipe climbing from the cab he could smell the fetid water slimy and ripe they were in a culdesac leading to the wide runoff pipe that ran from the west side highway down to the hudson river no one could see them here the bone collector walked to the back of the cab enjoying the sight of his elderly captive just like hed enjoyed staring at the girl hed tied in front of the steam pipe and the wiggling hand by the railroad tracks early this morning gazing at the frightened eyes the man was thinner than hed thought grayer hair disheveled old in the flesh but young in the bone the man cowered away from him arms folded defensively across his narrow chest opening the door the bone collector pressed his pistol against the mans breastbone please his captive whispered his voice quavering i dont have much money but you can have it all we can go to an atm ill get out please dont hurt me the bone collector gestured with his head the frail man looked around miserably then scooted forward he stood beside the car cowering his arms still crossed shivering despite the relentless heat why are you doing this the bone collector stepped back and fished the cuffs from his pocket because he wore the thick gloves it took a few seconds to find the chrome links as he dug them out he thought he saw a fourrigger tacking up the hudson the opposing current here wasnt as strong as in the east river where sailing ships had a hell of a time making their way from the east montgomery and out ward wharves north he squinted no wait it wasnt a sailboat it was just a cabin cruiser yuppies lounging on the long front deck as he reached forward with the cuffs the man grabbed his captors shirt gripped it hard please i was going to the hospital thats why i flagged you down ive been having chest pains shut up and the man suddenly reached for the bone collectors face the liverspotted hands gripping his neck and shoulder and squeezing hard a jolt of pain radiated from the spot where the yellow nails dug into him with a burst of temper he pulled his victims hands off and cuffed him roughly slapping a piece of tape on the mans mouth the bone collector dragged him down the gravel embankment toward the mouth of the pipe four feet in diameter he stopped examined the old man itd be so easy to take you down to the bone the bone touching it hearing it he lifted the mans hand the terrified eyes gazed back his lips trembling the bone collector caressed the mans fingers squeezed the phalanges between his own wished he could take his glove off but didnt dare then he lifted the mans palm and pressed it hard against his own ear what his left hand curled around his mystified captives little finger and slowly pulled until he heard the deep thonk of brittle bone snapping a satisfying sound the man screamed a muted cry stuttering through the tape and slumped to the ground the bone collector pulled him upright and led the stumbling man into the mouth of the pipe he prodded the man forward they emerged underneath the old rotting pier it was a disgusting place strewn with the decomposed bodies of animals and fish trash on the wet rocks a graygreen sludge of kelp a mound of seaweed rose and fell in the water humping like a fat lover despite the evening heat in the rest of the city down here it was cold as a march day señor ortega he lowered the man into the river cuffed him to a pier post ratcheting the bracelet tight around his wrist again the captives grayish face was about three feet above the surface of the water the bone collector walked carefully over the slick rocks to the drainpipe he turned and paused for a moment watching watching he hadnt cared much whether the constables found the others or not hanna the woman in the taxi but this one the bone collector hoped they didnt find him in time indeed that they didnt find him at all so he could come back in a month or two and see if the clever river had scrubbed the skeleton clean back on the gravel drive he pulled the mask off and left the clues to the next scene not far from where hed parked he was angry furious at the constables and so this time he hid the clues and he also included a special surprise something hed been saving for them the bone collector returned to the taxi the breeze was gentle carrying the fragrance of the sour river with it and the rustle of grass and as always in the city the shushhhh of traffic like emery paper on bone he stopped and listened to this sound head cocked as he looked out over the billion lights of the buildings stretching to the north like an oblong galaxy it was then that a woman running fast emerged on a jogging path beside the drainpipe and nearly collided with him in purple shorts and top the thin brunette danced out of his way gasping she stopped flicked sweat from her face in good shape taut muscles but not pretty a hook of a nose broad lips blotchy skin but beneath that youre not supposed you shouldnt park here thiss a jogging path her words fading and fear rising into her eyes which flicked from his face to the taxi to the wad of ski mask in his hand she knew who he was he smiled noting her remarkably pronounced clavicle her right ankle shifted slightly ready to take her weight when she sprinted away but he got her first he ducked low to tackle her and when she gave a fast scream and dropped her arms to block him the bone collector straightened up fast from his feint and swung his elbow into her temple there was a crack like a snapping belt she went down on the gravel hard and lay still horrified the bone collector dropped to his knees and cradled her head he moaned no no no furious with himself for striking so hard sick at heart that he mightve broken what seemed to be a perfect skull beneath the tentacles of stringy hair and the unremarkable face amelia sachs finished another coc card and took a break she paused found a vending machine and bought a paper cup of vile coffee she returned to the windowless office looked over the evidence shed gathered she felt a curious fondness for the macabre collection maybe because of what shed gone through to collect it her fiery joints ached and she still shuddered when she thought of the buried body at the first scene this morning the bloody branch of a hand and of tj colfaxs dangling flesh until today physical evidence hadnt meant anything to her pe was boring lectures on drowsy spring afternoons at the academy pe was math it was charts and graphs it was science it was dead no amie sachs was going to be a people cop walking beats dissing back the dissers outing druggies spreading respect for the law like her father or pounding it into them like handsome nick carelli a fiveyear vet the star of street crimes grinning at the world with his yoyougottaproblem smile thats just who she was going to be she looked at the crisp brown leaf shed found in the stockyard tunnel one of the clues had left for them and here was the underwear too she remembered that i the feebies had snagged the pe before cooperd finished the test on the what was that machine the chromatograph she wondered what the liquid soaking the cotton was but these thoughts led to lincoln rhyme and he was the one person she didnt want to think about just now she began to voucher the rest of the pe each coc card had a series of blank lines that would list the custodians of the evidence in sequence from the initial discovery at the scene all the way to trial sachs had transported evidence several times and her name had appeared on coc cards but this was the first time a sachs nypd had occupied the first slot once again she lifted the plastic bag containing the leaf hed actually touched it him the man whod killed tj colfax whod held monelle gergers pudgy arm and cut deep into it who was out searching for another vic right now if he hadnt already snatched one whod buried that poor man this morning waving for mercy he never got she thought of locards exchange principle people coming into contact each transferring something to the other something big something small most likely they didnt even know what had something of come off on this leaf a cell of skin a dot of sweat it was a stunning thought she felt a trill of excitement of fear as if the killer were right here in this tiny airless room with her back to the coc cards for ten minutes she filled them out and was just finishing the last one when the door burst open startling her she spun around fred dellray stood in the doorway his green jacket abandoned his starched shirt rumpled fingers pinching the cigarette behind his ear step inside a minuter two officer its payoff time thought you might wanna be there sachs followed him down the short corridor two steps behind his lope the afis resultsre comin in dellray said the war room was even busier than before jacketless agents hovered over desks they were armed with their onduty weapons the big sigsauer and smith wesson automatics mm ands a halfdozen agents were clustered around the computer terminal beside the optiscan sachs hadnt liked the way dellrayd taken the case away from them but she had to admit that beneath the slicktalking hipster dellray was one hell of a good cop agents young and old would come up to him with questions and hed patiently answer them hed yank a phone from the cradle and cajole or berate whoever was on the other end to get him what he needed sometimes hed look up across the bustling room and roar we gonna nail this prickdick yep you betcha we are and the straightarrowsd look at him uneasily but with the obvious thought in mind that if anybody could nail him itd be dellray here its coming in now an agent called dellray barked i want open lines to new york jersey and connecticut dmvs and corrections and parole ins too tell em to stand by for an incoming id request put everything else on hold agents peeled off and began making phone calls the computer screen filled she couldnt believe that dellray actually crossed his stickish fingers utter silence throughout the room got him the agent at the keyboard shouted aint no unsub anymore dellray sang melodically bending over the screen listen up people we gotta name victor pietrs born here his parents were from belgrade so we got a serbian connection id brought to us courtesy of new york d of c convictions for drugs assault one with a deadly two sentences served okay listen to this psychiatric history committed three times on involuntary orders intake at bellevue and manhattan psychiatric

there no current new york telephone listing nothing in jersey another agent echoed negative connecticut fuckall dellray muttered mix the names up try variations an lookit phoneservice accounts canceled in the past year for nonpayment for several minutes voices rose and fell like the tide dellray paced manically and sachs understood why his frame was so scrawny suddenly an agent shouted found him everyone turned to look im on with ny dmv another agent called theyve got him its coming through now hes a cabbie got a hack license why don that sprise me dellray muttered shoulda thoughta that wheres home sweet home morningside heights a block from the river the agent wrote down the address and held it aloft as dellray swept past and took it know the neighborhood pretty deserted lotta druggies another agent typed the address into his computer terminal okay checking deeds propertys an old house a banks got title he must be renting you want hrt one agent called across the bustling room i got quantico on the line no time dellray announced use the field office swat get em suited up sachs asked and what about the next victim what next victim hes already taken somebody he knows weve had the clues for an hour or two hedve planted the vic awhile ago he had to no reports of anybody missing the agent said and if he did snatch em theyre probably at his house no they wouldnt be why not theyd pick up too much pe she said lincoln rhyme said he has a safe house well then well get him to tell us where they are another agent said we can be real persuasive lets move it dellray called yo everbody lets thank officer amelia sachs here shes the one found that print and lifted it she was blushing could feel it hated it but she couldnt help herself as she glanced down she noticed strange lines on her shoes squinting she realized she was still wearing the rubber bands when she looked up she saw a room full of unsmiling federal agents checking weapons and heading for the door as they glanced at her the same way she thought lumberjacks look at logs nineteen in a tragedy of massive dimension befell our fair city on march hundreds of industrious young women were hard at work in a garment factory one of the many known notoriously as sweatshops in greenwich village in downtown manhattan so enamored of profits were the owners of this company that they denied the poor girls in their employ even the rudimentary facilities that slaves might enjoy they believed the laborers could not be trusted to make expeditious visits to the restroom facilities and so kept the doors to the cutting and sewing rooms under lock and key the bone collector was driving back to his building he passed a squad car but he kept his eyes forward and the constables never noticed him on the day in question a fire started on the eighth floor of the building and within minutes swept through the factory from which the young employees tried to flee they were unable to escape however owing to the chained state of the door many died on the spot and many more some horribly afire leapt into the air a hundred feet above the cobblestones and died from the collision with unyielding mother earth there numbered victims of the triangle shirtwaist fire the police however were confounded by the inability to locate one of the victims a young woman esther weinraub whom several witnesses had seen leap in desperation from the eighth floor window none of the other girls who similarly leapt survived the fall was it possible that she miraculously had for when the bodies were laid out in the street for bereaved family member to identify poor miss weinraubs was not to be found reports began to circulate of a ghoul a man seen carting off a large bundle from the scene of the fire so incensed were the constables that someone might violate the sacred remains of an innocent young woman that they put on a still search for the man after several weeks their diligent efforts bore fruit two residents of greenwich village reported seeing a man leaving the scene of the fire and carrying a heavy bundle like a carpet over his shoulder the constables picked up his trail and tracked him to the west side of the city where they interviewed neighbors and learned that the man fit the description of james schneider who was still at large they narrowed their search to a decrepit abode in an alley in hells kitchen not far from the th street stockyards as they entered the alleyway they were greeted with a revolting stench he was now driving past the very site of the triangle fire itself maybe hed even been subconsciously prompted to come here the asch building the ironic name of the structure that had housed the doomed factory was gone and the site was now a part of nyu then and now the bone collector would not have been surprised to see whitebloused working girls trailing sparks and faint smoke tumbling gracefully to their deaths falling around him like snow upon breaking into schneiders habitation the authorities found a sight that sent even the most seasoned of them reeling with horror the body of wretched esther weinraub or what remained of it was found in the basement schneider was bent on completing the work of the tragic fire and was slowly removing the womans flesh through means too shocking to recount here a search of this loathsome place revealed a secret room off the basement filled with bones that had been stripped clean of flesh beneath schneiders bed a constable found a diary in which the madman chronicled his history of evil bone schneider wrote is the ultimate core of a human being it alters not deceives not yields not once the facade of our intemperate ways of the flesh the flaws of the lesser races and the weaker gender are burnt or boiled away we are all of us noble bone bone does not lie it is immortal the lunatic writings set forth a chronicle of gruesome experimentation as he sought to ascertain the most effective way of cleansing his victims of their flesh he tried boiling the bodies burning them rendering with lye staking them out for animals and immersing them in water but one method above all he favored for this macabre sport it is best i have concluded his diary continues simply to bury the body in rich earth and let nature do the tedious work this is the most timeconsuming method but the least likely to arouse suspicion as the odors are kept to a minimum i prefer to inter the individuals while still alive though why that might be i cannot say with any certainty in his heretofore secret room three more bodies were discovered in this very condition the splayed hands and agog faces of the poor victims attest that they were indeed alive when schneider piled the last shovelful of dirt upon their tormented crowns it was these dark designs that prompted the journalists of the day to christen schneider with the name by which he was forever after known the bone collector he drove on his mind returning to the woman in the trunk esther weinraub her thin elbow her collarbone delicate as a birds wing he sped the cab forward even risked running two red lights he couldnt wait much longer im not tired rhyme snapped tired or not you need to rest no i need another drink black suitcases lined the wall awaiting the help of officers from the twentieth precinct to transport them back to the ird lab mel cooper was carting a microscope case downstairs lon sellitto was still sitting in the rattan chair but he wasnt saying much just coming to the obvious conclusion that lincoln rhyme was not a mellow drunk at all thom said im sure your blood pressures up you need rest i need a drink goddamn you amelia sachs rhyme thought and didnt know why you should give it up drinkings never been any good for you well i am giving it up rhyme responded silently for good monday and no twelvestep plan for me its a onestepper pour me another drink he ordered not really wanting one no pour me a drink now rhyme snapped no way lon would you please pour me another drink i thom said he doesnt get any more when hes in a mood like this hes insufferable and were not going to put up with him youre going to withhold something from me i could fire you fire away crip abuse ill get you indicted arrest him lon lincoln sellitto said placatingly arrest him the detective was taken aback by the viciousness of rhymes words hey buddy maybe you should go a little light sellitto said oh christ rhyme groaned he started to moan loudly sellitto blurted what is it thom was silent looking on cautiously my liver rhymes face broke into a cruel grin cirrhosis probably thom swung around furious i will not put up with this crap okay no its not ohkay a womans voice from the doorway we dont have much time at all amelia sachs walked into the room glanced at the empty tables rhyme felt spittle on his lip he was overwhelmed with fury because she saw the drool because he wore a crisp white shirt hed changed into just for her and because he wanted desperately to be alone forever alone in the dark of motionless peace where he was king not king for a day but king for eternity the spit tickled he cramped his already sore neck muscles trying to wipe his lip dry thom deftly swiped a kleenex from a box and dried his bosss mouth and chin officer sachs thom said welcome a shining example of maturity we arent seeing much of that right at the moment she wasnt wearing her hat and her navy blouse was open at the collar her long red hair tumbled to her shoulders nobodyd have any trouble differentiating that hair under a comparison scope mel let me in she said nodding toward the stairs isnt it past your bedtime sachs thom tapped a shoulder behave yourself the gesture meant i was just at the federal building she said to sellitto how are our tax dollars doing theyve caught him what sellitto asked just like that jesus they know about it downtown perkins called the mayor the guys a cabbie he was born here but his fathers serbian so theyre thinking hes trying to get even with the un or something got a yellow sheet oh and a history of mental problems too dellray and feebie swatre on their way there right now howd they do it rhyme asked betcha it was the fingerprint she nodded i suspected that would figure prominently and tell me how concerned were they about the next victim theyre concerned she said evenly but mostly they want to nail the unsub well thats their nature and let me guess theyre figuring theyll sweat the location of the vic out of him after they take him down you got it that may take some doing rhyme said ill venture that opinion without the benefit of our dr dobyns and the behavioral mavens so a change of heart amelia whyd you come back because whether dellray collars him or not i dont think we have time to wait to save the next vic i mean oh but were dismantled havent you heard shut down done gone outa business rhyme was looking in the dark computer screen trying to see if his hair had stayed combed you giving up she asked officer sellitto began even if we wanted to do somethin we dont have any of the pe thats the only link ive got it what all of it its downstairs in the rrv the detective glanced out the window sachs continued from the last scene from all the scenes you have it rhyme asked how but sellitto was laughing she jacked it lincoln gawdamn dellray doesnt need it sachs pointed out except for the trial theyve got the unsub well save the victim works out nice hm but mel cooper just left naw hes downstairs i asked him to wait sachs crossed her arms she glanced at the clock after eleven we dont have much time she repeated his eyes too were on the clock lord he was tired thom was right hed been awake longer than in years but he was surprised no shocked to find that while he might have been furious or embarrassed or stabbed with heartless frustration today the passing minutes had not lain like hot unbearable weights on his soul as they had for the past three and a half years well church mice in heaven rhyme barked a laugh thom thom we need coffee on the double sachs get those cello samples to the lab along with the polaroid of the bit mel lifted from the veal bone i want a polarizationcomparison report in an hour and none of this most probably crap i want an answer which grocery chain did our unsub buy the veal bone at and get that little shadow of yours back here lon the one named after the baseball player the black vans sped through side streets this was a more circuitous route to the perps location but dellray knew what he was doing antiterror operations were supposed to avoid major city streets which were often monitored by accomplices dellray in the back of the lead van tightened the velcro strap on the body armor they were less than ten minutes away he looked at the failing apartments the trashfilled lots as they sped along the last time hed been in this decrepit neighborhood hed been rastafarian peter haile thomas from queens hed bought pounds of cocaine from a shriveled little puerto rican who decided at the last minute to jack his buyer he took dellrays buyandbust money and aimed a gun at dellrays groin pulling the trigger as calmly as if he were picking vegetables at the a p click click click misfire toby dolittle and the backup team took the fucker and his minders down before the scumbag found his other piece leaving one shookup dellray to reflect on the irony of nearly getting killed because the perp truly bought the agents performance that he was a dealer not a cop eta four minutes the driver called for some reason dellrays thoughts flipped to lincoln rhyme he regretted hed been such a shit when he took over the case but there hadnt been much choice sellitto was a bulldog and polling was a psycho though dellray could handle them rhyme was the one who made him uneasy sharp as a razor hell it had been his team that found pietrss print even if they didnt jump on it as fast as they shouldve in the old days before his accident you couldnt beat rhyme if he didnt want to get beat and you couldnt fool him either now rhyme was a busted toy it was a sad thing what could happen to a man how you could die and still be alive dellray had walked into his room his bedroom no less and hit him hard harder than he needed to maybe hed call he could show time the driver called and dellray forgot all about lincoln rhyme the vans turned onto the street where pietrs lived most of the other streets theyd passed had been filled with sweating residents clutching beer bottles and cigarettes hoping for a breath or two of cool air but this one was dark empty the vans cruised slowly to a stop two dozen agents climbed out in black tactical outfits carrying their h ks equipped with muzzle lights and laser sights two homeless men stared at them one quickly hid his bottle of colt malt liquor under his shirt dellray gazed at a window in pietrss building it gave off a faint yellow glow the driver backed the first van into a shadowy parking space and whispered to dellray its perkins tapping his headset hes got the director on the horn they want to know whos leading the assault i am snapped the chameleon he turned to his team i want surveillance across the street and in the alleys snipers there there and there an i want everbody in place fi minutes ago are we all together on that down the stairs the old wood creaking his arm around her he guided the woman halfconscious from the blow to her head into the basement at the foot of the stairs he shoved her to the dirt floor and gazed down at her esther her eyes rose to meet his hopeless begging he didnt notice all he saw was her body he began to remove her clothing the purple jogging outfit it was unthinkable that a woman would actually go outside in this day and age wearing what was no more than well undergarments he hadnt thought that esther weinraub was a whore shed been a working girl stitching shirts five for a penny the bone collector observed how her collarbone showed at her throat and where some other man might glance over her breasts and dark areolae he stared at the indentation at the manubrium and the ribs blossoming from it like spiders legs whatre you doing she asked groggy from the blow to her head the bone collector looked her over carefully but what he saw wasnt a young anorectic woman nose too broad lips too full with skin like dirty sand he saw beneath those imperfections the perfect beauty of her structure he caressed her temple stroked it gently dont let it be cracked please she coughed and her nostrils flared the fumes were very strong down here though he hardly noticed them anymore dont hurt me again she whispered her head lolling just dont hurt me please he took the knife from his pocket and bent down cut her underwear off she looked down at her naked body you want that she said breathlessly okay you can fuck me okay the pleasure of the flesh he thought it just doesnt come close he pulled her to her feet and madly she pushed away from him and began stumbling toward a small doorway in the corner of the basement not running not really trying to escape just sobbing reaching out a hand weaving toward the door the bone collector watched her entranced by her slow pathetic gait the doorway which had once opened onto a coal chute now led to a narrow tunnel that connected to the basement of the abandoned building next door esther struggled to the metal door and pulled it open she climbed inside it was no more than a minute later that he heard the wailing scream followed by a breathless wrenching god no no no other words too lost in her boiling howls of terror then she was coming back through the tunnel moving faster now whipping her hands around her as if she was trying to shake off what shed just seen come to me esther stumbling over the dirt floor sobbing come to me running straight into his patient waiting arms which wrapped around her he squeezed the woman tight as a lover felt that marvelous collarbone beneath his fingers and slowly dragged the frantic woman back toward the tunnel doorway twenty the phases of the moon the leaf the damp underwear dirt their team was back in rhymes bedroom all except polling and haumann it was straining nypd loyalty to bring captains in on what was no two ways about it an unauthorized operation you gcd the liquid in the underwear right mel have to do it again they shut us down before we got the results he blotted out a sample and injected it into the chromatograph as he ran the machine sachs jockeyed to look at the peaks and valleys of the profile appearing on the screen like a stock index rhyme realized she was standing close to him as if shed edged near when he wasnt looking she spoke in a low voice i was yes i was blunter than i meant to be before i mean i have a temper i dont know where i got it from but i have it you were right rhyme said they easily held each others eyes and rhyme thought of the times he and blaine had had serious discussions as they talked they always focused on an object between them one of the ceramic horses she collected a book a nearly empty bottle of merlot or chardonnay he said i work scenes differently than most criminalists i needed somebody without any preconceived ideas but i also needed somebody with a mind of her own the contradictory qualities we seek in that elusive perfect lover strength and vulnerability in equal measures when i talked to commissioner eckert she said it was just to get my transfer through thats all i wanted it never occurred to me that wordd get back to the feds and theyd take the case away i know that i still let my temper go im sorry for that dont backpedal sachs i need somebody to tell me im a jerk when i act like one thom does thats why i love him dont get sentimental on me lincoln thom called from across the room rhyme continued nobody else ever tells me to go to hell theyre always walking on eggshells i hate it it doesnt seem like thereve been many people around here to say much of anything to you lately after a moment he said thats true on the screen of the chromatographspectrometer the peaks and valleys stopped moving and became one of natures infinite signatures mel cooper tapped on the computer keys and read the results water diesel oil phosphate sodium trace minerals no idea what it means what rhyme wondered was the message the underwear itself the liquid he said lets move on i want to see the dirt sachs brought him the bag it contained pinkish sand laced with chunks of clay and pebbles bulls liver he announced rockandsand mixture found just above the bedrock in manhattan sodium silicate mixed in cooper ran the chromatograph yep plenty of it then were looking for a downtown location within fifty yards of the water rhyme laughed at the astonished gaze on sachss face its not magic sachs ive just done my homework thats all contractors mix sodium silicate with bulls liver to stabilize the earth when they dig foundations in deepbedrock areas near the water that means its got to be downtown now lets take a look at the leaf she held up the bag no clue what it is rhyme said i dont think ive ever seen one like that not in manhattan ive got a list of horticulture web sites cooper said staring at his computer screen ill do some surfing rhyme himself had spent some time online cruising the internet as it had with books movies and posters his interest in the cyberworld had eventually paled perhaps because so much of his own world was virtual the net was in the end a forlorn place for lincoln rhyme coopers screen flicked and danced as he clicked on hyperlinks and disappeared deeper into the web im downloading some files should take ten twenty minutes rhyme said all right the rest of the clues sachs found not the planted ones the others they might tell us about where hes been lets look at our secret weapon mel secret weapon sachs asked the trace evidence special agent fred dellray had put together a tenman entry operation two teams plus search and surveillance the flakjacketed agents stood in the bushes sweating madly across the street upstairs in an abandoned brownstone the s s team had their big ears and video infrareds trained on the perps house the three snipers with their big remingtons strapped loaded and locked lay prone on rooftops their binoculared spotters crouched beside them like lamaze coaches dellray wearing an fbi windbreaker and jeans instead of his leprechaungreen outfit listened through his clipon earphone surveillance to command weve got infrared on the basement somebody moving down there whatsa view like dellray asked no view windowsre too dirty he all by his humble self maybe got a vic with him knowing somehow that officer sachs was probably right that hed already napped somebody else now cant tell weve just got motion and heat dellray had sent other officers around to the sides of the house they reported in no sign of anyone on the first or second floor garage is locked snipers dellray asked report shooter one to command ive acquired on front door over the others were covering the hallway and a room on the first floor loaded and locked they radioed in dellray drew his large automatic okay we got paper dellray said meaning a warrant they wouldnt have to knock lessgo teams one and two deploy deploy deploy the first team took out the front door with a battering ram while the second used the slightly more civilized approach of breaking in the backdoor window and unlocking the dead bolt they streamed inside dellray following the last of team ones officers into the old filthy house the smell of rotting flesh was overwhelming and dellray no stranger to crime scenes swallowed hard struggling to keep from vomiting the second team secured the ground floor and then charged up the stairs toward the bedroom while the first sped down the basement stairs boots thumping loudly on the old wood dellray raced down into the foulsmelling basement he heard a door being kicked in somewhere below and the shout of dont move federal agents freeze freeze freeze but when he reached the basement doorway he heard the same agent blurt in a very different tone what the hells this oh jesus fuck another one called thats gross shit in a flaming pile dellray spat out choking as he stepped inside swallowing hard at the vile smell the mans body lay on the floor leaching black fluid throat cut his dead glazed eyes stared at the ceiling but his torso seemed to be moving swelling and shifting dellray shuddered hed never developed much immunity to the sight of insect infestation the number of bugs and worms suggested the vicd been dead for at least three days whyd we get positive on the infrared one agent asked dellray pointed out the rat and mouse teeth marks along the vics bloated leg and side theyre around here someplace we interrupted dinner hour so what happened one of the vics get him watcha talkin about dellray snapped isnt that him no its not him dellray exploded gazing at one particular wound on the corpse one of the team was frowning naw dellray thiss the guy we got mug shots thats pietrs of course its fucking pietrs but he aint the unsub dontcha get it no what do you mean it was all clear to him now sumvabitch dellrays phone chirped and made him jump he flipped it open listened for a minute she did what oh like i really need this too no we dont have the fucking perp in fucking custody he jammed the off button pointed an angry finger at two swat agents youre coming with me whats up dellray we gonna pay ourselves a visit and what aint we gonna be when we do it the agents looked at each other frowning but dellray supplied the answer we aint gonna be very nice at all mel cooper shook the contents of the envelopes out onto newsprint examined the dust with an eye loupe well theres the brick dust and some other kind of stone marble i think he put a sample on the slide and examined it under the compound scope yep marble rosecolored was there any marble at the stockyard tunnel where you found the german girl none sachs responded cooper suggested it might have come from monelles residence hall when unsub grabbed her no i know the block the deutsche haus is in its just a converted east village tenement the best stone youd find thered be polished granite maybe just maybe its a fleck of his hideyhole anything notable about it chisel marks cooper said bending over the scope ah good how clean not very ragged so an old steam stonecutter yes id guess write thom rhyme instructed nodding at the poster theres marble in his safe house and its old but why do we care about his safe house banks asked looking at his watch the fedsll be there by now you can never have too much information banks remember that now what elseve we got another bit of the glove that red leather and whats this he asked sachs holding up a plastic bag containing a plug of wood the sample of the aftershave where he brushed up against a post should i run an olfactory profile cooper wondered let me smell it first rhyme said sachs brought the bag over to him inside was a tiny disk of wood she opened it up and he inhaled the air brut how could you miss it thom add that our man uses drugstore cologne cooper announced heres that other hair the technician mounted it in a comparison scope very similar to the one we found earlier probably the same source oh hell lincoln for you ill say it is the same brown are the ends cut or fractured naturally cut good were closing in on hair color rhyme said thom wrote brown just as sellitto said dont write that what obviously its not brown rhyme continued i thought its anything but brown blond sandy black red the detective explained san old trick you go into an alley behind a barbershop cop some hairs from the garbage drop em around the scene oh banks filed this somewhere in his enthusiastic brain rhyme said okay the fiber cooper mounted it in the polarizing scope as he adjusted knobs he said birefringence of rhyme blurted nylon whats it look like mel very coarse lobed crosssection light gray carpet right ill check the database a moment later he looked up from the computer its a hampstead textile b fiber rhyme exhaled a disgusted sigh what sachs asked the most common trunk liner used by us automakers found in over two hundred different makes going back fifteen years hopeless mel is there anything on the fiber use the sem the tech cranked up the scanning electron microscope the screen burst to life with an eerie bluegreen glow the strand of fiber looked like a huge rope got something here crystals a lot of em they use titanium dioxide to deluster shiny carpet that might be it gas it its important theres not enough here lincoln id have to burn the whole fiber so burn it sellitto said delicately borrowing federal evidence is one thing destroying it i dont know bout that lincoln if theres a trial we have to oh man banks said sellitto nodded reluctantly and cooper mounted the sample the machine hissed a moment later the screen flickered and columns appeared there thats the longchained polymer molecule the nylon but that small wave thats something else chlorine detergent its cleanser remember rhyme said the german girl said the car smelled clean find out what kind it is cooper ran the information through a brandname database pfizer chemicals makes it its sold under the name tidikleen by baer automotive products in teterboro perfect cried lincoln rhyme i know the company they sell in bulk to fleets mostly rentalcar companies our unsubs driving a rental he wouldnt be crazy enough to drive a rental car to crime scenes would he banks asked its stolen rhyme muttered as if the young man had asked what was two plus two and itll have stolen tags on it is emma still with us shes probably home by now wake her up and have her start canvassing hertz avis national budget for thefts will do sellitto said though uneasily perhaps smelling the faint stench of burned federal evidence wafting through the air the footprints sachs asked rhyme looked over the electrostatic impressions shed lifted unusual wear on the soles see the rubbeddown portion on the outsides of each shoe at the ball of the foot pigeontoed thom wondered aloud possibly but theres no corresponding heel wear which youd expect to see rhyme studied the prints what i think is hes a reader a reader sit in a chair there rhyme said to sachs and hunch over the table pretend youre reading she sat then looked up and pretend youre turning pages she did several times looked up again keep going youre reading war and peace the pages kept turning her head was bowed after a moment without thinking she crossed her ankles the outside edges of her shoes were the only part that met the floor rhyme pointed this out put that in the profile thom but add a question mark now lets look at the friction ridges sachs said she didnt have the good fingerprint the one theyd idd the unsub with its still at the federal building but rhyme wasnt interested in that print it was the other one the kromekote sachs had lifted from the german girls skin he wanted to look at not scannable cooper announced isnt even c grade i wouldnt give an opinion about this if i had to rhyme said im not interested in identity im interested in that line there it was crescentshaped and sat right in the middle of the pad of the finger what is it sachs asked a scar i think cooper said from an old cut a bad one looks like it went all the way to the bone rhyme thought back to other markings and defects hed seen on skin over the years in the days before jobs became mostly paper shuffling and computer keyboarding it was far easier to tell peoples jobs by examining their hands distorted finger pads from manual typewriters punctures from sewing machines and cobblers needles indentations and ink stains from stenographers and accountants pens paper cuts from printing presses scars from die cutters distinctive calluses from various types of manual labor but a scar like this told them nothing not yet at any rate not until they had a suspect whose hands they might examine what else the knee print this is good give us an idea of what hes wearing hold it up sachs higher baggy slacks it retained that deep crease there so its natural fiber in this weather ill bet cotton not wool you dont see silk slacks much nowadays lightweight not denim cooper said sports clothes rhyme concluded add that to our profile thom cooper looked back at the computer screen and typed some more no luck with the leaf doesnt match anything at the smithsonian rhyme stretched back into his pillow how much time would they have an hour two the moon dirt brine he glanced at sachs who was standing by herself in the corner her head was down and her long red hair fell dramatically toward the floor she was looking into an evidence bag a frown on her face lost in concentration how many times had rhyme himself stood in the same pose trying to a newspaper she cried looking up wheres a newspaper her eyes were frantic as she looked from table to table todays paper what is it sachs rhyme asked she grabbed the new york times from jerry banks and leafed quickly through it that liquid in the underwear she said to rhyme could it be salt water salt water cooper pored over the gcms chart of course water and sodium and other minerals and the oil phosphates its polluted seawater her eyes met rhymes and they said simultaneously high tide she held up the paper open to the weather map it contained a phasesofthemoon diagram identical to the one found at the scene below it was a tidal chart high tides in forty minutes rhymes face curled in disgust he was never angrier than when he was angry with himself hes going to drown the vic theyre under a pier downtown he looked hopelessly at the map of manhattan with its miles of shoreline sachs time to play racecar driver again you and banks go west lon why dont you take the east side around the south street seaport and mel figure out what the hell that leaf is a fluke of wave slapped his sagging head william everett opened his eyes and snorted the shivery water from his nose it was icy cold and he felt his questionable heart stutter as it struggled to send warming blood through his body he almost fainted again like when the son of a bitchd broken his finger then he floated back to waking his thoughts on his late wife and for some reason on their travels theyd been to giza and to guatemala nepal teheran one week before the embassy takeover their southeast china airlines plane had lost one of two engines an hour out of beijing and evelyn had lowered her head the crash position preparing to die and staring at an article in the inflight magazine it warned that drinking hot tea right after a meal was dangerous for you she told him about it afterwards at the raffles bar in singapore and theyd laughed hysterically until tears came to their eyes thinking of the kidnappers cold eyes his teeth the bulky gloves now in this horrid wet tomb the unbearable pain rolled up his arm and into his jaw broken finger or heart attack he wondered maybe a little of both everett closed his eyes until the pain subsided he looked around him the chamber where he was handcuffed was beneath a rotting pier a lip of wood dipped from the edge toward the churning water which was about six inches below the bottom of the rim lights from boats on the river and the industrial sites of jersey reflected through the narrow slit the water was up to his neck now and although the roof of the pier was several feet above his head the cuffs were extended as far as theyd go the pain swept up from his finger again and everetts head roared with the agony and dipped toward the water as he passed out a noseful of water and the racking cough that followed revived him then the moon tugged the plane of water slightly higher and with a sodden gulp the chamber was sealed off from the river outside the room went dark he was aware of the sounds of groaning waves and his own moaning from the pain he knew he was dead knew he couldnt keep his head above the greasy surface for more than a few minutes he closed his eyes pressed his face against the slick black column twentyone all the way downtown sachs rhymes voice clattered from the radio she punched the accelerator of the rrv red lights flashing as they screamed downtown along the west side highway icecool she goosed the wagon up to eighty okay whoa said jerry banks counting down twentythird street twentieth the skidding jog at the fourteenth street garbagebarge dock as they roared through the village the meatpacking district a semi pulled out of a side street directly into her path instead of braking she nudged the wagon over the center curb like a steeplechaser drawing breathless oaths from banks and a wail from the air horn of the big white which jackknifed spectacularly oops said amelia sachs and swung back into the southbound lane to rhyme she added say again missed that rhymes tinny voice popped through her earphones downtown is all i can tell you until we figure out what the leaf means were coming up on battery park city twentyfive minutes to high tide banks called maybe dellrays team could get the exact location out of him they could drag mr into an alley somewhere with a bag of apples nick had told her that was the way they talked perps into

the water you there rhyme talk to me sachs where are you a pier just north of battery park city i just heard from lon on the east side he hasnt found anything its hopeless she said therere a dozen piers then the whole promenade and the fireboat house and ferry docks and the pier at battery park we need esu we dont have esu sachs theyre not on our side anymore twenty minutes to high tide her eyes darted along the waterfront her shoulders sagged with helplessness hand on her weapon she sprinted to the river jerry banks not far behind get me something on that leaf mel a guess anything wing it fidgeting cooper looked from the microscope to the computer screen eight thousand varieties of leafy plants in manhattan it doesnt fit the cell structure of anything its old rhyme said how old cooper looked at the leaf again mummified id put it at a hundred years little less maybe whats gone extinct in the last hundred years plants dont go extinct in an ecosystem like manhattan they always show up again a ping in rhymes mind he was close to remembering something he both loved and hated this feeling he might grab the thought like a slow popup fly or it might vanish completely leaving him with only the sting of lost inspiration sixteen minutes to high tide what was the thought he grappled with it closed his eyes pier he was thinking the vics under a pier what about it think pier ships unloading cargo unloading cargo his eyes snapped open mel is it a crop oh hell ive been looking at generalhorticulture pages not cultivated crops he typed for what seemed like hours well hold on hold on heres a list of the encoded binaries he scanned it alfalfa barley beets corn oats tobacco tobacco try that cooper double clicked his mouse and the image slowly unfurled on the screen thats it the world trade towers rhyme announced the land from there north used to be tobacco plantations thom the research for my book i want the map from the s and that modern map bo haumann was using for the asbestoscleanup sites put them up there on the wall next to each other the aide found the old map in rhymes files he taped them both onto the wall near his bed crudely drawn the older map showed the northern part of the settled city a cluster on the lower portion of the isle covered with plantations there were three commercial wharves along the river which was then called not the hudson but the west river rhyme glanced at the recent map of the city the farmland was gone of course as were the original wharves but the contemporary map showed an abandoned wharf in the exact location of one of the tobacco exporters old piers rhyme strained forward struggling to see the street name it was near he was about to shout for thom to come hold the map closer when from downstairs he heard a loud snap and the door crashed inward glass shattered thom started down the stairs i want to see him the terse voice filled the hallway just a the aide began no not inaminute not in a hour but right fucking now mel rhyme whispered ditch the evidence shut the systems down but do it rhyme shook his head violently dislodging the headset microphone it fell onto the side of the clinitron footsteps pounded up the stairs thom did the best he could to stall but the visitors were three federal agents and two of the three were holding large guns slowly they backed him up the stairs bless him mel cooper pulled apart a compound microscope in five seconds flat and was calmly replacing the components with meticulous care as the fbi crested the stairs and stormed into rhymes room the evidence bags were stuffed under a table and covered with national geographics ah dellray rhyme asked find our unsub did you why didnt you tell us tell you what that the fingerprint was bogus no one asked me bogus cooper asked mystified well it was a real print rhyme said as if it were obvious but it wasnt the unsubs our boy needed a taxi to catch his fish with so he met what was his name victor pietrs dellray muttered and gave the cabbies history nice touch rhyme said with some genuine admiration picked a serb with a rap sheet and mental problems wonder how long he looked for a candidate anyway killed poor mr pietrs and stole his cab cut off his finger he kept it and figured if we were getting too close hed leave a nice obvious print at a scene to throw us off i guess it worked rhyme glanced at the clock fourteen minutes left howd you know dellray glanced at the maps on rhymes wall but thank god wasnt interested in them the print showed signs of dehydration and shriveling bet the body was a mess and you found it in the basement am i right where our boy likes to stow his victims dellray ignored him and nosed around the room like a giant terrier where you hidin our evidence evidence i dont know what youre talking about say did you break my door last time you walked in without knocking now you just kicked it in you know lincoln i was thinking of apologizing to you for before thats big of you fred but now im a inch away from collaring your ass rhyme glanced down at the microphone headset dangling on the floor he imagined sachss voice bleating from the earphones gimme that evidence rhyme you dont realize what kind of pissybad trouble youre in thom rhyme asked slowly agent dellray startled me and i dropped my walkman headset could you hook it on the bedframe the aide didnt miss a beat he rested the mike next to rhymes head out of dellrays sight thank you rhyme said to thom then added you know i havent had my bath yet i think its about time wouldnt you say ive been wondering when you were going to ask said thom with the ability of a naturalborn actor come in rhyme for christs sake where are you then she heard a voice in her headset thoms it sounded stilted exaggerated something was wrong ive got the new sponge the voice said looks like a good one rhyme answered rhyme sachs blurted what the hells going on cost seventeen dollars it ought to be good im going to turn you over more voices sounded through the earphone but she couldnt make them out sachs and banks were jogging along the waterfront peering over the wharves into the graybrown water of the hudson she motioned to banks to stop leaned away from the cramp below her breastbone spit into the river tried to catch her breath through the headset she heard wont take long youll have to excuse us gentlemen well just wait you dont mind i do mind rhyme said cant i get a little privacy here rhyme can you hear me sachs called desperately what the hell was he doing nup no privacy for them that steal evidence dellray he was in rhymes room well thats the end of it the vics as good as dead i want that evidence the agent barked well what youre going to get is a panoramic view of a man taking a sponge bath dellray banks started to speak but she waved him quiet some muttered words she couldnt hear the agents angry shout then rhymes calm voice again you know dellray i used to be a swimmer swam every day weve got less than ten minutes sachs whispered the water lapped calmly two placid boats cruised past dellray muttered something id go down to the hudson river and swim it was a lot cleaner then the water i mean a garbled transmission he was breaking up old pier my favorite ones gone now used to be the home of the hudson dusters that gang you ever hear of them in the s north of where battery park city is now you look bored tired of looking at a crips flabby ass no suit yourself that pier was between north moore and chambers id dive in swim around the piers north moore and chambers sachs shouted spinning around theyd missed it because theyd gone too far south it was a quarter mile from where they were she could see the brown scabby wood a large drainpipe backing up with tidal water how much time was left hardly any there was no way they could save him she ripped the headset off and started sprinting to the car banks close behind can you swim she asked me a lap or two at the health and racquet club theyd never make it sachs stopped suddenly spun around in a fast circle gazing at the deserted streets the water was nearly to his nose a small wave washed over william everetts face just as he inhaled and the foul salty liquid streamed into his throat he began to choke a deep horrible sound racking the water filled his lungs he lost his grip on the pier piling and sank under the surface stiffened and rose once more then sank again no lord no please dont let he shook the cuffs kicked hard trying to get some play as if some miracle might happen and his puny muscles could bend the huge bolt he was cuffed to snorting water from his nose swiping his head back and forth in panic he cleared his lungs momentarily neck muscles on fire as painful as his shattered finger from bending his head back to find the faint layer of air just above his face he had a moments respite then another wave slightly higher and that was it he couldnt fight anymore surrender join evelyn say goodbye and william everett let go he floated beneath the surface into the drecky water full of junk and tendrils of seaweed then jerked back in horror no no he was here the kidnapper hed come back everett kicked to the surface sneezing more water trying desperately to get away the man shone a brilliant light into everetts eyes and reached toward him with a knife no no it wasnt enough to drown him he had to slash him to death without thinking everett kicked out toward him but the kidnapper vanished under the water and then snap everett s hands were free the old man forgot his placid goodbyes and kicked like hell to the surface sucking sour air through his nose and ripping the tape from his mouth gasping spitting the foul water his head banged solidly into the underside of the oak pier and he laughed out loud oh god god god then another face appeared also hooded with another blindingly bright lamp attached and everett could just make out the nypd emblem on the mans wetsuit they werent knives the men held but metal cutters one of them thrust a bitter rubber mouthpiece between everetts lips and he inhaled a dazzling breath of oxygen the diver slipped his arm around him and together they swam to the lip of the pier take a deep breath well be out in a minute he filled his narrow lungs to bursting and eyes closed sailed with the diver deep into the water lit eerily by the mans yellow light it was a short but harrowing trip straight down then up again through cloudy flecked water once he slipped out of the divers hands and they separated momentarily but william everett took the glitch in stride after this evening a solo swim in the choppy hudson river was a piece of cake she hadnt planned on taking a cab the airport bus wouldve been fine but pammy was wired from too little sleep theyd both been up since five that morning and she was getting restless the little girl needed to be in bed soon tucked away with her blanket and her bottle of hawaiian punch besides carole herself couldnt wait to get to manhattan she was just a skinny midwest gal whod never been farther east than ohio in all her fortyone years and she was dying for her first look at the big apple carole collected her luggage and they started toward the exit she checked to make sure she had everything theyd left kate and eddies house with that afternoon pammy pooh purse blanket suitcase yellow knapsack everything accounted for her friends had warned her about the city theyll hustle you eddied said purse snatchers pickpockets and dont play those card games on the street maternal kate had added i dont play cards in my living room carole reminded her laughing whym i going to start playing on the streets of manhattan but she appreciated their concern after all here she was a widow with a threeyearold heading to the toughest city on earth for the un conference more foreigners hell more people than shed ever seen at one time carole found a pay phone and called the residence hotel to check on their reservations the night manager said the room was ready and waiting for them hed see them in fortyfive minutes or so they walked through automatic doors and were socked breathless by the scalding summer air carole paused looking around gripping pammy firmly with one hand the handle of the battered suitcase with the other the heavy yellow knapsack was snug on her shoulder they joined the line of passengers waiting at the taxi starters booth carole glanced at a huge billboard across the highway welcome un delegates it announced the artwork was terrible but she stared at it for a long moment one of the men on the billboard looked like ronnie for a time after he died two years ago virtually everything reminded her of her handsome crewcut husband shed drive past mcdonalds and remember that he liked big macs actors in movies who didnt look a thing like him might cock their heads the way he used to shed see a flyer for a lawnmower sale and remember how much he loved to cut their tiny square of grass in arlington heights then the tears would come and shed go back on prozac or imipramine shed spend a week in bed reluctantly acquiesce in kates offer that she stay with her and eddie for a night or a week or a month but no tears anymore she was here to jumpstart her life the sorrow was behind her now tossing her mass of darkblond hair off her sweaty shoulders carole ushered pammy forward and kicked the luggage ahead of them as the taxi queue moved up several places she looked all around trying to catch a glimpse of manhattan but she could see nothing except traffic and the tails of airplanes and a sea of people and cabs and cars steam rose like frantic ghosts from manholes and the night sky was black and yellow and hazy well shed see the city soon enough she guessed she hoped that pammy was old enough to keep her first memory of the sight how do you like our adventure so far honey adventure i like adventures i want some waiin punch can i please have some please that was new the threeyearold was learning all the keys and buttons carole laughed well get you some soon finally they got their cab the trunk popped open and carole dumped the luggage inside slammed the lid they climbed into the back seat and closed the door pammy pooh purse the driver asked where to and carole gave him the address of the midtown residence hotel shouting through the plexiglas divider the driver pulled into traffic carole sat back and settled pammy on her lap will we go past the un she called but the man was concentrating on changing lanes and didnt hear her im here for the conference she explained the un conference still no answer she wondered if he had trouble with english kate had warned her that the taxi drivers in new york were all foreigners taking american jobs eddie grumbled but dont get me started on that she couldnt see him clearly through the scuffed divider maybe he just doesnt want to talk they swung onto another highway and suddenly there it was in front of her the jagged skyline of the city brilliant like the crystals that kate and eddie collected a huge cluster of blue and gold and silver buildings in the middle of the island and another cluster way to the left it was bigger than anything carole had ever seen in her life and for a moment the island seemed like a massive ship look pammy thats where were going is that beeaaautiful or what a moment later though the view was cut off as the driver turned off the expressway and made a fast turn at the bottom of the ramp then they were moving through hot deserted streets lined with dark brick buildings carole leaned forward is this the right way to the city again no answer she rapped hard on the plexiglas are you going the right way answer me answer me mommy whats wrong pammy said and started to cry where are you going carole shouted but the man just kept driving leisurely stopping at all the red lights never going over the speed limit and when he pulled into the deserted parking lot behind a dark abandoned factory he made sure he signaled properly oh no no he pulled on a ski mask and climbed from the cab walking to the back he reached for the door but he hesitated and his hand dropped he leaned forward face against the window and tapped on the glass once twice three times getting the attention of lizards in the reptile room at a zoo he stared at the mother and daughter for a long moment before he opened the door twentytwo howd you do it sachs standing beside the pungent hudson river she spoke into her stalk mike i remembered seeing the fireboat station at battery park they scrambled a couple divers and were at the pier in about three minutes man you shouldve seen that boat move i want to try one of those someday rhyme explained to her about the fingerless cabbie son of a bitch she said clicking her tongue in disgust the weasel tricked us all not all of us rhyme reminded her coyly so dellray knows i boosted the evidence is he looking for me he said he was heading back to the federal building probably to decide which one of us to collar first hows the scene there sachs pretty bad she reported he parked on gravel so no footprints but its worse than that the tide backed out of this big drainpipe and where he parkeds underwater hell rhyme muttered no trace no prints no nothing hows the vic not so good exposure broken finger hes had heart problems theyre going to keep him in the hospital for a day or two can he tell us anything sachs walked over to banks who was interviewing william everett he wasnt big the man said matteroffactly carefully examining the splint the medic was putting on his hand and he wasnt really strong not a muscle man but he was strongern me i grabbed him and he just pulled my hands away description banks asked everett recounted the dark clothes and ski mask that was all he could remember one thing i should tell you everett held up his bandaged hand hes got a mean streak i grabbed him like i said i wasnt thinking i just panicked but he got real mad thats when he busted my finger retaliation hm banks asked i guess but thats not the strange part no the strange part is he listened to it the young detective had stopped writing looked at sachs he held my hand against his ear real tight and bent the finger until it broke like he was listening and liking it did you hear that rhyme yes thoms added it to our profile i dont know what it means though well have to think about it any sign of the planted pe not yet grid it sachs oh and get the vics clothes ive already asked him i rhyme you all right she heard a fit of coughing the transmission was shut off momentarily he came back on a moment later you there rhyme everything okay fine he said quickly get going walk the grid she surveyed the scene lit starkly by the esu halogens it was so frustrating hed been here hed walked on the gravel just a few feet away but whatever pe hed inadvertently left behind was lying inches below the surface of the dim water she covered the ground slowly back and forth i cant see anything the clues mightve been washed away no hes too smart not tove taken the tide into account theyll be on dry land somewhere ive got an idea she said suddenly come on down here what work the scene with me rhyme silence rhyme did you hear me are you talking to me he asked you look like de niro you cant act as good as de niro you know that scene from taxi driver rhyme didnt laugh he said the lines are you looking at me not talking to me sachs continued unfazed come on down work

try a little harder ive walked the entire grid twice then youve defined the perimeter too narrowly add another few feet and keep going eight twentythrees not finished yet not by a long shot youre changing the subject come on down and help me how rhyme asked howm i supposed to do that i had a friend who was challenged she began and he you mean he was a crip rhyme corrected softly but firmly she continued his aided put him into this fancy wheelchair every morning and he drove himself all over the place to the movies to those chairs rhymes voice sounded hollow they dont work for me she stopped speaking he continued the problems how i was injured itd be dangerous for me to be in a wheelchair it could he hesitated make things worse im sorry i didnt know after a moment he said of course you didnt blew that one oh boy brother but rhyme didnt seem any the worse for her faux pas his voice was smooth unemotional listen youve got to get on with the search our unsubs making it trickier but it wont be impossible heres an idea hes the underground man right maybe he buried them she looked over the scene maybe there she saw a mound of earth and leaves in a patch of tall grass near the gravel it didnt look right the mound seemed too assembled sachs crouched beside it lowered her head and using the pencils began to clear away leaves she turned her face slightly to the left and found she was staring at a rearing head bared fangs jesus lord she shouted stumbling backwards falling hard on her butt scrambling to draw her weapon no rhyme shouted you all right sachs drew a target and tried to steady the gun with very unsteady hands jerry banks came running up his own glock drawn he stopped sachs climbed to her feet looking at what was in front of them man banks whispered its a snake well a snakes skeleton sachs told rhyme a rattlesnake fuck holstered the glock its mounted on a board a snake interesting rhyme sounded intrigued yeah real interesting she muttered she pulled on latex gloves and lifted the coiled bones she turned it over metamorphosis what a label on the bottom the name of the store it came from id guess broadway rhyme said ill have the hardy boys check it out whatve we got tell me the clues they were underneath the snake in a baggie her heart pounded as she crouched down over the bag a book of matches she said okay maybe hes thinking arson anything printed on them nope but theres a smear of something like vaseline only stinky good sachs always smell evidence youre not sure about only be more precise she bent close yuck thats not precise sulfur maybe could be nitratebased explosive tovex is it blue no its milky clear even if it could go bang i imagine its a secondary explosive theyre the stable ones anything else another scrap of paper something on it what sachs his name his address email handle looks like its from a magazine i can see a small blackandwhite photo looks like part of a building but you cant see which one and underneath that all you can read is a date may five twenty ohsix i wonder if its a code or an address ill have to think about it anything else nope she heard him sigh all right come on back sachs what time is it my god almost one am i havent been up this late in years come on back and lets see what we have of all the neighborhoods in manhattan the lower east side has remained the most unchanged over the course of the citys history much of its gone of course the rolling pastoral fields the solid mansions of john hancock and early government luminaries der kolek the large freshwater lake its dutch name eventually corrupted to the collect which more accurately described the grossly polluted pond the notorious five points neighborhood in the early s the most dangerous square mile on earth where a single tenement like the decrepit gates of hell might be the site of two or three hundred murders every year but thousands of the old buildings remained tenements from the nineteenth century and colonial frame houses and federal brick townhomes from the prior one baroque meeting halls several of the egyptianstyle public buildings constructed by order of the regally corrupt congressman fernando wood some were abandoned their facades overgrown with weeds and floors cracked by persistent saplings but many were still in use this had been the land of tammany hall iniquity of pushcarts and sweatshops of the henry street settlement house minskys burlesque and the notorious yiddish gomorra the jewish mafia a neighborhood that gives birth to institutions like these does not die easily it was toward this neighborhood that the bone collector now piloted the taxi containing the thin woman and her young daughter observing that the constabulary was on to him james schneider went once again to ground like the serpent that he was seeking accommodations it is speculated in the cellars of the citys many tenanthouses which the reader may perchance recognize as the stillprevalent tenements and so he remained quiescent for some months as he drove home the bone collector saw around him not the manhattan of the s the korean delis the dank bagel shops the xratedvideo stores the empty clothing boutiques but a dreamy world of bowlerclad men women in rustling crinoline hems and cuffs filthy with street refuse hordes of buggies and wagons the air filled with the sometimes pleasant sometimes repulsive scent of methane but such was the foul indefatigable drive within him to start his collection anew that he was soon forced from his lair to waylay yet another good citizen this a young man newly arrived in town to attend university driving through the notorious eighteenth ward once the home of nearly fifty thousand people crammed into a thousand decrepit tenements when most people thought of the nineteenth century they thought in sepia because of old photographs but this was wrong old manhattan was the color of stone with choking industrial smoke paint prohibitively expensive and dim lighting the city was many shades of gray and yellow schneider snuck up behind the fellow and was about to strike when fortunes conscience at last cried out two constables chanced upon the assault they recognized schneider and gave chase the killer fled east across that engineering marvel the manhattan bridge completed in two years before these events but he stopped halfway across seeing that three constables were approaching from brooklyn having heard the alarm raised by the whistles and pistol reports of their confederates from manhattan schneider unarmed as chance would have it climbed onto the railing of the bridge as he was surrounded by the law he shouted maniacal diatribes against the constables condemning them for having ruined his life his words grew ever madder as the constabulary moved closer he leapt from the rail into the river a week later a pilot discovered his body on the shore of welfare island near hell gale there was little left for the crabs and turtles had been diligently working to reduce schneider to the very bone which he in his madness cherished he turned the taxi onto his deserted cobblestoned street east van brevoort and paused in front of the building he checked the two filthy strings hed run low across the doors to make certain that no one had entered a sudden motion startled him and he heard the guttural snarling of the dogs again their eyes yellow teeth brown bodies dotted with scars and sores his hand strayed to his pistol but they suddenly turned and yelping charged after a cat or rat in the alley he saw no one on the hot sidewalks and opened the padlock securing the carriagehouse door then climbed back inside the car and drove into the garage parked beside his taurus after the villains death his effects were secured and perused by detectives his diary showed that he had murdered eight good citizens of the city nor was he above grave robbery for it was ascertained from his pages if his claims be true that he had violated several holy resting places in cemeteries around the city none of his victims had accorded him the least affront nay most were upstanding citizens industrious and innocent and yet he felt not a modicum of guilt indeed he seems to have labored under the mad delusion that he was doing his victims a favor he paused wiped sweat from his mouth the ski mask itched he dragged the woman and her daughter out of the trunk and through the garage she was strong and fought hard at last he managed to get the cuffs on them you prick she howled dont you dare touch my daughter you touch her and ill kill you he gripped her hard around the chest and taped her mouth then he did the little girls too flesh withers and can be weak the villain wrote in his ruthless yet steady hand bone is the strongest aspect of the body as old as we may be in the flesh we are always young in the bone it is a noble goal i had and it is beyond me why anyone might quarrel with it i did a kindness to them all they are immortal now i freed them i took them down to the bone he dragged them into the basement and pushed the woman down hard on the floor her daughter beside her tied their cuffs to the wall with clothesline then returned upstairs he lifted her yellow knapsack from the back of the cab the suitcases from the trunk and pushed through a boltstudded wooden door into the main room of the building he was about to toss them into a corner but found that for some reason he was curious about these particular captives he sat down in front of one of the murals a painting of a butcher placidly holding a knife in one hand a slab of beef in the other he examined the luggage tag carole ganz carole with an e why the extra letter he wondered the suitcase contained nothing but clothes he started through the knapsack he found the cash right away there must have been four or five thousand he put it back in the zippered compartment there were a dozen childs toys a doll a tin of watercolors a package of modeling clay a mr potato head kit there were also an expensive discman a halfdozen cds and a sony travel clock radio he looked through some pictures photos of carole and her girl in most of the pictures the woman seemed very somber in a few others she seemed happier there were no photos of carole and her husband even though she wore a wedding ring many were of the mother and daughter with a couple a heavyset woman wearing one of those old granny dresses and a bearded balding man in a flannel shirt for a long time the bone collector gazed at a portrait of the little girl the fate of poor maggie oconnor the young slip of a girl merely eight years of age was particularly sad it was her misfortune the police speculate that she stumbled across the path of james schneider as he was disposing of one of his victims the girl a resident of the notorious hells kitchen had gone out to pluck horsehairs from one of the many dead animals found in that impoverished part of the city it was the custom of youngsters to wind tailhairs into bracelets and rings the only trinkets such urchins might have to adorn themselves with skin and bone skin and bone he propped the photo on the mantelpiece beside the small pile of bones hed been working on that morning and some that hed stolen from the store where hed found the snake it is surmised that schneider found young maggie near his lair witnessing the macabre spectacle of his murdering one of his victims whether he dispatched her quickly or slowly we cannot guess but unlike his other victims whose remains were ultimately discovered of frail becurled maggie oconnor nought was ever found the bone collector walked downstairs he ripped the tape off the mothers mouth and the woman gasped for air eyed him with cold fury what do you want she rasped what she wasnt as thin as esther but thank god she was nothing at all like fat hanna goldschmidt he could see so much of her soul the narrow mandible the clavicle and through the thin blue skirt the hint of the innominate bone a fusion of the ilium the ischium the pubis names like roman gods the little girl squirmed he leaned forward and placed his hand on her head skulls dont grow from a single piece of bone but from eight separate ones and the crown rises up like the triangular slabs of the astrodome roof he touched the girls occipital bone the parietal bones of the cap of the skull and two of his favorites the sensuous bones around the eye sockets the sphenoid and the ethmoid stop it carole shook her head furious keep away from her shhhh he said holding his gloved finger to his lips he looked at the little girl who cried and pressed close to her mother maggie oconnor he cooed looking at the shape of the girls face my little maggie the woman glared at him you were in the wrong place at the wrong time child what did you see me do young in the bone what are you talking about carole whispered he turned his attention to her the bone collector had always wondered about maggie oconnors mother wheres your husband hes dead she spat out then glanced at the little girl and said more softly he was killed two years ago look just let my daughter go she cant tell them anything about you are you listening to me what are you doing he gripped caroles hands and lifted them he fondled the metacarpals of the wrists the phalanges the tiny fingers squeezing the bones no dont do that i dont like that please her voice crackled with panic he felt out of control and didnt like the sensation one bit if he was going to succeed here with the victims with his plans he had to fight down the encroaching lust the madness was driving him further and further into the past confusing the now with the then before and after he needed all of his intelligence and craftiness to finish what hed started and yet yet she was so thin she was so taut he closed his eyes and imagined how a knife blade scraping over her tibia would sing like the bowing of an old violin his breathing was fast he was sweating rivers when finally he opened his eyes he found he was looking at her sandals he didnt have many foot bones in good condition the homeless people hed been preying on in the past months well theyd suffered from rickets and osteoporosis their toes were impacted by badly fitting shoes ill make a deal with you he heard himself saying she looked down at her daughter wriggled closer to her ill make a deal ill let you go if you let me do something what carole whispered let me take your skin off she blinked he whispered let me please a foot just one of your feet if you do that ill let you go what down to the bone she gazed at him with horror swallowed what would it matter he thought she was so nearly there anyway so thin so angular yes there was something different about her different from the other victims he put the pistol away and took the knife out of his pocket opened it with a startling click she didnt move her eyes slid to the little girl back to him youll let us go he nodded you havent seen my face you dont know where this place is a long moment she stared around her at the basement she muttered a word a name he thought ron or rob and with her eyes firmly on his she extended her legs and pushed her feet toward him he slipped her shoe off the right foot he took her toes kneaded the fragile twigs she leaned back the cables of her tendons rising beautifully from her neck her eyes squeezed shut he caressed her skin with the blade a firm grip on the knife she closed her eyes inhaled and gave a faint whimper go ahead she whispered and turned the girls face away hugged her tightly the bone collector imagined her in a victorian outfit crinoline and black lace he saw the three of them sitting together at delmonicos or strolling down fifth avenue he saw little maggie with them dressed in frothy lace rolling a hoop with a stick as they walked over the canal bridge then and now he nestled the stained blade in the arch of her foot mommy the girl screamed something popped within him for a moment he was overwhelmed with revulsion at what he was doing at himself no he couldnt do it not to her esther or hanna yes or the next one but not her the bone collector shook his head sadly and touched her cheekbone with the back of his hand he slapped the tape over caroles mouth again and cut the cord binding her feet come on he muttered she struggled fiercely but he gripped her head hard and pinched her nostrils till she passed out then he hefted her over his shoulder and started up the stairs carefully lifting the bag that sat nearby very carefully it was not the sort of thing he wanted to drop up the stairs pausing only once to look at young curlyhaired maggie oconnor sitting in the dirt looking hopelessly up at him twentythree he snagged them both in front of rhymes townhouse quick as the coiled snake that jerry banks was carrying at his side like a souvenir from santa fe dellray and two agents stepped from an alley he announced casually got some news honey dear youre under arrest for the theft of evidence under custodial care of the us government lincoln rhyme had been wrong dellray hadnt made it to the federal building after all hed been staking out rhymes digs banks rolled his eyes chill out dellray we saved the vic and a mighty good thing you did sonny if you hadnt we were gonna bring you up on homicide but we saved im sachs said and you didnt thanks for that snappy recap officer hold your wrists out this is bullshit cuff this young lady the chameleon said dramatically to a burly agent beside him she began we found more clues agent dellray hes got another one and i dont know how much time we have oh and invite that thayre boy to ouah party too dellray nodded to banks who turned to the woman fbi agent approaching him and seemed to be thinking of decking her dellray said a cheerful no no no you don wanna banks reluctantly held out his hands unsub page of appearance caucasian male

listened as he broke vics finger sachs angry offered the agent a cold smile how was your trip to morningside heights he still killed that cabbie our pert boysre crawling over that house now like beetles on dung and thats all theyre going to find sachs said this unsub knows crime scenes better than you and i do downtown dellray announced nodding at sachs who winced as the cuffs ratcheted tight around her wrists we can save the next one too if you you know what you got officer sachs take a guess you gotchaself the right to remain silent you got all right the voice called from behind them sachs looked around and saw jim polling striding along the sidewalk his slacks and dark sports shirt were rumpled it looked as if hed napped in them though his bleary face suggested he hadnt slept in days you could see a days growth of beard and his sandy hair was an unruly mess dellray blinked uneasily though it wasnt the cop he was troubled by but the tall physique of the us attorney for the southern district behind polling and bringing up the rear sac perkins okay fred let em go from the us attorney in the modulated baritone of an fm disk jockey the chameleon said she stole evidence sir she i just expedited some forensic analysis sachs said listen dellray began nope polling said completely in control now no temper tantrums no were not listening he turned to sachs and barked but dont you try to be funny nosir sorry sir the us attorney said to dellray fred you made a judgment call and it went south facts of life it was a good lead dellray said well were changing the direction of the investigation the us attorney continued sac perkins said weve been conferencing with the director and with behavioral weve decided that detectives rhyme and sellittos positioning is the approach to pursue but my snitch was clear that something was going down at the airport thats not the sorta thing hed be wishy about it comes down to this fred the us attorney said bluntly whatever the fuckers up to it was rhymes team that saved the vics dellrays lengthy fingers folded into an uncertain fist opened again i appreciate that fact sir but agent dellray thiss a decision that has already been made the glossy black face so energized at the federal building when he was marshaling his troops was now somber reserved for the moment the hipster was gone yessir this most recent hostage wouldve died if detective sachs here hadnt intervened the us attorney said thatd be officer sachs she corrected and it was mostly lincoln rhyme i was his legman so to speak the case is going back to the city the us attorney announced the bureaus at is to continue to handle terroristinformant liaison but with reduced manpower anything they learn should be conveyed to detectives sellitto and rhyme dellray youre gonna put bodies at their disposal for any searchandsurveillance or hostagerescue effort or anything else they might need got that yessir good you want to remove those handcuffs from these officers now dellray placidly unlocked the cuffs and slipped them into his pocket he walked to a large van parked nearby as sachs picked up the evidence bag she saw him standing by himself at the edge of a pool of streetlight his index finger lifted stroking the cigarette behind his ear she wasted a moments sympathy on the feebie then turned and ran up the stairs two at a time after jerry banks and his rattlesnake i have it figured out well almost sachs had just walked into rhymes room when he made this pronouncement he was quite pleased with himself everything except the rattler and the glop she delivered the new evidence to mel cooper the room had been transformed yet again and the tables were covered with new vials and beakers and pillboxes and lab equipment and boxes it wasnt much compared to the feds headquarters but to amelia sachs it felt oddly like home tell me she said tomorrows sunday pardon me todays sunday hes going to burn down a church how do you figure the date on the scrap of paper whats it mean you ever hear of the anarchists little russians in trench coats carrying around those bombs that look like bowling balls banks said from the man who reads picture books rhyme commented dryly your saturdaymorningcartoon roots are showing banks anarchism was an old social movement calling for the abolition of government one anarchist enrico malatesta his shtick was propaganda by deed translated that means murder and mayhem one of his followers an american named eugene lockworthy lived in new york one sunday morning he bolted the doors of a church on the upper east side just after the service began and set the place on fire killed eighteen parishioners and that happened on may sachs asked yep im not going to ask how you figured that out rhyme shrugged obvious our unsub likes history right he gave us some matches so hes telling us hes planning arson i just thought back to the citys famous fires the triangle shirtwaist crystal palace the general slocum excursion boat i checked the dates may twentieth was the first methodist church fire sachs asked but where same location as that church doubt it sellitto said theres a commercial highrise there now eight twentythree doesnt like new places ive got a couple men on it just in case but were sure hes going for a church and we think rhyme added that hes going to wait till a service starts why for one thing thats what lockworthy did sellitto continued also we were thinking bout what terry dobyns was telling us upping the ante going for multiple vics so weve got a little more time until the service starts rhyme looked up at the ceiling now how many churches are there in manhattan hundreds that was rhetorical banks i mean lets keep looking over the clues hell have to narrow it down some footsteps on the stair it was the twins once again we passed fred dellray outside he wasnt the least bit cordial or happy whoa look at that saul rhyme believed it was saul hed forgotten who had the freckles nodded at the snake ive seen more of those in one night than i ever want to again snakes rhyme asked we were at metamorphosis its a very spooky place met the owner there weird guy as you mayve guessed long long beard wish we hadnt gone at night bedding continued they sell taxidermied bats and insects you wouldnt believe some of the insects five inches long and critters like that one saul nodded at the snake scorpions a lot of scorpions anyway they had a breakin a month ago and guess what got took a rattlers skeleton reported rhyme asked yep but total value of the perped merch was only a hundred bucks or so so larceny wasnt like allhandsonboard you know but tell them saul nodded the snake wasnt the only thing missing whoever broke in took a couple dozen bones human bones rhyme asked yep thats what the owner thought was funny some of those insects forget five inches some of em were eight easy are worth three or four hundred but all the perp boosted was the snake and some bones any particular ones rhyme asked an assortment like your whitmans sampler his words not ours mostly little ones hand and foot and a rib maybe two the guy wasnt sure any cs report for jacked bones noooope the hardy boys departed once more heading downtown to the last scene to start canvassing the neighborhood rhyme wondered about the snake was it giving them a location did it relate to the first methodist fire if rattlers had been indigenous to manhattan urban development had long ago played saint patrick and purged the island of them was he making a play on the word snake or rattler then rhyme suddenly believed he understood the snakes for us us banks laughed its a slap in the face whose face everybody whos looking for him i think its a practical joke i wasnt laughing very hard sachs said your expression was pretty funny banks grinned i think were better than he expected and hes not happy about it hes mad and hes taking it out on us thom add that to our profile if you would hes mocking us sellittos phone rang he opened it and answered emma darlin whatcha got he nodded as he jotted notes then looked up and announced rentalcar thefts two avises disappeared from their location in the bronx in the past week one in midtown theyre out cause the colorsre wrong red green and white no nationals four hertz were jacked three in manhattan one from their downtown east side location from midtown and from the upper west side there were two green and this could be it one tan but a silver ford got boosted from white plains thats my vote agree rhyme announced white plains how do you know sachs asked monelle said it couldve been either beige or silver because our boys in the city rhyme explained and if hes going to boost something as obvious as a car hell do it as far away from his safe house as he can its a ford you said sellitto asked emma the question then looked up taurus this years model darkgray interior tags irrelevant rhyme nodded the first thing he changed the plates thank her and tell her to get some sleep but not to wander too far from the phone got something here lincoln mel cooper called whats that the glop im running it through the database of brand names now he stared at the screen crossreferencing lets see the most likely match is kinkaway its a retail hair straightener politically incorrect but helpful that puts us up in harlem wouldnt you think narrows down the churches considerably banks was looking through the religiousservice directories of all three metro newspapers i count twentytwo whens the earliest service three have services at eight six at nine one at ninethirty the rest at ten or eleven hell go for one of the first services hes already giving us hours to find the place sellitto said ive got haumann getting the esu boys together again how bout dellray sachs said she pictured the forlorn agent by himself on the street corner outside what about him sellitto muttered aw lets cut him in he wants a piece of this guy bad perkins said he was supposed to help banks offered you really want him sellitto asked frowning sachs was nodding sure rhyme agreed okay he can run the fed s s teams i want a team on each church right away all entrances but they should stay way back i dont want to spook him maybe we can nail him in the act sellitto took a phone call he looked up eyes closed jesus oh no rhyme muttered the detective wiped his sweating face and nodded central got a from the night manager at this place the midtown residence hotel woman and her little girl called him from la guardia said they were just about to get a cab that was a while ago they never showed up with all the news about the nappings he thought he should call her names carole ganz from chicago hell banks muttered a little girl too oughta just pull all the cabs off the streets till we nail his butt rhyme was drenched with weariness his head raged he remembered working a crime scene at a bomb factory nitroglycerin had bled out of some dynamite and seeped into an armchair rhyme had to search for trace nitro gave you blinding headaches the screen of coopers computer flickered email he announced and called up the message he read the fine type theyve polarized all the samples of cello that esu collected they think the scrap we found in the bone at the pearl street scene was from a shoprite grocery store its closest to the cello they use good rhyme called he nodded at the poster cross off all the grocery stores but the shoprites what locations do we have he watched thom ink through the stores leaving four bway nd greenwich bank th ave th houston lafayette that leaves us with the upper west side west village chelsea and the lower east side but he could have gone anywhere to buy them oh sure he couldve sachs he couldve bought them in white plains when he was stealing the car or in cleveland visiting his mother but see theres a point when unsubs feel comfortable in their deception and they stop bothering to cover their tracks the stupid or lazy ones toss the smoking gun in the dumpster behind their building and go on their merry way the smarter ones drop it in a bucket of spackle and pitch it into hell gate the brilliant ones sneak into a refinery and vaporize it in a fivethousanddegreecentigrade furnace our unsubs smart sure but hes like every other perp in the history of the world hes got limits im betting he thinks we wont have the time or inclination to look for him or his safe house because well be concentrating on the planted clues and of course hes dead wrong this is exactly how well find him now lets see if we cant get a little closer to his lair mel anything in the vics clothes from the last scene but the tidal water had washed away virtually everything from william everetts clothing you say they fought sachs the unsub and this everett wasnt much of a fight everett grabbed his shirt rhyme clicked his tongue i must be getting tired if id thought about it i would have had you scrape under his nails even if he was underwater thats one place here you go she said holding up two small plastic bags you scraped she nodded but whyre there two bags holding up one bag then the other she said left hand right hand mel cooper broke into a laugh even you never thought about separate bags for scraping lincoln its a great idea rhyme grunted differentiating the hands might have some marginal forensic value whoa cooper said laughing still that means he thinks its a brilliant idea and hes sorry he didnt think of it first the tech examined the scrapings got some brick here there was no brick anywhere around the drainpipe or the field sachs said its fragments but theres something attached to it i cant tell what banks asked could itve come from the stockyard tunnel there was a lotta brick there right all that came from annie oakley here rhyme said nodding ruefully at sachs no remember the unsubd left before she pulled out her sixgun then he frowned found himself straining forward mel i want to see that brick in the scope is there any way cooper looked over rhymes computer i think we can rig something up he ran a cable from the videooutput port on the compound scope to his own computer and then dug into a large suitcase he pulled out a long thick gray wire thiss a serial cable he connected the two computers and transferred some software to rhymes compaq in five minutes rhyme delighted was seeing exactly what cooper was looking at through the eyepiece the criminalists eyes scanned the chunk of brick hugely magnified he laughed out loud he outfoxed himself see those white blobs attached to the brick what are they sellitto asked looks like glue cooper offered exactly from a pethair roller perps whore real cautious use them to clean trace off themselves but it backfired some bits of adhesive mustve come off the roller and stuck to his clothes so we know its from his safe house held the brick in place until everett picked it up under his fingernails does the brick tell us anything sachs asked its old and its expensive cheap brick was very porous because they mixed in filler id guess his place is either institutional or built by someone wealthy at least a hundred years old maybe older ah here we go cooper said another bit of glove it looks like if the damn things keep disintegrating well be down to his friction ridges before too long rhymes screen flashed and a moment later what he recognized as a tiny fleck of leather came on the screen somethings funny here cooper said its not red rhyme observed like the other particle this flecks black run it through the microspectrophotometer cooper ran the test and then tapped his computer screen its leather but the dye is different maybe its stained or faded rhyme was leaning forward straining looking closely at the fleck on the screen when he realized he was in trouble serious trouble hey you okay it was sachs whod spoken rhyme didnt answer his neck and jaw began to shiver violently a feeling like panic rose from the crest of his shattered spine and moved up into his scalp then as if a thermostat had clicked on the chills and goose bumps vanished and he began to sweat perspiration poured from his face and tickled frantically thom he whispered thom its happening then he gasped as the headache seared through his face and spread along the walls of his skull he jammed his teeth together swayed his head anything to stop the unbearable agony but nothing worked the light in the room flickered the pain was so bad his reaction was to flee from it to run flatout on legs that hadnt moved in years lincoln sellitto was shouting his face sachs gasped its bright red and his hands were pale as ivory all of his body below the magic latitude at c was turning white rhymes blood on its phony desperate mission to get to where it thought it was needed surged into the tiny capillaries of his brain expanding them threatening to burst the delicate filaments as the attack grew worse rhyme was aware of thom over him ripping the blankets off the clinitron he was aware of sachs stepping forward her radiant blue eyes narrowed in concern the last thing he saw before the blackness was the falcon pushing off the ledge on his huge wings startled by the sudden flurry of activity in the room seeking easy oblivion in the hot air over the empty streets of the city twentyfour when rhyme passed out sellitto got to the phone first call for ems thom instructed then hit that number there speed dial its pete taylor our spinal cord specialist sellitto made the calls thom was shouting ill need some help here somebody sachs was closest she nodded stepped up to rhyme the aide had grabbed the unconscious man under the arms and pulled him higher up in bed he ripped open the shirt and prodded the pale chest saying everybody else if you could just leave us sellitto banks and cooper hesitated for a moment then stepped through the doorway sellitto closed the door behind them a beige box appeared in the aides hands it had switches and dials on the top and sprouted a wire ending in a flat disk which he placed over rhymes chest and taped down phrenic nerve stimulator itll keep him breathing he clicked on the machine thom slipped a bloodpressure cuff onto rhymes alabasterwhite arm sachs realized with a start that his body was virtually wrinklefree he was in his forties but his body was that of a twentyfiveyearold whys his face so red it looks like hes going to explode he is thom said matteroffactly yanking a doctors kit from underneath the bedside table he opened it then he continued to take the pressure dysreflexia all the stress today mental and physical hes not used to it he kept saying he was tired i know and i wasnt paying careful enough attention shhhh i have to listen he plugged the stethoscope into his ears inflated the cuff and let the air out slowly staring at his watch his hands were rocksteady shit diastolics one twentyfive shit father in heaven sachs thought hes going to stroke out thom nodded at the black bag find the bottle of nifedipine and open up one of those syringes as she searched thom yanked down rhymes pajamas and grabbed a catheter from beside the bed tore open its plastic wrapper too he smeared the end with ky jelly and lifted rhymes pale penis inserting the catheter gently but quickly into the tip thiss part of the problem bowel and urinary pressure can trigger an attack hes been drinking way more than he should today she opened the hypodermic but said i dont know how to do the needle ill do it he looked up at her could i ask would you mind doing this i dont want the tube to get a kink in it okay sure you want gloves she pulled on a pair and carefully took rhymes penis in her left hand she held the tube in her right it had been a long long time since shed held a man here the skin was soft and she thought how strange it was that this center of a mans being is most of the time as delicate as silk thom expertly injected the drug come on lincoln a siren sounded in the distance theyre almost here she said glancing out the window if we dont bring him back now theres nothing they can do how long does it take the drug to work thom stared at the unresponsive rhyme said it shouldve by now but too high a dose and he goes into shock the aide bent down and lifted an eyelid the blue pupil was glazed unfocused this isnt good he took the pressure again one fifty christ itll kill him she said oh thats not the problem what a shocked amelia sachs whispered he doesnt mind dying he looked at her briefly as if surprised she hadnt figured this out he just doesnt want to be any more paralyzed than he already is he prepared another injection he may alreadyve had one a stroke i mean thats what terrifies him thom leaned forward and injected more of the drug the siren was closer now honking too cars would be blocking the ambulances way in no hurry to pull aside one of the things that infuriated sachs about the city you can take the catheter out now she carefully extracted the tube should i nodding toward the urine bag thom managed a weak smile thats my job several minutes passed the ambulance seemed to make no progress then a voice crackled over a speaker and gradually the siren grew closer suddenly rhyme stirred his head shook slightly then it lolled back and forth pressed into the pillow his skin lost some of its florid tone lincoln can you hear me he moaned thom rhyme was shivering violently thom covered him with a sheet sachs found herself smoothing rhymes mussed hair she took a tissue and wiped his forehead footsteps pounded on the stairs and two burly ems medics appeared radios crackling they hurried into the room took rhymes blood pressure and checked the nerve stimulator a moment later dr peter taylor burst into the room peter thom said dysreflexia pressure its down but it was bad crested at one fifty the doctor winced thom introduced taylor to the ems techs they seemed pleased an expert was there and stepped back as taylor walked over to the bedside doctor rhyme said groggily lets look at those eyes taylor shone a light into rhymes pupils sachs scanned the doctors face for a reaction and was troubled by his frown dont need the nerve stimulator rhyme whispered you and your lungs right the doctor asked wryly well lets keep it going for a little while why dont we just till we see what exactlys going on here he glanced at sachs maybe you could wait downstairs taylor leaned close and rhyme noticed the beads of sweat dotting the doctors scalp under his thin hair the mans deft hands lifted a lid and gazed again into one pupil then the next he rigged up the sphygmomanometer and took rhymes blood pressure his eyes distant with that concentration of medicos lost in their minute vital tasks approaching normal he announced hows the urine eleven hundred ccs thom said taylor glowered been neglecting things or just drinking to excess rhyme glowered right back we were distracted doctor its been a busy night taylor followed rhymes nod and glanced around the room surprised as if someone had just sneaked the equipment in when he wasnt looking whats all this they hauled me out of retirement taylors perplexed frown grew into a smile about time ive been after you for months to do something with your life now whats the bowel situation thom said probably twelve hours fourteen careless of you taylor chided it wasnt his fault rhyme snapped ive had a roomful of people here all day i dont want to hear excuses the doctor shot back this was pete taylor who never spoke through anyone when he talked to rhyme and never let his bullying patient bully him we better take care of things he pulled on surgical gloves leaned over rhymes torso his fingers began manipulating the abdomen to trick the numb intestines into doing their work thom lifted the blankets and got the disposable diapers a moment later the job was done and thom cleaned his boss taylor said suddenly so youve given up that nonsense i hope studying rhyme closely that nonsense hed meant the suicide with a glance at thom rhyme said havent thought about that for a while good taylor looked over the instruments on the table this is what you ought to be doing maybe the departmentll put you back on the payroll dont think i could pass the physical hows the head a dozen sledgehammers comes close to describing it my neck too had two bad cramps so far today taylor walked behind the clinitron pressed his fingers on either side of rhymes spine where rhyme supposed though hed never seen the spot of course there were prominent incision scars from the operations hed had over the years taylor gave rhyme an expert massage digging deep into the taut straps of muscle in his shoulders and neck the pain slowly vanished he felt the doctors thumbs pause at what he guessed was the shattered vertebra the spaceship the stingray someday theyll fix this taylor said someday itll be no worse than breaking your leg you listen to me i predict it fifteen minutes later peter taylor came down the stairs and joined the cops on the sidewalk is he all right amelia sachs asked anxiously the pressures down he needs rest mostly the doctor a plainlooking man suddenly realized he was talking to a very beautiful woman he smoothed his thinning gray hair and cast a discreet glance at her willowy figure his eyes then went to the squad cars in front of the townhouse and he asked whats the case hes helping you with sellitto demurred as all detectives will in the face of that question from civilians but sachs had guessed taylor and rhyme were close so she said the kidnappings have you heard about them the taxidriver case its on all the news good for him work is the best thing that could happen to him he needs friends and he needs purpose thom appeared at the top of the stairs he said thanks pete well he didnt actually say thanks but he meant it you know how he is level with me taylor asked voice lower now conspiratorial is he still planning on talking to them and when thom said no hes not something in his tone told sachs that he was lying she didnt know about what or what significance it might have but it rankled planning on talking to them in any case taylor seemed not to pick up on the aides deceit he said ill come back tomorrow see how hes doing thom said hed appreciate it and taylor slung his bag over his shoulder and started up the sidewalk the aide gestured to sellitto hed like to talk to you for a minute the detective climbed the stairs quickly he disappeared into the room and a few minutes later he and thom walked outside sellitto solemn himself now glanced at her your turn and nodded toward the stairs rhyme lay in the massive bed hair mussed face no longer red hands no longer ivory the room smelled ripe visceral there were clean sheets on the bed and his clothes had been changed again this time the pajamas were as green as dellrays suit those are the ugliest pjs ive ever seen she said your ex gave them to you didnt she howd you guess an anniversary present sorry for the scare he said looking away from her he seemed suddenly timid and that upset her she thought of her father in the preop room at sloankettering before they took him down to the exploratory surgery he never awoke from sorry she asked ominously no more of that shit rhyme he appraised her for a minute then said you twoll do fine we two you and lon mel too of course and jim polling what do you mean im retiring youre what too taxing for the old system im afraid but you cant quit she waved at the monet poster look at everything weve found about were so close so you dont need me all you need is a little luck luck it took years to get bundy and what about the zodiac killer and the werewolf weve got good information here hard information youll come up with some good leads youll nail him sachs your swan song before they lap you up into public affairs ive got a feeling unsub s getting cocky they might even collar him at the church you look fine she said after a moment though he didnt rhyme laughed then the smile faded im very tired and i hurt hell i think i hurt in places the docsll say i cant hurt do what i do take a nap he tried to snort a derisive laugh but he sounded weak she hated seeing him this way he coughed briefly glanced down at the nerve stimulator and grimaced as if he was embarrassed that he depended on the machine sachs i dont suppose well be working together again i just wanted to say that youve got a good career ahead of you you make the right choices well ill come back and see you after we snag his bad ass id like that im glad you were first officer yesterday morning theres nobody else id ratherve walked the grid with i lincoln a voice said she turned to see a man in the doorway he looked around the room curiously taking in all the equipment been some excitement around here looks like doctor rhyme said his face blossoming into a smile please come in he stepped into the room i got thoms message emergency he said dr william berger this is amelia sachs but sachs could see shed already ceased to exist in lincoln rhymes universe whatever else was left to be said and she felt there were some things maybe many things would have to wait she walked through the door thom who stood in the large hallway outside closed the door behind her and ever proper paused nodding for her to precede him as sachs walked out into the steamy night she heard a voice from nearby excuse me she turned and found dr peter taylor standing by himself under a ginkgo tree can i talk to you for a minute sachs followed taylor up the sidewalk a few doors yes she asked he leaned against a stone wall and gave another selfconscious swipe at his hair sachs recalled how many times shed intimidated men with a single word or glance she thought as she often did what a useless power beauty is youre his friend right the doctor asked her i mean you work with him but youre a friend too sure i guess i am that man who just went inside do you know who he is berger i think hes a doctor did he say where he was from no taylor looked up at rhymes bedroom window for a moment he asked you know the lethe society no oh wait its a euthanasia group right taylor nodded i know all of lincolns doctors and ive never heard of berger i was just thinking maybe hes with them what is he still talking to them so thats what the conversation was about she felt weightless from the shock has he has he talked seriously about this before oh yes taylor sighed gazed into the smoky night sky oh yes then glanced at her name badge officer sachs ive spent hours trying to talk him out of it days but ive also worked with quads for years and i know how stubborn they are maybe hed listen to you just a few words i was thinking could you oh goddamn it rhyme she muttered and started down the sidewalk at a run leaving the doctor in midsentence she got to the front door of the townhouse just as thom was closing it she pushed past him forgot my watchbook your be right back you cant go up there hes with his doctor ill just be a second she was at the landing before thom started after her he must have known it was a scam because he took the stairs two at a time but she had a good lead and had shoved open rhymes door before the aide got to the top of the stairs she pushed in startling both rhyme and the doctor who was leaning against the table arms crossed she closed the door and locked it thom began pounding berger turned toward her with a frown of curiosity on his face sachs rhyme blurted i have to talk to you what about about you later how much later rhyme she asked sarcastically tomorrow next week what do you mean you want me to schedule a meeting for maybe a week from wednesday will you be able to make it then will you be around sachs i want to talk to you alone no then well do it the hard way she stepped up to berger youre under arrest the charge is attempted assisted suicide and the handcuffs flashed click click snapping onto his wrists in a silver blur she guessed the building was a church carole ganz lay in the basement on the floor a single shaft of cold oblique light fell on the wall illuminating a shabby picture of jesus and a stack of mildewy golden book bible stories a halfdozen tiny chairs for sundayschool students she guessed were nested in the middle of the room the cuffs were still on and so was the gag hed also tied her to a pipe near the wall with a fourfootlong piece of clothesline on a tall table nearby she could see the top of a large glass jug if she could knock it off she might use a piece of glass to cut the clothesline the table seemed out of reach but she rolled over onto her side and started to squirm like a caterpillar toward it this reminded her of pammy when she was an infant rolling on the bed between herself and ron she thought of her baby alone in that horrible basement and started to cry pammy pooh purse for a moment for a brief moment she weakened wished shed never left chicago no stop thinking that way quit feeling sorry for yourself this was the absolute right thing to do you did it for ron and for yourself too hed be proud of you kate had told her that a thousand times and she believed it struggling once more she moved a foot closer to the table groggy couldnt think straight her throat stung from the terrible thirst and the mold and mildew in the air she crawled a little farther then lay on her side catching her breath staring up at the table it seemed hopeless whats the use she thought wondering what was going through pammys mind you fucker thought carole ill kill you for this she squirmed trying to move farther along the floor but instead she lost her balance and rolled onto her back she gasped knowing what was coming no with a loud pop her wrist snapped she screamed through the gag blacked out when she came to a moment later she was overwhelmed with nausea no no no if she vomited shed die with the gag on that would be it fight it down fight it come on you can do it here i go she retched once then again no control it rising in her throat control control it and she did breathing through her nose concentrating on kate and eddie and pammy on the yellow knapsack containing all her precious possessions seeing it picturing it from every angle her whole life was in there her new life ron i dont want to blow it i came here for you honey she closed her eyes thought breathe deep in out finally the nausea subsided and a moment later she was feeling better and though she was crying in pain from the snapped wrist she managed to continue to caterpillar her way toward the table one foot two she felt a thump as her head collided with the table leg shed just managed to connect with it and couldnt move any farther she swung her head back and forth and jostled the table hard she heard the bottle slosh as it shifted on the tabletop she looked up a bit of the jug was showing beyond the edge of the table carole drew back her head and hit the table leg one last time no shed knocked the leg out of reach the jug teetered for a moment but stayed upright carole strained to get more slack from the clothesline but couldnt damn oh damn as she gazed hopelessly up at the filthy bottle she realized it was filled with a liquid and something floated inside what is that she scrunched her way back toward the wall a foot or two and looked up it seemed like a lightbulb inside no not a whole bulb just the filament and the base screwed into a socket a wire ran from the socket out of the jug to one of those timers that turn the lights on and off when youre away on vacation it looked like a bomb now she recognized the faintest whiff of gasoline no no carole began to squirm away from the table as fast as she could sobbing in desperation there was a filing cabinet by the wall itd give her some protection she drew her legs up then felt a chill of panic and unwound them furiously the motion knocked her off balance she realized to her horror that she was rolling onto her back once more oh stop dont she stayed poised perfectly still for a long moment quivering as she tried to shift her weight forward but then she continued to roll collapsing onto her cuffed hand her shattered wrist taking the weight of her body there was a moment of incredible pain and mercifully she fainted once more twentyfive no way rhyme you cant do it berger looked on uneasily rhyme supposed that in this line of work hed seen all sorts of hysterical scenarios played out at moments like this the biggest problem bergerd have wasnt those wanting to die but those who wanted everyone else to live thom pounded on the door thom rhyme called its all right you can leave us then to sachs weve said our farewells you and me its bad form to ruin a perfect exit you cant do this whod blown the whistle pete taylor maybe the doctor mustve guessed that he and thom were lying rhyme saw her eyes slip to the three items on the table the gifts of the magi the brandy the pills and the plastic bag also a rubber band similar to the ones sachs still wore on her shoes how many times had he come home from a crime scene to find blaine staring at the bands on his shoes horrified everybodyll think my husband cant afford new shoes hes keeping the soles on with rubber bands honestly lincoln sachs take the cuffs off the good doctor here ill have to ask you to leave one last time she barked a fast laugh excuse me thiss a crime in new york the da could bootstrap it into murder he wanted to berger said im just having a conversation with a patient thats why the charges only attempt so far maybe we should run your name and prints through ncic see what we come up with lincoln berger said quickly alarmed i cant well get it worked out rhyme said sachs please feet apart hands on trim hips her gorgeous face imperious lets go she barked to the doctor sachs you have no idea how important this is i wont let you kill yourself let me rhyme snapped let me and why exactly do i need your permission berger said miss officer sachs its his decision and its completely consensual lincolns more informed than most of the patients i deal with patients victims you mean sachs rhyme blurted trying to keep the desperation from his voice its taken me a year to find someone to help me maybe because its wrong ever consider that why now rhyme right in the middle of the case if i have another attack and a stroke i might lose all ability to communicate i could be conscious for forty years and completely unable to move and if im not braindead nobody in the universe is going to pull the plug at least now im still able to communicate my decisions but why she blurted why not rhyme answered tell me why not well it seemed as if the arguments against suicide were so obvious she was having trouble articulating them because because why sachs for one thing its cowardly rhyme laughed do you want to debate it sachs do you fair enough cowardly you say that leads us to sir thomas browne when life is more terrible than death its the truest valor to live courage in the face of insurmountable adversity a classic argument in favor of living but if thats true then why anesthetize patients before surgery why sell aspirin why fix broken arms why is prozac the most prescribed medicine in america sorry but theres nothing intrinsically good about pain but youre not in pain and how do you define pain sachs maybe the absence of all feeling can be pain too you can contribute so much look at all you know all the forensics all the history the socialcontribution argument thats a popular one he glanced at berger but the medico remained silent rhyme saw his interest dip to the bone sitting on the table the pale disk of spinal column he picked it up kneaded it in his cuffed hands he was a former orthopedics man rhyme recalled he continued to sachs but who says we should contribute anything to life besides the corollary is i might contribute something bad i might cause some harm too to myself or someone else thats what life is rhyme smiled but im choosing death not life sachs looked uneasy as she thought hard its just death isnt natural life is no freudd disagree with you he gave up on the pleasure principle and came to feel that there was another force a nonerotic primary aggression he called it working to unbind the connections we build in life our own destructions a perfectly natural force everything dies whats more natural than that again she worried a portion of her scalp all right she said lifes more of a challenge to you than most people but i thought everything ive seen about you tells me youre somebody who likes challenges challenges let me tell you about challenges i was on a ventilator for a year see the tracheotomy scar on my neck well through positivepressure breathing exercises and the greatest willpower i could muster i managed to get off the machine in fact ive got lungs like nobodys business theyre as strong as yours in a c quad thats one for the books sachs it consumed my life for eight months do you understand what im saying eight months just to handle a basic animal function im not talking about painting the sistine chapel or playing the violin im talking about fucking breathing but you could get better next year they might find a cure no not next year not in ten years you dont know that they must be doing research sure they are want to know what im an expert transplanting embryonic nerve tissue onto damaged tissue to promote axonal regeneration these words tripped easily from his handsome lips no significant effect some doctors are chemically treating the affected areas to create an environment where cells can regenerate no significant effect not in advanced species lower forms of life show pretty good success if i were a frog id be walking again well hopping so there are people working on it sachs asked sure but no one expects any breakthroughs for twenty thirty years if they were expected she shot back then they wouldnt be breakthroughs now would they rhyme laughed she was good sachs tossed the veil of red hair from her eyes and said your career was law enforcement remember suicides illegal its a sin too he responded the dakota indians believed that the ghosts of those who committed suicide had to drag around the tree theyd hanged themselves from for all eternity did that stop suicide nope they just used small trees tell you what rhyme heres my last argument she nodded at berger grabbed the cuff chain im taking him in and booking him refute that one lincoln berger said uneasily panic in his eyes sachs took the doctor by the shoulder and led him to the door no he said please dont do this as sachs opened the door rhyme called out sachs before you do that answer me something she paused one hand on the knob one question she looked back have you ever wanted to kill yourself she unlocked the door with a loud snap he said answer me sachs didnt open the door she stood with her back to him no never are you happy with your life as much as anybody youre never depressed i didnt say that i said ive never wanted to kill myself you like to drive you were telling me people who like to drive like to drive fast you do dont you yes sometimes whats the fastest youve done i dont know over eighty a dismissing smile yes over a hundred she gestured upward with her thumb one ten one twenty he asked smiling in astonishment clocked at my sachs you are impressive well driving that fast didnt you think that maybe just maybe something might happen a rod or axle or something would break a tire would blow a spot of oil on the road it was pretty safe im not crazy pretty safe but driving as fast as a small plane well thats not completely safe now is it youre leading the witness no im not stay with me you drive that fast you have to accept that you could have an accident and die right maybe she conceded berger cuffed hands in front of him looked on nervously as he kneaded the pale yellow disk of spinal column so youve moved close to that line right ah you know what im talking about i know you do the line between the risk of dying and the certainty of dying see sachs if you carry the dead around with you its a very short step over that line a short step to joining them she lowered her head and her face went completely still as the curtain of hair obscured her eyes giving up the dead he whispered praying she wouldnt leave with berger knowing he was so very close to pushing her over the edge i touched a nerve there how much of you wants to follow the dead more than a little sachs oh much more than a little she was hesitating he knew he was near her heart she turned angrily to berger gripped him by the cuffs come on pushed through the door rhyme called you know what im saying dont you again she stopped sometimes things happen sachs sometimes you just cant be what you ought to be you cant have what you ought to have and life changes maybe just a little maybe a lot and at some point it just isnt worth the fight to try to fix what went wrong he watched them standing motionless in the doorway the room was utterly silent she turned and looked back at him death cures loneliness rhyme continued it cures tension it cures the itch just like shed glanced at his legs earlier he now gave a fast look at her torn fingers she released bergers cuffs and walked to the window tears glistened on her cheeks in the yellow radiance from the streetlights outside sachs im tired he said earnestly i cant tell you how tired i am you know how hard life is to start with pile on a whole mountainful of burdens washing eating crapping making phone calls buttoning shirts scratching your nose then pile on a thousand more and more after that he fell silent after a long moment she said ill make a deal with you whats that she nodded toward the poster eight twentythrees got that mother and her little girl help us save them just them if you do that ill give him an hour alone with you she glanced at berger provided he gets the hell out of town afterwards rhyme shook his head sachs if i have a stroke if i cant communicate if that happens she said evenly even if you cant say a word the deal still holds ill make sure you have one hour together she crossed her arms spread her feet again in what was now rhymes favorite image of amelia sachs he wished he couldve seen her on the railroad tracks that morning stopping the train she said thats the best ill do a moment passed rhyme nodded okay its a deal to berger he said monday okay lincoln fair enough berger still shaken watched sachs cautiously as she unlocked the cuffs afraid it seemed that she might change her mind when he was free he walked quickly to the door he realized he was still holding the vertebra and returned set it almost reverently next to rhyme on the crime scene report for the first murder that morning happiern hogs in red virginia mud sachs remarked slouching in the squeaky rattan chair meaning sellitto and polling after shed told them that rhyme had agreed to remain on the case for another day polling particularly she said i thought the little guy was going to hug me dont tell him i called him that how are you feeling you look better she sipped some scotch and set the glass back on the bedside table beside rhymes tumbler not bad thom was changing the bedclothes you were sweating like a fountain he said but only above my neck rhyme pointed out sweating i mean that right sachs asked yep thats how it works thermostats busted below that i never need any axial deodorant axial pit rhyme snorted armpit my first aide never said armpit hed say im going to elevate you by your axials lincoln oh and if you feel like regurgitating go right ahead lincoln he called himself a caregiver the word was actually on his résumé i have no idea why i hired him were very superstitious sachs we think calling something by a different name is going to change it unsub perpetrator but that aide he was just a nurse who was up to his own armpits in piss n puke right thom nothing to be ashamed of its an honorable profession messy but honorable i thrive on mess thats why i work for you whatre you thom an aide or a caregiver im a saint ha fast with the comebacks and fast with the needle too he brought me back from the dead done it more than once rhyme was suddenly pierced with a fear that sachs had seen him naked eyes fixed firmly on the unsub profile he asked say do i owe you some thanks too sachs did you play clara barton here he uneasily waited for her answer didnt know how he could look at her again if she had nup thom answered saved you all by my lonesome didnt want any of these sensitive souls repulsed by the sight of your baggy rear end thank you thom he thought then barked now go away we have to talk about the case sachs and me you need some sleep of course i do but we still need to talk about the case good night good night after thom left sachs poured some macallan in a glass she lowered her head and inhaled the smoky vapors who snitched rhyme asked pete who she asked dr taylor the sci man she hesitated long enough for him to know that taylor was the one she said finally he cares about you of course he does thats the problem i want him to care a little less does he know about berger he suspects rhyme grimaced look tell him that bergers just an old friend he what sachs exhaled slowly as if shooting cigarette smoke through her pursed lips you not only want me to let you kill yourself you want me to lie to the one person who could talk you out of it he couldnt talk me out of it rhyme responded then why do you want me to lie he laughed lets just keep dr taylor in the dark for a few more days all right she said jesus youre a tough person to deal with he examined her closely why dont you tell me about it about what whos the dead that you havent given up theres plenty of them such as read the newspaper come on sachs she shook her head stared down at her scotch with a faint smile on her lips no i dont think so he put her silence down to reluctance about having an intimate conversation with someone shed known only for one day which seemed ironic considering she sat next to a dozen catheters a tube of ky jelly and a box of depends still he wasnt going to push it and said nothing more so he was surprised when she suddenly looked up and blurted its just its just oh hell and as the sobbing began she lifted her hands to her face spilling a good two inches of scotland s best all over the parquet twentysix i cant believe im telling you this she sat huddled in the deep chair legs drawn up issue shoes kicked off the tears were gone though her face was as ruddy as her hair go on he encouraged that guy i told you about we were going to get an apartment together oh with the collie you didnt say it was a guy your boyfriend the secret lover rhyme wondered he was my boyfriend i was thinking maybe it was your father youd lost naw pop did pass away three years ago cancer but we knew it was coming if that prepares you for it i guess we were prepared but nick he was killed rhyme asked softly but she didnt answer nick carelli one of us a cop detective third worked street crimes the name was familiar rhyme said nothing and let her continue we lived together for a while talked about getting married she paused seemed to be lining up her thoughts like targets at a shooting range he worked undercover so we were pretty secret about our relationship he couldnt let word get around on the street that his gal was a cop she cleared her throat its hard to explain see we had this thing between us it was it hasnt happened for me very often hell it never happened before nick we clicked in some really deep way he knew i had to be a cop and that wasnt a problem for him same with me and his working undercover that kind of wavelength you knew where you just completely understand someone you ever felt what im talking about with your wife rhyme smiled faintly i did yes but not with blaine my wife and that was all he wanted to say on the subject howd you meet he asked the assignments lectures at the academy where somebody gets up and they tell you a little about what their division does nick was lecturing on undercover work he asked me out on the spot our first date was at rodmans neck the gun range she nodded sniffing afterwards we went to his moms in brooklyn and had pasta and a bottle of chianti she pinched me hard and said i was too skinny to have babies made me eat two cannoli we went back to my place and he stayed over that night quite a first date huh from then on we saw each other all the time it was gonna work rhyme i felt it it was gonna work just fine rhyme said what happened he was another bolstering hit of old liquor he was on the take is what happened the whole time i knew him he was crooked oh way crooked i never had a clue not a single goddamn clue he socked it away in banks around the city he dusted close to two hundred thousand lincoln was silent a moment im sorry sachs drugs no merch mostly appliances tvs jackings they called it the brooklyn connection the papers did rhyme was nodding thats why i remember it there were a dozen of them in the ring right all cops mostly a few icc people too what happened to him nick you know what happens when cops bust cops they beat the crap out of him said he resisted but i know he didnt broke three ribs a couple fingers smashed his face all up pleaded guilty but he still got twenty to thirty for hijacking rhyme was astonished he worked a couple of the jobs himself pistolwhipped one driver took a shot at another one just to scare him i know it was just to scare him but the judge threw him away she closed her eyes pressed her lips together hard when he got collared internal affairs went after him like they were in heat they checked pen registers we were real careful about calling each other he said perps sometimes tapped his line but there were some calls to my place ia came after me too so nick just cut me off i mean he had to otherwise i wouldve gone down with him you know ia its always a goddamn witchhunt what happened to convince them that i wasnt anything to him well he said some things about me she swallowed her eyes fixed on the floor at the ia inquest they wanted to know about me nick said oh pd sachs i just fucked her a few times turned out she was lousy so i dumped her she tilted her head back and mopped tears with her sleeve the nickname pd lon told me she frowned did he tell you what it means the portables daughter after your father she smiled wanly thats how it started but thats not how it ended up at the inquest nick said i was such a lousy fuck it really stood for pussy diver cause i probably liked girls better guess how fast that went through the department its a low common denominator out there sachs she took a deep breath i saw him in court toward the end of the inquest he looked at me once and i cant even describe what was in his eyes just pure heartbreak oh he did it to protect me but still you were right you know about the lonely stuff i didnt mean no she said unsmiling i hit you you hit me that was fair and you were right i hate being alone i want to go out i want to meet somebody but after nick i lost my taste for sex sachs gave a sour laugh everybody thinks looking like mes wonderful i could have my pick of

reaction at seeing him for the first time she was at ease with him because here was a man who was no threat to her no sexual comeons someone she wouldnt have to fend off and perhaps a certain

position of the gun i did the search signed off and went back to the office what happened the scene had been staged it was really a burglarymurder and the perp had never left the apartment what he was

dont use it anymore why not he didnt answer but said instead put something on is it plugged in it is good pick something a moment later she stepped out of the closet and walked over to the couch as levi stubbs and the four tops started singing about love it had been a year since thered been a note of music in this room rhyme estimated silently he tried to answer sachss question about why hed stopped listening he couldnt sachs lifted files and books off the couch lay back on it and thumbed through a copy of scenes of the crime can i have one she asked take ten will you her voice braked to a halt sign it for you he laughed she joined him how bout if i put my thumbprint on it graphoanalystsll never give you more than an eightyfive percent probability of a handwriting match but a

most im a terrible reader rhyme confessed i sound like im reciting crime scene reports but ive got this memory its pretty good how bout if i just tell you about some scenes would you she turned her back pulled her navy blouse off and unstrapped the thin american body armor vest tossed it aside beneath it she wore a mesh tshirt and under that a sports bra she pulled the blouse back on and lay on the couch pulling the blanket over her and curled up on her side closed her eyes with the environmental control unit rhyme dimmed the lights i always found the sites of death fascinating he began theyre like shrines were a lot more interested in where people bought the big one than where they were born take john kennedy a thousand people a day visit the texas book depository in dallas how many

we really know is what the witnesses tell us remember what i say never trust a wit maybe those bible accounts arent what happened at all wheres the proof the pe the nails blood sweat the spear the cross the vinegar sandal prints and friction ridges rhyme turned his head slightly to the left and he continued to talk about crime scenes and evidence until sachss chest rose and fell steadily and faint strands of her fiery red hair blew back and forth under her shallow breath with his left index finger he flipped through the ecu control and shut off the light he too was soon asleep a faint light of dawn was in the sky awakening carole ganz could see it through the chicken wire impregnated glass above her head pammy oh baby then she thought of ron and all her possessions sitting in that terrible basement the money the yellow knapsack mostly though she was thinking about pammy something had wakened her from a light troubled sleep what was it the pain from her wrist it throbbed horribly she adjusted herself slightly she the tubular howl of a pipe organ and a rising chorus of voices filled the room again thats what had wakened her music a crashing wave of music the church wasnt abandoned there were people around she laughed to herself somebody would and that was when she remembered the bomb carole peered around the filing cabinet it was still there teetering on the edge of the table it had the crude look of real bombs and murder weapons not the slick shiny gadgets you see in movies sloppy tape badly stripped wires dirty gasoline maybe its a dud she thought in the daylight it didnt look so dangerous another burst of music it came from directly over her head accompanied by a shuffling of footsteps a door closed creaks and groans as people moved around the old dry wood floors plumes of dust fell from the joists the soaring voices were cut off in midpassage a moment later they started singing again carole banged with her feet but the floor was concrete the walls brick she tried to scream but the sound was swallowed by the gag the rehearsal continued the solemn vigorous music rattling through the basement after ten minutes carole collapsed on the floor in exhaustion her eyes were drawn back to the bomb again now the light was better and she could see the timer clearly carole squinted the timer it wasnt a dud at all the arrow was set for am the dial showed the time was now squirming her way farther behind the filing cabinet carole began to kick the metal sides with her knee but whatever faint noises the blows made immediately vanished in the booming mournful rendition of swing low sweet chariot filling the church basement from above iv down to the bone this only is denied the gods the power to remake the past aristotle twentyseven sunday am to monday pm he awoke to a scent as he often did and as on many mornings he didnt at first open his eyes but just remained in his halfseated position trying to figure out what the unfamiliar smell might be the gassy scent of dawn air the dew on the oilslick streets damp plaster he tried to detect the scent of amelia sachs but could not his thoughts skipped over her and continued what was it cleanser no a chemical from coopers impromptu lab no he recognized all of those it was ah yes marking pen now he could open his eyes and after a glance at sleeping sachs to make certain she hadnt deserted him found himself gazing at the monet poster on the wall thats where the smell was coming from the hot humid air of this august morning had wilted the paper and brought the scent out knows cs

we have been having some trouble figuring out where it is im sure you have the snide crook said see rhyme continued weve narrowed it down to the stone wall in the coal bin of a colonial farmhouse on the connecticut river about five miles north of long island sound i just cant tell whether the house is on the east bank or the west bank of the river when the story made the rounds the phrase everybody used to describe the expression on the perps face was you had to fucking be there maybe it is magic sachs he thought at least years old prob mansion or institutional he scanned the poster once again and closed his eyes leaning back into his glorious pillow it was then that he felt the jolt almost like a slap on his face the shock rose to his scalp like spreading fire eyes wide locked onto the poster old appeals to him sachs he cried wake up she stirred and sat up what whats old old old i made a mistake he said tersely theres a problem she thought at first it was something medical and she leapt from the couch reaching for thoms medical bag no the clues sachs the clues i got it wrong his breathing was rapid and he ground his teeth together as he thought she pulled her clothes on sat back her fingers disappearing automatically into her scalp scratching what rhyme what is it the church it might not be in harlem he repeated i made a mistake just like with the perp who killed colin stantons family in criminalistics you can nail down a hundred clues perfectly and its the one you miss that gets people killed what time is it she asked quarter to six a little after get the newspaper the churchservices schedule sachs found the paper thumbed through it then looked up whatre you thinking eight twentythrees obsessed with whats old if hes after an old black church then he might not mean uptown philip payton started the afroamerican realty company in harlem in there were two other black settlements in the city downtown where the courthouses are now and san juan hill theyre mostly white now but oh what the hell was i thinking of wheres san juan hill just north of hells kitchen on the west side it was named in honor of all the black soldiers who fought in the spanishamerican war she read through the paper downtown churches she said well in battery park theres the seamens institute a chapel there they have services trinity saint pauls that wasnt the black area farther north and east a presbyterian church in chinatown any baptist evangelical no nothing in that area at all theres oh hell with resignation in her eyes she sighed oh no rhyme understood sunrise service she was nodding holy tabernacle baptist oh rhyme theres a gospel service starting at six fiftyninth and eleventh avenue thats san juan hill call them she grabbed the phone and dialed the number she stood head down fiercely plucking an eyebrow and shaking her head answer answer hell its a recording the minister must be out of his office she said into the receiver this is the new york police department we have reason to believe theres a firebomb in your church evacuate as fast as possible she hung up pulled her shoes on go sachs youve got to get there now me were closer than the nearest precinct you can be there in ten minutes she jogged toward the door slinging her utility belt around her waist ill call the precinct he yelled as she leapt down the stairs hair a red cloud around her head and sachs if you ever wanted to drive fast do it now the rrv wagon skidded into st street speeding west sachs burst into the intersection at broadway skidded hard and whacked a new york post vending machine sending it through zabars window before she brought the wagon under control she remembered all the crime scene equipment in the back rearheavy vehicle she thought dont corner at fifty then down broadway brake at the intersections check left check right clear punch it she peeled off on ninth avenue at lincoln center and headed south im only oh hell a mad stop on screaming tires the street was closed a row of blue sawhorses blocked ninth for a street fair later that morning a banner proclaimed crafts and delicacies of all nations hand in hand we are all one gaw damn un she backed up a half block and got the wagon up to fifty before she slammed into the first sawhorse spreading portable aluminum tables and wooden display racks in her wake she tore a swath through the deserted fair two blocks later the wagon broke through the southern barricade and she skidded west on fiftyninth using far more of the sidewalk than she meant to there was the church a hundred yards away parishioners on the steps parents little girls in frilly white and pink dresses young boys in dark suits and white shirts their hair in gangsta knobs or fades and from a basement window a small puff of gray smoke sachs slammed the accelerator to the floor the engine roaring grabbing the radio rrv two to central k and in the instant it took her to glance down at the motorola to make sure the volume was up a big mercedes slipped out of the alley directly into her path a fast glimpse of the family inside eyes wide in horror as the father slammed on the brakes sachs instinctively spun the wheel hard to the left putting the wagon into controlled skid come on she was begging the tires grip grip grip but the oily asphalt was loose from the heat of the past few days and covered with dew the wagon danced over the road like a hydrofoil the rear end met the mercs front flaton at fifty miles an hour with an explosive boom the sheared off the rear right side of the wagon the black cs suitcases flew into the air breaking open and strewing their contents along the street churchgoers dove for cover from the splinters of glass and plastic and sheet metal the air bag popped and deflated stunning sachs she covered her face as the wagon tumbled over a row of cars and through a newsstand then skidded to a stop upside down newspapers and plastic evidence bags floated to the ground like tiny paratroopers held upside down by the harness blinded by her hair sachs wiped blood from her torn forehead and lip and tried to pop the belt release it held tight hot gasoline flowed into the car and trickled along her arm she pulled a switchblade from her back pocket flicked the knife open and cut the seat belt falling she nearly skewered herself on the knife and lay gasping choking on the gas fumes come on girl get out out the doors were jammed closed and there was no escape through the crushed rear end of the wagon sachs began kicking the windows the glass wouldnt break she drew her foot back and slammed it hard into the cracked windshield no effect except that she nearly sprained her ankle her gun she slapped her hip the gun had been torn from the holster and tossed somewhere inside the car feeling the hot drizzle of gasoline on her arm and shoulder she searched frantically through the papers and cs equipment littering the ceiling of the station wagon then she saw the clunky glock near the dome light she swept it up and aimed at the side window go ahead backdrops clear no spectators yet then she hesitated would the muzzle flash ignite the gas she held the gun as far away from her soaked uniform blouse as she could debating then squeezed the trigger twentyeight five shots a star pattern and even then the honest general motors glass held firm three more blasts deafening her in the confines of the wagon but at least the gas didnt explode she began to kick again finally the window burst outward in a cascade of bluegreen ice just as she rolled out the interior of the wagon exploded with a breathless woosh stripping down to her tshirt she flung away her gassoaked uniform blouse and bulletproof vest and tossed aside the headset mike felt her ankle wobble but sprinted to the front door of the church past the fleeing churchgoers and choir the ground floor was filled with bubbling smoke nearby a section of the floor rippled and steamed and then burst into flames the minister appeared suddenly choking tears streaming down his face he was dragging an unconscious woman behind him sachs helped him get her to the door wheres the basement she asked he coughed hard shook his head where she cried thinking of carole ganz and her little daughter the basement there but on the other side of the patch of burning floor sachs could barely see it the smoke was so thick a wall collapsed in front of them the old joists and posts behind it snapping and firing sparks and jets of hot gas which hissed into the cloudy room she hesitated then started for the basement door the minister took her arm wait he opened a closet and grabbed a fire extinguisher yanked the arming pin lets go sachs shook her head not you keep checking up here tell the fire department theres a police officer and another victim in the basement sachs was sprinting now when you move she jumped over the fiery patch of floor but because of the smoke she misjudged the distance to the wall it was closer than shed thought and she slammed into the wood paneling then fell backwards rolling as her hair brushed the fire some strands igniting gagging on the stink she crushed the flames out and started to push herself to her feet the floor weakened by the flames beneath broke under her weight and her face crashed into the oak she felt the blaze in the basement lick her hands and arms as she yanked her hands back rolling away from the edge she climbed to her feet and reached for the knob to the basement door she stopped suddenly come on girl think better feel a door before opening it if its too hot and you let oxygen into a superheated room itll ignite and the backdraftll fry your ass good she touched the wood it was scorching hot then thought but what the hell else can i do spitting on her hand she gripped the knob fast twisting it open and releasing it just before the burn seared her palm the door burst open and a cloud of smoke and sparks shot outward anybody down there she called and started down the lower stairs were burning she blasted them with a short burst of carbon dioxide and leapt into the murky basement she broke through the secondtolast step pitching forward the extinguisher clattered to the floor as she grabbed the railing just in time to save her leg from snapping pulling herself out of the broken step sachs squinted through the haze the smoke wasnt as bad down here it was rising but the flames were raging all around her the extinguisher had rolled under a burning table forget it she ran through the smoke hello she shouted no answer then remembered that unsub used duct tape he liked his vics silent she kicked in a small doorway and looked inside the boiler room there was a door leading outside but burning debris blocked it completely beside it stood the fuel tank which was now surrounded by flames it wont explode sachs remembered from the academy the lecture on arson fuel oil doesnt explode kick aside the debris and push the door open clear your escape route then go look for the woman and the girl she hesitated watching the flames roll over the side of the oil tank it wont explode it wont explode she started forward edging toward the door it wont the tank suddenly puffed out like a heated soda can and split down the middle the oil squirted into the air igniting in a huge orange spume a fiery pool formed on the floor and flowed toward sachs wont explode okay but it burns pretty fucking well she leapt back through the door slammed it shut so much for her escape route backing toward the stairs choking now keeping low looking for any signs of carole and pammy could have changed the rules could he have given up on basements and put these vics in the church attic crack a fast look upward she saw a large oak beam rippling with flames start to fall with a scream sachs leapt aside but tripped and landed hard on her back staring at the huge falling bar of wood streaking directly at her face and chest instinctively she held her hands up a huge bang as the beam landed on a childs sundayschool chair it stopped inches from sachss head she crawled out from underneath and rolled to her feet looking around the room peering through the darkening smoke hell no she thought suddenly im not losing another one choking sachs turned back to the fire and staggered toward the one corner she hadnt checked as she jogged forward a leg shot out from behind a file cabinet and tripped her hands flying outward sachs landed face down inches from a pool of burning oil she rolled to her side drawing her weapon and swinging it into the panicked face of a blond woman struggling to sit up sachs pulled the gag off her mouth and the woman spit black mucus she gagged for a moment a deep dying sound carole ganz she nodded your daughter sachs cried not here my hands the cuffs no time come on sachs cut caroles ankles free with her switchblade it was then that she saw against the wall by the window a melting plastic bag the planted clues the ones that told where the little girl would be she stepped toward it but with a deafening bang the door to the boiler room cracked in half spewing a sixinch tidal wave of burning oil over the floor surrounding the bag which disintegrated instantly sachs stared for a moment and then heard the womans scream all the stairs were blazing now sachs knocked the fire extinguisher out from under the smoldering table the handle and nozzle had melted away and the metal canister was too hot to grasp with her knife she cut a patch off her uniform blouse and lifted the crackling extinguisher by its neck flung it to the top of the burning stairs it staggered for a moment like an uncertain bowling pin and then started down sachs drew her glock and when the red cylinder was halfway down fired one round the extinguisher erupted in a huge booming explosion pieces of red shrapnel from the casing hissed over their heads the mushroom cloud of carbon dioxide and powder settled over the stairs and momentarily dampened most of the flames now move sachs shouted together they took the steps two at a time sachs carrying her own weight and half the womans and pushed through the doorway into the inferno on the first floor they hugged the wall as they stumbled toward the exit while above them stainedglass windows burst and rained hot shards the colorful bodies of jesus and matthew and mary and god himself down upon the bent backs of the escaping women twentynine forty minutes later sachs had been salved and bandaged and stitched and had sucked so much pure oxygen she felt like she was tripping she sat beside carole ganz they stared at what was left of the church which was virtually nothing only two walls remained and curiously a portion of the third floor jutting into space above a lunar landscape of ash and debris piled in the basement pammy pammy carole moaned then retched and spit she took her own oxygen mask to her face leaned back weary and in pain sachs examined another alcoholsoaked rag with which she was wiping the blood from her face the rags had started out brown and were now merely pink the wounds werent serious a cut on her forehead swatches of seconddegree burns on her arm and hand her lips were no longer flawless however the lower one had been cut deeply in the crash the tear requiring three stitches carole was suffering from smoke inhalation and a broken wrist an impromptu cast covered her left wrist and she cradled it head down speaking through clenched teeth every breath was an alarming wheeze that son of a bitch coughing why pammy why on earth a threeyearold child she wiped angry tears with the back of her uninjured arm maybe he doesnt want to hurt her so he just brought you to the church no she spat out angrily he doesnt care about her hes sick i saw the way he looked at her im going to kill him im going to fucking kill him the harsh words dissolved into a harsher bout of coughing sachs winced in pain shed unconsciously dug a nail into a burned fingertip she pulled out her watchbook can you tell me what happened between bouts of sobbing and throaty coughs carole told her the story of the kidnapping you want me to call anybody sachs asked your husband carole didnt answer she drew her knees up to her chin hugged herself wheezing roughly with her scalded right hand sachs squeezed the womans biceps and repeated the question my husband she stared at sachs with an eerie look my husbands dead oh im sorry carole was getting groggy from the sedative and a woman medic helped her into the ambulance to rest sachs looked up and saw lon sellitto and jerry banks running toward her from the burnedout church jesus officer sellitto was surveying the carnage in the street what about the girl sachs nodded hes still got her banks said you okay nothing serious sachs glanced toward the ambulance the vic carole she doesnt have any money no place to stay shes in town to work for the un think you could make some calls detective see if they could set her up for a while sure sellitto said and the planted clues banks asked he winced as he touched a bandage over his right eyebrow gone sachs said i saw them in the basement couldnt get to them in time burned up and buried oh man banks muttered whats going to happen to the little girl what does he thinks going to happen to her she walked back toward the wreck of the ird wagon found the headset she pulled it on and was about to call in a patch request to rhyme but hesitated then lifted off the mike what could he tell her anyway she looked at the church how can you work a crime scene when there is no scene she was standing with her hands on her hips staring out onto the smoldering hulk of the building when she heard a sound she couldnt place a whining mechanical sound she paid no attention to it until she was aware of lon sellitto pausing as he dusted ash off his wrinkled shirt he said i dont believe it she turned toward the street a large black van was parked a block away a hydraulic ramp was protruding off the side and something sat on it she squinted one of those bomb squad robots it seemed the ramp lowered to the sidewalk and the robot rolled off then she laughed out loud the contraption turned toward them and started to move the wheelchair reminded her of a pontiac firebird candyapple red it was one of those electric models small rear wheels a large battery and motor mounted underneath thom walked along beside it but lincoln rhyme himself was driving in control she observed wryly via a straw that he held in his mouth his movements were oddly graceful rhyme pulled up to her and stopped all right i lied he said abruptly she exhaled a sigh about your back when you said you couldnt use a wheelchair im confessing i lied youre going to be mad amelia so be mad and get it over with you ever notice when youre in a good mood you call me sachs when youre in a bad mood you call me amelia im not in a bad mood he snapped he really isnt thom agreed he just hates to get caught at anything the aide nodded toward the impressive wheelchair she glanced at the side it was made by the action company a storm arrow model he had this in the closet downstairs all the while he spun his pathetic little tale of woe oh i let him have it for that no annotations thom thank you im apologizing all right i am sorry hes had it for years thom continued learned the sipnpuff cold thats the straw control hes really very good at it by the way he always calls me thom i never get preferential lastname treatment i got tired of being stared at rhyme said matteroffactly so i stopped going for joyrides then glanced at her torn lip hurt she touched her mouth which was bent into a grin stings like hell rhyme glanced sideways and what happened to you banks shaving your forehead now walked into a fire truck the young man grinned and touched the bandage again rhyme sachs began smiling no longer theres nothing here hes got the little girl and i couldnt get to the planted pe in time ah sachs theres always something have faith in the teachings of monsieur locard i saw them burn up the clues and if there was

fivefoothigh wall of brick all that remained of the north side of the church she peered down into the smoky pit at her feet a fire marshal called hey officer we havent secured the area yet its dangerous not as dangerous as the last time i was there she answered and holding the handle of the can in her teeth started down the wall lincoln rhyme watched her but he was really seeing himself three and a half years ago pull his suit jacket off and climb down into the construction site at the subway entrance near city hall sachs rhyme called she turned be careful i saw what was left of the rrv i dont want to lose you twice in one day she nodded and then disappeared over the edge of the wall after a few minutes rhyme barked to banks where is she i dont know what im saying is could you go check on her oh sure he walked to the wall looked over well rhyme asked its a mess of course its a mess do you see her no sachs rhyme shouted there was a long groan of wood then a crash dust rose sachs amelia no answer just as he was about to send esu in after her they heard her voice incoming jerry rhyme called ready the young detective called the can came flying up out of the basement banks caught it onehanded sachs climbed out of the basement wiping her hands on her slacks wincing okay she nodded now lets work the alley rhyme ordered theres traffic at all hours around here so hed want the car off the street while he got her inside thats where he parked used that door right there how do you know therere two ways to open locked doors without explosives that is locks and hinges this oned be deadbolted from the inside so he took the pins out of the hinges see he didnt bother to put them in very far again when he left they started at the door and worked their way to the back of the grim canyon the smoldering building on their right they moved a foot at a time sachs training the polilight on the cobblestones i want tire treads rhyme announced i want to know where his trunk was here she said examining the ground treads but i dont know whether thesere the front or the rear tires he mightve backed in are they clear or fuzzy the treadmarks a little fuzzy then thosere the front he laughed at her bewildered expression youre the automotive expert sachs next time you get in a car and start it see if you dont spin the wheel a little before you start moving to see if the tires are pointed straight the front treadsre always fuzzier than the rear now the stolen car was a ford taurus it measures stem to stern wheelbase approximately inches from the center of the rear tire to the trunk measure that and vacuum come on rhyme howd you know that looked it up this morning you do the vics clothing yep nails and hair too and rhyme get this the little girls name is pam but he called her maggie just like he did with the german girl he called her hanna remember you mean his other persona did rhyme said i wonder who the characters are in his little play im going to vacuum around the door too she announced rhyme watched her face cut and hair uneven singed short in spots she vacuumed the base of the door and just as he was about to remind her that crime scenes were threedimensional she ran the vacuum up and around the jamb he probably looked inside before he took her in she said and began vacuuming the windowsills too which would have been rhymes next order he listened to the whine of the dustbuster but second by second he was fading away into the past some hours before im sachs began shhh he said like the walks he now took like the concerts he now attended like so many of the conversations he had rhyme was slipping deeper and deeper into his consciousness and when he got to a particular place even he had no idea where he found he wasnt alone he was picturing a short man wearing gloves dark sports clothes a ski mask climbing out of the silver ford taurus sedan which smelled of cleanser and new car the woman carole ganz was in the trunk her child captive in an old building made of pink marble and expensive brick he saw the man dragging the woman from the car almost a memory it was that clear popping the hinges pulling open the door dragging her inside tying her up he started to leave but paused he walked to a place where he could look back and see carole clearly just like hed stared down at the man hed buried at the railroad tracks yesterday morning just like hed chained tammie jean colfax to the pipe in the center of the room so he could get a good look at her but why rhyme wondered why does he look to make sure the vics cant escape to make sure he hasnt left anything behind to his eyes sprang open the indistinct apparition of unsub vanished sachs remember the colfax scene when you found the glove print sure you said he was watching her thats the reason he chained her out in the open but you didnt know why well i figured it out he watches the vics because he has to because its his nature what do you mean come on rhyme sipped twice into the straw control which turned the arrow wheelchair around then puffed hard and he started forward he wheeled to the sidewalk sipped hard into the straw to stop he squinted as he looked all around him he wants to see his victims and im betting he wanted to see the parishioners too from someplace he thought was safe where he didnt bother to sweep up afterwards he was gazing across the street at the only secluded vantage point on the block the outdoor patio of a restaurant opposite the church there sweep it clean sachs she nodded slipped a new clip into her glock grabbed evidence bags a pair of pencils and the dustbuster he saw her run across the street and work her way up the steps carefully examining them he was here she shouted theres a glove print and the shoeprint its worn just like the other ones yes rhyme thought oh this felt good the warm sun the air the spectators and the excitement of the chase when you move they cant getcha well if we move faster maybe we can rhyme happened to glance at the crowd and saw that some people were staring at him but far more were watching amelia sachs for fifteen minutes she pored over the scene and when she returned she held up a small evidence bag what did you find sachs his drivers license his birth certificate gold she said smiling i found some gold thirty come on people rhyme called weve got to move on this one before he gets the girl to the next scene i mean move thom did a sitting transfer to get rhyme from the storm arrow back into bed perching him momentarily on a sliding board and then easing him back into the clinitron sachs glanced at the wheelchair elevator that had been built into one of the bedroom closets it was the one he hadnt wanted her to open when he was directing her to the stereo and cds rhyme lay still for a moment breathing deeply from the exertion the cluesre gone he reminded them theres no way we can figure out where the next scene is so were going for the big one his safe house you think you can find it sellitto asked do we have a choice rhyme thought and said nothing banks hurried up the stairs he hadnt even stepped into the bedroom before rhyme blurted what did they say tell me tell me rhyme knew that the tiny fleck of gold that sachs had found was beyond the capabilities of mel coopers impromptu lab hed asked the young detective to speed it down to the fbis regional pert office and have it analyzed theyll call us in the next half hour half hour rhyme muttered didnt they give it priority you bet they did dellray was there you shouldve seen him he ordered every other case put on hold and said if the metallurgy report wasnt in your hands asap thered be one mean mother you get the picture reaming their you get the rest of the picture rhyme sachs said theres something else the ganz woman said that might be important he told her hed let her go if she agreed to let him flail her foot flail cut the skin off it flay rhyme corrected oh anyway he didnt do anything she said it was in the end like he couldnt bring himself to cut her just like the first scene the man by the railroad tracks sellitto offered interesting rhyme reflected i thought hed cut the vics finger to discourage anybody from stealing the ring but maybe not look at his behavior cutting the finger off the cabbie and carrying it around cutting the german girls arm and leg stealing the bones and the snake skeleton listening while he broke everett s finger theres something about the way he sees his victims something anatomical exactly sachs except the ganz woman sellitto said my point rhyme said he couldve cut her and still kept her alive for us but something stopped him what sellitto said whats different about her cant be that shes a woman or shes from out of town so was the german girl maybe he didnt want to hurt her in front of her daughter banks said no rhyme said laughing grimly compassion isnt his thing sachs said suddenly but that is one thing different about her shes a mother rhyme considered this that could be it mother and daughter it didnt carry enough weight for him to let them go but it stopped him from torturing her thom jot that down with a question mark he then asked sachs did she say anything else about the way he looked sachs flipped through her notebook same as before she read ski mask slight build black gloves he black gloves rhyme looked at the chart on the wall not red she said black i asked her if she was sure and that other bit of leather was black too wasnt it mel maybe that was from the gloves so whats the red leather from cooper shrugged i dont know but we found a couple pieces of it so its something close to him rhyme looked over the evidence bags what else did we find the trace we vacuumed in the alley and by the doorway sachs tapped the filter over a sheet of newsprint and cooper went over it with a loupe plenty o nothin he announced mostly soil bits of minerals manhattan mica schist feldspar which was found throughout the city keep going decomposed leaves thats about it how about the ganz womans clothes cooper and sachs opened the newspaper and examined the trace mostly soil cooper said and a few bits of what look like stone where did he keep her at his safe house exactly on the floor in the basement she said it was a dirt floor excellent rhyme shouted to cooper burn it the soil cooper placed a sample in the gcms they waited impatiently for the results finally the computer screen blinked the grid resembled a lunar landscape all right lincoln interesting im reading offthecharts for tannin and sodium carbonate aint he amazin cooper laughed howd you know they were used in tanneries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the tannic acid cures the hide and the alkaline fixes it so his safe house is near the site of an old tannery he smiled couldnt help himself he thought you hear footsteps thats us behind you his eyes slipped to the randel survey map because of the smell no one wanted tanneries in their neighborhoods so the commissioners restricted them i know there were some on the lower east side and in west greenwich village when it literally was a village a suburb of the city and then on the far west side in the fifties near the stockyard tunnel where we found the german girl oh and in harlem in the early s rhyme glanced at the list of grocery stores the locations of the shoprites that sold veal shanks chelseas out no tanning there harlem too no shoprites there so its the west village lower east side or midtown west side hells kitchen again which he seems to like only about ten square miles rhyme estimated cynically hed figured out on his first day on the job that it was easier to hide in manhattan than in the north woods lets keep going what about the stone in caroles clothes cooper was bent over the microscope okay got it patch it in to me mel rhymes computer screen burst to life and he watched the flecks of stone and crystal like brilliant asteroids move it around rhyme instructed three substances were bonded together the one on the left is marble pinkish cooper said like what we found before and in between that gray stuff its mortar and the other is brownstone rhyme announced its from a federalstyle building like the city hall only the front facade was marble the rest was brownstone they did it to save money well they did it so the money appropriated for marble could find its way into various pockets now what else do we have the ash lets find the arson accelerant cooper ran the ash sample through the gcms he stared at the curve that appeared on the screen newly refined gasoline containing its manufacturers dyes and additives was unique and could be traced back to a single source as long as different batches of gas werent mixed together at the service station where the perp bought it cooper announced that the gasoline matched perfectly the brand sold by the gas exchange service stations banks grabbed the yellow pages and flipped them open weve got six stations in manhattan three downtown one at sixth avenue and houston one on delancey east and one at nineteenth and eighth nineteenths too far north rhyme said he stared at the profile chart east side or west which is it grocery stores gasoline a lanky figure suddenly filled the doorway i still invited to this here party frederick dellray asked depends rhyme countered

way lincoln analyze that bit of pe you found turns out its gold leaf probably sixty to eighty years old he found a few cellulose fibers attached so he thinks its from a book of course gold topstain from a page rhyme said now he also found some particles of ink on it he said im quotin the boy now its not inconsistent with the type of ink the new york public library uses to stamp the ends of their books dont he talk funny a library book rhyme mused amelia sachs said a redleatherbound library book rhyme stared at her right he shouted thats what the bits of red leatherre from not the glove its a book he carries around with him could be his bible bible dellray asked you thinkin hes some kinda religious nutzo not the bible fred call the library again banks maybe thats how he wore down his shoes in the reading room i know its a long shot but we dont have a lot of options here i want a list of all the antiquarian books stolen from manhattan locations in the past year will do the young man rubbed a shaving scar as he called the mayor at home and bluntly asked hizzoner to contact the director of the public library and tell them what they needed a half hour later the fax machine buzzed and spewed out two pages thom ripped the transmission out of the machine whoa readers sure have sticky fingers in this city he said as he brought it to rhyme eightyfour books fifty years old or older had disappeared from the public library branches in the past twelve months thirtyfive of them in manhattan rhyme scanned the list dickens austen hemingway dreiser books about music philosophy wine literary criticism fairy tales their value was surprisingly low twenty thirty dollars he supposed that none of them were first editions but perhaps the thieves hadnt known that he continued to scan the list nothing nothing maybe and then he saw it crime in old new york by richard wille stephans published by bountiful press in its value was listed at sixtyfive dollars and it had been stolen from the delancey street branch of the new york public library nine months earlier it was described as five by seven inches in size bound in red kidskin with marbleized endpapers gilded edges i want a copy of it i dont care how get somebody to the library of congress if you have to dellray said ill take care of that one grocery stores gasoline the library rhyme had to make a decision there were three hundred searchers available cops and state troopers and federal agents but theyd be spread microscopically thin if they had to search both the west and east sides of downtown new york gazing at the profile chart is your house in the west village rhyme silently asked did you buy the gas and steal the book on the east side to fox us or is that your real neighborhood how clever are you no no the questions not how clever you are but how clever you think you are how confident were you that wed never find those minuscule bits of yourself that m locard assures us youd leave behind finally rhyme

rosecolored marble front brownstone sides and back may have been a mansion or a public building at one time with a garage or carriage house attached a taurus sedan and a yellow cab coming and going for the past few weeks more often in the last few days rhyme glanced at sachs giving up the dead sellitto and dellray made their calls sachs said to rhyme im going too i hadnt expected anything else when the door had closed downstairs he whispered godspeed sachs godspeed thirtyone three squad cars cruised slowly through the streets of the lower east side two constables in each eyes searching and a moment later two black broughams appeared two sedans he meant unmarked but their telltale searchlights next to the left sideview mirrors left no doubt who they were hed known they were narrowing the search of course and that it was only a matter of time until they found his house but he was shocked that they were this close and he was particularly upset to see the cops get out and examine a silver taurus parked on canal street how the hell had they found out about his carriage hed known that stealing a car was a huge risk but he thought it would take hertz days to notice the missing vehicle and even if they did he was sure the constables would never connect him with the theft oh they were good one of the meaneyed cops happened to glance at his cab staring forward the bone collector turned slowly onto houston street lost himself in a crowd of other cabs a half hour later hed ditched the taxi and the hertz taurus and had returned on foot to the mansion young maggie looked up at him she was scared yes but shed stopped crying he wondered if he should just keep her take himself a daughter raise her the idea glowed within him for a moment or two then it faded no thered be too many questions also there was something eerie about the way the girl was looking at him she seemed older than her years shed always remember what hed done oh for a while she might think

down at her at her delicate skull at her twigs of arms she screamed like a siren he took off his glove his fingers hovered over her for a moment then he caressed the soft hair on her head fingerprints can be lifted from flesh if taken within minutes of contact see kromekote but no one has as yet successfully lifted and reconstructed frictionridge prints from human hair lincoln rhyme physical evidence th ed new york forensic press the bone collector slowly rose and walked upstairs into the large living room of the building past the paintings on the walls the workers the staring women and children he cocked his head at a faint noise outside then louder a clatter of metal he grabbed his weapon and hurried to the back of the building unbolting the door he pushed it open suddenly dropping into a twohanded shooting stance the pack of wild dogs glanced at him they returned quickly to the trash can theyd knocked over he slipped the gun into his pocket and returned to the living room he found himself next to the bottleglass window again looking out at the old graveyard oh yes there there was the man again wearing black standing in the cemetery in the distance the sky was spiked by the black masts of clipper ships and sloops docked in the east river along the out wards shore the bone collector felt an overwhelming sense of sorrow he wondered if some tragedy had just occurred maybe the great fire of had just destroyed most of the buildings along broadway or the yellow fever epidemic of had decimated the irish community or the general slocum excursionboat fire in had killed over a thousand women and children destroying the lower east sides german neighborhood or maybe he was sensing tragedies soon to occur after a few minutes maggies screams grew quiet replaced by the sounds of the old city the roar of steam engines the clang of bells the pops of blackpowder gunshots the clop of hooves on resonant cobblestones he continued to stare forgetting the constables who pursued him forgetting maggie just watching the ghostly form stroll down the street then and now his eyes remained focused out the window for a long moment lost in a different time and so he didnt notice the wild dogs whod pushed through the back door hed left ajar they looked at him through the doorway of the living room and paused only momentarily before turning around and loping quietly into the back of the building noses lifted at the smells ears pricked at the sounds of the strange place particularly the faint wailing that rose from somewhere beneath them it was a sign of their desperation that even the hardy boys split up bedding was working a halfdozen blocks around delancey saul was farther south sellitto and banks each had their search areas and the hundreds of other officers fbi agents and troopers made the doortodoor rounds asking about a slight man a young child crying a silver ford taurus a deserted federalstyle building fronted in rose marble the rest of it dark brownstone huh what the hell you mean federal seen a kid you asking if i ever seen a kid on the lower east yo jimmy you ever see any kids round here like not in the last what sixty seconds amelia sachs was flexing her muscle she insisted that she be on sellittos crew the one hitting the shoprite on east houston that had sold unsub the veal chop and the gas station that had sold him the gasoline the library from which hed stolen crime in old new york but theyd found no leads there and scattered like wolves smelling a dozen different scents each picked a chunk of neighborhood to call his or her own as sachs gunned the engine of the new rrv and tried another block she felt the same frustration shed known when working the crime scenes over the past several days too damn much evidence too much turf to cover the hopelessness of it here on the hot damp streets branching into a hundred other streets and alleys running past a thousand buildings all old finding the safe house seemed as impossible as finding that hair that rhyme had told her about pasted to the ceiling by the blowback from a revolver shed intended to hit every street but as time wore on and she thought of the child buried underground near death she began to search more quickly speeding down streets glancing right and left for the rosymarble building doubt stabbed her had she missed the building in her haste or should she drive like lightning and cover more streets on and on another block another and still nothing after the villains death his effects were secured and perused by detectives his diary showed that he had murdered eight good citizens of the city nor was he above grave robbery for it was ascertained from his pages if his claims be true that he had violated several holy resting places in cemeteries around the city none of his victims had accorded him the least affront nay most were upstanding citizens industrious and innocent and yet he felt not a modicum of guilt indeed he seems to have labored under the mad delusion that he was doing his victims a favor lincoln rhymes left ring finger twitched slightly and the frame turned the onionskin page of crime in old new york which

very bad etching in the book covered by tissue showed a demonic james schneider sitting in a basement examining a leg bone rhyme stared at the randel survey map of the city bones rhyme was recalling a crime scene hed run once hed been called to a construction site in lower manhattan where some excavators had discovered a skull a few feet below the surface of a vacant lot rhyme saw immediately that the skull was very old and brought a forensic anthropologist into the case they continued to dig and discovered a number of bones and skeletons a little research revealed that in thered been a slave rebellion in manhattan and a number of slaves and militant white abolitionists had been hanged on a small island in the collect the island became a popular site for hangings and several informal cemeteries and potters fields sprang up in the area where had the collect been rhyme tried to recall near where chinatown and the lower east side meet but it was hard to say for certain because the pond had been filled in so long ago it had been yes he thought his heart thudding the collect had been filled in because it had grown so polluted the city commissioners considered it a major health risk and among the main polluters were the tanneries on the eastern shore pretty good with the dialer now rhyme didnt flub a single number and got put through to the mayor on the first try hizzoner though the mans personal secretary said was at a brunch at the un but when rhyme identified himself the secretary said one minute sir and in much less time than that he found himself on the line with a man who said through a mouthful of food talk to me detective how the fuckre we doing fiveeighteightfive k amelia sachs said answering the radio rhyme heard the edginess in her voice sachs this isnt good she told him were not having any luck i think ive got him what the sixhundred block east van brevoort near chinatown howd you know the mayor put me in touch with the head of the historical society theres an archaeologic dig down there an old graveyard across the street from where a big tannery used to be and there were some big federal mansions in the area at one time i think hes nearby im rolling through the speakerphone he heard a squeal of tires then the siren cut in ive called lon and haumann he added theyre on their way over now rhyme her urgent voice crackled ill get her out ah youve got a cops good heart amelia a professional heart rhyme thought but youre still just a rookie sachs he said yes ive been reading this book eight twentythrees picked a bad one for this role model of his really bad she said nothing what im saying is he continued whether the girls there or not if you find him and he so much as flinches you nail him but we get him alive he can lead us to her we can no sachs listen to me you take him out any sign hes going for a weapon anything you take him out static clattered then he heard her steady voice im at van brevoort rhyme you were right looks like his place eighteen unmarkeds two esu vans and amelia sachss rrv were clustered near a short deserted street on the lower east side east van brevoort looked like it was in sarajevo the buildings were abandoned two of them burned to the ground on the east side of the street was a dilapidated hospital of some kind its roof caved in next to it was a large hole in the ground roped off with a no trespassing sign emblazoned with the county court seal the archaeologic dig rhyme had mentioned a scrawny dog had died and lay in the gutter its corpse picked over by rats in the middle of the other side of the street was a marblefronted townhouse faintly pink with an attached carriage house marginally nicer than the other decrepit tenements along van brevoort sellitto banks and haumann stood beside the esu van as a dozen officers suited up in kevlar and racked their ms sachs joined them and without asking tucked her hair under a helmet and started to vest up sellitto said sachs youre not tactical slapping the velcro strap down she stared at the detective eyebrow lifted high until he relented and said okay but youre rear guard thats an order haumann said youll be team two yessir i can live with that one esu cop offered her an mp machine gun she thought about nick their date on the range at rodmans neck theyd spent two hours practicing with automatic weapons firing zpatterns through doors flipreloading with taped banana clips and fieldstripping ms to clear the sand jams that plagued the colts nick loved the staccato clutter but sachs didnt much like the messy firepower of the big weapons shed suggested a match between them with glocks and had whupped him three straight at fifty feet he laughed and kissed her hard as the last of her empty casings spun ringing onto the firing range ill just use my sidearm she told the esu officer the hardy boys ran up crouching as if they were mindful of snipers heres what weve got theres nobody around block is completely empty the windows of his buildingre all barred a back entrance leading into the alley the doors open open haumann asked glancing at several of his officers saul confirmed not just unlocked but open booby traps not that we could see which isnt to say there arent any sellitto asked any vehicles in the alley nope two front entrances main front door which looks painted shut the seconds the carriagehouse doors double wide enough for two vehicles theres a padlock and chain but theyre lying on the ground haumann nodded so maybe hes inside maybe saul said then added and tell him what we think we heard very faint could have been crying could have been screaming sachs asked the little girl maybe but then it just stopped howd rhyme figure this place you tell me how his mind works sellitto said haumann called one of his commanders and issued a series of orders a moment later two esu vans pulled into the intersection and blocked the other end of the street team one front door blow it with cutting charges its wood and its old so keep the plastic down okay team two into the alley on my three you go got it neutralize but were assuming the girls in there so check your backdrops fore you squeeze officer sachs youre sure you want to do this a firm nod okay boys and girls go get him thirtytwo sachs and the five other officers of team two ran into the torrid alley which had been blocked off by esu trucks renegade weeds grew profusely through the cobblestones and cracked foundations and the desolation reminded sachs of the traintrack grave yesterday morning he hoped the victim was dead for his sake haumann had ordered troopers onto the roofs of the surrounding buildings and she saw the muzzles of their black colts bristling like antennae the team paused at the rear doorway her fellow cops glanced at sachs as she checked the rubber bands over her shoes heard one of them whisper to another something about superstition then she heard through her earphone team one leader at front door charge mounted and armed we are clear k roger team one leader team two team two in position k roger team two leader both teams dynamic entry on my three checked her weapon one last time one her tongue touched a dot of sweat hanging from the swollen wound on her lip two okay rhyme here we go three the explosion was very sedate a distant pop and then the teams were moving fast she sprinted along behind the esu troopers as they slipped inside and scattered their muzzlemounted flashlights crisscrossing the shafts of brilliant sunlight that streamed through the windows sachs found herself alone as the rest of the team dispersed checking out armoires and closets and the shadows behind the grotesque statues the place was filled with she turned the corner a pale face loomed a knife a thud in her heart combat stance gun up she laid five pounds of pressure on the slick trigger before she realized she was staring at a painting on the wall an eerie moonfaced butcher holding a knife in one hand a slab of meat in the other brother he picked a great place for home the esu troops clopped upstairs searching the first and second floors but sachs was looking for something else she found the door leading down to the basement partly open okay halogen off youve got to take a look first but she remembered what nick had said never look around corners at head or chest level thats where hes expecting you down on one knee a deep breath go nothing blackness back to cover listen at first she heard nothing then there was a definite scratching a clatter the sound of a fast breath or grunt hes there and hes digging his way out into her mike she said ive got activity in the basement backup roger but she couldnt wait she thought of the little girl down there with him and she started down the stairs paused and listened again then she realized she was standing with her body fully exposed from the waist down she practically leapt down to the floor dropped into a crouch in the darkness breathe deep now do it the halogen in her left hand stabbed a brilliant rod of light through the room the muzzle of her weapon targeted the center of the white disk as it swung left to right keep the beam down hed be at crotch level too remembering what nick had told her perps dont fly nothing no sign of him officer sachs an esu trooper was at the top of the stairs oh no she muttered as her beam fell on pammy ganz frozen in the corner of the basement dont move she called to the trooper inches away from the girl stood the pack of emaciated wild dogs sniffing at her face her fingers her legs the girls wide eyes darted from one animal to the other her tiny chest rose and fell and tears streamed down her face her mouth was open and the dot of her pink tongue seemed glued to the right arc of her lip stay up there she said to the esu trooper dont spook em sachs drew targets but didnt fire she could kill two or three but the others might panic and grab the girl one was big enough to snap her neck with a single flip of its scarred mangy head is he down there the esu cop asked dont know get a medic here to the top of the stairs nobody come down roger her weapon sights floating from one animal to another sachs slowly started forward one by one the dogs became aware of her and turned away from pammy the little girl was merely food sachs was a predator they growled and snarled front legs quivering as their hindquarters tensed ready to jump im ascared pammy said shrilly drawing their attention again shhhh honey sachs cooed dont say anything be quiet mommy i want my mommy her abrasive howl set the dogs off they danced in place and swung their battered noses from right to left growling easy easy sachs moved to the left the dogs were facing her now glancing from her eyes to her outstretched hand and the gun they separated into two packs one stayed close to pammy the other moved around sachs trying to flank her she eased between the little girl and the three dogs closest to her the glock swinging back and forth a pendulum their black eyes on the black gun one dog with a scabby yellow coat snarled and stepped forward on sachss right the little girl was whimpering mommy sachs moved slowly she leaned down clamped her hand on the childs sweatshirt and dragged pammy behind her the yellow dog moved closer shoo sachs said closer still go away the dogs behind the yellow one tensed as he bared cracked brown teeth get the fuck outa here sachs snarled and slammed the barrel of the glock onto his nose the dog blinked in dismay yelped skittered up the stairs pammy screamed sending the others into a frenzy they started fighting among themselves a whirlwind of snapping teeth and slaver a scarred rottweiler tossed a dustmop of a mutt to the floor in front of sachs she stamped her foot beside the scrawny brown thing and he skittered to his feet raced up the stairs the others chased him like greyhounds after a rabbit pammy began to sob sachs crouched beside her and swept the basement again with her light no sign of the unsub its okay honey well have you home soon youll be all right that man here you remember him she nodded did he leave i dont know i want my mommy she heard the other officers call in the first and second floors were secure the car and taxi sachs asked any sign a trooper transmitted theyre gone hes probably left hes not there amelia that would be illogical from the top of the stairs an officer called basement secure she said im going to check hold on were coming down negative on that she said weve got a pretty clean crime scene here and i want to keep it that way just get a medic down here to check out the little girl the young medic a sandyhaired man walked down the stairs and crouched beside pammy it was then that sachs saw the trail leading into the back of the basement to a low blackpainted metal door she walked to it avoiding the path itself to save the prints and crouched down the door was partly open and there seemed to be a tunnel on the other side dark but not completely black leading to another building an escape route the son of a bitch with the knuckles of her left hand she pushed the door open wider it didnt squeak she peered into the tunnel faint light twenty thirty feet away no moving shadows if sachs saw anything in the dimness it was tjs contorted body dangling from the black pipe monelle gergers round limp body as the black rat crawled toward her throat portable to cp sachs said into her mike go ahead k haumanns terse voice responded ive got a tunnel leading to the building south of the unsubs have somebody cover the doors and windows will do k im going in she told him the tunnel well get you some backup sachs negative i dont want the scene contaminated just have somebody keep an eye on the girl say again no no backup she clicked the light out and started crawling thered been no courses in tunnelrat work at the academy of course but the things nick had told her about securing a unfriendly scene came back to her weapon close to the body not extended too far where it could be knocked aside three steps well shuffles forward pause listen two more steps pause listen four steps next time dont do anything predictable hell its dark and whats that smell she shivered in disgust at the hot foul stink the claustrophobia wrapped around her like a cloud of oil smoke and she had to stop for a moment concentrating on anything but the closeness of the walls the panic slipped away but the smell was worse she gagged quiet girl quiet sachs controlled the reflex and kept going and whats that noise something electrical a buzzing rising and falling ten feet from the end of the tunnel through the doorway she could see a second large basement murky though not quite as dark as the one pammy had been in light leached in through a greasy window she saw motes of dust pedaling through the gloom no no girl the guns too far in front of you one kick and its gone close to your face keep your weight low and back use your arms to aim ass for support then she was at the doorway she gagged again tried to stifle the sound is he waiting for me or not head out a fast look youve got a helmet itll deflect anything but a fullmetal or teflon and remember hes shooting a a girl gun all right think look which way first the patrolmans guide wasnt any help and nick wasnt offering any advice at the moment flip a coin left she stuck her head out fast glancing to the left back into the tunnel shed seen nothing a blank wall shadows if hes the other way hes seen me ands got good target positioning okay fuck just go fast when you move sachs leapt they cant getcha she hit the ground hard rolling twisting around the figure was hidden in shadows against the wall to the right under the window drawing a target she started to fire then froze amelia sachs gasped oh my god her eyes were inexorably drawn to the womans body propped up against the wall from the waist up she was thin with darkbrown hair a gaunt face small breasts bony arms her skin was covered with swarms of flies the buzzing sachs had heard from the waist down she was nothing bloody hip bones femur the whip of her spine feet all the flesh had been dissolved in the repulsive bath she rested next to a horrible stew deep brown chunks of flesh floating in it lye or acid of some sort the fumes stung sachss eyes while horror and fury too boiled in her heart oh you poor thing sachs waved pointlessly at the flies that strafed the new intruder the womans hands were relaxed palms upward as if she were meditating eyes closed a purple jogging outfit lay by her side she wasnt the only victim another skeleton completely stripped lay beside a similar vat older empty of the terrible acid but coated with a dark sludge of blood and melted muscle its forearm and hand were missing and beyond that was another one this victim picked apart the bones carefully scrubbed of all the flesh cleaned resting carefully on the floor a stack of tripleought sandpaper rested beside the skull the elegant curve of the head shone like a trophy and then she heard it behind her a breath faint but unmistakable the snap of air deep in a throat she spun around furious at herself for her carelessness but the emptiness of the basement gaped back at her she swept the light over the floor which was stone and didnt show footprints as clearly as the dirt floor in s building next door another inhalation where was he where sachs crouched further sending the light sideways up and down nothing where the fuck is he another tunnel an exit to the street looking at the floor again she spotted what she thought was a faint trail leading into the shadows of the room she moved along beside it pause listen breathing yes no stupidly she spun around and looked at the dead woman once more come on eyes back again moving along the floor nothing how can i hear him and not see him the wall ahead of her was solid no doors or windows she backed up toward the skeletons from somewhere lincoln rhymes words came back crime scenesre threedimensional sachs looked up suddenly flashing the light in front of her the huge dobermans teeth shone back dangling bits of gray flesh two feet away on a high ledge he was waiting like a wildcat for her neither of them moved for a moment absolutely frozen then sachs instinctively dropped her head and before she could bring her weapon up he launched himself toward her face his teeth connected with the helmet gripping the strap in his mouth he shook furiously trying to break her neck as they fell backwards onto the edge of an acidfilled pit the pistol flew from her hand the dog kept his grip on her helmet while his hind legs galloped his claws digging into her vest and belly and thighs she hit him hard with her fists but it was like slugging wood he didnt feel the blows at all releasing the helmet he reared back then lunged for her face she flung her left arm over her eyes and as he grabbed her forearm and she felt his teeth clamp down on her skin she slipped the switchblade from her pocket and shoved the blade between his ribs there was a yelp a high sound and he rolled off her kept moving speeding straight for the doorway sachs snagged her pistol and was after him in an instant scrabbling through the tunnel she burst out to see the wounded animal sprinting straight toward pammy and the medic who stood frozen as the doberman leapt into the air sachs dropped into a crouch and squeezed off two rounds one hit the back of the animals head and the other streaked into the brick wall the dog collapsed in a quivering pile at the medics feet shots fired she heard in her radio and a halfdozen troopers rushed down the stairs pulled the dog away and deployed around the girl its all right sachs shouted it was me the team rose from their defensive positions pammy was screaming doggie dead she made the doggie dead sachs holstered her weapon and hefted the girl onto her hip mommy youll see your mommy soon sachs said were going to call her right now upstairs she set pammy on the floor and turned to a young esu officer standing nearby i lost my cuff key could you take those off her please open them over a piece of clean newspaper wrap em up in the paper and put the whole thing in a plastic bag the officer rolled his eyes listen beautiful go find yourself a rookie to order around he started to walk away trooper bo haumann barked youll do what she says sir he protested im esu got news sachs muttered youre crime scene now carole ganz was lying on her back in a very beige bedroom staring at the ceiling thinking about the time a few weeks ago when she and pammy and a bunch of friends were sitting around a campfire in wisconsin at kate and eddies place talking telling stories singing songs kates voice wasnt so hot but eddie couldve been a pro he could even play barre chords he sang carole kings tapestry just for her and carole sang along softly through her tears thinking that maybe just maybe she really was putting rons death behind her and getting on with her life she remembered kates voice from that night when youre angry the only way to deal with it is to wrap up that anger and give it away give it to somebody else do you hear me dont keep it inside you give it away well she was angry now furious some young kid a mindless little shit had taken her husband away shot him in the back and now some crazy man had taken her daughter she wanted to explode and it took all her willpower not to start flinging things against the wall and howling like a coyote she lay back on the bed and gingerly placed her shattered wrist on her belly shed taken a demerol which had eased the pain but she hadnt been able to sleep shed done nothing but stay inside all day long trying to get in touch with kate and eddie and waiting for news about pammy she kept picturing ron kept picturing her anger actually imagining herself packing it up in a box wrapping it carefully sealing it up and then the phone rang she stared for a moment then yanked it off the cradle hello carole listened to the policewoman tell her that theyd found pammy that she was in the hospital but that she was okay a moment later pammy herself came on the phone and they were both crying and laughing at the same time ten minutes later she was on her way to manhattan hospital in the back seat of a black police sedan carole practically sprinted down the corridor to pammys room and was surprised to be stopped by the police guard so they hadnt caught the fucker yet but as soon as she saw her daughter she forgot about him forgot the terror in the taxi and the fiery basement she threw her arms around her little girl oh honey i missed you are you okay really okay that lady she killed a doggie carole turned and saw the tall redhaired policewoman standing nearby the one whod saved her from the church basement but it was all right because he was going to eat me carole hugged sachs i dont know what to say i just thank you thank you pammys fine sachs assured her some scratches nothing serious and shes got a little cough mrs ganz a young man walked into the room carrying her suitcase and yellow knapsack im detective banks weve got your things here oh thank god is anything missing he asked her she looked through the knapsack carefully it was all there the money pammys doll the package of clay the mr potato head the cds the clock radio he hadnt taken anything waityou know i think theres a picture missing im not sure i thought i had more than these but everything importants here the detective gave her a receipt to sign a young resident stepped into the room he joked with pammy about her pooh bear as he took her blood pressure carole asked him when can she leave well wed like to keep her in for a few days just to make sure a few days but shes fine shes got a bit of bronchitis i want to keep an eye on and he lowered his voice were also going to bring in an abuse specialist just to make sure but she was going to go with me tomorrow to the un ceremonies i promised her the policewoman added its easier to keep her guarded here we dont know where the unsub the kidnapper is well have an officer babysitting you too well i guess can i stay with her for a while you bet the resident said you can stay the night well have a cot brought in then carole was alone with her daughter once more she sat down on the bed and put her arm around the childs narrow shoulders she had a bad moment remembering how he that crazy man had touched pammy how his eyes had looked when hed asked if he could cut her own skin off carole shivered and began to cry it was pammy who brought her back mommy tell me a story no no sing me something sing me the friend song pleeeeease calming down carole asked you want to hear that one hm yes carole hoisted the girl onto her lap and in a reedy voice started to sing youve got a friend pammy sang snatches of it along with her it had been one of rons favorites and in the past couple years after he was gone she hadnt been able to listen to more than a few bars without breaking into tears today she and pammy finished it together pretty much on key dryeyed and laughing thirtythree amelia sachs finally went home to her apartment in carroll gardens brooklyn exactly six blocks from her parents house where her mother still lived as soon as she walked in she hit the first speeddial button on the kitchen phone mom me im taking you to brunch at the plaza wednesday thats my day off what for to celebrate your new assignment how is public affairs you didnt call a fast laugh sachs realized her mother had no idea what shed been doing for the past day and a half you been following the news mom me im brokaws secret admirer you know that you hear about this kidnapper the last few days who hasnt whatre you telling me honey ive got the inside scoop and she told her astonished mother the story about saving the vics and about lincoln rhyme and with some editing about the crime scenes amie your fatherd be so proud so call in sick on wednesday the plaza ok forget it sweetheart save your money ive got waffles and bob evans in the freezer you can come here its not that expensive mom not that much its a fortune well hey sachs said trying to sound spontaneous you like the pink teacup dont you a little place in the west village that served up platters of the best pancakes and eggs on the east coast for next to nothing a pause that might be nice this was a strategy sachs had used successfully over the years ive gotta get some rest mom ill call tomorrow you work too hard amie this case of yours it wasnt dangerous was it i was just doing the technical stuff mom crime scene it doesnt get any safer than that and they asked for you especially the woman said then repeated your fatherd be so proud they hung up and sachs wandered into the bedroom flopped down on the bed after shed left pammys room sachs had paid visits to the other two surviving victims of unsub monelle gerger dotted with bandages and pumped full of antirabies serum had been released and was returning to her family in frankfurt but just for rest of summer she explained adamantly not you know for good and shed pointed to her stereo and cd collection in the decrepit apartment in the deutsche haus by way of proving that no new world psycho was driving her permanently out of town william everett was still in the hospital the shattered finger was not a serious problem of course but his heart had been acting up again sachs was astonished to find that hed owned a shop in hells kitchen years ago and thought he might have known her father i knew all the beat cops he said she showed him her wallet picture of the man in his dress uniform i think so not sure but i think so the calls had been social but sachs had gone armed with her watchbook neither of the vics though had been able to tell her anything more about unsub in her apartment now sachs glanced out her window she saw the ginkgoes and maples shiver in the sharp wind she stripped off her uniform scratched under her boobs where it always itched like mad from being squooshed under the body armor she pulled on a bathrobe unsub hadnt had much warning but it had been enough the safe house on van brevoort had been hosed completely even though the landlord said hed moved in a long time ago last january with a phony id no one was very surprised to learn had left with everything hed brought trash included after sachs had worked the scene nypd latents had descended and was dusting every surface in the place so far the preliminary reports werent encouraging looks like he even wore gloves when he crapped young banks had reported to her a mobile unit had found the taxi and the sedan unsub d cleverly parked them near avenue d and ninth street sellitto guessed it probably took a local gang seven or eight minutes to strip them down to their chassis any physical evidence the vehicles mightve yielded was now in a dozen chop shops around the city sachs turned on the tube and found the news nothing about the kidnappings all the stories were about the opening ceremonies of the un peace conference she stared at bryant gumbel stared at the un secretarygeneral stared at some ambassador from the middle east stared far more intently than her interest warranted she even studied the ads as if she were memorizing them because there was something she definitely didnt want to think about her bargain with lincoln rhyme the deal was clear now that carole and pammy were safe it was her turn to come through to let him have his hour alone with dr berger now him berger she hadnt liked the look of the doctor at all you could see one big fucking ego in his compact athletic frame his evasive eyes his black hair perfectly combed expensive clothes why couldnt rhyme have found someone like kevorkian he may have been quirky but at least seemed like a wise old grandfather her lids closed giving up the dead a bargain was a bargain but goddammit rhyme well she couldnt let him go without one last try hed caught her off guard in his bedroom she was flustered hadnt thought of any really good arguments monday she had until tomorrow to try to convince him not to do it or at least to wait awhile a month hell a day what could she say to him shed jot down her arguments write a little speech opening her eyes she climbed out of bed to find a pen and some paper i could sachs froze her breath whistling into her lungs like the wind outside he wore dark clothes the ski mask and gloves black as oil unsub stood in the middle of her bedroom her hand instinctively went toward the bedside table her glock and knife but he was ready the shovel swung fast and caught her on the side of her head a yellow light exploded in her eyes she was on her hands and knees when the foot slammed into her rib cage and she collapsed to her stomach struggling for breath she felt her hands being cuffed behind her a strip of duct tape slapped onto her mouth moving fast efficiently he rolled her onto her back her robe fell open kicking furiously struggling madly to pull the cuffs apart another blow to her stomach she gagged and fell still as he reached for her gripped her at the armpits dragged her out the back door and into the large private garden behind the apartment his eyes remained on her face not even looking at her tits her flat belly her mound with its few red curls she could easily have given that up to him if it would have saved her life but no rhymes diagnosis was right it wasnt lust that drove he had something else in mind he dropped her willowy figure face up into a patch of blackeyed susans and pachysandra out of sight of the neighbors he looked around catching his breath he picked up the shovel and plunged the blade into the dirt amelia sachs began to cry rubbing the back of his head into the pillow compulsive a doctor had once told him after observing this behavior an opinion rhyme hadnt asked for or wanted his nestling rhyme reflected was just a variation on amelia sachss tearing her flesh with her own nails he stretched his neck muscles rolling his head around as he stared at the profile chart on the wall rhyme believed that the full story of the mans madness was here in front of him in the black swoopy handwriting and the gaps between the words but he couldnt see the storys ending not yet he looked over the clues again there were only a few left unexplained the scar on the finger the knot the aftershave the scar was useless to them unless they had a suspect whose fingers they could examine and thered been no luck in identifying the knot only preppy bankss opinion that it wasnt nautical what about the cheap aftershave assuming that most unsubs wouldnt spritz themselves to go on a kidnapping spree why had he worn it rhyme could only conclude again that he was trying to obscure another a telltale scent he ran through the possibilities food liquor chemicals tobacco he felt eyes on him and looked to his right the black dots of the bony rattlesnakes eye sockets gazed toward the clinitron this was the one clue that was out of place it had no purpose except to taunt them something occurred to him using the painstaking turning frame rhyme slowly flipped back through crime in old new york to the chapter on james schneider he found the paragraphs hed remembered it has been suggested by a wellknown physician of the mind a practitioner of the discipline of psychelogy which has been much in the news of late that james schneiders ultimate intent had little to do with harming his victims rather this learned doctor has suggested the villain was seeking revenge against those that did him what he perceived to be harm the citys constabulary if not society as a whole who can say where the source of this hate lay perhaps like the nile of old its wellsprings were hidden to the world and possibly even to the villain himself yet one reason may be found in a littleknown fact young james schneider at the tender age of ten saw his father dragged away by constables only to die in prison for a robbery which it was later ascertained he did not commit following this unfortunate arrest the boys mother fell into life on the street and abandoned her son who grew up a ward of the state did the madman perchance commit these crimes to fling derision into the face of the very constabulary which had inadvertently destroyed his family we will undoubtedly never know yet what does seem clear is that by mocking the ineffectualness of the protectors of its citizenry james schneider the bone collector was wreaking his vengeance upon the city itself as much as upon his innocent victims lincoln rhyme lay back in his pillow and looked at the profile chart again dirt is heavier than anything its the earth itself the dust of an iron core and it doesnt kill by strangling the air from the lungs but by compressing the cells until they die from the panic of immobility sachs wished that she had died she prayed that she would fast from fear or a heart attack before the first shovelful hit her face she prayed for this harder than lincoln rhyme had prayed for his pills and liquor lying in the grave the unsub had dug in her own backyard sachs felt the progress of the rich earth dense and wormy moving along her body sadistically he was burying her slowly casting only a shallow scoop at a time scattering it carefully around her hed started with her feet he was now up to her chest the dirt slipping into her robe and around her breasts like a lovers fingers heavier and heavier compressing binding her lungs she could suck only an ounce or two of air at a time he paused once or twice to look at her then continued he likes to watch hands beneath her neck straining to keep her head above the tide then her chest was buried completely her shoulders her throat the cold earth rose to the hot skin of her face packing around her head so she couldnt move finally he bent down and ripped the tape off her mouth as sachs tried to scream he spilled a handful of dirt into her face she shivered choked on the black earth ears ringing hearing for some reason an old song from her infancy the green leaves of summer a song her father played over and over again on the hifi sorrowful haunting she closed her eyes everything was going black opened her mouth once and got another cups worth of soil giving up the dead and then she was under completely quiet not choking or gasping the earth was a perfect seal she had no air in her lungs couldnt make any sounds silence except for the haunting melody and the growing roar in her ears then the pressure on her face ceased as her body went numb as numb as lincoln rhymes her mind began to shut down blackness blackness no words from her father nothing from nick no dreams of downshifting from five to four to goose the speedometer into three digits blackness giving up the the mass sinking down onto her pushing pushing seeing only one image the hand rising out of the grave yesterday morning waving for mercy when no mercy would be given waving for her to follow rhyme ill miss you giving up thirtyfour something struck her forehead hard she felt the thump but no pain what what his shovel a brick maybe in an instant of compassion d decided that this slow death was more than anyone could bear and was striking for her throat to sever her veins another blow and another she couldnt open her eyes but she was aware of light growing around her colors and air she forced the mass of dirt from her mouth and sucked in tiny breaths all she could manage began coughing in a loud bray retching spitting her lids sprang open and through tearing eyes she found herself looking up at the muddy vision of lon sellitto kneeling over her beside two ems medics one of whom dug into her mouth with latexclad fingers and pulled out more gunk while the other readied an oxygen mask and green tank sellitto and banks continued to uncover her body shoving the dirt away with their muscular hands they pulled her up leaving the robe behind like a shed skin sellitto old divorcé that he was looked chastely away from her body as he put his jacket around her shoulders young jerry banks did look of course but she loved him anyway did you she wheezed then surrendered to a racking cough sellitto glanced expectantly at banks who was the more breathless of the two he mustve done the most running after the unsub the young detective shook his head got away sitting up she inhaled oxygen for a moment how she wheezed howd you know rhyme he answered dont ask me how he called in s for everybody on the team when he heard we were okay he sent us over here asap then the numbness left snap in a flash and for the first time she realized what had nearly happened she dropped the oxygen mask backed away in panic tears streaming her panicky keening growing louder and louder no no no slapping her arms and thighs frantic trying to shake off the horror clinging to her like a teeming swarm of bees oh god oh god no sachs banks asked alarmed hey sachs the older detective waved his partner away its okay he kept his arm around her shoulders as she dropped to all fours and vomited violently sobbing sobbing gripping the dirt desperately between her fingers as if she wanted to strangle it finally sachs calmed and sat back on her naked haunches she began laughing softly at first then louder and louder hysterical astonished to find that the skies had opened and it had been raining huge hot summer drops and she hadnt even realized it arm around his shoulders face pressed against his they stayed that way for a long moment sachs oh sachs she stepped away from the clinitron and scooted an old armchair from the corner of the room sachs wearing navy sweatpants and a hunter college tshirt flopped down into the chair and dangled her exquisite legs over the arm like a schoolgirl why us rhyme whyd he come after us her voice was a raspy whisper from the dirt shed swallowed because the people he kidnapped arent the real victims we are whos we she asked im not sure society maybe or the city or the un cops i went back and reread his bible the chapter on james schneider remember terrys theory about why the unsubd been leaving the clues sellitto said sort of making us accessories to share the guilt make it easier for him to kill rhyme nodded but said i dont think thats the reason though i think the clues were a way to attack us every dead vic was a loss for us in her old clothes hair pulled back in a ponytail sachs looked more beautiful than any time in the past two days but her eyes were tin shed be reliving every shovelful of dirt he supposed and rhyme found the thought of her living burial so disturbing he had to look away whats he got against us she asked i dont know schneiders father was arrested by mistake and died in prison our unsub who knows why i only care about evidence not motives amelia sachs finished the sentence whyd he start going after us directly banks asked nodding at sachs we found his hideyhole and saved the little girl i dont think he expected us so soon maybe he just got pissed lon we need twentyfourhour babysitters for all of us he couldve just taken off after we saved the kid but he stuck around to do some damage you and jerry me cooper haumann polling were all on his list betcha meanwhile get perettis boys over to sachss im sure he kept it clean but there might be something there he left a lot faster than hed planned to i better get over there sachs said no rhyme said i have to work the scene you have to get some rest he ordered thats what you have to do sachs you dont mind my saying you look lousy yeah officer sellitto said san order i told you to stand down for the rest of the day weve got two hundred searchers looking for him and fred dellrays got another hundred and twenty feebies i got a crime scene in my own backyard and youre not gonna let me walk the grid thats it rhyme said in a nutshell sellitto walked to the doorway any problems with that officer nosir come on banks we got work to do you need a lift sachs orre they still trusting you with vehicles no thanks got wheels downstairs she said the two detectives left rhyme heard their voices echoing through the empty hall then the door closed and they were gone rhyme realized the glaring overhead lights were on he clicked through several commands and dimmed them sachs stretched well she said just as rhyme said so she glanced at the clock its late sure is rising she walked to the table where her purse rested she picked it up clicked it open found her compact and examined her cut lip in the mirror it doesnt look too bad rhyme said frankenstein she said prodding why dont they use fleshcolored stitches she put the mirror away slung the purse over her shoulder you moved the bed she noticed it was closer to the window thom did i can look at the park if i want to well thats good she walked to the window looked down oh for christs sake rhyme thought to himself do it what can happen he blurted quickly you want to stay here i mean its getting late and latentsll be dusting your place for hours he felt a mad bolt of anticipation deep within him well kill that he thought furious with himself until her face blossomed into a smile id like that good his jaw shivered from the adrenaline wonderful thom listening to music drinking some scotch maybe hed tell her more about famous crime scenes the historian in him was also curious about her father about police work in the s and s about the infamous midtown south precinct in the old days rhyme shouted thom get some sheets and a blanket thom i dont know what the hell hes doing thom sachs started to say something but the aide appeared in the doorway and said testily one rude shout wouldve been enough you know lincoln amelias staying over again could you get some blankets and pillows for the couch no not the couch again she said its like sleeping on rocks rhyme was stabbed with a splinter of rejection thinking ruefully to himself been a few years since hed felt that emotion resigned he nonetheless smiled and said theres a bedroom downstairs thom can make it up for you but sachs set down her purse thats okay thom you dont have to its no bother its all right good night thom she walked to the door well i she smiled but he began looking from her to rhyme who frowned shook his head good night thom she said firmly watch your feet and closed the door slowly as he stepped back out of the way into the hall it closed with a loud click sachs kicked off her shoes pulled off the sweats and tshirt she wore a lace bra and baggy cotton panties she climbed into the clinitron beside rhyme showing every bit of the authority beautiful women wield when it comes to climbing into bed with a man she wriggled down into the pellets and laughed this is one hell of a bed she said stretching like a cat eyes closed sachs asked you dont mind do you i dont mind at all rhyme what tell me more about your book okay some more crime scenes he started to describe a clever serial killer in queens but in less than one minute she was asleep rhyme glanced down and noted her breast against his chest her knee resting on his thigh a womans hair was banked against his face for the first time in years it tickled hed forgotten that this happened for someone who lived so in the past with such a good memory he was surprised to find he couldnt exactly remember when hed experienced this sensation last what he could recall was an amalgam of evenings with elaine he supposed before the accident he did remember that hed decided to endure the tickle not push the strands away so he wouldnt disturb his wife now of course he couldnt brush away sachss hair if god himself had asked but he wouldnt think of moving it aside just the opposite he wanted to prolong the sensation until the end of the universe thirtyfive the next morning lincoln rhyme was alone again thom had gone shopping and mel cooper was at the ird lab downtown vince peretti had completed the cs work at the mansion on east van brevoort and at sachss theyd found woefully few clues though rhyme put the lack of pe down to the unsubs ingenuity not perettis derivative talents rhyme was awaiting the crime scene report but both dobyns and sellitto believed that had gone to ground temporarily at least thered been no more attacks on the police and no other victims had been kidnapped in the past twelve hours sachss minder a large patrol officer from mts had accompanied her to an appointment with an ear nose and throat man at a hospital in brooklyn the dirt had done quite a number on her throat rhyme himself had a bodyguard too a uniform from the twentieth precinct stationed in front of his townhouse a friendly cop hed known for years and with whom rhyme enjoyed a running argument on the merits of irish peat versus scottish in the production of whisky rhyme was in a great mood he called downstairs on the intercom im expecting a doctor in a couple of hours you can let him up the cop said he would dr william berger had assured rhyme that today hed be on time rhyme leaned back in the pillow and realized he wasnt completely alone on the windowsill the falcons paced rarely skittish they seemed uneasy another low front was approaching rhymes window revealed a calm sky but he trusted the birds they were infallible barometers unsub page

am here he was just like two days ago awaiting bergers arrival thats life he thought postponement upon postponement but ultimately with some luck we get to where were meant to be he watched television for twenty minutes trolling for stories about the kidnappings but all the stations were doing specials on the opening day of the un conference rhyme found it boring and turned to a rerun of matlock flipped back to a gorgeous cnn reporter standing outside un headquarters and then shut the damn set off the telephone rang and he went through the complicated gestures of answering it hello there was a pause before a mans voice said lincoln yes jim polling how you doin rhyme realized that he hadnt seen much of the captain since early yesterday except for the news conference last night where hed whispered prompts to the mayor and chief wilson okay any word on our unsub rhyme asked nothing yet but well get him another pause hey you alone yep a longer pause okay if i stop by sure a half hour ill be here rhyme said jovially he rested his head in the thick pillow and his eyes slipped to the knotted clothesline hanging beside the profile poster still no answer about the knot it was he laughed aloud at the joke a loose end he hated the idea of leaving the case without finding out what kind of knot it was then he remembered that polling was a fisherman maybe hed recognize polling rhyme reflected james polling funny how the captain had insisted rhyme handle the case how hed fought to keep him on it rather than peretti who was the better choice politically for polling remembering too how hed lost his temper at dellray when the feebie tried to strongarm the investigation away from the nypd now that he thought about it pollings whole involvement in the case was a mystery eight twentythree wasnt the kind of perp you took on voluntarily even if you were looking for juicy cases to hang on your collar record too many chances to lose vics too many opportunities for the press and the brass to snipe at you for fucking up polling recalling how hed breeze into rhymes bedroom check out their progress and leave sure he was reporting to the mayor and the chief but the thought slipped unexpectedly into rhymes mind was there someone else polling was reporting back to someone who wanted to keep tabs on the investigation the unsub himself but how on earth could polling have any connection with it seemed and then it struck him could polling be the unsub of course not it was ridiculous laughable even apart from motive and means there was the question of opportunity the captain had been here in rhymes room when some of the kidnappings had occurred or had he rhyme looked up at the profile chart dark clothing and wrinkled cotton slacks pollingd been wearing dark sports clothes over the past several days but so what so did a lot of downstairs a door opened and closed thom no answer the aide wasnt due back for hours lincoln oh no hell he started to dial on the ecu with his chin he bumped the cursor to footsteps on the stairs he tried to redial but he knocked the joystick out of reach in his desperation and jim polling walked into the room rhyme had counted on the babysitters calling upstairs first but of course a beat cop would let a police captain inside without thinking twice pollings dark jacket was unbuttoned and rhyme got a look at the automatic on his hip he couldnt see if it was his issue weapon but he knew that colts were on the nypd list of approved personal weapons lincoln polling said he was clearly uneasy cautious his eyes fell to the bleached bit of spinal cord how you doing jim not bad polling the outdoorsman had the scar on the fingerprint been left by years of casting a fishing line or an accident with a hunting knife rhyme tried to look but polling kept his hands jammed into his pockets was he holding something in there a knife polling certainly knew forensics and crime scenes he knew how not to leave evidence the ski mask if polling was the unsub hed have to wear the mask of course because one of the vics might see him later and the aftershave what if the unsub hadnt worn the scent at all but had just carried a bottle with him and sprayed some at the scenes to make them believe he wore brut so when polling showed up here not wearing any no one would suspect him youre alone polling asked my assistant the cop downstairs said he wouldnt be back for a while rhyme hesitated thats right polling was slight but strong sandyhaired terry dobynss words came back someone helpful upstanding a social worker counselor politician somebody helping other people like a cop rhyme wondered now if he was about to die and to his shock he realized that he didnt want to not this way not on somebody elses terms polling walked to the bed yet there was nothing he could do he was at this mans complete mercy lincoln polling repeated gravely their eyes met and the feeling of electrical connection went through them dry sparks the captain looked quickly out the window youve been wondering havent you wondering why i wanted you on the case i figured it was my personality this drew no smile from the captain why did you want me jim the captains fingers knitted together thin but strong the hands of a fisherman a sport that yes may be genteel but whose purpose is nonetheless to wrench a poor beast from his home and slice through its smooth belly with a thin knife four years ago the shepherd case we were on it together rhyme nodded the workers found the body of that cop in the subway stop a groan rhyme recalled like the sound of the titanic sinking in a night to remember then an explosion loud as a gunshot as the beam came down on his hapless neck and dirt packed around his body and you ran the scene you yourself like you always did i did yes did you know how we convicted shepherd we had a wit a witness rhyme hadnt heard that after the accident hed lost all track of the case except for learning that shepherd had been convicted and three months later stabbed to death on rikers island by an assailant who was never captured an eyewitness polling continued he could place shepherd at one of the victims homes with the murder weapon the captain stepped closer to the bed crossed his arms we had the wit a day before we found the last body the one in the subway before i put in the request that you run the scene whatre you saying jim the captains eyes rooted themselves to the floor we didnt need you we didnt need your report rhyme said nothing polling nodded you understand what im saying i wanted to nail that fuck shepherd so bad i wanted an airtight case and you know what a lincoln rhyme crime scene report does to defense lawyers it scares the everlovin shit out of them but shepherd wouldve been convicted even without my report from the subway scene thats right lincoln but its worse than that see i got word from mta engineering that the site wasnt safe the subway site and you had me work the scene before they shored it up shepherd was a copkiller pollings face twisted up in disgust i wanted him so bad i woulda done anything to nail him but he lowered his head to his hands rhyme said nothing he heard the groan of the beam the explosion of the breaking wood then the rustle of the dirt nestling around him a curious warm peace in his body while his heart stuttered with terror jim thats why i wanted you on this case lincoln you see a miserable look crossed the captains tough face he stared at the disk of spinal column on the table i kept hearing these stories that your life was crap you were wasting away here talking about killing yourself i felt so fucking guilty i wanted to try to give you some of your life back rhyme said and youve been living with this for the last three and a half years you know about me lincoln everybody knows about me i collar somebody he gives me any shit he goes down i get a hardon for some perp i dont stop till the pricks bagged and tagged i cant control it i know ive fucked over people sometimes but they were perps or suspects at least they werent my own they werent cops what happened to you that was a sin it was just fucking wrong i wasnt a rookie rhyme said i didnt have to work a scene i thought wasnt safe but bad time another voice said from the doorway rhyme glanced up expecting to see berger but it was peter taylor whod come up the stairs rhyme recalled that he was coming by today to check on his patient after the dysreflexia attack he supposed too that the doctor was planning to give him hell about berger and the lethe society he wasnt in the mood for that he wanted time alone to digest pollings confession at the moment it just sat there numb as rhymes thigh but he said come on in peter youve got a very funny security system lincoln the guard asked if i was a doctor and he let me up what do lawyers and accountants get booted rhyme laughed ill only be a second rhyme turned back to polling fate jim thats what happened to me i was in the wrong place at the wrong time it happens thanks lincoln polling put his hand on rhymes right shoulder and squeezed it gently rhyme nodded and to deflect the uneasy gratitude introduced the men jim this is pete taylor one of my doctors and this is jim polling we used to work together nice to meet you taylor said sticking out his right hand it was a broad gesture and rhymes eyes followed it noticing for some reason the deep crescent scar on taylors right index finger no rhyme shouted so youre a cop too taylor gripped pollings hand tightly as he slid the knife held firmly in his left hand in and out of the captains chest three times navigating around the ribs with the delicacy of a surgeon undoubtedly so he wouldnt nick the precious bone thirtysix in two long steps taylor was beside the bed he grabbed the ecu controller from beneath rhymes finger flung it across the room rhyme took a breath to shout but the doctor said hes dead too the constable nodding toward the door meaning the bodyguard downstairs taylor stared with fascination as polling thrashed like a spinecracked animal spraying his blood on the floor and walls jim rhyme cried no oh no the captains hands curled over his ruined chest a repugnant gurgling from his throat filled the room accompanied by the mad thudding of his shoes on the floor as he died finally he quivered once violently and lay still his glazed eyes dotted with blood stared at the ceiling turning to the bed he kept his eyes on lincoln rhyme as he walked around it slowly circling the knife in his hand his breathing was hard who are you rhyme gasped silently taylor stepped forward put his fingers around rhymes arm squeezed the bone several times perhaps hard perhaps not his hand strayed to rhymes left ring finger he lifted it off the ecu and caressed it with the dripping blade of the knife slipped the sharp point up under the nail rhyme felt faint pain a queasy sensation then harder he gasped then taylor noticed something and froze he gasped leaned forward staring at the copy of crime in old new york on the turning frame thats how you actually found it oh the constables should be proud to have you in their ranks lincoln rhyme i thought itd be days before you got to the house i thought maggied be stripped down by the dogs by then whyre you doing this rhyme asked but taylor didnt answer he was examining rhyme carefully muttering half to himself you didnt used to be this good you know in the old days you missed a lot back then didnt you in the old days the old days what did he mean he shook his balding head gray hair not brown and glanced at a copy of rhymes forensic textbook there was recognition in his eyes and slowly rhyme began to understand you read my book the criminalist said you studied it at the library right the public library branch near you eight twentythree was after all a reader so he knew rhymes cs procedures thats why hed swept up so carefully why hed worn gloves touching even surfaces most criminals wouldntve thought would retain prints why hed sprayed the aftershave at the scene hed known exactly what sachs would be looking for and of course the manual wasnt the only book hed read scenes of the crime too thats what had given him the idea for the planted clues old new york clues clues that only lincoln rhyme would be able to figure out taylor picked up the disk of spinal column hed given to rhyme eight months ago he kneaded it absently between his fingers and rhyme saw the gift so touching back then for the horrific preface that it was his eyes were unfocused distant rhyme recalled hed seen this before when taylord examined him over the past months hed put it down to a doctors concentration but now knew it was madness the control hed been struggling to maintain was disappearing tell me rhyme asked why why taylor whispered moving his hand along rhymes leg probing once more knee shin ankle because you were something remarkable rhyme unique you were invulnerable what do you mean how can you punish a man who wants to die if you kill him youve done what he wants so i had to make you want to live and the answer came to rhyme finally the old days it was fake wasnt it he whispered that obituary from the albany coroner you wrote it yourself colin stanton dr taylor was colin stanton the man whose family had been butchered in front of him on the streets of chinatown the man who stood paralyzed in front of the bodies of his wife and two children as they bled to death and could not make the obscene choice about which of them to save you missed things in the old days now too late the final pieces fell into place his watching the victims tj colfax and monelle and carole ganz hed risked capture to stand and stare at them just as stanton had stood over his family watching as they died he wanted revenge but he was a doctor sworn never to take a life and so in order to kill he had to become his spiritual ancestor the bone collector james schneider a nineteenthcentury madman whose family had been destroyed by the police after i got out of the mental hospital i came back to manhattan i read the inquest report about how you missed the killer at the crime scene how he got out of the apartment i knew i had to kill you but i couldnt i dont know why i kept waiting and waiting for something to happen and then i found the book james schneider hed been through exactly what i had hed done it i could too i took them down to the bone the obituary rhyme said right i wrote it myself on my computer faxed it to nypd so they wouldnt suspect me then i became someone else dr peter taylor i didnt realize until later why i picked that name can you figure it out stantons eyes strayed to the chart the answers there rhyme scanned the profile knows basic german schneiderrhyme said sighing its german for tailor stanton nodded i spent weeks at the library reading up on spinal cord trauma and then called you claimed id been referred by columbia sci i planned to kill you during the first appointment cut your flesh off a strip at a time let you bleed to death it mightve taken hours even days but what happened his eyes grew wide i found out you wanted to kill yourself he leaned close to rhyme jesus i still remember the first time i saw you you son of a bitch you were dead and i knew what i had to do i had to make you want to live i had to give you purpose once more so it didnt matter whom he kidnapped anyone would do you didnt even care whether the victims lived or died of course not all i wanted was to force you to try to save them the knot rhyme asked noticing the loop of clothesline hanging beside the poster it was a surgical suture he nodded of course and the scar on your finger my finger he frowned how did you her neck you printed her neck hannas i knew that was possible i didnt think about it angry with himself i broke a glass in the mental hospital library stanton continued to cut my wrist i squeezed it till it broke he madly traced the scar with his left index finger the deaths rhyme said evenly your wife and children it was an accident a terrible accident horrible but it didnt happen on purpose it was a mistake im so sorry for you and for them in a singsongy voice stanton chided remember what you wrote in the preface of your textbook he recited perfectly the criminalist knows that for every action theres a consequence the presence of a perpetrator alters every crime scene however subtly it is because of this that we can identify and locate criminals and achieve justice stanton grabbed rhymes hair and tugged his head forward they were inches apart rhyme could smell the madmans breath see the lenses of sweat on the gray skin well im the consequence of your actions whatll you accomplish you kill me and im no worse off than i wouldve been oh but im not going to kill you not yet stanton released rhymes hair backed away you want to know what im going to do he whispered im going to kill your doctor berger but not the way hes used to killing oh no sleeping pills for him no booze well see how he likes death the oldfashioned way then your friend sellitto and officer sachs her too she was lucky once but ill get her the next time another burial for her and thom too of course hell die right here in front of you work him down to the bone nice and slow stantons breathing was fast maybe well take care of him today whens he due back i made the mistakes its my rhyme suddenly coughed deeply he cleared his throat caught his breath its my fault do whatever you want with me no its all of you its please you cant rhyme began to cough again it turned into a violent racking he managed to control it stanton glanced at him you cant hurt them ill do whatever rhymes voice seized his head flew back his eyes bulged and lincoln rhymes breath stopped completely his head thrashed his shoulders shivered violently the tendons in his neck tightened like steel cords rhyme stanton cried sputtering saliva shooting from his lips rhyme trembled once twice an earthquake seemed to ripple through his entire limp body his head fell back blood trickled from the corner of his mouth no stanton shouted slamming his hands into rhymes chest you cant die the doctor lifted rhymes lids revealing only whites stanton tore open thoms medicine box and prepared a bloodpressure hypodermic injected the drug he yanked the pillow off the bed and pulled rhyme flat he tilted back rhymes lolling head wiped the lips and placed his mouth on rhymes breathing hard into the unresponsive lungs no stanton raged i wont let you die you cant no response again he checked the unmoving eyes come on come on another breath pounding on the still chest then he backed up frozen with panic and shock staring staring watching the man die in front of him finally he bent forward and one last time exhaled deeply into rhymes mouth and it was when stanton turned his head and lowered his ear to listen for the faint sound of breath any faint exhalation that rhymes head shot forward like a striking snake he closed his teeth on stantons neck tearing through the carotid artery and gripping a portion of the mans own spine down to stanton screamed and scrabbled backwards sliding rhyme off the bed on top of him together they fell in a pile on the floor the hot coppery blood gushed and gushed filling rhymes mouth the bone his lungs his killer lungs had already gone for a minute without air but he refused to loosen his grip now to gasp for breath ignoring the searing pain from inside his cheek where hed bit into the tender skin bloodying it to give credence to his sham attack of dysreflexia he growled in rage seeing amelia sachs buried in dirt seeing the steam spew over tj colfaxs body and he shook his head feeling the snap of bone and cartilage pummeling rhymes chest stanton screamed again kicking to get away from the monster that had socketed itself to him but rhymes grip was unbreakable it was as if the spirits of all the dead muscles throughout his body had risen into his jaw stanton clawed his way to the bedside table and managed to grab his knife he jabbed it into rhyme once twice but the only places he could reach were the criminalists legs and arms its pain that incapacitates and pain was one thing to which lincoln rhyme was immune the vise of his jaws closed harder and stantons scream was cut off as his windpipe went he plunged the knife deep into rhymes arm it stopped when it hit bone he started to draw it out to strike again but the madmans body froze then spasmed violently once then again and suddenly went completely limp stanton collapsed to the floor pulling rhyme after him the criminalists head slammed onto the oak with a loud crack yet rhyme wouldnt let go he held tight and continued to crush the mans neck shaking tearing the flesh like a hungry lion crazed by blood and by the immeasurable satisfaction of a lust fulfilled v when you move they cant gethcha a physicians duty is not just to extend life it is to end suffering dr jack kevorkian thirtyseven monday pm to monday pm it was nearly sunset when amelia sachs walked through his doorway she was no longer in sweats or uniform she wore jeans and a forestgreen blouse her beautiful face sported several scratches rhyme didnt recognize though given the events of the past three days he guessed the wounds werent selfinflicted yuck she said walking around the portion of the floor where stanton and polling had died it had been mopped with bleach with the perp bodybagged forensics became moot but the pink island of stain was huge rhyme watched sachs pause and nod a cold greeting to dr william berger who stood by the falcon window with his infamous briefcase at his side so you got him did you she asked nodding at the bloodstain yeah rhyme said hes got all by yourself it was hardly a fair fight he offered i forced myself to hold back outside the liquid ruddy light of the low sun ignited treetops and the marching line of elegant buildings along fifth avenue across the park sachs glanced at berger who said lincoln and i were just having a little talk were you there was a long pause amelia he began im going to go through with it ive decided i see her gorgeous lips marred by the black lines of tiny stitches tightened slightly it was her only visible reaction you know i hate it when you use my first name i goddamn hate it how could he explain to her that she was largely the reason he was going ahead with his death waking that morning with her beside him he realized with a piquant sorrow that she would soon climb from the bed and dress and walk out the door to her own life to a normal life why they were as doomed as lovers could be if he dared even to think of them as lovers it was only a matter of time until she met another nick and fell in love the case was over and without that binding them together their lives would have to drift apart inevitable oh stanton was smarter than he couldve guessed rhyme had been drawn to the brink of the real world once again and yes hed moved far over it sachs i lied sometimes you cant give up the dead sometimes you just have to go with them hands clenched she walked to the window i tried to come up with a ballbuster of an argument to talk you out of it you know something real slick but i couldnt all i can say is i just dont want you to do it a deals a deal sachs she looked at berger shit rhyme walking over to the bed crouching down she put her hand on his shoulder brushed his hair off his forehead but will you do one thing for me what give me a few hours im not changing my mind i understand just two hours theres something you have to do first rhyme looked at berger who said i cant stay much longer lincoln my plane if you want to wait a week i can come back thats okay doctor sachs said ill help him do it you the doctor asked cautiously reluctantly she nodded yes this wasnt her nature rhyme could see that clearly but he glanced into her blue eyes which though tearful were remarkably clear she said when i was when he was burying me rhyme i couldnt move not an inch for an instant i was desperate to die not to live just to have it over with i understood how you feel rhyme nodded slowly then said to berger its all right doctor could you just leave the whats the euphemism of the day hows paraphernalia berger suggested could you just leave them there on the table youre sure he asked sachs she nodded again the doctor set the pills brandy and plastic bag on the bedside table then he rummaged through his briefcase i dont have any rubber bands im afraid for the bag thats all right sachs said glancing down at her shoes ive got some then berger stepped close to the bed put his arm on rhymes shoulder i wish you a peaceful selfdeliverance he said selfdeliverance rhyme said wryly as berger left then to sachs now whats this i have to do she took the turn at fifty skidded hard and slipped smoothly up into fourth gear the wind blasted through the open windows and tossed their hair behind them the gusts were brutal but amelia sachs wouldnt hear of driving with the windows up thatd be unamerican she announced and broke the mph mark when you move rhyme had suggested it might be wiser to take their spin on the nypd training course but he wasnt surprised when sachs declared that that was a pussy run shed disposed of it the first week at the academy so they were out on long island their cover stories for the nassau county police ready rehearsed and marginally credible the thing about fivespeeds is top gear isnt the fastest thats a mileage gear i dont give a shit about mileage then she took his left hand and placed it on the round black knob encircled it with hers downshifted the engine screamed and they shot up to as trees and houses streaked past and the uneasy horses grazing in the fields stared at the black streak of chevrolet isnt this the best rhyme she shouted man better than sex better than anything i can feel the vibrations he said i think i can in my finger she smiled and he believed she squeezed his hand beneath hers finally they ran out of deserted road population loomed and sachs reluctantly slowed turned around and pointed the nose of the car toward the hazy crescent of moon as it rose above the distant city nearly invisible in the stew of hot august air lets try for onefifty she proposed lincoln rhyme closed his eyes and lost himself in the sensation of wind and the perfume of freshly cut grass and the speed the night was the hottest of the month from lincoln s rhymes new vantage point he could look down into the park and see the weirdos on the benches the exhausted joggers the families reclining around the smoke of dwindling barbecue fires like the survivors of a medieval battle a few dog walkers unable to wait for the nights fever to break made their obligatory rounds baggies in hand thom had put on a cd samuel barbers elegiac adagio for strings but rhyme had snorted a derisive laugh declared it a sorry cliché and ordered him to replace it with gershwin amelia sachs climbed the stairs and walked into his bedroom noticed him looking outside what do you see she asked hot people and the birds the falcons ah yes theyre there hot too he examined the male i dont think so somehow they seem above that sort of thing she set the bag on the foot of the bed and lifted out the contents a bottle of expensive brandy hed reminded her of the scotch but sachs said shed contribute the liquor she set it next to the pills and the plastic bag looking like a breezy professional wife home from balduccis with piles of vegetables and seafood and too little time to whip them into dinner shed also bought some ice at rhymes request hed remembered what berger had explained about the heat in the bag she lifted the cap off the courvoisier and poured herself a glass and filled his tumbler arranged the straw toward his mouth wheres thom she asked him out does he know yes they sipped the brandy do you want me to say anything to your wife rhyme considered it for a long moment thinking we have years to converse with someone to blurt and rant to explain our desires and anger and regrets and oh how we squander those moments here hed known amelia sachs all of three days and theyd bared their hearts far more than he and elaine had done in nearly a decade no he said ive emailed her a chuckle thats a comment on our times id say more brandy the astringent bite on his palate was dissipating growing smoother duller lighter sachs leaned over the bed and tapped her glass to his i have some money rhyme began im giving a lot of it to blaine and to thom i but she shushed him with a kiss to the forehead and shook her head a soft clatter of pebbles as she spilled the tiny seconals into her hand rhyme instinctively thought the dilliekoppanyi color test reagent add percent cobalt acetate in methanol to the suspect material followed by percent isopropylamine in methanol if the substance is a barbiturate the reagent turns a beautiful violetblue color how should we do it she asked gazing at the pills i really dont know mix them in the booze he suggested she dropped them in his tumbler they dissolved quickly how fragile they were like the dreams they induce she stirred the mixture with the straw he glanced at her wounded nails but even that he couldnt be sorrowful for this was his night and it was a night of joy lincoln rhyme had a sudden recollection of childhood in suburban illinois he never drank his milk and to get him to do so his mother bought straws coated on the inside with flavoring strawberry chocolate he hadnt thought about them until just this moment it was a great invention he remembered he always looked forward to his afternoon milk sachs pushed the straw close to his mouth he took it between his lips she put her hand on his arm light or dark music or silence dreams or the meditation of dreamless sleep what will i find he began to sip the taste was really no different from straight liquor a little more bitter maybe it was like from downstairs came a huge pounding on the door hands and feet both it seemed voices shouting too he lifted his lips away from the straw glanced into the dim stairwell she looked at him frowning go see he said to her she disappeared down the stairs and a moment later returned looking unhappy lon sellitto and jerry banks followed rhyme noticed that the young detective had done another butcher job on his face with a razor hed really have to get that under control sellitto glanced at the bottle and the bag his eyes swayed toward sachs but she crossed her arms and held her own silently ordering him to leave this was not an issue of rank the look told the detective and what was happening here was none of his business sellittos eyes acknowledged the message but he wasnt about to go anywhere just yet lincoln i need to talk to you talk but talk fast lon were busy the detective sat heavily in the noisy rattan chair an hour ago a bomb went off at the united nations right next to the banquet hall during the welcome dinner for the peace conference delegates six dead fiftyfour hurt banks added twenty of them serious my god sachs whispered tell him sellitto muttered banks continued for the conference the un hired a bunch of temps the perp was one of them a receptionist a halfdozen people saw her carrying a knapsack to work and putting it in a storeroom near the banquet hall she left just before the bang the bomb squad estimates were looking at about two pounds of c or semtex sellitto said linc the bomb it was a yellow knapsack the wits said yellow why was that familiar un human resources idd the receptionist as carole ganz the mother rhyme and sachs said simultaneously yeah the woman you saved in the church only ganzs an alias her real names charlotte willoughby she was married to a ron willoughby ring a bell rhyme said it didnt it was in the news a couple years ago he was an army sergeant assigned to a un peacekeeping force in burma keep going the criminalist said willoughby didnt want to go thought an american soldier shouldnt be wearing a un uniform and taking orders from anybody except the us army its a big rightwing issue nowadays but he went anyway wasnt there a week before hes blown away by some little punk in rangoon got shot in the back became a conservative martyr antiterror says his widow got recruited by an extremist group out in the chicago burbs some u of c grads gone underground edward and katherine stone banks took over the narrative the explosive was in a package of kids modeling clay along with some other toys we think she was going to take the little girl with her so security at the banquethall entrance wouldnt think anything of the clay but with pammy in the hospital she didnt have her cover story so she gave up on the hall and just planted it in the storeroom did enough damage as it was rabitted yep not a trace what about the little girl sachs asked pammy gone the woman checked her out of the hospital around the time of the bang no sign of either of them rhyme asked the cell the group in chicago theyre gone too had a safe house in wisconsin but its been hosed we dont know where they are so that was the rumor dellrays snitch heard rhyme laughed carole was the one coming into the airport had nothing to do with unsub he found banks and sellitto staring at him oh the old silent trick again forget it lon rhyme said all too aware of the glass sitting inches from him radiating a welcoming heat impossible the older detective plucked his sweaty shirt away from his body cringing god damn cold in here lincoln jesus look just think about it whatsa harm i cant help you sellitto said there was a note carole wrote it and sent it to the secretarygeneral by interoffice envelope harping on world government taking away american liberties some shit like that claimed credit for the unesco bombing in london too and said thered be more weve gotta get em linc feeling his oats scarface banks said the secretarygeneral and the mayor bothve asked for you sac perkins too and therell be a call from the white house you need any more persuading we sure hope you dont detective rhyme didnt comment on the error regarding his rank theyve got the bureaus pert team ready to go fred dellrays running the case and he asked respectfully yeah he used that very word he asked respectfully if youd do the forensic work and its a virgin scene except for getting the bodies and the wounded out then its not virgin rhyme snapped its extremely contaminated all the more reason we need you banks ventured adding sir to defuse rhymes glare rhyme sighed looked at the glass and the straw peace was so close to him just now and pain too infinite sums of both he closed his eyes not a sound in the room sellitto added it was just the woman herself hey wouldnt be that big a deal but shes got her daughter with her lincoln underground with a little girl you know what that kids lifes going to be like ill get you for that too lon rhyme nestled his head into the opulent pillow finally his eyes sprang open he said thered be some conditions name it linc first of all he said i dont work alone rhyme looked toward amelia sachs she hesitated for a moment then smiled and stood lifted the glass of tainted brandy out from under the straw she opened the window wide and flung the tawny liquid into the ripe hot air above the alley next to the townhouse while just feet away the falcon looked up glaring angrily at the motion of her arm cocked his gray head then turned back to feed his hungry youngster appendix excerpts from glossary of terms lincoln rhyme physical evidence th ed new
