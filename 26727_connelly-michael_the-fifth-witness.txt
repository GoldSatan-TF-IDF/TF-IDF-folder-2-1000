michael connelly the fifth witness the fourth book in the mickey haller series this is for dennis wojciechowski with many thanks part onethe magic words one mrs pena looked across the seat at me and held her hands up in a beseeching manner she spoke in a heavy accent choosing english to make her final pitch directly to me please you help me mr mickey i looked at rojas who was turned around in the front seat even though i didnt need him to translate i then looked past mrs pena over her shoulder and through the car window to the home she desperately wanted to hold on to it was a bleached pink twobedroom house with a hardscrabble yard behind a wire fence the concrete step to the front stoop had graffiti sprayed across it indecipherable except for the number it wasnt the address it was a pledge of allegiance my eyes finally came back to her she was fortyfour years old and attractive in a worn sort of way she was the single mother of three teenage boys and had not paid her mortgage in nine months now the bank had foreclosed and was moving in to sell the house out from under her the auction would take place in three days it didnt matter that the house was worth little or that it sat in a ganginfested neighborhood in south la somebody would buy it and mrs pena would become a renter instead of an ownerthat is if the new owner didnt evict her for years she had relied on the protection of the florencia but times were different no gang allegiance could help her now she needed a lawyer she needed me tell her i will try my best i said tell her i am pretty certain i will be able to stop the auction and challenge the validity of the foreclosure it will at least slow things down it will give us time to work up a longrange plan maybe get her back on her feet i nodded and waited while rojas translated i had been using rojas as my driver and interpreter ever since i had bought the advertising package on the spanish radio stations i felt the cell phone in my pocket vibrate my upper thigh read this as a text message as opposed to an actual phone call which had a longer vibration either way i ignored it when rojas completed the translation i jumped in before mrs pena could respond tell her that she has to understand that this isnt a solution to her problems i can delay things and we can negotiate with her bank but i am not promising that she wont lose the house in fact shes already lost the house im going to get it back but then shell still have to face the bank rojas translated making hand gestures where i had not the truth was that mrs pena would have to leave eventually it was just a question of how far she wanted me to take it personal bankruptcy would tack another year onto foreclosure defense but she didnt have to decide that now now tell her that i also need to be paid for my work give her the schedule a thousand up front and the monthly payment plan how much on the monthly and how long i looked out at the house again mrs pena had invited me inside but i preferred meeting in the car this was driveby territory and i was in my lincoln town car bps that stood for ballistic protection series i bought it used from the widow of a murdered enforcer with the sinaloa cartel there was armored plating in the doors and the windows were constructed of three layers of laminated glass they were bulletproof the windows in mrs penas pink house were not the lesson learned from the sinaloa man was that you dont leave the car unless you have to mrs pena had explained earlier that the mortgage payments she had stopped making nine months ago had been seven hundred a month she would continue to withhold any payments to the bank while i worked the case she would have a free ride for as long as i kept the bank at bay so there was money to be made here make it twofifty a month ill give her the cutrate plan make sure she knows shes getting a deal and that she can never be late with the payments we can take a credit card if she has one with any juice on it just make sure it doesnt expire until at least twenty twelve rojas translated with more gestures and many more words than i had used while i pulled my phone the text had come from lorna taylor call me asap id have to get back to her after the client conference a typical law practice would have an office manager and receptionist but i didnt have an office other than the backseat of my lincoln so lorna ran the business end of things and answered the phones at the west hollywood condo she shared with my chief investigator my mother was mexican born and i understood her native language better than i ever let on when mrs pena responded i knew what she saidthe gist of it at least but i let rojas translate it all back to me anyway she promised to go inside the house to get the thousanddollar cash retainer and to dutifully make the monthly payments to me not the bank i figured that if i could extend her stay in the house to a year my take would be four grand total not bad for what was entailed i would probably never see mrs pena again i would file a suit challenging the foreclosure and stretch things out the chances were i wouldnt even make a court appearance my young associate would do the courthouse legwork mrs pena would be happy and so would i eventually though the hammer would come down it always does i thought i had a workable case even though mrs pena would not be a sympathetic client most of my clients stop making payments to the bank after losing a job or experiencing a medical catastrophe mrs pena stopped when her three sons went to jail for selling drugs and their weekly financial support abruptly ended not a lot of goodwill to be had with that story but the bank had played dirty i had looked up her file on my laptop it was all there a record of her being served with notices involving demands for payment and then foreclosure only mrs pena said she had never received these notices and i believed her it wasnt the kind of neighborhood where process servers were known to roam freely i suspected that the notifications had ended up in the trash and the server had simply lied about it if i could make that case then i could back the bank off mrs pena with the leverage it would give me that would be my defense that the poor woman was never given proper notice of the peril she was in the bank took advantage of her foreclosed on her without allowing her the opportunity to make up the arrears and should be rebuked by the court for doing so okay we have a deal i said tell her to go in and get her money while i print out a contract and receipt well get going on this today i smiled and nodded at mrs pena rojas translated and then jumped out of the car to go around and open her door once mrs pena left the car i opened the spanish contract template on my laptop and typed in the necessary names and numbers i sent it to the printer that sat on an electronics platform on the front passenger seat i then went to work on the receipt for funds to be deposited into my client trust account everything was aboveboard always it was the best way to keep the california bar off my ass i might have a bulletproof car but it was the bar i most often checked for over my shoulder it had been a rough year for michael haller and associates attorneysatlaw criminal defense had virtually dried up in the down economy of course crime wasnt down in los angeles crime marched on through any economy but the paying customers were few and far between it seemed as though nobody had money to pay a lawyer consequently the public defenders office was busting at the seams with cases and clients while guys like me were left starving i had expenses and a fourteenyearold kid in private school who talked about usc whenever the subject of colleges came up i had to do something and so i did what i had once held as unthinkable i went civil the only growth industry in the law business was foreclosure defense i attended a few bar seminars got up to speed on it and started running new ads in two languages i built a few websites and started buying the lists of foreclosure filings from the county clerks office thats how i got mrs pena as a client direct mail her name was on the list and i had sent her a letterin spanishoffering my services she told me that my letter happened to be the first indication she had ever received that she was in foreclosure the saying goes that if you build it they will come it was true i was getting more work than i could handlesix more appointments after mrs pena todayand had even hired an actual associate to michael haller and associates for the first time ever the national epidemic of real estate foreclosure was slowing but by no means abating in los angeles county i could be feeding at the trough for years to come the cases went for only four or five grand a pop but this was a quantityoverquality period in my professional life i currently had more than ninety foreclosure clients on my docket no doubt my kid could start planning on usc hell she could start thinking about staying for a masters degree there were those who believed i was part of the problem that i was merely helping the deadbeats game the system while delaying the economic recovery of the whole that description fit some of my clients for sure but i viewed most of them as repeat victims initially scammed with the american dream of home ownership when lured into mortgages they had no business even qualifying for and then victimized again when the bubble burst and unscrupulous lenders ran roughshod over them in the subsequent foreclosure frenzy most of these onceproud home owners didnt stand a chance under californias streamlined foreclosure regulations a bank didnt even need a judges approval to take away someones house the great financial minds thought this was the way to go just keep it moving the sooner the crisis hit bottom the sooner the recovery would begin i say tell that to mrs pena there was a theory out there that this was all part of a conspiracy among the top banks in the country to undermine property laws sabotage the judicial system and create a perpetually cycling foreclosure industry that had them profiting from both ends of the process me i wasnt exactly buying into that but during my short time in this area of the law i had seen enough predatory and unethical acts by socalled legitimate businessmen to make me miss good oldfashioned criminal law rojas was waiting outside the car for mrs pena to return with the money i checked my watch and noted we were running late on my next appointmenta commercial foreclosure over in compton i tried to bunch my new client consultations geographically to save time and gas and mileage on the car today i worked the south end tomorrow i would hit east la two days a week i was in the car signing up new clients the rest of the time i worked the cases lets go mrs pena i said we gotta roll i decided to use the waiting time to call lorna three months earlier i had started blocking the id on my phone i never did that when i practiced criminal but in my brave new world of foreclosure defense i usually didnt want people having my direct number and that included the lender attorneys as well as my own clients law offices of michael haller and associates lorna said when she picked up how can i its me whats up mickey you have to get over to van nuys division right away there was a strong urgency in her voice van nuys division was the lapds central command for operations in the sprawling san fernando valley on the north side of the city im working the south end today whats going on they have lisa trammel there she called lisa trammel was a client in fact my very first foreclosure client i had kept her in her home for going on eight months and was confident i could take it at least another year further before we dropped the bankruptcy bomb but she was consumed by the frustrations and inequities of her life and could not be calmed or controlled shed taken to marching in front of the bank with a placard decrying its fraudulent practices and heartless actions that is until the bank got a temporary restraining order against her did she violate the tro are they holding her mickey theyre holding her for murder that wasnt what i was expecting to hear murder whos the victim she said theyre charging her with killing mitchell bondurant that gave me another great big pause i looked out the window and saw mrs pena coming out through her front door she held a wad of cash in her hand all right get on the phone and reschedule the rest of todays appointments and tell cisco to head up to van nuys ill meet him there you got it do you want bullocks to take the afternoon appointments bullocks was what we called jennifer aronson the associate i had hired out of southwestern a law school housed in the old bullocks department store building on wilshire no i dont want her doing intake just reschedule them and listen i think i have the trammel file with me but you have the call list track down her sister lisas got a kid hes probably in school and somebodys going to have to take him if lisa cant we made every client fill out an extensive contact list because sometimes it was hard to find them for court hearingsand to get them to pay for my work ill start on that lorna said good luck mickey same to you i closed the phone and thought about lisa trammel somehow i wasnt surprised that she had been arrested for killing the man who was trying to take her home away from her its not that i had thought it would come to this not even close but deep down i had known it was going to come to something two i quickly took mrs penas cash and gave her a receipt we both signed the contract and she got a copy for her own records i took a credit card number from her and she promised it would withstand a amonth hit while i was working for her i then thanked her shook her hand and had rojas walk her back to her front door while he did that i popped the trunk with the remote i carried and got out the lincolns trunk was spacious enough to hold three cardboard file boxes as well as all my office supplies i found the trammel file in the third box and pulled it i also grabbed the fancy briefcase i used for police station visits when i closed the trunk i saw the stylized spraypainted in silver on the lids black paint son of a bitch i looked around three front yards down a couple of kids were playing in the dirt but they looked too young to be graffiti artists the rest of the street was deserted i was baffled not only had i not heard or noticed the assault on my car that had taken place while i was having a client conference inside it but it was barely past one and i knew most gangbangers didnt get up and embrace the day and all its possibilities until late afternoon they were night creatures i headed back to my open door with the file i noticed rojas was standing at the front stoop chatting with mrs pena i whistled and signaled him back to the car we had to get going i got in message received rojas trotted back to the car and jumped in himself compton he asked no change of plans weve got to get up to van nuys fast okay boss he pulled away from the curb and started making his way back to the freeway there was no direct freeway route to van nuys we would have to take the into downtown where wed pick up the north we couldnt have been starting off from a worse position in the city what was she saying at the front door i asked rojas she was asking about you what do you mean she said you looked like you shouldnt need a translator you know i nodded i got that a lot my mothers genes made me look more south of the border than north she also wanted to know if you were married boss i told her you were but if you want to circle back and tap that itll be there shed probably want a discount on the fees though thanks rojas i said dryly she already got a discount but ill keep it in mind before opening the file i scrolled through the contacts list on my phone i was looking for the name of someone in the van nuys detective squad who might share some information with me but there was nobody i was going in blind on a murder case not a good starting point either i closed the phone and put it into its charger then opened the file lisa trammel had become my client after responding to the generic letter i sent to the owners of all homes in foreclosure i assumed i wasnt the only lawyer in los angeles who did this but for some reason lisa answered my letter and not theirs as an attorney in private practice you get to choose your own clients most of the time sometimes you choose wrong lisa was one of those times with me i was eager to start the new line of work i was looking for clients who were in jams or who had been taken advantage of people who were too naive to know their rights or options i was looking for underdogs and thought i had found one in lisa no doubt she fit the bill she was losing her house because of a set of circumstances that had fallen like dominoes out of her control and her lender had turned her case over to a foreclosure mill that had cut corners and even violated the rules i signed lisa up put her on a payment plan and started to fight her fight it was a good case and i was excited it was only after this that lisa became a nuisance client lisa trammel was thirtyfive years old she was the married mother of a nineyearold boy named tyler and their house was on melba in woodland hills at the time she and her husband jeffrey bought the house in lisa taught social studies at grant high while jeffrey sold bmws at the dealership in calabasas their threebedroom house carried a mortgage against an appraised value of the market was strong then and mortgages were plentiful and easy to get they used an independent mortgage broker who shopped their file around and got them into a lowinterest loan that carried a balloon payment at the fiveyear mark the loan was then folded into an investment block of mortgages and reassigned twice before finding its permanent home at westland financial a subsidiary of westland national the los angelesbased bank headquartered in sherman oaks all was well and good for the family of three until jeff trammel decided he didnt want to be a husband and father anymore a few months before the note on the house was due jeff took off leaving his bmw m demo in the parking lot at union station and lisa holding the balloon down to a single income and a child to care for lisa looked at the reality of her situation and made choices by now the economy had stalled out like a plane lumbering into the sky without enough airspeed given her teachers income no institution was going to refinance the balloon she stopped making payments on the loan and ignored all communications from the bank when the note came due the property went into foreclosure and that was when i came onto the scene i sent jeff and lisa a letter not realizing jeff was no longer in the picture lisa answered it i define a nuisance client as one who does not understand the bounds of our relationship even after i clearly and sometimes repeatedly delineate them lisa came to me with her first notice of foreclosure i took the case and told her to sit back and wait while i went to work but lisa couldnt sit back she couldnt wait she called me every day after i filed a lawsuit putting the foreclosure before a judge she showed up at court for routine filings and continuances she had to be there and she had to know every move i made see every letter i sent and be summarized on every call i received she often called me and yelled when she perceived that i was not giving her case my fullest attention i began to understand why her husband had hightailed it he had to get away from her i began to wonder about lisas mental health and suspected a bipolar affliction the incessant calls and activities were cyclical there were weeks when i heard nothing alternating with weeks where she would call daily and repeatedly until she got me on the line three months into the case she told me she had lost her job with the la county school district because of unexcused absences it was then that she talked about seeking damages from the bank that was foreclosing on her home a sense of entitlement moved into the discourse the bank was responsible for everything the abandonment by her husband the loss of her job the taking of her home i made a mistake in revealing to her some of my case intelligence and strategy i did it to appease her to get her off the line our examination of the loan record had turned up inconsistencies and issues in the mortgages repeated reassignment to various holding companies there were indications of fraud that i thought i could use to swing leverage to lisas side when it came time to negotiate an out but the information only galvanized lisas belief in her victimization at the hands of the bank never did she acknowledge the fact that she had signed for a loan and was obliged to repay it she saw the bank only as the source of her woes the first thing she did was register a website she used wwwcaliforniaforeclosurefighterscom to launch an organization called foreclosure litigants against greed it worked better as an acronymflagand she effectively made use of the american flag on her protest signs the message being that fighting foreclosure was as american as apple pie she then took to marching in front of westlands corporate headquarters on ventura boulevard sometimes by herself sometimes with her young son and sometimes with people she had attracted to the cause she carried signs that decried the banks involvement in illegal foreclosures and in putting families out of their homes and onto the streets lisa was quick to alert local media outlets to her activities she got on tv repeatedly and was always ready with a sound bite that gave voice to people in her situation casting them as victims of the foreclosure epidemic not gardenvariety deadbeats i had noticed that on channel she had even become part of the stock footage thrown up on the screen whenever there was an update on nationwide foreclosure issues or statistics california was the third leading state in the country for foreclosures and los angeles was the hotbed as these facts were reported there would be lisa and her group on the screen carrying their signsdont take my home stop illegal foreclosure now alleging that her protests were illegal gatherings that impeded traffic and endangered pedestrians westland sought and received a restraining order that kept lisa one hundred yards from any bank facility and its employees undaunted she took her signs and her fellow protestors to the county courthouse where foreclosures were fought every day mitchell bondurant was a senior vice president at westland he headed up the mortgage loan division his name was on the loan documents relating to lisa trammels house as such his name was on all of my filings i had also written him a letter outlining what i described as indications of fraudulent practices by the foreclosure mill westland had contracted with to carry out the dirty work of taking the homes and other properties of their default customers lisa was entitled to see all documents arising from her case she was copied on the letter and everything else despite being the human face of the effort to take her home away bondurant remained above the fray hiding behind the banks legal team he never responded to my letter and i never met him i had no knowledge that lisa trammel had ever met or spoken with him either but now he was dead and the police had lisa in custody we exited the at van nuys boulevard and headed north the civic center was a plaza surrounded by two courthouses a library city hall north and the valley bureau police complex which included the van nuys division various other government agencies and buildings were clustered around the main grouping parking was always a problem but it wasnt my worry i pulled my phone and called my investigator dennis wojciechowski cisco its me you close in his early years wojciechowski was associated with the road saints motorcycle club but there was already a member named dennis nobody could pronounce wojciechowski so they called him the cisco kid because of his dark looks and mustache the mustache was now gone but the name had stuck already here ill meet you on the bench by the front stairs to the pd ill be there in five have you talked to anyone yet ive got nothing yeah your old pal kurlens running lead on this the victim mitchell bondurant was found in the parking garage at westlands headquarters on ventura about nine this morning he was on the ground between two cars not clear how long he was down but he was dead on scene do we know the cause yet there it gets a little hinky at first they put out that hed been shot because an employee who was on another level of the garage told responding police she had heard two popping sounds like shots but when they examined the body on the scene it looked like he had been beaten to death hit with something was lisa trammel arrested there no from what i understand she was picked up at her home in woodland hills i still have some calls out but thats about the extent of what ive got so far sorry mick dont worry about it well know everything soon enough is kurlen at the scene or with the suspect i was told he and his partner picked up trammel and took her in the partners a female named cynthia longstreth shes a done ive never heard of her i had never heard of her either but since she was a detective one my guess was that she was new to the homicide beat and paired with the veteran kurlen a d to get some seasoning i looked out the window we were passing a bmw dealership and it made me think of the missing husband who had sold beemers before pulling the plug on the marriage and disappearing i wondered if jeff trammel would show up now that his wife was arrested for murder would he take custody of the son he had abandoned you want me to get valenzuela over here cisco asked hes only a block away fernando valenzuela was a bail bondsman i used on valley cases but i knew he wouldnt be needed this time id wait on that if theyve tagged her with murder she isnt going to make bail right yeah do you know if a das been assigned yet i was thinking about my exwife who worked for the district attorneys office in van nuys she might be a useful source of backchannel informationunless she had been put on the case then there would be a conflict of interest it had happened before maggie mcpherson wouldnt like that ive got nothing on that i considered what little we knew and what might be the best way to proceed my feeling was that once the police understood what they had in this casea murder that could draw wide attention to one of the great financial catastrophes of the timethey would quickly go to lockdown putting a lid on all sources of information the time to make moves was now cisco i changed my mind dont wait for me go over to the scene and see what you can find out talk to people before they get locked down you sure yeah ill handle the pd and ill call if i need anything got it good luck you too i closed the phone and looked at the back of my drivers head rojas turn right at delano and take me up sylmar no problem i dont know how long ill be i want you to drop me and then go back up van nuys boulevard and find a body shop see if they can get the paint off the back of the car rojas looked at me in the rearview mirror what paint three the van nuys police building is a fourstory structure serving many purposes it houses the van nuys police division as well as the valley bureau command offices and the main jail facility serving the northern part of the city i had been here before on cases and knew that as with most lapd stations large or small there would be multiple obstacles standing between my client and me i have always had the suspicion that officers assigned to front desk duty were chosen by cunning supervisors because of their skills in obfuscation and disinformation if you doubt this walk into any police station in the city and tell the desk officer who greets you that you wish to make a complaint against a police officer see how long it takes him to find the proper form desk cops are usually young and dumb and unintentionally ignorant or old and obdurate and completely deliberate in their actions at the front desk at van nuys station i was met by an officer with the name crimmins printed on his crisp uniform he was a silverhaired veteran and therefore highly accomplished when it came to the deadeyed stare he showed this to me when i identified myself as a defense attorney with a client waiting to see me in the detective squad his response consisted of pursing his lips and pointing to a row of plastic chairs where i was supposed to meekly go to wait until he deemed it time to call upstairs guys like crimmins are used to a cowering public people who do exactly as he says because they are too intimidated to do anything else i wasnt part of that public no thats not how this works i said crimmins squinted he hadnt been challenged by anybody all day let alone a criminal defense attorneyemphasis on criminal his first move was to fire up the sarcasm responders is that right yes thats right so pick up the phone and call upstairs to detective kurlen tell him mickey haller is on the way up and that if i dont see my client in the next ten minutes ill just walk across the plaza to the courthouse and go see judge mills i paused to let the name register im sure you know of judge roger mills lucky for me he used to be a criminal defense attorney before he got elected to the bench he didnt like being jacked around by the police back then and doesnt like it much when he hears about it now hell drag both you and kurlen into court and make you explain why you were playing this same old game of stopping a citizen from exercising her constitutional rights to consult an attorney last time it went down like that judge mills didnt like the answers he got and fined the guy who was sitting where you are five hundred bucks crimmins looked like hed had a hard time following my words he was a shortsentence man i guessed he blinked twice and reached for the phone i heard him confer directly with kurlen he then hung up you know the way smart guy i know the way thank you for your help officer crimmins catch you later he pointed his finger at me like it was a gun getting the last shot in so he could tell himself that he had handled that sonofabitch lawyer i left the desk and headed into the nearby alcove where i knew the elevator was located on the third floor detective howard kurlen was waiting for me with a smile on his face it wasnt a friendly smile he looked like the cat who just ate the canary have fun down there counselor oh yeah well youre too late up here hows that you booked her he spread his hands in a phony sorry about that gesture its funny my partner took her out of here just before i got the call from downstairs wow what a coincidence i still want to talk to her youll have to go through the jail this would probably take me an extra hour of waiting and this was why kurlen was smiling you sure you cant have your partner turn around and bring her down i wont be long with her i said it even though i thought i was spitting into the wind but kurlen surprised me and pulled his phone off his belt he hit a speeddial button it was either an elaborate hoax or he was actually doing what i asked kurlen and i had a history we had squared off against each other on prior cases i had attempted on more than one occasion to destroy his credibility on the witness stand i was never very successful at it but the experience still made it hard to be cordial afterward but now he was doing me a good turn and i wasnt sure why its me kurlen said into the phone bring her back here he listened for a moment because i told you to now bring her back he closed the phone without another word to his partner and looked at me you owe me one haller i couldve hung you up for a couple hours in the old days i wouldve i know i appreciate it he headed back toward the squad room and signaled me to follow he spoke casually as he walked so when she told us to call you she said you were handling her foreclosure thats right my sister got divorced and now shes in a mess like that there it was the quid pro quo you want me to talk to her no i just want to know if its best to fight these things or just get it over with the squad room looked like it was in a time warp it was vintage s with a linoleum floor twotone yellow walls and gray governmentissue desks with rubber stripping around the edges kurlen remained standing while waiting for his partner to come back with my client i pulled a card out of my pocket and handed it to him youre talking to a fighter so thats my answer i couldnt handle her case because of conflict of interest between you and me but have her call the office and well get her hooked up with somebody good make sure she mentions your name kurlen nodded and picked a dvd case off his desk and handed it to me might as well give you this now i looked at the disc whats this our interview with your client you will clearly see that we stopped talking to her as soon as she said the magic words i want a lawyer ill be sure to check that out detective you want to tell me why shes your suspect sure shes our suspect and were charging her because she did it and she made admissions about it before asking to call her lawyer sorry about that counselor but we played by the rules i held the disc up as if it were my client youre telling me she admitted killing bondurant not in so many words but she made admissions and contradictions ill leave it at that did she by any chance say in so many words why she did it she didnt have to the victim was in the process of taking away her house thats plenty enough motive right there were as good as gold on motive i couldve told him that he had that wrong that i was in the process of stopping the foreclosure but i kept my mouth shut about that my job was to gather information here not give it away what else you got detective nothing that i care to share with you at the moment youll have to wait to get the rest through discovery ill do that has a da been assigned yet not that i heard kurlen nodded toward the back of the room and i turned to see lisa trammel being walked toward the door of an interrogation room she had the classic deerintheheadlights look in her eyes youve got fifteen minutes kurlen said and thats only because im being nice i figure theres no need to start a war not yet at least i thought as i headed toward the interrogation room hey wait a minute kurlen called to my back i have to check the briefcase rules you know he was referring to the leatheroveraluminum attaché i was carrying i couldve made an argument about the search infringing on attorneyclient privilege but i wanted to talk to my client i stepped back toward him and swung the case up onto a counter then popped it open all it contained was the lisa trammel file a fresh legal pad and the new contracts and powerofattorney form i had printed out while driving up i figured i needed lisa to resign since my representation was crossing from civil to criminal kurlen gave it a quick onceover and signaled me to close it handtooled italian leather he said looks like a fancy drug dealers case you havent been associating with the wrong people have you haller he put on that canary smile again cop humor was truly unique in all the world as a matter of fact it did belong to a courier i said a client but where he was going he wasnt going to need it anymore so i took it in trade you want to see the secret compartment its kind of a pain to open i think ill pass youre good i closed the case and headed back to the interrogation room and its colombian leather i said kurlens partner was waiting at the rooms door i didnt know her but didnt bother to introduce myself we were never going to be friendly and i guessed she would be the type to stiff me on the handshake in order to impress kurlen she held the door open and i stopped at the threshold all listening and recording devices in this room are off correct you got it if theyre not that would be a violation of my clients we know the drill yeah but sometimes you conveniently forget it dont you youve got fourteen minutes now sir you want to talk to her or keep talking to me right i went in and the door was closed behind me it was a ninebysix room i looked at lisa and put a finger to my lips what she asked that means dont say a word lisa until i tell you to her response was to break down in a cascade of tears and a loud and long wail that tailed off into a sentence that was completely unintelligible she was sitting at a square table with a chair opposite her i quickly took the open chair and put my case up on the table i knew she would be positioned to face the rooms hidden camera so i didnt bother to look around for it i snapped open the case and pulled it close to my body hoping that my back would act as a blind to the camera i had to assume that kurlen and his partner were listening and watching one more reason for his being nice while one by one i took out the legal pad and documents with my right hand i used the left to open the cases secret compartment i hit the engage button on the paquin acoustic jammer the device emitted a lowfrequency rf signal that clogged any listening device within twentyfive feet with electronic disinformation if kurlen and his partner were illegally listening in they were now hearing white noise the case and its hidden device were almost ten years old and as far as i knew the original owner was still in federal prison id taken it in trade at least seven years ago back when drug cases were my bread and butter i knew law enforcement was always trying to build a better mousetrap and in ten years the electronic eavesdropping business must have undergone at least two revolutions so i was not completely put at ease i would still need to exercise caution in what i said and hoped my client would as well lisa were not going to talk a whole lot here because we dont know who may be listening you understand i think so but what is happening here i dont understand whats happening her voice had risen progressively through the sentence until she was screaming the last word this was an emotional speaking pattern she had used several times on the phone with me when i was handling only her foreclosure now the stakes were higher and i had to draw the line none of that lisa i said firmly you do not scream at me you understand if im going to represent you on this you do not scream at me okay sorry but theyre saying i did something i didnt do i know and were going to fight it but no screaming because they had pulled her back before the booking process had begun lisa was still in her own clothes she was wearing a white tshirt with a flower pattern on the front i saw no blood on it or anywhere else her face was streaked with tears and her brown curly hair was unkempt she was a small woman and seemed even more so in the harsh light of the room i need to ask you some questions i said where were you when the police found you i was home why are they doing this to me lisa listen to me you have to calm down and let me ask the questions this is very important but whats going on no one tells me anything they said i was under arrest for murdering mitchell bondurant when how i didnt go near that man i didnt break the tro i realized that it would have been better if i had viewed kurlens dvd before speaking with her but it was par for the course to come into a case at a disadvantage lisa you are indeed under arrest for the murder of mitchell bondurant detective kurlenhes the older onetold me that you made admissions to them in re she shrieked and brought her hands to her face i saw that she was cuffed at the wrists a new round of tears started i didnt admit anything i didnt do anything calm down lisa thats why im here to defend you but we dont have a lot of time right now theyre giving me ten minutes and then theyre going to book you i need to im going to jail i nodded reluctantly well what about bail it is very hard to get bail on a murder charge and even if i could get something set you dont have the another piercing wail filled the tiny room i lost my patience lisa stop doing that now listen your life is at stake here okay you have to calm down and listen to me i am your attorney and i will do my best to get you out of here but its going to take some time now listen to my questions and answer them without all the what about my son what about tyler someone from my office is making contact with your sister and we will arrange for him to be with her until we can get you out i was very careful not to introduce a hard time line for her release until we can get you out as far as i was concerned that might be days weeks or even years it might never happen but i did not need to get specific lisa nodded as if there was some relief in knowing her son would be with her sister what about your husband you have a contact number for him no i dont know where he is and i dont want you contacting him anyway not even for your son especially not for my son my sister will take care of him i nodded and let it go now was not the time to ask about her failed marriage okay calmly now lets talk about this morning i have the disc from the detectives but i want to go over this myself you said you were home when detective kurlen and his partner arrived what were you doing i was i was on the computer i was sending emails okay to who to my friends to people in flag i was telling them that we were going to meet tomorrow at the courthouse at ten and to bring the placards okay and when the detectives showed up what exactly did they say the man did all the talking he kurlen yes they came in and he asked me some things then he asked if i wouldnt mind coming to the station to answer questions i said about what and he said mitch bondurant he didnt say anything about him being dead or killed so i said yes i thought maybe they were finally investigating him i didnt know they were investigating me well did he tell you that you had certain rights not to speak to him and to contact a lawyer yes like on tv he told me my rights when exactly when we were already here when he said i was under arrest did you ride with him here yes and did you speak in the car no he was on his cell phone almost the whole time i heard him say things like i have her with me and like that were you handcuffed in the car no smart kurlen he risked riding in the car with an uncuffed murder suspect in order to keep her suspicions down and to lull her into agreeing to speak with him you cant build a better mousetrap than that it would also allow the prosecution to argue that lisa was not under arrest yet and therefore her statements were voluntary so you were brought here and you agreed to talk to him yes i had no idea they were going to arrest me i thought i was helping them with a case but kurlen didnt say what the case was no never not until he said i was under arrest and that i could make a call and thats when they handcuffed me too kurlen had used some of the oldest tricks in the book but they were still in the book because they worked i had to watch the dvd to know exactly what lisa had admitted to if anything asking her about it while she was upset was not the best use of my limited time as if to underscore this there was a sudden and sharp knock on the door followed by a muffled voice saying i had two minutes okay i am going to go to work on this lisa i need you to sign a couple of documents first though this first one is a new contract that covers criminal defense i slid the onepage document over to her and put a pen on top of it she started to scan it all these fees she said a hundred fifty thousand dollars for a trial i cant pay you this i dont have it thats a standard fee and thats only if we go to trial and as far as what you can pay thats what these other documents are for this one gives me your power of attorney allowing me to solicit book and movie deals things like that coming from the case i have an agent i work with on this stuff if theres a deal out there hell get it the last document puts a lien on any of those funds so that the defense gets paid first i knew this case was going to draw attention the foreclosure epidemic was the countrys biggest ongoing financial catastrophe there could be a book in this maybe even a film and i could end up getting paid she picked up the pen and signed the documents without reading further i took them back and put them away okay lisa what i am about to tell you now is the most important piece of advice in the world so i want you to listen and then tell me you understand okay do not talk about this case with anyone other than me do not talk to detectives jailers other jail inmates dont even talk to your sister or son about it whenever anyone asksand believe me they willyou simply tell them that you cannot talk about your case but i didnt do anything wrong im innocent its people who are guilty who dont talk i held my finger up to admonish her no youre wrong and it sounds to me like you are not taking what i say seriously lisa no i am i am then do what i am telling you talk to no one and that includes the phone in the jail all calls are recorded lisa dont talk on the phone about your case even to me okay okay i got it if it makes you feel any better you can answer all questions by saying i am innocent of the charges but on the advice of my attorney i am not going to talk about the case okay hows that good i guess the door opened and kurlen was standing there he was giving me the squint of suspicion which told me it was a good thing i had brought the paquin jammer with me i looked back at lisa okay lisa it gets bad before it gets good hang in there and remember the golden rule talk to no one i stood up the next time youll see me will be at first appearance and well be able to talk then now go with detective kurlen four the following morning lisa trammel made her first appearance in los angeles superior court on charges of firstdegree murder a special circumstances count of lying in wait was added by the district attorneys office which made her eligible for a sentence of life without parole and even for the death penalty it was a bargaining chip for the prosecution i could see the da wanting this case to go away with a plea agreement before public sympathy swung behind the defendant what better way to get that result than to hold lwop or the death penalty over the defendants head the courtroom was crowded to standing room only with members of the media as well as flag recruits and sympathizers overnight the story had grown exponentially as word spread about the police and prosecutions theory that a home foreclosure may have spawned the murder of a banker it put a bloodandguts twist on the nationwide financial plague and that in turn packed the house lisa had calmed considerably after almost twentyfour hours in jail she stood zombielike in the custody pen awaiting her twominute hearing i assured her first that her son was safe in the loving hands of her sister and second that haller and associates would do all that was possible to provide her with the best and most rigorous defense her immediate concern was in getting out of jail to take care of her son and to assist her legal team though the firstappearance hearing was primarily just an official acknowledgment of the charges and the starting point of the judicial process there would also be an opportunity to request and argue for bail i was planning to do just that as my general philosophy was to leave no stone unturned and no issue unargued but i was pessimistic about the outcome by law bail would be set but in reality bail in murder cases was usually set in the millions thereby making it unattainable for the common man my client was an unemployed single mother with a house in foreclosure a sevenfigure bail meant lisa wouldnt be getting out of jail judge stephen fluharty pushed the trammel case to the top of the docket in an effort to accommodate the media andrea freeman the prosecutor assigned to the case read the charges and the judge scheduled the arraignment for the following week trammel would not enter a plea until then these routine procedures were dispensed with quickly fluharty was about to call a short recess so the media could pack up equipment and leave en masse when i interrupted and made a motion requesting him to set bail for my client the second reason for doing this was to see how the prosecution responded every now and then i got lucky and the prosecutor revealed evidence or strategy while arguing for a high bail amount but freeman was too cagey to make such a slip she argued that lisa trammel was a danger to the community and should continue to be held without bail until further into the proceedings of the case she noted that the victim of the crime was not the only individual involved in foreclosing on lisas place of residence but only one link in a chain other people and institutions in that chain could be endangered if trammel was set free there was no big reveal there it seemed obvious from the start that the prosecution would use the foreclosure as the motive for the murder of mitchell bondurant freeman had said just enough to make a convincing argument against bail but had mentioned little about the murder case she was building she was good and we had faced each other on cases before as far as i remembered i had lost them all when it was my turn i argued that there was no indication let alone evidence that trammel was either a danger to the community or a flight risk barring such evidence the judge could not deny the defendant bail fluharty split his decision right down the middle giving the defense a victory by ruling that bail should be set and giving the prosecution a win by setting it at two million dollars the upshot was that lisa wasnt going anywhere she would need two million in collateral or a bail bondsman a ten percent bond would cost her in cash and that was out of the question she was staying in jail the judge finally called for the recess and that gave me a few more minutes with lisa before she was removed by the courtroom deputies as the media filed out i quickly admonished her one more time to keep her mouth shut its even more important now lisa with all of the media on this case they may try to get to you in the jaileither directly or through other inmates or visitors you think you can trust so remember talk to no one i get it good now i also want you to know that my entire staff is meeting this afternoon to review the case and set some strategies can you think of anything you want brought up or discussed anything that can help us i just have a question and its for you what is it how come you havent asked me if i did it i saw one of the courtroom deputies enter the pen and come up behind lisa ready to take her back i dont need to ask you lisa i said i dont need to know the answer to do my job then ours is a pitiful system i am not sure i can have a lawyer defending me who doesnt believe in me well its certainly your choice and im sure there would be a line of lawyers out the door of the courthouse who would love to have this case but nobody knows the circumstances of this case or the foreclosure like i do and just because somebody says they believe you it doesnt mean they really do with me you dont get that bullshit lisa with me its dont ask dont tell and that goes both ways dont ask me if i believe you and i wont tell you i paused to see if she wanted to respond she didnt so are we good i dont want to be spinning my wheels on this if youre going to be looking for a believer to take my place were good i guess all right then ill be by to see you tomorrow to discuss the case and what direction we are going to be moving in i am hoping that my investigator will have a preliminary take on what the evidence is showing by then hes can i ask you a question mickey of course you can could you lend me the money for the bail i was not taken aback i long ago lost track of how many clients hit me up for bail money this might have been the highest amount so far but i doubted it would be the last time i was asked i cant do that lisa number one i dont have that kind of money and number two its a conflict of interest for an attorney to provide bail for his own client so i cant help you there what i think you need to do is get used to the idea that you are going to be incarcerated at least through your trial the bail is set at two million and that means you would need at least two hundred thousand just to get a bond its a lot of money lisa and if you had it id want half of it to pay for the defense so either way youd still be in jail i smiled but she didnt see any humor in what i was telling her when you put up a bond like that do you get it back after the trial she asked no that goes to the bail bondsman to cover his risk because hed be the one on the hook for the whole two million if you were to flee lisa looked incensed im not going to flee i am going to stay right here and fight this thing i just want to be with my son he needs his mother lisa i was not referring to you specifically i was just telling you how bail and bonds work anyway the deputy behind you has been very patient you need to go with him and i need to get back to work on your defense well talk tomorrow i nodded to the deputy and he moved in to take lisa back to the courthouse lockup as they went through the steel door off the side of the custody pen lisa looked back at me with scared eyes there was no way she could know what lay ahead that this was only the start of what would be the most harrowing ordeal of her life andrea freeman had stopped to talk with a fellow prosecutor and that allowed me to catch up with her as she was leaving the courtroom do you want to grab a cup of coffee and talk i asked as i came up beside her dont you need to talk to your people my people all the people with cameras theyll be lined up outside the door id rather talk to you and we could even discuss media guidelines if you would like i think i can spare a few minutes you want to go down to the basement or come back with me to the office for some da coffee lets hit the basement id be looking over my shoulder too much in your office your exwife her and others though my ex and i are in a good phase right now glad to hear it you know maggie there were at least eighty deputy das working out of van nuys in passing we left the courtroom and stood side by side in front of the assembled media to announce that we would not be commenting on the case at this early stage as we headed to the elevators at least six reporters most of them from out of town shoved business cards into my handnew york times cnn dateline salon and the holy grail of them all minutes in less than twentyfour hours i had gone from scrounging amonth foreclosure cases in south la to being lead defense attorney on a case that threatened to be the signature story of this financial epoch and i liked it theyre gone freeman said once we were on the elevator you can wipe the shiteating grin off your face i looked at her and really smiled that obvious huh oh yeah all i can say is enjoy it while you can that was a notsosubtle reminder of what i was facing with this case freeman was an upandcomer in the das office and some said she would someday run for the top job herself the conventional wisdom was to attribute her rise and rep in the prosecutors office to her skin color and to internal politics to suggest she got the good cases because she was a minority who was the protégée of another minority but i knew this was a deadly mistake andrea freeman was damn good at what she did and i had the winless record against her to prove it when i got the word the night before that she had been assigned the trammel case i had felt it like a poke in the ribs it hurt but there was nothing i could do about it in the basement cafeteria we poured cups of coffee from the urns and found a table in a quiet corner she took the seat that allowed her to see the entrance it was a law enforcement thing that extended from patrol officers to detectives to prosecutors never turn your back on a potential point of attack so i said here we are youre in the position of having to prosecute a potential american hero freeman laughed like i was insane yeah right last i heard we dont make heroes out of murderers i could think of an infamous case prosecuted locally that might challenge that statement but i let it go maybe that is overreaching a bit i said lets just say that i think public sympathy is going to be running high on the defendants side of the aisle on this one i think fanning the media flames will only heighten it for now sure but as the evidence gets out there and the details become known i dont think public sympathy is going to be an issue at least not from my standpoint but what are you saying haller you want to talk about a plea before the case is even a day old i shook my head no not at all i dont want to talk about anything like that my client says she is innocent i brought up the sympathy angle because of the attention the case is already getting i just picked up a card from a producer at sixty minutes so id like to set up some guidelines and agreements on how we proceed with the media you just mentioned the evidence and how it gets out there into the public domain i hope you are talking about evidence presented in court and not selectively fed to the la times or anybody else in the fourth estate hey id be happy to call it a nofly zone right now nobody talks to the media under any circumstances i frowned im not ready to go that far yet she gave me the knowing nod i didnt think so so all ill say then is be careful both of us i for one wont hesitate to go to the judge if i think youre trying to taint the jury pool then same here good then thats settled for now what else when am i going to start seeing some discovery she took a long draw on her coffee before answering you know from prior cases how i work im not into ill show you mine if you show me yours thats always a oneway street because the defense doesnt show dick so i like to keep it nice and tight i think we need to come to an accommodation counselor well when we get a judge you can talk to the judge but im not playing nice with a murderer no matter who her lawyer is and just so you know i already came down hard on your buddy kurlen for giving you that disc yesterday that should not have happened and hes lucky i didnt have him removed from the case consider it a gift from the prosecution but its the only one youll be getting counselor it was the answer i was expecting freeman was a damn good prosecutor but in my view she didnt play fair a trial was supposed to be a spirited contesting of facts and evidence both sides with equal footing in the law and the rules of the game but using the rules to hide or withhold facts and evidence was the routine with freeman she liked a tilted game she didnt carry the light she didnt even see the light andrea come on the cops took my clients computer and all her paperwork its her stuff and i need it to even start to build the defense you cant treat that like discovery freeman scrunched her mouth to the side and posed as though she was actually considering a compromise i shouldve seen it for the act it was ill tell you what she said as soon as we are assigned to a judge you go in and ask about that if a judge tells me to turn it over ill turn it all over otherwise its mine and i aint sharing thanks a lot she smiled youre welcome her response to my request for cooperation and her smiling way of delivering it only served to underline a thought i had growing in the back of my mind since i had gotten word she was on the case i had to find a way to make freeman see the light five michael haller and associates had a full staff meeting that afternoon in the living room of lorna taylors condo in west hollywood attending were lorna of course as well as my investigator cisco wojciechowskiit was his living room tooand the junior associate of the firm jennifer aronson i noticed that aronson looked uncomfortable in the surroundings and i had to admit it was unprofessional i had rented a temporary office the year before when i was engaged in the jason jessup case and it had worked out well i knew that it would be best to have a real office instead of two staff members living room for the trammel case the only problem was it would add another expense i would have to eat until i manufactured fees out of the movie and book rights of the caseif i managed to make that happen this had made me reluctant to pull the trigger but seeing aronsons disappointment made the decision for me okay lets start i said after lorna had served everybody soda or iced tea i know this is not the most professional way to run a law firm and well be looking into getting some office space as soon as we can in the mean really lorna said clearly surprised by this information yes i just sort of decided that oh well im glad you like my place so much its not that lorna ive just been thinking lately you know with taking on bullocks here its like weve got a real firm now and maybe we should have a legit address you know so clients can come in instead of us always going to them fine with me as long as i dont have to open shop till ten and i can wear my bedroom slippers to work im kind of used to that i could tell i had insulted her we had been married once for a short time and i knew the signs but i would have to deal with it later it was time to put the focus on the lisa trammel defense so anyway lets talk about lisa trammel i had my first sitdown with the prosecutor after first appearance this morning and it didnt go so well ive done the dance with andrea freeman before and shes a givenoquarter kind of prosecutor if its something that can be argued then shes going to argue it if its discoverable material that she can sit on until the judge orders her to give it up then shell do that too in a way i admire her but not when were on the same case the bottom line is that getting discovery out of her is going to be like pulling teeth well is there even going to be a trial lorna asked we have to assume so i answered in my brief discussions with our client she has expressed only a desire to fight this thing she says she didnt do it so for now that means no plea agreement we plan on a trial but remain open to other possibilities wait a minute aronson said you emailed me last night saying you wanted me to look at the video you got of the interrogation thats discovery didnt that come from the prosecution aronson was a petite twentyfiveyearold with short hair that was carefully made to look stylishly unkempt she wore retrostyle glasses that partially hid brilliant green eyes she came from a law school that didnt turn any heads in the silkstocking firms downtown but when i interviewed her i sensed that she had a drive that was fueled by negative motivation she was out to prove those silkstocking assholes wrong i hired her on the spot the video disc came from the lead detective and the prosecutor wasnt happy about it at all so dont be expecting anything else we want something we go to the judge or we go out and get it ourselves which brings us to cisco tell us what youve got so far big man all eyes turned to my investigator who sat on a leather swivel chair next to a fireplace that was filled with potted plants he was dressed up today meaning he had sleeves on his tshirt still the shirt did little to hide the tats and the gun show his bulging biceps made him look more like a strip club bouncer than a seasoned investigator with a lot of finesse in his kit it had taken me a long time to get over the idea of this giant beef dish being my replacement with lorna but i had worked through it and besides i knew of no better defense investigator early in his life when he was cruising with the road saints the cops had tried to set him up twice on drug raps it built a lasting distrust of the police in him most people give the police the benefit of the doubt cisco didnt and that made him very good at what he did okay i am going to break this into two reports he said the crime scene and the clients house which was searched by police for several hours yesterday first the crime scene without using any notes he proceeded to detail all of his findings from westland nationals headquarters mitchell bondurant had been surprised by his attacker while getting out of his car to report for work he was struck at least twice on the head with an unknown object most likely attacked from behind there were no defensive wounds on his hands or arms indicating he was incapacitated almost immediately a spilled cup of joes joe coffee was found on the ground next to him along with his briefcase which was open beside the back tire of his car so what about the gunshots somebody said they heard i asked cisco shrugged i think theyre looking at that as car backfire two backfires or one and an echo either way there was no gunplay involved he went back to his report the autopsy results were not yet in but cisco was betting on bluntforce trauma being the cause of death at the moment time of death was listed as between and am there was a receipt in bondurants pocket from a joes joe four blocks away it was timestamped am and investigators figured the fastest he could have gotten from the coffee shop to his parking space in the bank garage was nine minutes the call from the bank employee who found his body was logged at am so estimated time of death had an approximate twentyminute swing it wasnt a lot of time but when it came to things like documenting a defendants movements for the purpose of alibi it was an eternity police interviewed everyone who was parking on the same level as well as all of those who worked in bondurants department at the bank lisa trammels name came up early and often during these interviews she was named as an individual bondurant had reportedly felt threatened by his department kept a threatassessment file and she was number one on the list as we all knew she had been served with a restraining order keeping her away from the bank the police hit the jackpot when one bank employee reported seeing lisa trammel walking away from the bank on ventura boulevard within minutes of the murder who is this witness i asked zeroing in on the most damaging part of his report her name is margo schafer shes a bank teller according to my sources shes never had contact with trammel she works in the bank not the loan operation but trammels photo was circulated to staff after they got the tro against her everybody was told to be aware of her and to report it if she was seen so she recognized her and was this on bank property no it was on the sidewalk a half block away she was supposedly walking east on ventura away from the bank do we know anything about this margo schafer not now but we will im on it i nodded it usually wasnt necessary for me to tell cisco what to investigate he moved on to the second part of his report the search of lisa trammels house this time he referred to a document he pulled from a file lisa trammel volunteeredtheir wordto accompany detectives to van nuys division about two hours after the murder theyre claiming she was not placed under arrest until the conclusion of an interview at the station using statements made during that interview as well as the eyewitness account of margo schafer the detectives obtained a search warrant for trammels home they spent about six hours there looking for evidence including a possible murder weapon as well as digital and hardcopy documentation of a plan to kill bondurant search warrants designate a specific window of time during which the search must take place afterward police must in a timely manner file a document with the court called a searchwarrant return that lists exactly what was seized it is then the judges responsibility to review the seizure to make sure that the police acted within the parameters of the warrant cisco said the detectives kurlen and longstreth had filed the return that morning and he had obtained a copy through the clerks office it was a key part of the case at this point because the police and prosecution werent sharing information with the defense andrea freeman had shut that down but the searchwarrant request and return were public records freeman could not stop their release and they gave me the best look at how the state was building its case give us the highlights i said but then i want a copy of the whole thing this is your copy here cisco said as far as may i please get a copy too aronson asked cisco looked at me for permission it was awkward he was silently asking if she was truly a member of the team and not just a client handholder i had brought in from the departmentstore law school absolutely i said you got it cisco said now the highlights as far as the weapon goes it looks like the detectives went into the garage and took every handheld tool they could find off the workbench so they dont know what the murder weapon was i said no autopsy yet cisco said theyll have to make wound comparisons that will take time but ive got the medical examiners office wired when they know it ill know it okay what else they took her laptop a threeyearold macbook pro and various and sundry documents relating to the foreclosure of the home on melba this is where they might piss the judge off they do not specifically list the documents probably because there were too many they mention just three files they are marked flag foreclosure one and foreclosure two i assumed that any foreclosure documents lisa had at home were documents i had given her the flag file as well as the computer could hold names of the members of lisas group an indication that the police were possibly looking for coconspirators okay what else they took her cell phone one pair of shoes from the garage and heres the kicker they seized a personal journal they dont describe it beyond that or say what was in it but im thinking that if its got her ranting against the bank or the victim in particular then well have a problem ill ask her about it when i visit her tomorrow i said back up for a second the cell phone was it specifically stated in the warrant application that they wanted her phone are they suggesting a conspiracy that she had help killing bondurant no nothing about coconspirators in the application theyre probably just making sure they cover all possibilities i nodded seeing the moves the investigators were making against my client was very helpful theyve probably filed a separate search warrant seeking call records from her service provider i said ill check into it cisco said okay anything else on the warrant the shoes the return lists one pair of shoes taken from the garage doesnt say why just says that they were gardening shoes they were a womans shoes no other shoes taken not that theyre taking credit for just these youve got nothing about shoe prints at the crime scene right ive got nothing on that okay i was sure the reason for the seizure of the shoes would become apparent soon enough on a search warrant police throw as wide a net as the court allows its better to seize as much as possible than leave anything behind sometimes that means seizing items that ultimately have nothing to do with the case by the way cisco said if you get the chance the application makes interesting reading if you can get past the misspellings and grammar issues they used her interview extensively but we already saw all of that on the disc kurlen gave you yes her socalled admissions and his exaggerations i stood up and started pacing in the middle of the room lorna also got up and took the search warrant from cisco so she could make a copy she disappeared into a nearby den where she had her office and where there was a copier i waited for her to come back and hand a copy of the documents to aronson before i began okay this is how we are going to do this first thing is we need to get moving on getting a real office some place close to the van nuys courthouse where we can set up our command post you want me on that mick lorna asked yes i do ill make sure theres parking and good food nearby it would be nice to be able to just walk to court you got it shortterm lease i paused i liked working out of the backseat of the lincoln it had a freedom to it that was conducive to my thought processes well take it for a year see what happens i looked at aronson next she had her head down and was writing notes on a legal pad bullocks i need you to handhold our current clients and respond with the basics to new callers the radio ads run through the month so we can expect no downturn in business i also need you to help out on trammel she looked up at me and her eyes brightened at the prospect of being on a murder case less than a year after being admitted to the bar dont get too excited i said im not giving you second chair just yet youll be doing a lot of the grunt work how were you on probable cause back at the departmentstore school i was the best in my class of course you were well you see that document in your hand i want you to take that search warrant and break it down and tear it apart were looking for omissions and misrepresentations anything that can be used in a motion to suppress i want all evidence taken from lisa trammels house thrown out aronson visibly gulped this was because i was issuing a tall order and it was more than grunt work because the task would probably mean a lot of effort for little return it was rare that evidence was kicked wholesale from a case i was simply covering all the bases and using aronson on one of them she was smart enough to see that and it was one reason i had hired her remember youre working on a murder case i said how many of your classmates can say theyve done that yet probably none damn right so next i want you to take the disc of lisas police interview and do the same thing look for any false move by the cops anything we can use to get that knocked out as well i think there might be something here in light of the supreme courts ruling last year are you familiar with it uh this is my first criminal case then get familiar with it kurlen went out of his way to make it look like she came in for a voluntary interview but if we can show he had her in his control cuffs or not we can make a case for her being under arrest from the start we do that and everything she said before miranda goes byebye okay aronson didnt look up from her writing do you understand your assignments yes good then go to it but dont forget about the rest of the clients theyre paying the bills around here for now i turned back to lorna which reminds me lorna i need you to make contact with joel gotler and get something rolling on this story this whole thing might go away if theres a plea agreement so lets try to get a deal now tell him were willing to go low on the back end for some decent upfront cash we need to fund the defense gotler was the hollywood agent who represented me i used him whenever hollywood came calling this time we were going to go calling on hollywood and proactively try to get a deal sell him on it i told lorna ive got a business card in the car from a producer at sixty minutes thats how big this is getting ill call joel she said i know what to say i stopped pacing to consider what was left and what my role was going to be i looked at cisco you want me on the witness he asked thats right and the victim too i want the full picture on both of them my order was punctuated by a sharp buzzing sound from an intercom speaker on the wall next to the kitchen door sorry thats the front gate lorna said she made no move to go to the intercom you want to answer it i asked no im not expecting anyone and all the delivery guys know the combination its probably a solicitor they walk this neighborhood like zombies okay i said then lets move on the next thing we need to be thinking about is the alternate killer that drew everyones undivided attention we need a setup man i said if we take this thing to trial its not going to be good enough to just potshot the states case we are going to need an aggressive defense we have to point the jury in a direction away from lisa to do that we need an alternate theory i was aware of aronson watching me as i spoke i felt like a teacher in law school what we need is a hypothesis of innocence if we build that we win the case the gate buzzer went off again it was then followed by two more long and insistent buzzes what the hell lorna said annoyed she got up and walked to the intercom she pushed the communication button yes who is it is this the law offices of mickey haller it was a womans voice and it sounded familiar but i couldnt immediately place it the speaker was tinny and the volume turned low lorna looked back at us and shook her head as though she was confused her address was not on any of our advertising how did this person get to the front gate yes but it is by appointment only lorna responded i can give you the number to call if you want to set up a consultation with mr haller please i need to speak to him now this is lisa trammel and im already a client i need to speak with him as soon as possible i stared at the intercom speaker as though i believed it to be a direct pipeline to the van nuys womens jailwhere lisa was supposed to be then i looked at lorna i guess youd better open the gate six lisa trammel was not alone when lorna answered her front door my client walked through in the company of a man i recognized as having been in court during lisas first appearance he had been in the front row of the gallery and stood out to me because he didnt look like a lawyer or journalist he looked hollywood and not the glitzy confident hollywood the other one the hollywood on the make either a toupee or amateur dye job on the hair requisite matching fringe on the chin wattled throat he looked like a sixtyyearold trying without a lot of success to pass for forty he wore a black leather sport coat over a maroon turtleneck a gold chain with a peace sign on it hung from his neck whoever he was i had to suspect he was the reason lisa was walking free well you either escaped from van nuys jail or you made bail i said im thinking that somehow someway its the latter smart man lisa said everyone this is herbert dahl my friend and benefactor thats dahl said the smiling benefactor benefactor i asked does that mean you put up lisas bail a bond actually dahl said who did you use a guy named valenzuela his place is right by the jail very convenient and he said he knew you right i paused for a moment wondering how to proceed and lisa filled in the space herb is a true hero rescuing me from that horrible place she said now im out and free to help our team fight these false charges lisa had worked previously with aronson but not directly with lorna or cisco she stepped over and put her hand out to them introducing herself and shaking hands as if this was all part of a routine day and it was time to get down to business cisco glanced over at me and gave me a look that said what the hell is this i shrugged i didnt know lisa had never mentioned herb dahl to me a dear enough friend and benefactor that he was willing to drop k on a bond this and the fact that she hadnt tapped his largesse to pay for her defense did not surprise me her barging in all bluster and business ready to be part of the team didnt either i believed that with strangers lisa was very skilled at keeping her personal and emotional issues beneath the surface she could charm the stripes off a tiger and i wondered if herb dahl knew what he was getting into i assumed he was working an angle but he might not understand that he was being worked as well lisa i said can we step back here into lornas office and speak privately for a moment i think herb should hear whatever it is you have to say hes going to be documenting the case well hes not going to document our conversations because communications between you and your attorney are private and privileged he can be compelled to testify in court about anything he hears or sees oh well isnt there a way of deputizing him or something to make him part of the legal team lisa just come back here for a few minutes i pointed toward the den and lisa finally started moving in that direction lorna why dont you get mr dahl something to drink i followed lisa into the den and closed the door there were two desks one for lorna and one for cisco i pulled a side chair over in front of lornas and told lisa to sit down i then went behind the desk and sat down to face her this is a strange law office she said it feels like somebodys home or something its temporary lets talk about your hero out there lisa how long have you known him just a couple months or so how did you meet him on the courthouse steps he came to one of the flag protests he said he was interested in us from a filmmakers perspective really so hes a filmmaker wheres his camera well he actually puts things together hes very successful he does like book deals and movies hes going to handle all of that this case is going to get massive attention mickey at the jail they told me i had interview requests from thirtysix reporters of course they didnt let me speak to them only herb herb got to you in the jail did he he must be relentless he said that when he sees a story he stops at nothing remember that little girl who lived for a week on the side of the mountain with her dead father after he crashed off the road he got her a tv movie thats impressive i know hes very successful yes you said that so did you make some sort of agreement with him yes hell put all the deals together and we split everything fiftyfifty after his expenses and he gets the bail money back i mean thats only fair but hes talking about a lot of money i might be able to save my house mickey did you sign something a contract or any sort of agreement oh yes its all legal and binding he has to give me my share you know that because you showed it to your lawyer uh no but herb said it was standard boilerplate you know legal mumbojumbo but i read it sure she did just like when she signed the contracts with me can i see the contract lisa herb kept it you can ask him i will now did you happen to tell him about our agreements our agreements yes you signed contracts with me yesterday at the police station remember one was for me to represent you criminally and the others granted me power of attorney to represent you and negotiate any sale of story rights so that we can fund your defense you remember that you signed a lien she didnt answer did you see i have three people out there lisa were all working on your case and you havent paid us a penny so far so that means i have to come up with all their salaries all their expenses every week thats why in the agreements you signed yesterday you were giving me the authority to make book and film deals oh i didnt read that part let me ask you something which is more important to you lisa that you have the best defense possible and try to defy the odds and win this case or that you have a book or movie deal lisa put a pouting look on her face and then promptly deflected the question but you dont understand im innocent i didnt no you dont understand whether youre innocent or not has nothing to do with this equation its what we can prove or disprove in court and when i say we i really mean me lisa me im your hero not herb dahl out there in the leather jacket and hollywood piece sign and i mean that as in piece of the pie she paused for a long moment before responding i cant mickey he just bailed me out it cost him two hundred thousand dollars he has to make that back while your defense team goes hungry no youre going to get paid mickey i promise i get half of everything ill pay you after he gets his two hundred grand back plus expenses expenses that could be anything it sounds like he said he got a half a million for one of michael jacksons doctors and that was just for a tabloid story we might get a movie i was on the verge of losing it with her lorna had a stressrelease squeeze toy on the desk it was a small judges gavel a sample of a giveaway she was considering for marketing and promotional purposes the name and number of the firm could be printed on the side i grabbed it and squeezed hard on the barrel thinking of it as herb dahls windpipe after a few moments the anger eased the thing actually worked i made a mental note to tell lorna to go ahead with the purchase wed give them out at bail bond offices and street fairs okay i said well talk about this later were going to go back out there now you are still going to send herb home because we are going to talk about your case and we do not do that in front of people who are not in the circle of privilege later you are going to call him and tell him he is not to make any deal or move without my approval do you understand lisa yes she sounded chastised and meek do you want me to tell him to leave or do you want to handle it can you handle it mickey no problem i think were done here we stepped back into the living room and caught dahl as he was finishing a story and that was before he made titanic he laughed at the kicker but the others in the room failed to show the same sense of hollywood humor okay herb were going to get back to work on the case and we need to talk with lisa i said im going to walk you out now but how will she get home i have a driver we can handle that he hesitated and looked to lisa to save him its okay herb she said we need to talk about the case ill call you as soon as i get home promise promise mick i can walk him out lorna offered no thats okay i have to go to the car anyway everyone said goodbye to the man with the peace sign and dahl and i left the condo each unit in the building had an exterior exit we walked down a pathway to the front gate on kings road i saw a delivery of phone books underneath the mailbox and used one stack to prop the gate open so i could get back in we walked out to my car which was parked against a red curb in front rojas was leaning on the front fender smoking a cigarette i had left my remote in the cup holder so i called to him rojas the trunk he pulled his keys and popped the rear lid i told dahl there was something i wanted to give him and he followed me over youre not going to stuff me in there are you not quite herb i just want to give you something we went behind the car and i pushed the trunk all the way open jeez you got it all set up back here he said when he saw the file boxes i didnt respond i grabbed the contracts file and pulled out the agreements lisa had signed the day before i moved around the car and copied it on the multipurpose machine on the front seat i handed the copies to dahl and kept the originals there read that stuff when you have a few minutes what is it it is my representation contract with lisa standard boilerplate theres also a power of attorney and a lien on any and all income derived from her case youll notice that she signed and dated them all yesterday that means they supersede your contract herb check the small print it gives me control of all story rightsbooks movies tv everything i saw his eyes harden wait just a no herb you wait a minute i know you just shelled out two hundred big ones on the bond plus whatever you paid to get to her in the jail i get it youve got a huge investment riding on this ill see that you get it back eventually but youre in second position here buddy accept it and step the fuck back you make no moves or deals without talking to me first i tapped the contract he was staring at you dont listen to me and youre going to need a lawyer a good one ill tie you up for two years and you wont ever see a dime of that two hundred back i slammed the car door to punctuate the point have a nice day i left him there and went to the trunk to return the originals to the file when i closed the lid i noticed that i could still see the shadow of the graffiti the spray paint had been removed but it had permanently marred the gloss of the cars finish the florencia still had its mark on me i looked down at the license plate on the bumper iwalkem that was going to be easier said than done this time i passed by dahl who was still standing on the sidewalk looking at the contracts back at the condo gate i picked a phone book off the stack that was propping it open i thumbed the corner back on a random page my ad was there my smiling face on the corner save your home dont let them foreclose without a fight michael haller associates attorneysatlaw call or visit wwwstopfinancialruincom se habla español i checked a few other pages to make sure the ad was on every page which i had paid for and then dropped the book back onto the stack i wasnt even sure who still used phone books but my message was there just in case the others were waiting silently for me when i got back to the condo lisas arrival with her benefactor had put an awkward spin on things i tried to get the meeting restarted in a way that would promote team unity okay so everybodys met everybody lisa we were in the middle of discussions about how we are going to proceed and what we need to know as we go forward we didnt have the advantage of having you here because frankly i was pretty sure you werent going to be getting out of jail until we got the notguilty verdict at the end but now youre here and i certainly want to include you in our strategies do you have anything you want to say to the group i felt like i was leading a group therapy session at the oaks but lisa lit up at the chance to hold the floor yes i first wanted to say that i am very grateful for all of your efforts on my behalf i know that in the law things like guilt and innocence dont really matter its what you can prove i understand that but i thought it might be good for you to hear it even if it is only this one time i am innocent of these charges i did not kill mr bondurant i hope that you believe me and that at trial we prove it i have a little boy and he badly needs to be with his mother no one spoke but everybody nodded somberly okay i said before your arrival we were going through the division of labor who is in charge of what who needs to do what that sort of thing id like to include you in the assignments as well whatever i can do she was sitting bolt upright on the edge of her chair the police spent several hours in your house after your arrest they searched it top to bottom and subject to the authority the search warrant gave them they took several items that might be evidence in the case we have a list which you are welcome to look at included are your laptop and three files marked flag and foreclosure one and two this is where you come in the minute we are assigned a courtroom and a judge we will file a motion asking to be immediately allowed to examine the laptop and the files but until then i need you to list as best you can what was in the files and on the computer in other words lisa what is in these documents that would make the cops seize them do you understand of course and yes i can do this ill start on it tonight thank you there is one other thing i want to ask you about you see if this thing goes to trial then i dont want any loose ends i dont want anybody showing up out of the woodwork or why do you say if excuse me you said if if this thing goes to trial there are no ifs sorry slip of the tongue but just so you know a good attorney will always listen to an offer from the prosecution because many times these negotiations allow you a sneak peek into the states case so if i tell you that i am talking to the prosecution about a deal remember that i have an ulterior motive okay okay but i am telling you now i wont plead guilty to anything i havent done theres a killer out there walking free while they try to do this to me last night i couldnt sleep in that terrible place i kept thinking about my son i could never face him if i pleaded guilty to something im not guilty of i thought she was about to turn on the faucet but she held back i understand i said softly now lisa this other thing i want to talk about is your husband why i immediately saw the warning flags go up we were crossing into difficult terrain hes a loose end when was the last time you heard from him is he going to show up and cause us a problem could he testify about you about any prior acts of retribution or revenge we need to know what is out there lisa whether it ever materializes doesnt matter if there is a threat i need to know about it i thought a spouse could not testify against a partner there is a privilege that you get to invoke but it can be a gray area especially with you two no longer living together so i want to tie up the loose end do you have any idea where your husband is at this time i wasnt being fully accurate on the law but i needed to get to the husband to further understand the dynamic of their marriage and how it might or might not play into the defense estranged spouses were wild cards you might be able to prevent them from testifying against your client but that didnt mean you could keep them from cooperating with the state outside the courtroom no none she answered but i assume he will show up sooner or later why lisa turned her palms up as if to show the answer was easy theres money to be made if he is anywhere near a tv or a newspaper and he gets wind of whats going on hell show up you can count on it it seemed like an odd answer as though there was a history of her husband being a money grubber when i knew that wherever he was he was spending very little of it you told me he maxed out your credit card in mexico thats right rosarito beach he put fortyfour hundred on the visa and exceeded the limit i had to cancel it and that was the only card we had left but i didnt realize that by canceling it i would lose the ability to track him so the answer is i dont know where he is now cisco cleared his throat and entered the interview what about contact any phone calls emails texts there were a few emails at first then nothing until he called on our sons birthday that was six weeks ago did your son ask him where he was lisa hesitated and then said no she wasnt a good liar i could tell there was something more there what is it lisa i asked she paused and then relented youll all think im a terrible mother but i didnt let him talk to tyler we got into an argument and i just hung up on him later i felt bad but i couldnt call back because the number had been blocked but he does have a cell phone i asked no he did but that numbers been out of service for a while he didnt call on his phone he either borrowed a phone or got a new number which he hasnt given me couldve been a throwaway cisco said they sell them in every convenience store i nodded the story of marital disintegration left everyone somber finally i spoke up lisa if he makes new contact you let me know right away i will i looked from her to my investigator we locked eyes and in the silent transmission i told him to check out everything he could about lisas wandering husband i didnt want him popping up in the middle of trial cisco gave me the nod he was on it a couple other things lisa and well have enough to get started okay when the police searched your house yesterday they took some other things we havent talked about one was described as a journal do you know what this was yes i was writing a book a book about my journey your journey yes the journey to finding myself in this cause the movement helping people fight to save their homes okay so it was like a diary of the protests and things like that thats right do you remember if you ever put mitchell bondurants name in the journal she looked down as she searched her memory i dont think so but i may have mentioned him you know said that he was the man behind everything nothing about hurting him no nothing like that and i didnt hurt him i didnt do this im not asking you that lisa i am trying to figure out what evidence they have against you so youre saying that this journal is not going to be a problem for us correct thats right it will be no problem theres nothing bad in there okay good i looked at the other members of my staff the verbal sparring with lisa had made me forget the next question cisco prompted me the witness right lisa yesterday morning at the time of the murder were you anywhere near the westland national building in sherman oaks she didnt answer right away which told me we had a problem lisa my son goes to school in sherman oaks i take him in the mornings and i drive right by that building thats okay so you drove by yesterday what time would that have been um about seven fortyfive that was taking him to school right right what about after you drop him off do you go back the same way yes most days what about yesterday were talking about yesterday did you drive back by i think so yes you dont remember no i did i take ventura to van nuys and then up to the freeway so did you go back by after dropping off tyler or did you do something else i stopped to get coffee and then i went home i drove by then what time im not sure i wasnt watching the clock i think it was around eight thirty did you ever get out of your car in the vicinity of westland national no of course not you are sure of course im sure i would remember that dont you think okay where did you stop to get your coffee at the joes joe on ventura by woodman i always go there i paused i looked at cisco and then at aronson cisco had previously reported that mitchell bondurant had been carrying a cup of joes joe when attacked i decided not to ask the obvious question yet about whether lisa had seen or interacted with bondurant at the coffee shop as lisas defense attorney i would be bound by what i knew i could never assist in perjury if lisa was to tell me that she had seen bondurant and even exchanged words with him then i would not be allowed to have her spin a different story at trial if she was to testify i had to be careful about soliciting information that would constrain me this early in the case i knew this was a contradiction my mission was to know all i could and yet there were things i didnt want to know right now sometimes knowing things limits you not knowing them gives you more latitude in crafting a defense aronson was staring at me obviously wondering why i wasnt asking the followup question i just gave her a quick head shake i would explain my reasons to her laterone more lesson they didnt teach her in law school i stood up lisa i think thats enough for today youve given us a lot of information and well go to work on it ill have my driver take you home now seven she was fourteen years old and still liked to eat pancakes for dinner my daughter and i had a booth at the dupars in studio city our wednesday night ritual i picked her up from her mothers and we stopped for pancakes on the way back to my place she did her homework and i did my casework it was my most treasured routine the official custody arrangement was that i had hayley every wednesday night and then every other weekend we alternated christmases and thanksgivings and i also had her for two weeks in the summer but that was just the official arrangement things had been going well over the past year and often the three of us did things together on christmas we had dinner as a family sometimes my exwife even joined us for pancakes and that was worth treasuring too but on this night it was just hayley and me my casework involved my review of the protocol from the autopsy of mitchell bondurant it included photos of the procedure as well as the body where it was found in the banks garage so i was leaning back in the booth and trying to make sure neither hayley nor anybody else in the restaurant saw the gruesome images they wouldnt go well with pancakes meantime hayley was doing her science homework studying changes in matter and the elements of combustion cisco had been right the autopsy concluded that bondurant had died from brain hemorrhaging caused by multiple points of bluntforce trauma to the head three points exactly the protocol contained a line drawing of the top of the victims head three points of impact were delineated on the crown in a grouping so tight that all three could have been covered with a teacup seeing this drawing got me excited i flipped to the front page of the protocol where the body being examined was described mitchell bondurant was described as six foot one and pounds i did not have lisa trammels dimensions handy so i called the number of the cell phone cisco had dropped off to her that morningsince her own phone had been seized by the police it was always a priority to make sure a client could be contacted at any time lisa its mickey real quick how tall are you what mickey im in the middle of dinner with just tell me how tall you are and ill let you go dont lie whats it say on your drivers license um five three i think is that accurate yes what is okay thats all i needed you can go back to dinner have a good night what i hung up and wrote her height on the legal pad i had on the table next to it i wrote bondurants height the exciting point was that he had ten inches on his suspected killer and yet the impacts that punctured his skull and killed him were delivered to the crown of his head this raised what i called a question of physics the kind of question a jury can puzzle over and decide for themselves the kind of question a good defense attorney can make something with this was iftheglovedoesntfityoumustacquit stuff the question here was how did diminutive lisa trammel hit sixfootone mitchell bondurant on the top of the head of course the answer depended on the dimensions of the weapon as well as a few other things such as the victims position if he was on the ground when attacked then none of this would matter but it was something to grab on to at the moment i quickly went to one of the files on the table and pulled out the searchwarrant return who was that you called hayley asked my client i had to find out how tall she was how come because it might have something to do with whether she could do what theyre saying she did i checked the list of items seized as cisco had reported only one pair of shoes was on it and they were described as gardening shoes taken from the garage no high heels no platform sandals or any other footwear of course the detectives conducted the search prior to the autopsy and before they knew its findings i considered all of this and concluded that gardening shoes probably didnt have much of a heel on them if they were suggesting the shoes were worn during the killing then bondurant still probably had ten inches on my clientif he was standing when attacked this was good i underlined the notes on heights three times on my legal pad but then i also started thinking about the seizure of only one pair of shoes the searchwarrant return did not say why the gardening shoes were taken but the warrant gave the police authority to seize anything that could have been used in the commission of the crime they had zeroed in on the gardening shoes and i was at a loss to explain why mom said you have a really big case now i looked at my daughter she rarely talked to me about my work i believed that this was because at her young age she still saw things as black and white and without any gray areas people were either good or bad and i represented the bad ones for a living so there was nothing to talk about did she yeah well its getting a lot of attention its the lady who killed the man taking away her house right was that her you just talked to shes accused of killing the man she hasnt been convicted of anything but yes that was her how come you need to know how tall she is you really want to know uhhuh well theyre saying she killed a man who was a lot taller than her by hitting him on the top of the head with some kind of a tool or something so im just wondering if shes tall enough to have done it so andy will have to prove that she was right andy moms friend shes the prosecutor on your case mom said you mean andrea freeman tall black lady with real short hair yeah so it was andy now i thought andy who said she knew my exwife only in passing so she and mom are pretty good friends i didnt know that they do yoga and sometimes andy comes by when i have gina and they go out she lives in sherman oaks too gina was the sitter my ex used when i wasnt available or when she didnt want me to know about her social activities or when we went out together well do me a favor hay dont tell anybody what we are talking about or what you heard me saying on the phone its sort of private stuff and i dont want it getting back to andy i probably shouldnt have made that call in front of you okay i wont thanks sweetie i waited to see if she would say more about the case but she went back to the science workbook i turned back to the autopsy protocol and the photos of the fatal wounds on bondurants head the medical examiner had shaved the victims head in the vicinity of the wounds a ruler had been placed in the photo to give dimension on the skin the impacts were pinkish and circular the skin was broken but the blood had been washed away to show the wounds two overlapped and the third was only an inch away the circular shape of the weapons impact surface led me to think that bondurant had been attacked with a hammer im not much of a home fixit man but i know my way around a toolbox and i knew that the striking surface of many hammers was circular sometimes ovoid i was sure this would be confirmed by the coroners toolmark expert but it was always good to be a step ahead and anticipate their moves i noticed that there was a small vshaped notch in each of the impact marks and wasnt sure what it meant i checked the searchwarrant return again and saw that the police had not listed a hammer among the tools seized from lisa trammels garage this was curious because so many other less common tools were seized again it may have been because the search was carried out before the autopsy was conducted and such facts were known the police took all tools rather than a specific tool it still left the question though where was the hammer was there a hammer this of course was the cases first doubleedged sword the prosecution would hold that the lack of a hammer in a fully stocked workbench was an indication of culpability the defendant used the hammer to strike and kill the victim then discarded it to hide her involvement in the crime the defenses side of that argument was that the missing hammer was exculpatory you have no murder weapon you have no connection to the defendant you have no case on paper it should be a wash but not always jurors typically leaned toward the prosecution in such questions call it the homefield advantage the prosecution is always the home team still i made a note to tell cisco to chase down the hammer as best he could talk to lisa trammel see what she knew track down her husband if only to ask if there ever was a hammer and what had happened to it the next photos from the autopsy were of the shattered skull itself after the scalp had been pulled back over the cranium the damage was extensive the skull having been punctured by all three of the blows and fractured in almost wavelike patterns emanating from the impact areas the wounds were described as unsurvivable and the photos completely backed this conclusion the autopsy listed several other lacerations and abrasions on the body and even a fracture as well as three broken teeth but the examiner interpreted all of these as injuries sustained when bondurant fell face forward to the ground during the attack he was unconscious if not already dead before he hit the garage floor there were no defensive wounds listed part of the autopsy protocol contained color photocopies of the crime scene photos provided to the examiner by the lapd it was not a complete set but just six shots that showed the bodys orientation in situmeaning situated as it had been found i wouldve rather had a full set of prints of the actual photographs but i wouldnt get those until i got a judge to ease the discovery embargo placed on the case by andy freeman the crime scene photos showed bondurants body from numerous angles it was sprawled between two cars in the garage the drivers side door of a lexus suv was open there was a joes joe coffee cup on the ground and a pool of spilled coffee nearby was an open briefcase bondurant was facedown on the ground the back and top of his head matted with blood his eyes were open and appeared to be staring at concrete in the photos there were evidence markers next to blood drips on the concrete there was no analysis to determine if this was blood spatter from the attack itself or drippings from the murder weapon i found the briefcase to be a curious thing why was it open had anything been taken had the murderer taken the time to rifle through the case after killing bondurant if so this would seem to be a cold and calculated move the garage was filling with employees coming to work at the bank to take the time to go through a briefcase while the body of your victim lies nearby seemed like an extreme risk but not the sort of move a killer fueled by emotion and vengeance would make it was not the move of an amateur i wrote a few more notes in regard to these questions and then a final reminder i would have cisco find out if there was assigned parking in the garage did bondurant have his name on the wall at the front of the stall the lyinginwait tag added to the murder charge indicated the prosecution believed trammel knew where bondurant would be and when they would have to prove that at trial i closed the trammel files and wrapped a rubber band around them and the legal pad you doing okay i asked hayley sure are you almost finished my food or my homework both im finished eating but i still have social studies and english but we can go if you want i still have a few other files to look at i have court tomorrow for the murder case no other cases like where youre trying to let people stay in their houses thats right how come there are so many cases like that out of the mouths of babes greed honey it all comes down to greed on everybodys part i looked at her to see if that would suffice but she didnt go back to her homework she looked at me expecting more a fourteenyearold who was interested in what most of the country was not well what happens is that it takes a lot of money to buy a house or a condo most of the time thats why so many people rent their homes instead most people who buy a home put down a big chunk of money but they almost never have enough to buy the whole house so they go to the bank for a loan the bank decides if they have enough money and make enough money to pay back the loan which is called a mortgage so if everything looks good they buy the home they want and pay back the mortgage with monthly payments for many years does this make sense you mean like they pay rent to the bank sort of but when you rent from a landlord you dont get any ownership there is supposed to be ownership involved when you have a mortgage it is your home and they say the american dream is to own your own home do you own yours i do and your mom owns hers she nodded but i wasnt so sure we were talking at a level understandable to a fourteenyearold she didnt see much of the american dream in her parents having separate mortgages to go with their separate addresses okay so a while back they started making it easier to buy a home and soon practically anybody who walked into a bank or went to see a mortgage broker was being given a loan on a home there was a lot of fraud and corruption and there were a lot of loans given to people who shouldnt have been given them some people lied to get loans and sometimes it was the loan makers who lied were talking about millions of loans hay and when you have that much going on there are not enough people or rules to control it all was it like nobody made anybody pay there was some of that but it was mostly that people were taking on more than they could handle and these loans had interest rates that changed these rates dictated how much the home owner had to pay each month and they could go up by a lot sometimes they had whats called a balloon payment where you have to pay it all back at the end of five years to make a long and complicated story short the countrys economy went down and the values of the homes went down with it it became a crisis because millions of people in the country couldnt pay for the houses they bought and they couldnt sell them because they were worth less than what was owed on them but the banks and other lenders and these investment syndicates that held all the mortgages didnt really care about that they just wanted their money back so when people couldnt pay they started taking their houses so those people hire you some of them do but there are millions of foreclosures going on these lenders all want their money back and so some of them do bad things and some of them hire people to do bad things they lie and cheat and they take away peoples houses without doing it fairly or under the law and thats where i come in i looked at her i had probably lost her already i pulled over the second stack of files i had on the table and opened the top one i spoke as i read okay now heres one this family bought a house six years ago and the monthly payment was nine hundred dollars two years later when the shit started to hit the dad sorry two years later when things started going wrong in this country their interest rate went up and so did their payment at the same time the husband lost his job as a school bus driver because he had an accident so the husband and wife went to the bank and said hey we have a problem can we change or restructure our loan so we can still pay for our house this is called loan modification and its pretty much a joke these people did the right thing going in like that but the bank led them on and said yes well work with you you keep paying what you can while we go to work on this so they paid what they could but it wasnt enough they waited and waited but they never heard anything from the bank that is until they got the notice in the mail that they were being foreclosed on so its this kind of stuff that is wrong and i try to do something about it its david and goliath stuff hay the giant financial institutions are running roughshod over people and they dont have too many guys like me standing up for them it was during my explanation to my young daughter that i finally realized why i had been drawn to this particular practice of law yes some of my clients were just gaming the system they were charlatans no better than the banks they were taking on but some of my clients were the downtrodden and disadvantaged they were the true underdogs in society and i wanted to stand for them and keep them in their homes for as long as i possibly could hayley had raised her pencil and was itching to go back to work as soon as i dismissed her she was polite that way and must have gotten it from her mother anyway thats what its all about you can go back to work now you want something else to drink or a dessert dad pancakes are like dessert she had braces and had chosen lime green bands when she spoke my attention was constantly drawn to her teeth oh right yeah then what about something else to drink more milk no im fine okay i went back to work too and separated the three foreclosure files in front of me i had been getting so much business off the radio ads that we had been bundling court appearances that is trying to schedule together hearings and appearances on all cases that i had before a particular judge in the morning i had three hearings before judge alfred byrne in the downtown county courthouse all three were defenses based on claims of wrongful foreclosure and fraud perpetrated by the lender or the loanservicing agent employed by the lender in each of the cases i had stayed foreclosure with my court filings my clients were in their homes and not required to make their monthly payments the other side viewed this as a scam equal in size to the foreclosure epidemic i was despised by opposing counsel for perpetuating fraud myself and only delaying an inevitable outcome that was okay by me when you come from the criminal defense bar you are used to being despised am i too late for pancakes i looked up to see my exwife slide into the booth next to our daughter she landed a kiss on hayleys cheek before the girl could go on the defensive she was at that age i wished maggie had slid into my side of the booth and planted one on me but i could wait i smiled at her as i started pulling all the files off the table to make room its never too late for pancakes i said eight lisa trammel was formally arraigned in van nuys the following tuesday it was a routine hearing intended to put her plea on record and to start the clock in order to meet the states speedytrial requirement however because my client was free on bail we would likely be waiving speedy trial there was no reason to hurry as long as she was breathing free air the case would slowly build momentum like a summer storm and begin when the defense was fully prepared but the arraignment did serve the purpose of putting lisas forthright and emphatic not guilty on the court record as well as on video for the gathered media though attendance was lower than it was at her first appearance the national media tends to retreat from the ongoing mundane processes of a case as it passes through the justice system the local media still showed in force and the fifteenminute hearing was well documented the case had been assigned to superior court judge dario morales for arraignment and preliminary hearing the latter would be a perfunctory rubberstamping of the charges lisa would undoubtedly be held to answer and the case would then be assigned to another judge for the main event the trial though i had talked to her on the phone almost daily since her arrest i had not seen lisa in more than a week she had declined my invitations to meet in person and now i knew why she looked like a different woman when she showed up in court her hair had been cut into a stylish wave and her face looked both excessively pink and smooth whispers in the courtroom hinted that lisa had had a botox facial treatment in order to become more visually appealing i believed these physical changes as well as the smart new suit lisa was wearing were the work of herb dahl he and lisa seemed inseparable and dahls involvement was becoming more and more troubling he had begun incessantly referring producers and screenwriters to my office number this left lorna constantly deflecting their attempts to secure a piece of the lisa trammel story quick checks of the internet movie database usually revealed these herb dahl referrals to be hollywood hacks and bottomfeeders of the lowest caliber it wasnt that we couldnt use a nice big infusion of hollywood cash to defray our mounting costs but these were all dealnowpaylater people and that wouldnt do meantime my own agent was out there trying to sew up a deal with an upfront fee that would cover a few salaries and the rent on an office and still leave enough to pay back dahl and make him go away with almost any court hearing the most important information and actions are not what ends up on the record so too with lisas arraignment after her plea was routinely put on record and morales scheduled a status hearing for two weeks later i told the judge that the defense had a number of motions to submit to the court for consideration he welcomed them and i stepped forward and handed his clerk five separate motions i gave andrea freeman copies as well the first three motions had been prepared by aronson after her indepth review of the lapds searchwarrant application the video of detective kurlen interviewing lisa trammel and the questions regarding miranda and when lisa was actually placed under arrest aronson had found inconsistencies procedural errors and exaggerations of fact she drew up motions to suppress asking that the taped interview be disallowed in the case and that all evidence gathered from the search of the defendants home be excluded as well the motions were well thought out and cogently written i was proud of aronson and pleased with myself for seeing her as a diamond in the rough when her résumé had crossed my desk but the truth was i knew her motions didnt stand much of a chance no judge elected to the bench wants to throw out the evidence in a murder case not if he wants the voting public to keep him on the bench so the jurist will look for ways to maintain status quo and get the decisions on evidence before a jury nevertheless aronsons motions played an important role in the defense strategy because accompanying them were two other motions one sought to jumpstart the discovery process by requesting defense access to all records and internal memoranda pertaining to lisa trammel and mitchell bondurant held by westland financial the other was a motion compelling the prosecution to allow the defense to examine trammels laptop computer cell phone and all personal documents seized in the search of her home since morales would want to act equitably toward both defense and prosecution my strategy was to push the judge toward a solomonic solution split the baby dismiss the motions to suppress but give the defense the access requested in the other two motions of course both morales and freeman had been around the block a few times and would see this strategy coming from a mile away still just because they knew what i was doing didnt mean they could stop it besides that i had a sixth motion in my pocket that i had not yet filed with the court and it was going to be my ace in the hole morales gave freeman ten days to respond to the motions and adjourned the hearing quickly moving on to his next case a good judge always keeps the cases moving i turned to lisa and told her to wait for me in the hallway because i was going to speak to the prosecutor i noticed dahl waiting for her at the gate he would be more than happy to escort her out i decided to deal with him later and went over to the prosecution table freeman had her head down and was writing a note on a legal pad hey andy she looked up at me she had just begun to smile expecting to see some friend who typically called her andy when she saw it was me the smile disappeared in an instant i placed the sixth motion down on the table in front of her take a look at that when you have a minute im going to file it tomorrow morning didnt want to inundate the court with a blizzard of paper today you know tomorrow morning should be fine but i thought id give you a headsup since it involves you me what are you talking about i didnt answer i left her there and made my way through the gate and out of the courtroom as i stepped through the double doors i saw my client and herb dahl already holding court in front of a deep semicircle of reporters and cameras i quickly walked up behind lisa took her by the arm and pulled her away while she was in midsentence ththththats all folks i said in my best porky pig lisa struggled against my pull but i still managed to get her away from the pack and start walking her down the hallway what are you doing she protested you are embarrassing me embarrassing you lisa you are embarrassing yourself with that guy i told you to drop him now look at you all done up like youre some kind of movie star this is a trial lisa not entertainment tonight i was telling them my story i stopped walking when we were far enough away from the crowd not to be overheard lisa you cant talk openly to the media like that it can come back to bite you on the ass what are you talking about it was a perfect opportunity to give my side of this im being railroaded here and its time to speak out i told you its guilty people who dont speak the problem is the da has a media unit and they copy and record every story about you that is printed and aired everything you say they have a copy of it and if you ever change your story even slightly from one statement to the next then theyve got you theyll crucify you with it in front of a jury what im trying to say is its not worth the risk lisa you should let me do the talking for you but if you cant do that and really want to put out your story yourself then well prepare and rehearse you and plan it with strategic hits in the media but thats where herb comes in he was making sure i didnt let me explain it again to you lisa herb dahl is not your attorney and does not have your best interests as his priority he has herb dahls okay i cant seem to get the message through to you you have to cut him loose he no i cant i wont hes the only one who truly cares oh thats really breaking my heart lisa if hes the only one who cares about you whats he doing still talking to those people i pointed to the knot of reporters and photographers sure enough dahl was still holding forth feeding them whatever they needed what is he saying to them lisa do you know because i sure as shit dont and thats sort of funny because youre the defendant and im the defense attorney whos he he can speak for me lisa said as we watched dahl pointing his finger to call on reporters i saw the door to the courtroom we had just left swing open andrea freeman strode out holding my sixth motion in her hand her eyes scanning the hallway at first she zeroed in on the media knot but then she saw it was not me at the center of it when her radar picked me up she corrected her course and made a beeline right toward me a few of the reporters called to her but she sharply waved them off with the document lisa go over to one of those benches and sit down and wait for me and dont talk to any reporters what about just do it as lisa walked away freeman came up on me she was mad and i could see the fire in her eyes what is this shit haller she held up the paper i maintained a calm demeanor even as she stepped right into my personal space well i said i think its pretty obvious what it is its a motion to have you dismissed from the case because you have a conflict of interest i have a conflict of interest what conflict look andyi can call you andy right i mean my daughter does so i should too dont you think cut the shit haller sure i can do that the conflict that i am objecting to is that youve been discussing this case with my exwife and who happens to be a prosecutor working in the same office as me thats true but these discussions havent taken place in the office exclusively in fact theyve taken place at yoga and in front of my daughter and probably all over the valley as far as i know oh come on this is such bullshit really then why did you lie to me ive never lied what are you i asked you if you knew my exwife and you said in passing thats not really the truth is it i just didnt want to get into it with you so you lied i didnt mention that in the motion but i could add it before i file it the judge could decide if it is important she blew out her breath in agitated surrender what do you want i looked around no one could hear us what do i want i want to show you that i can play it your way too you want to be a hardass with me i can be one with you meaning what haller whats the quid pro quo i nodded we were getting down to the deal now you know if i file this tomorrow you are history the judge will err on the side of the defense hell avoid anything that might have any chance of getting him reversed besides he knows there are three hundred ablebodied prosecutors in the das office they can just send in a replacement i pointed to the gaggle of reporters assembled in the hall most of them still surrounding herb dahl you see all of those reporters and all that attention all of that will go away probably the biggest case of your career and it all goes away no press conferences no headlines no spotlight it all goes to whoever they send in to take your place first of all i will fight this thing and it is not a given that judge morales will fall for your bullshit i will tell him exactly what you are doing trying to dashop trying to get rid of a prosecutor you are flatout scared of you can tell him all you like but youll still have to tell the judgein open courthow it is that my fourteenyearold daughter was reciting facts of this case back to me at dinner last week that is bullshit you should be ashamed of using your what are you saying that im the liar or my daughter is the liar because we can bring her into court too im not so sure your bosses are going to like the spectacle this will causeor the headlines you know da grills fourteenyearold calls the kid a liar kind of tawdry dont you think freeman turned her back and took a step to walk away from me but then stopped i knew i had her she should walk away from me and the case but she couldnt she wanted the case and all that it could bring her she turned back to me she looked at me as though i were not even there as if i were dead again what do you want id rather not file this tomorrow id rather just withdraw the motions i had to make to get my clients property back and to see the westland documents all i want is cooperation a friendly giveandtake on discovery i want it to start flowing now not later i dont want to go to the judge every time i want something im entitled to i could complain to the bar about you good we can make crosscomplaints theyll investigate both of us and find that only you acted inappropriately by discussing the case with defense counsels exwife and daughter i didnt discuss it with your daughter she was just there im sure the bar will make that distinction i let her twist for a moment it was her move but she needed one final push oh and by the way if i file the motion tomorrow ill be sure to drop a dime to the times whos their court reporter salters i think shed find this to be an interesting little side story a nice exclusive she nodded as though her predicament had just become crystal clear in front of her withdraw your motions she said you will have everything you asked for by the end of the day friday tomorrow thats not enough time i have to pull it together and get it copied the copy shop is always backed up then thursday by noon or i file the motion fine asshole good once i go through it all maybe we can start talking about a plea thank you andy fuck you haller and there isnt going to be a plea weve got her nailed and im going to be looking at you not her when the verdict comes in she pivoted and started to walk away but then turned right back to me and dont call me andy you dont get to call me that she marched away then moving in long angry strides toward the elevator lobby totally ignoring a reporter who trotted up to her and tried to get a quote i knew there would be no plea agreement my client wouldnt allow it but i gave freeman the opening so she could throw it back in my face i wanted her to go away angry but not that angry i wanted her to think she had salvaged something it would make her easier to deal with i looked around and saw lisa waiting dutifully on the bench i had earlier pointed her to i signaled her to get up okay lisa lets get out of here but what about herb i drove in with him your car or his his then hes fine my guy will drive you home we walked into the elevator alcove thankfully andrea freeman had already caught a ride down to the das office on the second floor i pushed the button but the elevator didnt come soon enough we were joined by dahl what were you leaving without me i didnt respond to his question and quickly dispensed with any guise of civility you know youre fucking me up by talking to the media like that you think youre helping the cause but youre notunless herbert dahl is the cause whoa whats with the language were in a courthouse i dont care where we are do not speak for my client do you understand if you do it again im going to call a press conference and youre not going to like what i have to say about you fine that was it my last press conference but now i got a question whats goin on with all these people ive been sending your way some of them called me back and said they were treated pretty rudely by your staff yeah you keep sending them and well keep treating them that way hey i know the business and these are legitimate people the grind side dahl looked confused he looked at lisa and then back at me whats that mean the grind side come on you mean you havent heard of the grind side you mean the blind side the movie about the lady who adopts the football player no i mean the grind side the movie made by one of the producers you sent over to us its about this lady who adopts a football player and then has sex with him three or four times a day then when that gets boring she invites the whole football team over i dont think it made as much money as the blind side lisa was turning pale i got the feeling that what i was saying about dahls hollywood connections wasnt matching up with what dahl had been putting in her ears for weeks yeah this is what hes doing for you lisa these are the kind of people he wants to put you with look dahl said do you have any idea how hard it is to get something going in this town a project there are those who can and those who cant i dont care what the guy made before as long as he can get something going now you understand these are legitimate people and i have a lot of money on the line here haller an elevator finally arrived i directed lisa onto it but then put my hand on dahls chest and slowly pushed him away from the door just back off dahl youll get your money and then some but you just back off i stepped into the elevator and turned to make sure dahl didnt attempt to jump on at the last moment he didnt try it but he didnt move either i held his hateful stare until the doors closed on it nine we moved into our new offices on saturday morning it was a threeroom suite in a building at victory and van nuys boulevards the place was even called the victory building which i liked it was also fully furnished and only two blocks from the courthouse where lisa trammel would face trial all hands were on deck to help with the move including rojas who wore a tshirt and baggies showing off the tattoos that completely covered his arms and legs i didnt know which was more shocking seeing the tattoos or seeing rojas in anything other than the suit he always wore while driving me the setup in the new place was that i got my own office while cisco and aronson shared the other larger office and lorna anchored the reception area in between going from the backseat of a lincoln to an office with tenfoot ceilings a full desk and a nap couch was a big change the first thing i did upon settling in was to use the open space and polished wood floor to spread out the eighthundredplus pages of discovery documents i had received from andrea freeman most of it was from westland and a lot of it was filler it was freemans passiveaggressive response to being maneuvered by the defense there were dozens of pages and packets on bank policy and procedures and other forms i didnt need these all went into one pile there were also copies of all communications that went directly to lisa trammel most of which i already had and was familiar with these went into a second pile and finally there were copies of internal bank communications as well as communications between the victim mitchell bondurant and the outside company the bank used to carry out its foreclosures this company was called aloft and i was already quite familiar with it because it was my adversary on at least a third of my foreclosure cases aloft was a mill a company that filed and tracked all documents required in the lengthy foreclosure process it was a gobetween that allowed bankers and other lenders to keep their hands clean in the dirty business of taking peoples homes away from them companies like aloft got the job done without the banks so much as having to send a letter to the customer faced with foreclosure it was this stack of correspondence that i was most interested in and it was here that i found the document that would change the course of the case i moved behind my desk sat down and studied the phone there were more buttons on it than i would ever have use for i finally found the intercom button for the other office and pushed it hello nothing i pushed it again cisco bullocks are you there nothing i got up and started toward the door intent on communicating with my staff the oldfashioned way when a response finally came over the phones speaker mickey is that you it was ciscos voice i hurried back to the desk and pushed the button yeah its me can you come in here and bring bullocks roger and out a few minutes later my investigator and associate counsel entered hey boss cisco asked looking at the stacks of documents on the floor the point of the office is to put stuff in drawers and file cabinets and up on shelves ill get around to it i said shut the door and have a seat once we were all in place i looked at them across my big rented desk and laughed this is weird i said i could get used to it having an office cisco said but bullocks doesnt know from nothing yes i do aronson protested last summer i interned at shandler massey and ortiz and i had my own office well maybe next time you get your own with us i said so now down to business cisco did you get the laptop to your guy yeah dropped it off yesterday morning i told him it was a rush job we were talking about lisas laptop which had been returned by the das office along with her cell phone and the four boxes of documents and hes going to be able to tell us what the da was looking at he said hell be able to provide a list of the files they opened and how long they were opened from that we should be able to get an idea of what they paid attention to but dont get your hopes up why because freeman gave in on this way too easily i dont think she wouldve given us back the computer if it was that important to her maybe neither he nor aronson was aware of the deal i made with freeman or the leverage i had used i turned my attention to aronson after she completed the motions to suppress earlier in the week i had put her on backgrounding the victim this came after cisco had picked up some preliminary indications in his investigations that all was not well in mitchell bondurants personal world bullocks whatve you got on our victim well theres still a lot i need to check out but theres no doubt that he was heading over the falls financially that is how so well when the going was good and the financing came easy he was a definite player in the real estate market between ohtwo and ohseven he bought and flipped twentyone properties mostly residential real estate made good money and plowed it back into bigger deals then the economy tanked and he was caught holding the bag he was upsidedown exactly at the time of his death he owned five large properties that suddenly werent worth what he paid for them it looks like he had been trying to sell them for more than a year no takers and three of them had balloons that were going to pop this year it added up to over two million dollars he would owe i stood up and came around the desk i started pacing aronsons report was exciting i didnt know exactly how it fit in but i was confident i could make it fit we just had to talk it out okay so bondurant the senior vice president in charge of the home loan side of westland was falling victim to the same sort of situation as many of the people he was foreclosing on when the money was flowing he took mortgages with fiveyear balloon notes thinking like everybody else that hed turn the properties over or remortgage long before the five years were up except the economy goes into the toilet aronson said he cant sell them and he cant remortgage them because they arent worth what he paid for them no bank would touch his paper not even his own aronson had a glum look on her face this is all good work bullocks whats wrong well im just wondering what all this has to do with the murder maybe nothing maybe everything i went back to the desk and sat down i handed her the threepage document i had found in the volumes the prosecution had provided she took it and held it so she and cisco could both look at it whats this she asked i think its our smoking gun i forgot my glasses in the other office cisco said read it bullocks its a copy of a certified letter from bondurant to louis opparizio at a louis opparizio financial technologies or aloft for short it says dear louis attached you will find correspondence from an attorney named michael haller who is representing the home owner in one of the foreclosure cases you are handling for westland it gives lisas name loan number and the address of the house then it goes in his letter mr haller makes allegations that the file is replete with fraudulent actions perpetrated in the case you will note that he gives specific instances all of which were carried out by aloft as you know and we have discussed there have been other complaints these new allegations against aloft if true have put westland in a vulnerable position especially considering the governments recent interest in this aspect of the mortgage business unless we come to some sort of arrangement and understanding in regard to this i will be recommending to the board that westland withdraw from its contract with your company for cause and any ongoing business be terminated this action would also require the bank to file an sar with appropriate authorities please contact me at your earliest convenience to further discuss these matters thats it a copy of your original letter is attached and a copy of the return card from the post office the letter was signed for by someone named natalie and i cant read the last name begins with an l i leaned back in my leather executive chair and smiled at them while rolling a paper clip over my fingers like a magician aronson eager to impress jumped in first so bondurant was covering his ass he had to have known what aloft was doing the banks have a winkwink relationship with all these foreclosure mills they dont care how its done they just want it done but by sending this letter he was distancing himself from aloft and the underhanded practices i shrugged as if to say maybe arrangement and understanding i said they both looked at me blankly thats what he said in the letter unless we come to some sort of arrangement and understanding okay whats it mean aronson asked read between the lines i dont think he was distancing himself i think the letter was a threat i think it means he wanted a piece of alofts action he wanted in and he was covering his ass yes by sending the letter but i think there was another message he wanted some of the action or he was going to take it away from opparizio he was even threatening to file an sar what exactly is an sar aronson asked suspicious activity report cisco said a routine form the banks file them over anything with who federal trade fbi secret service whoever they want to really i could tell i had not sold them on anything yet do you have any idea what sort of money aloft is raking in i asked its easily involved in a third of our cases i know its unscientific but if you take that out across the board and alofts got a third of the cases in la county then you are talking about millions and millions in fees from this one county they say that in california alone there will be three million foreclosures before this plays out over the next few years plus theres the acquisition what acquisition aronson asked you gotta read the papers opparizio is in the process of selling aloft to a big investment fund a company called lemure its publicly traded and any sort of controversy regarding one of its satellite acquisitions could affect the deal as well as the stock price so dont kid yourself if bondurant was desperate enough he could make some waves he may have made more than he was counting on cisco nodded the first to tumble to my theory okay so we have bondurant facing personal financial disaster he said three balloons about to pop so he turns around and tries to muscle in on opparizio the lemure deal and the whole foreclosure gravy train and it gets him killed thats right cisco was sold i now swiveled in my chair so that i was looking directly at aronson i dont know she said its a big jump and its going to be hard to prove who says we have to prove it we just have to figure out how to get it before the jury the reality was we didnt need to prove a damn thing we only had to suggest it and let a jury do the rest i just had to plant the seeds of reasonable doubt to build the hypothesis of innocence i leaned forward across my big wooden desk and looked at my team this is our defense theory opparizio is our straw man hes the guy we paint as guilty the jury points the finger at him and our client walks i looked at both their faces and got no reaction i kept going cisco i want you to focus on louis opparizio and his company get me everything thats out there history known associates everything all the details of the merger i want to know more about that deal and this guy than even he knows by the end of next week i want to subpoena records from aloft theyll fight it but it ought to stir things up a bit aronson shook her head but wait a minute she said are you saying this is all bullshit just a defense gambit and this guy opparizio didnt really do it what if were right about opparizio and theyre wrong about lisa trammel what if shes innocent she looked at me with eyes full of naive hope i smiled and looked at cisco tell her my investigator turned to face my young associate kid youre new at this so you get a pass but we never ask that question it doesnt matter if our clients are guilty or innocent they all get the same bang for the buck yes but there are no buts i said we are talking about avenues of defense here ways to provide our client with the best defense possible these are strategies we will follow regardless of guilt or innocence you want to do criminal defense this is what you have to understand you never ask your client if he did it yes or no the answer is only a distraction so you dont need to know she tightened her lips into a thin straight line how are you on tennyson i asked the charge of the light brigade what does theirs not to reason why theirs but to do or die were the light brigade bullocks we go up against an army that has more people more weapons more everything most of the time it amounts to little more than a suicide run no chance of survival no chance of winning but sometimes you get a case where you have a shot it might be a long shot but its a shot nonetheless so you take it you charge and you dont ask questions like that actually i think its do and die that was the point of the poem they didnt have the choice to do or die they had to do and die so you know your tennyson i like do or die better the point is did lisa trammel kill mitchell bondurant i really dont know she says she didnt and thats good enough for me if its not good enough for you then ill take you off this one and put you back on foreclosures fulltime no aronson said quickly i want to stay im in thats good not many lawyers get to sit second chair on a murder case ten months out of law school she looked at me eyes wide second chair i nodded you deserve it youve done some really good work on this but the light quickly faded what i just dont know why you cant have it both ways you know give unbridled effort in your defense but be conscientious about your work try for the best outcome the best outcome for who your client society or for yourself your responsibility is to your client and the law bullocks thats it i gave her a long stare before continuing dont go growing a conscience on me i said ive been down that road it doesnt lead you to anything good ten after spending most of the day setting up the office i didnt get home till almost eight i found my exwife sitting on the steps leading up to the front deck our daughter wasnt with her in the past year there had been several encounters between us that did not include hayley and i was thrilled by the prospect of another i was dogtired from the days mental and physical work but i could easily rally for maggie mcfierce hey mags you forget the key she got up and just from her stiff posture and the way she dusted off the backside of her jeans all businesslike i knew something wasnt right when i got to the top step i moved in for a kissjust on the cheek but she immediately made an evasive maneuver and my suspicion was confirmed thats where hayley gets it i said the old duck and roll when i give her a kiss well im not here for that haller i didnt use my key because i thought you might consider it some sort of conflict of interest if you found a prosecutor in your house now i got it yoga today you saw andrea freeman thats right suddenly i didnt feel the strength to rally anymore i unlocked the door like a prisoner punished with the indignity of letting himself into the room where they give you the needle come on in i guess well get this over with she came in quickly my last comment throwing another log on her fire what you did was despicable using our daughter in such an underhanded way i wheeled around on her using our daughter i did no such thing our daughter was put in the middle of this thing and i learned of it only by accident it doesnt matter youre disgusting no im a defense lawyer and your good pal andy was discussing me and my case with my exwife in front of my daughter and then she outright lied to me what are you talking about she doesnt lie im not talking about hayley im talking about andy i asked her on the first day she was on the case if she knew you and she said she knew you only in passing i think we can agree that that is not the case and i dont know for sure but i would guess that if we described this situation to ten different judges that maybe ten would consider it a conflict look we werent discussing you or the case it came up when we were having lunch hayley happened to be there what am i supposed to do disavow my friends because of you it doesnt work that way if it was no big deal why did she lie to me it wasnt a direct lie its not like were best friends or anything besides she probably didnt want you to get into it like you have anyway so now were qualifying lies on a sliding scale some are indirect and no big deal dont worry about those lies haller dont be an asshole look you want something to drink i dont want anything i came to tell you that you not only embarrassed me and your daughter but yourself it was low haller you used something innocent from your own daughter to get an edge it was really low i was still holding my briefcase i put it down on the table in the dining alcove i put my hands on the top of one of the chairs and leaned down on it as i thought out my comeback come on maggie said baiting me you always have a quick answer for everything the great defender lets hear it this time i laughed and shook my head she was so damn beautiful when she was mad it was disarming and the bad part was i think she knew it oh so this is funny you threaten to ruin someones career and then can laugh about it i didnt threaten to ruin her career i threatened to kick her off the case and no its not funny its just that what haller its just that what ive been sitting out there for two hours wondering if you were going to show up because i want to know how you could do this i stepped away from the table and went on the offensive moving toward her as i spoke making her step back and then crowding her into a corner ending my words with my finger pointing inches from her chest i did it because im a defense attorney and as a defense attorney i have taken an oath to defend my clients to the best of my ability so yes i saw an advantage here your good pal andyand youclearly crossed a line sure no harm was doneas far as i know but that doesnt mean the line wasnt crossed if you jump a fence with a sign on it that says no trespassing then you are still trespassing even if you jump right back across so i became aware of this trespass and i used it to my advantage to get something i need to defend my client something i shouldve been given as a matter of course but which your friend was holding back simply because she could was she within the rules yes was it fair no and one reason you are all hot and bothered about it is that you know it wasnt fair and that i made the right move it was something you would have done yourself never in a million years i would never stoop so low bullshit i turned away from her she stayed in the corner what are you doing here maggie what do you mean i just told you why im here yeah but you couldve picked up a phone or sent me an email why did you come here i wanted to see your face when you gave an explanation i turned back to her this whole thing was a sideshow i moved in on her and put my hand on the wall right next to her head it was bullshit arguments like this that wrecked our marriage i said i know you know its been eight years weve been divorced as long as we were married eight years and i still couldnt shake her eight years and here we are yes here we are you know youre the trespasser haller you jump over everybodys fences come in and out of our lives whenever you want and we just let you i slowly leaned in closer until we were breathing the same air i kissed her lightly and then harder when she tried to say something i didnt want to hear any more words i was finished with words part twothe hypothesis of innocence eleven the office was closed and locked for the evening but i was still in place at my desk prepping for the preliminary hearing it was a tuesday in early march and i wished i could have opened a window to let in the cool evening breeze but the office was hermetically sealed with vertical windows that did not open lorna hadnt noticed that when shed inspected the place and signed the lease it made me miss working out of the backseat of the lincoln where i could slide a window down and catch the breeze whenever i wanted the preliminary hearing was a week away by prepping i mean i was trying to anticipate what my opponent andrea freeman would be willing to part with when she put her case before the judge a preliminary hearing is a routine step on the way to a trial it is one hundred percent the prosecutions show the state is charged with presenting its case to the court and the judge then rules on whether there is sufficient evidence to take it forward to a jury trial this isnt the reasonable doubt threshold not even close the judge only has to decide if a preponderance of the evidence supports the charges if so then the next stop is a fullblown trial the trick for freeman would be to parcel out just enough evidence to cross that preponderance line and get the judges nod of approval without giving away the whole store because she knew that i would be going to school on whatever she presented there is no doubt that the prosecutions burden is no burden at all though the idea of a preliminary hearing is to provide a check on the system and to make sure the government does not run roughshod over the individual it is still a fixed game the california state assembly saw to that frustrated by the seemingly interminable duration of criminal cases as they slowly wound through the justice system the politicians in sacramento took action the prevailing view was that justice delayed was justice denied never mind that this sentiment conflicted with a basic component of the adversarial systema strong and vigorous defense the assembly sidestepped that minor inconvenience and voted for change installing measures that streamlined the process the preliminary hearing went from a full airing of the prosecutions evidence to what is essentially a game of hideandseek few witnesses had to be called besides the lead investigator hearsay was approved rather than discouraged and the prosecution need not offer even half of its evidence just enough to get by the result was that it was beyond rare that a case did not measure up to the level of preponderance and the preliminary hearing became a routine rubberstamping of the charges on the way to trial still there was a value for the defense in the proceedings i still got a peek at what was to come and an opportunity to raise questions about what witnesses and evidence were presented and therein was the prep work i needed to anticipate which cards freeman would show and decide how i would play against them we were way past any notion of a plea agreement freeman still wasnt giving on that end and my client still wasnt taking we were on a direct course toward a trial in april or may and i cant say i was unhappy about it we had a legitimate shot and if lisa trammel wanted to go for it i was going to be ready in recent weeks we had gotten some good news as well as bad on the evidence front as expected judge morales ruled against our motions to suppress the police interview and the search of lisas home this cleared the way for the prosecution to build its case around the pillars of motivation opportunity and the single eyewitness account they had the foreclosure action they had lisas history of protest against the bank they had her incriminating admissions during her interview and most of all they had the eyewitness margo schafer who claimed to have seen lisa just a block from the bank and only minutes after the killing but we were building a defense case that attacked these pillars and contained much evidence that was indeed exculpatory no murder weapon had been identified or found yet and the states zeal to prove that a tiny blemish of blood found on a pipe wrench taken from the tool bench in lisas garage had backfired when testing concluded it was not mitchell bondurants blood of course the prosecution would not bring this up at the preliminary hearing or the trial but i could and would it is the defenses job to take the miscues and mistakes of the investigation and ram them down the states throat i would not hold back additionally my investigator had gathered information that would put into question the observations of the states key witness even though we would not get that shot until trial and we also had the hypothesis of innocence the alternate theory was building nicely we had served subpoenas on louis opparizio and his company aloft the foreclosure mill at the center of the defense strategy i anticipated that no defense tactics or evidence would come up during the preliminary hearing freeman would put detective kurlen on the stand and he would walk the judge through the entire case making sure to sidestep any weaknesses in the evidence she would also put on the medical examiner and possibly a forensic analyst schafer the witness was the only question my first thought was that freeman would hold her back she could rely on kurlen to present information from his interview with her thereby bringing out what schafer would eventually testify to at trial no more was needed for a prelim on the other hand freeman might put schafer on the stand in a bid to see what i had if i revealed during crossexamination how i planned to handle the witness it would help freeman prepare for what was ahead at trial it was all strategy and games at this point and i had to admit it was the best part of a trial the moves made outside the courtroom were always more significant than those made inside the inside moves were all prepped and choreographed i preferred the improvisation done away from the courtroom i was underlining the name schafer on my legal pad when i heard the phone ring in the reception area i could have taken it on my set but didnt bother it was well after hours and i knew the number on the phonebook ad had been forwarded to the new office number anybody calling this late was probably looking for foreclosure advice they could leave a message i pulled the blood analysis file to front and center on the desk it contained the dna comparison report that had been run on blood extracted from a crevice in the handle of the pipe wrench from lisas tool bench it had been a rush job the prosecution popping for an expensive analysis from an outside firm rather than wait for the regional lab to do it i imagined the disappointment freeman must have felt when the report came in negative not mitchell bondurants blood not only was it a setback for the prosecutiona match would have killed any chance lisa had at an acquittal and forced her into a plea agreement but now freeman knew i could wave the report in front of the jury and say see their case is full of wrong turns and wrong evidence we also scored when footage from video cameras in the bank building and garage entrance failed to show lisa trammel during the time before and after the killing the cameras did not cover the entire facility but that was beside the point it was exculpatory evidence now my cell phone started to vibrate i pulled it out of my pocket and looked at the id it was my agent joel gotler calling i hesitated but then took the call youre working late i said by way of answering yeah dont you read your emails gotler said ive been trying to reach you sorry my computers right here but ive been busy whats going on weve got a big problem do you read deadline hollywood no whats that its a blog look it up on your computer now yeah now do it i closed the blood file and slid it aside i pulled my laptop over and opened it i went online and navigated to the deadline hollywood site i started scrolling it looked like a list of short reports on hollywood deals box office estimates and studio comings and goings who bought and sold what who left what agency who was going down and who was going up that sort of thing okay what am i looking for here scroll down to three fortyfive this afternoon the posts on the blog were timestamped i did as instructed and came to the late afternoon post gotler wanted me to see the headline alone kicked me in the nuts archway grabs reallife murder mystery dahlmcreynolds to produce sources tell me that archway pictures has anted up six figures against a sevenfigure backend to acquire rights to the foreclosurerevenge case currently twisting its way through the justice system here in lalaland the accused lisa trammel was represented by herb dahl in the deal and he will produce alongside archways clegg mcreynolds the multitiered deal includes tv and documentary rights the ending of the story however has yet to be written as trammel still faces trial in the murder of the banker who was trying to foreclose on her house in a press release mcreynolds said trammels story will be used to put a magnifying glass on the foreclosure epidemic that has swept across the country in recent years she is expected to go to trial in two months that motherfucker i said yeah thats about right gotler said what the hell is going on im out there trying to sell this thing and was very close to a deal with lakeshore and then i read this are you kidding me haller you stab me in the back like this look i dont know exactly what is going on here but i have a contract with lisa trammel and do you know this guy dahl i do and hes a complete sleaze i know i know he tried to make a move and i shut his ass down he got lisa to sign something but ah jeez she signed with this guy no i mean yes but after she signed with me i have a contract i have first po i stopped right there the contracts i remembered making copies and giving them to dahl i then put the originals back in the file in the trunk of the lincoln dahl saw the whole thing son of a bitch what is it i looked at the stack of files on the corner of my desk they had all been generated by the lisa trammel case but i had not brought in the files from the trunk of the lincoln because i had been lazy i figured they were all old contracts and old cases and maybe i wasnt sure how i would ultimately like working out of a bricksandmortar office the contracts file was still in the trunk joel ill call you right back hey what is i closed the phone and headed to the door the victory building had its own twolevel garage but it was not attached i had to leave the building and walk to the garage next door i trotted up the ramp and on the second level headed to my car popping the trunk with the remote as i approached my lincoln was the only vehicle left on the upper level i pulled the contracts file and leaned under the light from the trunk lid to look for the agreement lisa trammel had signed it wasnt there to say i was angry was an understatement i shoved the file back into its slot and slammed the lid i pulled my phone and called lisa as i headed back to the ramp the call went to message lisa this is your attorney i thought we agreed that when i called you you would answer no matter what time no matter what you were doing but here i am calling and youre not answering call me back i want to talk to you about your little friend herb and the deal he just made i am sure you are aware of it but what you may not be aware of is that i am going to be suing his ass for this stunt im going to put him under the earth lisa so call me back now i closed the phone and squeezed it as i headed down the ramp i barely noticed the two men walking up the ramp until one of them called to me hey youre that guy right i stopped confused by the question my mind still firmly wrapped around herb dahl and lisa trammel excuse me the lawyer youre the famous lawyer from tv they both moved toward me they were young guys in bomber jackets hands in their pockets i didnt want to stop to make small talk uh no i think youve got the wrong no man thats you i seen you on the tv right i gave up yeah i have a case it gets me on tv right right right and whats your name again mickey haller as soon as i said my name i saw the silent one take his hands out of his jacket pockets and square his shoulders toward me he was wearing black fingerless gloves it wasnt cool enough for gloves and in that moment i realized that since there were no other cars up on the second level these guys hadnt been going up there they had been looking for me whats this all the silent man swung a left fist into my midsection i doubled over just in time to feel his right fist crush three of my left ribs i remembered dropping my phone at that point but little else i know i tried to run but the talker blocked my way and then turned me around pinning my elbows at my sides he was wearing black gloves too twelve they left my face alone but that was about the only thing that didnt feel bruised or broken when i woke up in icu at holy cross the final tally included thirtyeight stitches in my scalp nine fractured ribs four broken fingers two bruised kidneys and one testicle that had been twisted degrees before the surgeons straightened it my torso was the color of a grape popsicle and my urine the dark hue of cocacola the last time i had stayed in a hospital i got hooked on oxycodone an addiction that nearly cost me my child and career this time i told them id gut it out without the chemical help and this of course was a painful mistake two hours after taking my stand i was pleading with the nurses the orderlies and anyone who would listen to give me the drip it finally took care of the pain but left me floating too close to the ceiling it took them a couple days to find the right equilibrium of pain relief and consciousness that was when i started accepting visitors two of the first were a pair of detectives from the van nuys division caps unit their names were stilwell and eyman they asked me basic questions so that they could complete their paperwork they had about as much interest in determining who had attacked me as they did in the idea of working through lunch i was after all the defense counsel to an alleged murderer their colleagues down the hall had popped in other words they werent going to get their own balls in a twist over this one when stilwell closed his notebook i knew the interviewand the investigationwas over he told me they would check back if anything came up you forgot something didnt you i said i spoke without moving my jaw because somehow moving my jaw set off the pain receptors in my rib cage whats that stilwell asked you never asked me to describe my attackers you didnt even ask what color they were we can get all of that on our next visit the doctor told us you need your rest you want to make an appointment for the next visit neither detective answered they wouldnt be coming back i didnt think so i said goodbye detectives im glad the crimes against persons unit is on this makes me feel safe look stilwell said likely this was a random thing two muggers looking for an easy mark the chances of us they knew who i was you said they recognized you from the tv and the newspapers i didnt say that i said they recognized me and made it appear as though it was from tv or something if you really cared about this you wouldve made that distinction are you accusing us of not caring about a random act of violence in this community pretty much yeah and who says it was random you said you didnt know or recognize the assailants so unless you are changing your mind about that there is no evidence that this was anything other than a random act or at best a lawyer hate crime they recognized you and didnt like that you defend murderers and scumbags and decided to relieve their frustrations on your body couldve been a lot of things my entire body throbbed with pain ignited by their indifference but i was also tired and wanted them gone never mind detectives i said go on back to crimes against persons and fill out your paperwork you can forget about this one ill take it from here i closed my eyes on them then it was the only thing i could do the next time my lids came open i saw cisco sitting in a chair in the corner of the room staring at me hey boss he said gently as if his usual booming voice might hurt me hows it hanging i coughed as i came fully awake and that set off a paroxysm of pain in my testicles feels like its still about a hundred eighty degrees to the left he smiled because he thought i was delirious but i was lucid enough to know that this was his second visit and that i had asked him to do some sleuthing when he had come the first time what time is it im losing track sleeping so much ten after ten thursday no friday morning mick id been sleeping more than i realized i tried to sit up but the movement set off a burning wave of pain across my left side jesus christ you okay boss whadaya got for me cisco he stood up and came to the side of the bed not a whole lot but im still working it out i got a look at the police report however not a lot there but it did say that you were found by the night cleaning crew that came in about nine oclock to work in the building they found you out cold on the garage ramp and called it in nine oclock wasnt too long after did they see anything else no they didnt according to the report i plan to be there tonight to interview them myself good what about the office me and lorna checked as best we could it doesnt look like anybody was in there nothing missing as far as we can tell and it was left unlocked the whole night i think you were the target mick not the office the medication drip worked on a regulated feed system that parceled out the sweet juice of relief according to impulses sent from a computer in another room and programmed by someone i had never met but at that moment that computer nerd was my hero i felt the cold trickle of a boost moving through my arm and into my chest i was silent as i waited for my screaming nerve endings to be calmed what are you thinking mick my minds a blank i told you i didnt recognize them im not talking about them im talking about who sent them whats your gut tell you opparizio it would certainly be the choice he knows were coming for him i mean who else what about dahl i shook my head what for he already stole my contract and made the deal why beat me up after maybe just to slow you down maybe to add intrigue to the project this adds another dimension its part of the story seems like a stretch i like opparizio better but why would he do it same thing to slow me down warn me off he doesnt want to be a witness and he doesnt want to be dragged through the shit he knows i have on him cisco shrugged still not sure im buying it well whoever it was doesnt matter this isnt going to slow me down what exactly are you going to do about dahl he stole the contract im working on it ill have a plan for that douche bag by the time i get out of here whens that supposed to be theyre waiting to see if im healing all right if not they might take off my left nut cisco cringed as though i was talking about his left nut yeah i try not to think about it i said okay then moving on what about the two men ive got two white guys early thirties leather bomber jackets and gloves you remember anything else this time nope no regional or foreign accents not that i can remember scars limps or tattoos none that i remember it went down pretty quick i know you think you could pick them out of a sixpack he was talking about a photo spread of mug shots one of them i could the one who did all the talking i didnt look at the other one too much once he hit me i wasnt seeing anything right well ill keep working on it what else cisco im getting tired i closed my eyes to accentuate the point well i was supposed to call maggie as soon as you were awake her timings been off every time shes been in here with hayley youve been out you can call her just tell her to wake me up if im asleep i want to see my kid okay ill tell her to bring her after school meantime bullocks wants to bring by the motion for a continuance for your approval and signature before filing it by the end of the day i opened my eyes cisco had moved to the other side of the bed what continuance for the prelim shes going to ask the judge to put it back a few weeks in light of your hospitalization no mick its friday the prelims tuesday even if they let you out of here by then youre not going to be in any kind of condition to she can handle it who bullocks yes shes good she can handle it shes good but green are you sure you want somebody just out of law school handling a prelim for a murder trial its a prelim trammels going to be bound over for trial whether im there or not the best we can hope for is a little peek at the prosecutions case strategy and aronson will be able to report back on that you think the judge is going to allow it he might see it as a move to set up an ineffectivecounsel beef if theres ultimately a conviction if lisa signs off on it well be okay ill call her and tell her its part of the case strategy bullocks can spend some time here with me over the weekend and ill prep her but what is the case strategy mick why not just wait till youre healthy because i want them to think they succeeded who opparizio whoever did this to me let them think im incapacitated or running scared whatever aronson handles the prelim and then we push this thing to trial cisco nodded got it good you go now and call maggie tell her to wake me up no matter what the nurses say especially if she comes with hayley will do boss but uh theres one more thing what rojas is sitting out there in the waiting room he wanted to visit but i told him to wait out there he came yesterday too but you were sleeping i nodded rojas did you check the cars trunk i did i didnt see any evidence of a pick no scratches on the tumblers okay when you go out send him in you want to see him alone yeah alone you got it he left then and i grabbed the beds remote i slowly and painfully raised the bed to about fortyfive degrees so i was half sitting up for my next visitor the adjustment ignited another run of searing pain that burned across my rib cage like an august brushfire rojas tentatively entered the room waving and nodding at me hey mr haller how you doin ive had better days rojas how are you doing im good im good i just wanted to stop by and say hello and all he was as nervous as a feral cat and i thought i knew why it was nice of you to come by why dont you sit in that chair over there okay he took the chair in the corner this allowed me a full view of him i would be able to pick up all body movements as i tried to read him he was already displaying some of the classic tells of a dissembleravoidance of eye contact inappropriate smiling constant hand movement did the doctors tell you how long you have to stay here he asked a few more days i think at least until i stop pissing blood man thats bad shit they going to catch who did it they dont seem to be working too hard on it rojas nodded i said nothing else silence is often a very useful interview tool my driver then rubbed his palms up and down his thighs a few times and stood up well i didnt want to interrupt you you probably have to get your sleep or something no im up for the day rojas it hurts too much to sleep you can stay whats the hurry youre not driving somebody else now are you oh no no nothing like that he reluctantly sat down again rojas had been a client before he was my driver hed been popped on a possessionofstolenproperty beef and had a prior conviction to go with it the prosecution wanted jail time but i was able to get him probation he owed me three grand for my efforts but had lost his job since his employer was also the victim of the theft i told him he could work it off by driving and translating for me and he took the job i started out paying him a week and counted an additional against the debt after three months the debt was cleared but he stayed on collecting the whole now i thought he was happy and on the straight and narrow path but maybe once a thief always a thief i just want you to know mr haller that once you get out of here im on call for you twentyfour hours a day i dont want you driving nowhere if you even have to go down the hill to the starbucks ill be there to take you thank you rojas after all i guess its the least you can do right uh he looked confused but not that confused he knew where this was headed i decided not to dance around it any longer how much did he pay you he fidgeted in the seat who for what come on rojas dont play it this way its embarrassing i really dont know what youre talking about maybe i should go after all he stood up we dont have an agreement rojas we dont have a contract no verbal promises nothing you walk out of this room and i fire you and thats it is that what you want here doesnt matter if theres an agreement you cant just fire me for no reason but i have the reason rojas herb dahl told me all about it you should know theres no honor among thieves he said you called him up and told him youd get him whatever he needs the bluff worked i saw the rage explode in rojass eyes i had my finger on the nursecall button just in case that greasy little shit eater i nodded good description how i didnt call his ass up the fucker came to me he said he just wanted fifteen seconds in the trunk i shoulda known this would blow up on me i thought you were smarter than that rojas how much did he pay you four bills not even a weeks pay and now youre not going to have any pay rojas came close to the bedside i held my finger on the call button i figured he was going to either attack me or ask me for a deal mr haller i need this job my kids this is like last time rojas didnt you learn a lesson about ripping off your employer yes sir i did dahl told me he just wanted to look at something but then he took it and when i tried to stop him he said what are you going to do about it he had me i couldnt stop him you still have the four hundred yes i didnt spend a thing four hundreddollar bills and they looked real to me i pointed him back to the chair i didnt want him so close okay time to make a choice rojas you can walk out that door with your four hundred and ill never see you again or i can give you a second i want the second chance please im sorry well youre going to have to earn it youre going to have to help me make right what you did i am going to sue dahl for taking that document and i am going to need you to be the witness who explains exactly what happened ill do it but who will believe me thats where your four hundreddollar bills come in i want you to go home or to wherever they are and i have them right here in my wallet he jumped up from the seat and pulled his wallet take them out like this i held my finger and thumb close together they can get fingerprints off money they sure can and if we can get dahls off those then it doesnt matter what he says about you hes nailed i opened a drawer of the little table to the side of my bed a plastic ziploc bag containing my wallet and keys and loose change and currency was there it had all been bagged by the paramedics who had been called to the garage of the victory building cisco had secured it and had only just given it back i dumped the contents into the drawer and then handed the bag to rojas okay put the money in there and seal it he did as instructed and then i waved him over to give me the bag the hundreds looked crisp and new less prior handling of the currency would mean a better shot at pulling prints cisco will take it from here ill call him and tell him to come back and pick these up at some point hell need your prints uh rojass eyes were on the bag and the money what will i get that money back i put the bag in the drawer and slammed it shut jesus christ rojas get out of here before i change my mind and fire your ass okay okay im sorry you know youre sorry you got caught and thats all just go i cant believe i just gave you a second chance i must be a fucking idiot rojas retreated like a dog with its tail between its legs after he was gone i slowly lowered the bed and tried not to think about his betrayal or who had sent the two men in black gloves or anything else to do with the case i looked up at the bag of clear liquid hanging up there overhead and waited for the blessed boost that would make at least some of the pain go away thirteen as expected lisa trammel was held to answer and ordered to stand trial for murder by judge dario morales at the end of a daylong preliminary hearing in van nuys superior court using detective howard kurlen as her primary carrier of evidence prosecutor andrea freeman deftly presented a net of circumstantial evidence that quickly enclosed lisa freeman took the case across the preponderance threshold like a hundredmeter sprinter and the judge was equally swift in rendering his ruling it was routine matteroffact chopchop and lisa was held to answer my client was there at the defense table for the hearing but i was not jennifer aronson held forth for the defense as best she could in a onesided game the judge had allowed the hearing to proceed only after questioning lisa exhaustively to assure himself that her decision to go forward without me there was knowing voluntary and strategic lisa acknowledged in open court that she was aware of aronsons lack of courtroom experience and waived any claim to the argument of ineffective counsel as grounds for an appeal of the judges eventual determination i watched most of it from the confines of my home where i was continuing to recover from my injuries ktla channel had carried the morning session live in lieu of other local programming before flipping back to the usual slate of insipid afternoon talk shows this meant i missed only the last two hours of the hearing but that was okay because by that point i knew how it would go there were no surprises and the only disappointment was in not getting any sort of new read on how the prosecution would unfurl the flag at trial when it all counted as decided during our prep sessions in my room at holy cross aronson presented no witnesses or any affirmative defense we chose to reserve any indication of our hypothesis of innocence for trial when the threshold of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt raised the game to almost an even match aronson used crossexamination of the states witnesses sparingly these were all seasoned veterans of courtroom testimonykurlen a forensic expert and the medical examiner among them freeman chose not to put margo schafer on the stand using kurlen to recount his interview with the eyewitness who placed lisa trammel a block from the murder there wasnt much to get from the states lineup and so our strategy was to observe and wait to bide our time we would simply go at them at trial where we stood the best chance at the end of the hearing lisa was ordered to stand trial before judge coleman perry on the sixth floor of the courthouse perry was yet another judge i had never stood before but since i knew his courtroom was one of four possible destinations for my client i had done some checking with other members of the defense bar the overall report i got was that perry was a straight shooter with a short temper he was fair until you crossed him and then he was prone to hold a grudge that might last an entire trial it was good knowledge to have as the case progressed to its final stage two days later i finally felt ready to return to the fray my broken fingers were bound tightly in a formfitted plaster cast and my bruised torso was losing the shadings of deep blue and purple for a sickly tone of yellow my scalp stitches had been removed and i was able to delicately comb my hair back over the shaved wound as if i was hiding a bald spot best of all my formerly twisted testicle which the doctor had ultimately chosen not to remove was improving a little bit every day according to the doctor and his powers of observation and palpation it was left to see whether it would resume normal activity and function or die on the vine like an unpicked roma tomato by previous arrangement rojas had the lincoln at the bottom of the front steps at eleven oclock sharp i slowly made my way down walking cane firmly in hand rojas was there to help me get into the back of the car we moved carefully and soon i was in my usual place ready to roll rojas jumped behind the wheel and we jerked forward and down the hill easy rojas it hurts too much for me to wear a seat belt so dont send me into the front seat sorry boss ill do better where are we going today the office he had gotten that boss stuff from cisco i hated being called a boss even though i knew that was what i was the office is later first we go to archway pictures on melrose you got it archway was a secondtier studio across melrose from one of the behemoths paramount pictures started as a studio lot to handle the overflow demand for soundstages and equipment it grew into a selfsustaining studio under the guidance of the late walter elliot it now made its own slate of films each year and created its own overflow demand coincidentally elliot happened to be a client of mine at one time it took rojas twenty minutes to get from my house above laurel canyon to the studio he pulled up to the security booth at the signature arch that spanned the studios entrance i lowered the window and told the security man who approached me that i was there to see clegg mcreynolds he asked for my name and id and i gave him my drivers license he retreated to the booth and consulted a computer screen he frowned im sorry sir but youre not on the driveon list do you have an appointment no appointment but hell want to see me i hadnt wanted to give mcreynolds too much advance notice well i cant let you in without an appointment can you call him and tell him im here hell want to see me you know who he is right the implication was clear this was one you didnt want to screw up the guard slid the door shut while he made the call to mcreynolds through the glass i saw him talking he had a live one on the line then he slid the door open and extended the phone to me it was on a long cord i took it and then raised the window on the guard tit for tat this is michael haller is this mr mcreynolds no this is mr mcreynoldss personal assistant how can i help you mr haller i see no appointment here in the book and frankly i dont know who you are the voice was female young and confident im the guy who is going to make your bosss life miserable if you dont get him on the line there was a bubble of silence before the voice responded i dont think i like your threatening manner mr mcreynolds is on the set and it was not a threat i dont make threats i just speak the truth wheres the set im not telling you that youre not getting anywhere near clegg until i know what this is about i noted that she was on a firstname basis with the boss a horn blared from behind me the cars were stacking up the guard rapped his knuckles on my window then bent down to try to see in through the smoked glass i ignored him a second horn honked from the rear this is about your saving your boss a lot of grief are you familiar with the deal he announced last week regarding the woman accused of killing the banker foreclosing on her home yes i am well your boss acquired those rights illegally im assuming this was through no fault or knowledge of his own if im right hes the victim of a scam and im here to make it right for him this is a onetime opportunity after this clegg mcreynolds gets pulled down into the quicksand the final threat was punctuated with another long blast from the car directly behind me and a sharp rap on the window talk to the guard i said tell him yea or nay i lowered the window and handed the phone out to the angry guard he held it to his ear whats it going to be ive got a line of cars out to melrose here he listened and then stepped back into his booth and hung up the phone then he looked at me as he pushed the button that opened the gate stage nine he said straight ahead and left at the end you cant miss it i threw him a toldyouso smile as i raised the window and rojas drove under the rising gate stage was a soundstage big enough to house an aircraft carrier it was surrounded by equipment trucks star wagons and craft services vans four stretch limos were parked end to end along one side their engines running and drivers waiting for filming to end and the anointed to exit it looked like a major production but i wasnt going to get the chance to see what it was about walking down the middle of the driveway between buildings and were an older man and a younger woman the woman wore a headset which i assumed made her a pa she pointed a finger at my approaching car okay let me out here rojas stopped and as i was opening the door my phone rang i pulled it and looked at the screen id unavailable it said that on the calls i used to get from my clients in the drug trade they used cheap throwaway phones to avoid wiretaps and record searches i ignored the call and left the phone on the seat you want me to answer your call you gotta tell me who you are i slowly got out leaving the cane behind as well why advertise a weakness my father the great lawyer always said i slowly walked toward the producer and his assistant youre haller the man called out thats me i want you to know that this production you just pulled me out of is running a quarter million dollars an hour they went ahead and shut down inside just so i could come outside to deal with you i appreciate that and ill make it quick good now what the fuck is this about me being scammed nobody scams me i looked at him and waited and said nothing it only took mcreynolds five more seconds to blow another gasket well are you going to tell me or not i dont have all day here i looked at his personal assistant and then back at him he got the message uhuh im going to have a witness to anything thats said here the girl stays i shrugged and pulled a compact recorder out of my pocket and turned it on i held it up its red light glowing then ill make sure i have a record too mcreynolds looked down at the device and i could see the concern in his eyes his voice his words preserved on tape that could be dangerous in a place like hollywood visions of mel gibson danced in his head okay turn that off and jenny goes clegg jenny protested mcreynolds reached down and spanked her hard on the rump i said go humiliated the young woman hurried off like a schoolgirl sometimes you have to treat em that way mcreynolds explained and im sure they learn from it mcreynolds nodded in agreement not picking up on the sarcasm in my voice so again haller whats this about its about you clegg being played for a sucker by herb dahl your partner on the lisa trammel deal mcreynolds emphatically shook his head no way legals all over that deal its squeaky clean even the woman signed off trammel i could make her a threehundredpound whore who likes black dick in the movie and she couldnt do a thing about it that deal is perfect yeah well what legals missed is the part about neither one of them having the rights to the story to sell you in the first place those rights happen to reside here with me trammel signed them over to me before dahl came along and took second position he thought he could move up one by stealing the original contracts out of my files only thats not going to work ive got a witness to the theft and dahls fingerprints hes going to go down on fraud and theft charges and your choice here is to decide whether you want to go down with him clegg are you threatening me is this some sort of shakedown nobody shakes me down no no shakedown i just want whats mine so you can either stick with dahl as your partner or you can have the same deal with me its too late i signed we all signed the deal is done he turned to walk away have you paid him he turned back to me are you kidding this is hollywood and you probably only signed deal memos right thats right contracts in four weeks then your deal is announced but not done thats how you do it in hollywood but if you want to make a change you can if you want to find a deal killer you can i dont want to do any of that i like the project dahl brought it to me i made the deal with him i nodded like i understood his dilemma suit yourself but i go to the police tomorrow morning and file the suit in the afternoon youll be named as a defendant as someone who colluded in the perpetration of the fraud i did no such thing i didnt even know about all of this until you told me thats right i told you and you did nothing you chose to move forward with a thief despite knowing the facts thats collusion and that makes my case i reached into my pocket and pulled the tape recorder out i held it up so he could see the red light was still on im going to tie this movie up so long the girl whose ass you just slapped will be running this place by the time its done this time i walked away and he called me back wait a minute haller i turned around he looked off to the north toward the sign high on the mountain that drew everybody here what do i need to do he asked you need to make the same deal with me ill take care of dahl he deserves something and hell get it i need a phone number to give legal i pulled a card and gave it to him remember i have to hear something today you will by the way what are the numbers on the deal twofifty against a million another quarter to produce i nodded a quarter million dollars up front would certainly fund lisa trammels defense there might even be a piece left over for herb dahl it all depended on how i wanted to handle this and how fair i wanted to be to a thief realistically id have liked to put the guy in the ground but then again he did find the project a legitimate home tell you what im the only guy in town who will ever say this but i dont want to produce you keep that part of the deal with dahl thats his end as long as hes not in jail put a character clause in the contract thatll be something new around here i hope legal can handle it pleasure doing business with you clegg once more i turned and headed back toward my car this time clegg came up alongside me and walked with me well be able to reach you right well need you as a technical advisor especially on the screenplay you have my card i got to the lincoln and rojas had the door open for me once again i carefully slipped in nice and easy on the cojones and then looked back at mcreynolds one more thing the producer said i was thinking of going to matthew mcconaughey with this hed be excellent but who do you think could play you i smiled at him and reached for the door handle youre looking at him clegg i pulled the door closed and through the smoked glass watched the confusion spread on his face i told rojas to head toward van nuys fourteen rojas told me that my phone had been ringing repeatedly while i was talking to mcreynolds i checked it and found no messages i then opened the call record and saw that a total of four calls from a line with an unavailable id had come in during the ten minutes i was out of the car the time intervals were too disparate for it to have been an errant fax call on a repeat dialer someone had been trying to reach me but apparently it wasnt urgent enough to warrant leaving a message i called lorna and told her i was on the way in i filled her in about the deal i had made with mcreynolds and said to expect a call from the archway legal department before the end of the day she was excited about the prospect of money coming in on the case instead of going out only what else andrea freemans called twice i thought about the four calls on my cell you give her my cell i did i think i just missed her but she didnt leave a message something must be up lorna gave me the number andrea had left with her maybe you can reach her if you call right back ill let you go okay but wheres everybody at right now in or out jennifers here in her office and i just heard from cisco hes heading back from some field work what field work he didnt say okay then ill see everybody when i get there i disconnected and called the number for freeman i had not heard from her since id been attacked by the blackgloved boys even kurlen had come by to visit and check on me but not even a getwellsoon card from my worthy opponent now six calls in one morning but no messages i was certainly curious she answered after one ring and got right down to business when can you come in she said id like to float something by you before we hit the gas and go it was her way of saying she was open to the possibility of ending this case with a plea agreement before the whole machinery of a trial started to crank to life i thought you said there wasnt going to be an offer well lets just say cooler heads have prevailed im not stepping back from what i think of your moves on this case but i dont see why your client should pay for your actions something was going on i could sense it some sort of problem with her case had come up a piece of evidence lost or a witness had changed stories i thought of margo schafer maybe there was a problem with the eyewitness after all freeman hadnt trotted her out during the prelim i dont want to come into the das office you can come to my office or we meet on neutral ground im not afraid to enter the enemys camp wheres your office i gave her the address and we agreed to meet in an hour i disconnected the call and tried to zero in on what could have gone wrong with the states case at this point in the game i came back to schafer again it had to be her my phone vibrated in my hand and i looked down at the screen id unavailable freeman was calling me back probably to cancel the meeting and reveal that the whole thing was a charade just another maneuver out of the prosecutorial psychops manual i pushed the button and connected yes silence hello is this michael haller a male voice one i didnt recognize yes who is this jeff trammel for some reason it took me a moment to place the name and then it came through to me big time the prodigal husband jeff trammel yes how are you im good i guess how did you get this number i was talking to lisa this morning i checked in she told me i should call you well im glad you did jeff are you aware of the situation your wife is in yes she told me you didnt see it on the news theres no tv or anything here i cant read spanish where exactly are you jeff id rather not say youd probably tell lisa and id rather she didnt have that information right now will you be coming back for the trial i dont know i dont have any money we could get you some money for travel you could come back here and be with your wife and son during this difficult time you could also testify jeff testify about the house and the bank and all the pressures um no i couldnt i dont want to put myself out like that mr haller my failings that wouldnt feel right not even to save your wife more like my exwife we just havent made it all legal jeff what do you want do you want money there was a long pause now we would get down to it but then he surprised me i dont want anything mr haller are you sure about that i just want to be left out of it its not my life anymore where are you jeff where is your life now im not telling you that i shook my head in frustration i wanted to keep him on the phone like a cop trying for a trace only there was no trace look jeff i hate to bring this up but its my job to cover all the bases you know what i mean and if we lose this case and theres a conviction then lisa will be sentenced there will be a time when her loved ones and her friends will be able to address the court and say good things about her we will be able to bring up what we consider to be mitigating factors her fight to keep the house for example i would want to be able to count on you to come in and testify then you think youre going to lose no i think we have a damn good chance of winning this thing i really do its an entirely circumstantial case with a witness i think we can blow out of the water but i have to be prepared for the opposite result are you sure you cant tell me where you are jeff i can keep it confidential i mean ill need to know where you are if were going to send you money i need to go now what about the money jeff ill call you back jeff he was gone i almost had him rojas sorry boss i put the phone down on the armrest for a moment and looked out to see where we were the through the cahuenga pass i was still another twenty minutes out jeff trammel hadnt said no to the money the last time i mentioned it my next call was to my client when she answered i heard tv noise in the background lisa its mickey we need to talk okay can you turn that tv off oh sure sorry i waited and soon her end was silent okay first of all your husband just called me you gave him my number yes you told me to remember yes thats fine i was just checking it didnt go well it sounds like he wants to stay away thats what he told me did he tell you where he is if i knew that i could send cisco to convince him to help us he wouldnt tell me i think he might still be in mexico he said he had no money he said the same to me he wants me to send him some of the movie money you told him about that theres going to be a movie mickey he should know or maybe she meant that he should have his nose rubbed in it where were you going to send the money he said i could just deposit it in western union and he could access it from any of their offices i knew there were western union offices all over tijuana and points south id sent money to clients before we could send the money and then narrow things down by seeing which office jeff trammel went into to get the cash but if he was smart he wouldnt go to the office closest to where he was living and wed be back to square one okay i said well think about jeff later i also wanted to tell you that the deal herb dahl made with archway has changed how so its with me now i just left archway herb can still produce if they ever make a movie and he gets to stay out of jail so he comes out ahead you come out ahead because your defense team will now be paid for their work and youll get the rest which by the way will be much more than you were ever going to see from herb mickey you cant do that he made that deal i just unmade it lisa clegg mcreynolds wasnt interested in being entangled in the legal net i was about to throw over herbs head you can tell herb or you can have him call me if he wants she was silent theres one more thing and this is important you listening yes im here im going to the office where im going to meet with the prosecutor she called the meeting i think somethings up somethings gone wrong for their side she wants to talk about a deal and she would have never agreed to come to my office if she didnt have to i just wanted you to know ill call you after the meeting no deals mickey unless shes offering to stand on the steps of the courthouse and announce to cnn and fox and all the others that im innocent i felt the car swerve from course and looked out the window rojas was bailing off the freeway early because of traffic well i dont think thats what shes coming over to offer but it is my duty to keep you informed of your choices i dont want you to become some sort of martyr for this this cause of yours you should listen to all offers lisa im not pleading guilty period is there anything else you want to talk about im good for now i will call you later i put the phone down on the armrest enough talk for now i closed my eyes to rest for a few minutes i tried to wiggle my fingers in the plaster and the effort hurt but was successful the doctor who studied the xrays said he believed the damage had occurred when someone stomped on my hand after i was on the ground and already unconscious lucky for me i guess he predicted full recovery for the fingers in the dark world behind my eyelids i saw the men in black gloves moving toward me it played in a repetitive loop i saw the dispassionate look in their eyes as they approached me it was just a piece of business for them nothing else on the line for me it was four decades of confidence and selfesteem shattered like small bones on the pavement after a while i heard rojas from the front seat hey boss were here fifteen as i entered the reception area lorna waved a hand in warning from behind the desk she then pointed toward the door to my office she was telling me that andrea freeman was already in there waiting i made a quick detour to the other office knocked once and opened the door cisco and bullocks were behind their desks i went to ciscos and put my phone down in front of him lisas husband called in fact he called several times unavailable id can you see what you can do he rubbed a finger across his mouth as he considered the request our carrier has a threattrace service i give the exact time of the calls and theyll see what they can find takes a few days but all theyll be able to do is identify the number not the location you need law enforcement if you are going to try to triangulate this guys location i just want the number next time i want to call him instead of the other way around you got it as i turned to leave i looked at aronson bullocks you want to come in and see what the district attorneys office has to say love to we moved through the suite to my office freeman was sitting in a chair in front of my desk reading email on her phone she was in noncourt clothes blue jeans and a pullover sweater it mustve been all inside work today i closed the door and she looked up andrea can i get you something to drink no im fine and you know jennifer from the prelim silent jennifer of course didnt make a peep at the prelim as i came around my desk i checked aronson and saw her face and neck start to color with embarrassment i tried to throw her a line oh she wanted to make a peep or two but she had her orders from me strategy you know jennifer pull that chair over aronson dragged a side chair toward the desk and sat down so here we are i said what brings the das office to my humble place of work well were getting close and i thought you know i figured you work the whole county and might not be as familiar with judge perry as i am thats an understatement ive never even been in front of him well he likes to keep a clean docket he doesnt care about headlines and hoopla hell just want to know that there was a vigorous effort to end this matter through disposition so i thought maybe we could have one more discussion about it before we get down to a fullblown trial one more i dont remember the first discussion do you want to talk about it or not i leaned back and swiveled in my chair as if mulling the question over this was all a little dance and we both knew it freeman wasnt acting out of some desire to please judge perry there was something else unseen in the room something had gone wrong and there was an opportunity for the defense i wiggled my fingers in the cast trying to relieve an itch on my palm well i said im not sure what youre thinking every time i bring up a plea with my client she tells me to pound sand she wants a trial of course ive seen this before the old no deal no deal no deal yes deal scenario right but my hands are sort of tied here andrea my client has twice forbidden me from approaching your office with a tender she wont allow me to initiate so here we are youve come to me so that works but you have to open negotiations you tell me what youre thinking freeman nodded fair enough i did make the call after all are we in agreement that this is off the record nothing leaves this room if no agreement is eventually struck sure aronson nodded along with me okay then this is what we are thinking and this already has approval from on high we drop down to man and recommend the midlevel i nodded projecting my lower lip in a manner that suggested that it was an offer with merit but i knew that if she opened with manslaughter with a midrange sentence recommendation it could only get better for my client i also knew that my instincts were right there was no way the da would float an offer like this unless something was seriously wrong by my estimation their case was weak from the moment they put the cuffs on my client but now something had fallen out of place something big and i had to find out what that was thats a good offer i said youre damn right were coming down off premeditated and lying in wait im assuming were talking voluntary manslaughter it would be hard even for you to make a case for involuntary its not like she just happened to be in that garage do you think shell take it i dont know shes said since the start no deals she wants a trial i can try to sell it its just that just that what im curious you know why such a nice offer why are you coming down to this whats gone wrong inside your case that makes you feel you need to cut and run this is not cutting and running shell still go to prison and there will still be justice theres nothing wrong with our case but trials are expensive and long across the board the das office is trying for dispositions over trials but dispositions that make sense this is one of those times you dont want it im ready to go i held my hands up in surrender i could see her focus on the plaster cast on my left hand its not whether i want it its my clients choice and i have to give her all the information i can thats all ive been in this position before usually a deal this good is too good to be true you take it and you end up finding out later that the main witness was going to flake out or the prosecution just picked up a nice piece of exculpatory evidence you wouldve gotten in discovery if youd hung on just a little bit longer yeah well not this time it is what it is you have twentyfour hours and then it comes off the table what about going with the low range what it was almost a shriek come on you didnt come in here and give me your last best offer no one works that way you have one more give and we both know it voluntary manslaughter lowrange sentencing recommendation shell do five to seven tops youre killing me the press will eat me alive maybe but i know your boss didnt send you over here with one offer andrea she leaned back and looked at aronson and then around the rest of the room her eyes trailing over the shelves of books that came with the office i waited i glanced at aronson and winked i knew what was coming im sorry about your hand freeman said that mustve hurt actually it didnt i was already down for the count when they did it i never felt a thing i held up my hand again and wiggled my fingers their tips moving along the top edge of the cast i can already move them pretty good okay low range i still need to hear back in twentyfour hours and this is all off the record other than to your client this is not to be revealed outside of this room if it doesnt go we already agreed to that okay then i guess thats it ill be heading back she stood up and aronson and i followed we dropped into the sort of small talk that often follows a meeting of great importance so whos going to be the next da i asked your guess is as good as mine freeman said theres no frontrunner yet thats for sure the office was currently operating with an interim district attorney following the appointment of its former holder to a top job in the us attorney generals office in washington dc a special election would be held in the fall to fill the slot and so far the field of candidates was uninspiring finished with the pleasantries we shook hands and freeman left the office sitting back down i looked at aronson so what do you think i think youre right the offer was too good and then she made it even better somethings gone wrong in her case yeah but what we cant exploit it if we dont know what it is i leaned forward to the phone and pushed the intercom i told cisco to come in i swiveled in silence while we waited cisco entered put my cell phone down on the desk and then took the seat where freeman had sat i have the trace underway id give it three days they dont move that quickly thanks so whats up with the prosecutor shes running scared and we dont know why i know youve vetted everything shes given us and checked out the witnesses i want to do it again somethings changed something they thought they had they no longer have we have to find out what it is margo schafer probably how so cisco shrugged just speaking from experience eyewitnesses are unreliable schafer is a big part of a very circumstantial case they lose her or she turns up shaky and they have a big problem we already know its going to be tough to convince a jury that she saw what she claims she saw but we still havent talked to her she refused to be interviewed and is under no obligation to do so i opened the middle drawer of the desk and pulled out a pencil i pushed its point into the top opening of the cast and down between two fingers then maneuvered the pencil back and forth to scratch my palm what are you doing cisco asked whats it look like itching my palm it was driving me crazy the whole meeting you know what they say about itchy palms aronson said i looked at her wondering if there was some sort of sexual innuendo to the answer no what if its your right hand you are going to come into money if its your left then you are going to pay out money if you scratch them you stop it from happening they teach you that in law school bullocks no my mother always said it she was superstitious she thought it was true well if it is i just saved us a bunch of money i pulled the pencil out and put it back in the drawer cisco take another run at schafer try to catch her off guard show up somewhere shed never expect it see how she reacts see if she talks you got it if she doesnt talk take another run at her background maybe theres a connection we dont know about if there is ill find it thats what im counting on sixteen as i had expected lisa trammel wanted no part in a plea agreement that would put her in prison for as long as seven years even though she faced the possibility of four times that amount if convicted at trial she chose to take her chances on an acquittal and i couldnt blame her while i remained at a loss to explain the states change of heart the offer of a defensefriendly disposition made me think the prosecution was running scared and that we had a legitimate fighting chance if my client was willing to roll the dice then so was i it wasnt my freedom at stake i was cruising home at the end of work the next day when i called andrea freeman to give her the news she had left several messages early in the day and i had strategically not returned them hoping to make her sweat it turned out she was anything but feeling the heat when i told her my client was passing on the offer she simply laughed uh haller you might want to start returning your messages a little sooner i tried several times this morning to get to you that offer was permanently taken off the table at ten oclock she shouldve accepted it last night and it probably would have saved her about twenty years in prison who pulled the offer your boss i did i changed my mind and thats that i couldnt think of what could have caused such a dramatic change in less than twentyfour hours the only activity on the case that morning that i knew of was louis opparizios attorney filing a motion to quash the subpoena we had served on him but i didnt see the connection to freemans abrupt change in direction on the plea when i didnt respond freeman moved to end the call so counselor i guess ill see you in court yeah and just so you know im going to find it andrea find what whatever it is youre hiding the thing that went wrong yesterday that made you bring me that offer doesnt matter if you think its all fixed now im going to find it and when we get to trial ill have it in my back pocket she laughed into the phone in a way that immediately undercut the confidence id had in my statement like i said ill see you in court she said yeah ill be there i said i put the phone down on the armrest and tried to intuit what was going on then it struck me i might already be carrying freemans secret in my back pocket the letter from bondurant to opparizio had been hidden in the haystack of documents freeman had turned over maybe she had found it only recently herself and realized what i could do with it how i could build a defense case around it it happens sometimes a prosecutor gets a case with what seems like overwhelming evidence and hubris sets in you go with what youve got and other potential evidence goes undiscovered until late sometimes too late i became convinced it had to be the letter a day ago she was running scared because of the letter now she was confident why the only difference between yesterday and today was the motion to quash the opparizio subpoena all at once i understood her strategy the prosecution would support the dismissal of the subpoena if opparizio didnt testify i might not be able to get the letter before the jury if i had it right then there could be a severe setback for the defense at the hearing on the motion i now knew i had to be prepared to fight as though my case depended on it because it did i decided to put the phone in my pocket no more calls it was friday evening i would put the case aside and take it all up again in the morning everything could wait until then rojas put on some music its the weekend man rojas hit the button on the dash to play the cd i had forgotten what i had in there but soon identified the song as ry cooder singing teardrops will fall a cover of the s classic on his anthology disc it sounded good and it sounded right a song about love lost and being left alone the trial would start in less than three weeks whether or not we figured out what freeman was hiding the defense team was locked and loaded and ready to go we still had some outstanding subpoenas to serve but otherwise we were fit for battle and i was growing more confident every day the following monday i would hole up in my office and start choreographing the defense case the hypothesis of innocence would be carefully revealed piece by piece and witness by witness until it all came together in a crushing wave of reasonable doubt but i still had a weekend to fill before that and i wanted to put as much distance as i could between me and lisa trammel and everything else cooder was now on to poor mans shangrila the one about the ufos and space vatos in chávez ravine before they took it away from the people and put up dodger stadium whats that sound whats that light streaking down through the night i told rojas to turn it up i lowered the back windows and let the wind and music blow through my hair and ears ufo got a radio little julian singing soft and low los angeles down below dj says we gotta go to el monte to el monte pa el monte na na na na na livin in a poor mans shangrila i closed my eyes as we cruised seventeen rojas dropped me at the steps of my home and i slowly made my way up while he put the lincoln in the garage his own car was parked on the street hed take it home and come back monday the usual routine before opening the door i stepped to the far end of the deck and looked out at the city the sun still had a couple hours of work ahead then would set on another week from up here the city had a certain sound that was as identifiable as a train whistle the low hiss of a million dreams in competition you all right i turned around it was rojas at the top of the steps yeah fine whats the matter i dont know i saw you standing up here and thought maybe something was wrong like you were locked out or something no i was just checking out the city i went over to the door pulling out my house key have a good weekend rojas you too boss you know you should probably stop calling me boss okay boss whatever i turned the lock and pushed the door open i was immediately greeted with a sharp and multivoiced cheer of surprise i once got shot in the gut after opening the same door this surprise was a lot better my daughter rushed forward and hugged me and i hugged her back i looked around the room and saw everybody cisco lorna bullocks my half brother harry bosch and his daughter maddie and maggie was there too she came up next to hayley and kissed me on the cheek uh i said ive got some bad news today is not my birthday i am afraid youve all been led astray by someone with some sort of devious plan to get cake maggie punched me on the shoulder your birthdays monday not a good day for a surprise party yeah exactly as i had planned it come on get out of the door and let rojas in nobodys staying that long we just wanted to say happy birthday i leaned forward and kissed her cheek and whispered in her ear what about you youre not staying long either well see about that she escorted me in through a gauntlet of handshakes kisses and back pats it was nice and totally unexpected i was placed in the seat of honor and handed a lemonade the party lasted another hour and i got time to visit with all my guests i hadnt seen harry bosch in a few months i had heard hed come by the hospital but i wasnt awake for the visit we had worked a case the year before with me as a special prosecutor it had been nice being on the same side and i had thought the experience would keep us close but it hadnt really worked out that way bosch remained as distant as ever and i remained as saddened about it as ever when i saw the opportunity i moved toward him and we stood side by side in front of the window that gave the best view of the city from this angle its hard not to love it isnt it he asked i turned from the view to him and then back he was drinking a lemonade too he had told me hed stopped drinking when his teenage daughter had come to live with him i know what you mean i said he drained his glass and thanked me for the party i told him he could leave maddie with us if she wanted to visit hayley longer but he said that he already had plans to take her to a shooting range in the morning a shooting range youre taking your daughter to a shooting range ive got guns in the house she should know how to use them i shrugged i guessed there was a logic in it bosch and his daughter were the first to leave and soon afterward the party ended everybody left except for maggie and hayley they had decided to stay the night exhausted by the day and the week and the month i took a long shower and then got into bed early soon maggie came in after talking hayley to sleep in her room she closed the door and that was when i knew my real birthday present was coming she hadnt brought any nightclothes with her lying on my back i watched her get undressed and then slip under the covers with me you know youre a piece of work haller she whispered what did i do this time you just trespassed all over the place she moved in close and then over on top of me she bent down tenting my face with her hair she kissed me and started slowly moving her hips then put her lips against my ear so she said normal function and activity thats what the doctor told you right thats what he said well see part threeboléro eighteen louis opparizio was a man who did not want to be served as an attorney he knew that the only way he could be dragged into the lisa trammel trial was to be served with a subpoena to testify avoiding service meant avoiding testimony whether he had been tipped to the defense strategy or simply was smart enough to understand it on his own he seemingly disappeared just at the time we began looking for him his whereabouts became unknown and all the routine tricks of the trade to track him and draw him out had failed we did not know if opparizio was in the country let alone in los angeles opparizio had one very big thing going for him in his effort to hide money with enough money you can hide from anybody in this world and opparizio knew it he owned numerous homes in numerous states multiple vehicles and even a private jet to help him connect quickly to all his dots when he moved whether it was from state to state or from beverly hills home to beverly hills office he traveled behind a phalanx of security men he also had one thing going against him money the vast wealth he had accumulated by carrying out the bidding of banks and other lenders had also given him an achilles heel he had acquired the tastes and desires of the super rich and that was how we eventually got him in the course of his efforts to locate opparizio cisco wojciechowski amassed a tremendous amount of information about his quarrys profile from this data a trap was carefully planned and executed to perfection a glossy presentation package announcing the closedbid auction of an aldo tinto painting was sent to opparizios office in beverly hills the package said the painting would be on view for interested bidders for only two hours beginning at pm two nights hence in studio z at bergamot station in santa monica bids would then be accepted until midnight the presentation looked professional and legitimate the depiction of the painting had been lifted from an online art catalog that displayed private collections we knew from a twoyearold profile of opparizio in a bar journal that he had become a collector of secondtier painters and that the late italian master tinto was his obsession when a man called the phone number on the portfolio identified himself as a representative of louis opparizio and booked a private viewing of the painting we had him at precisely the appointed time the opparizio entourage entered the old red car trolley station which had been turned into an upscale gallery complex while three sunglassed security men fanned out across the grounds two more swept gallery z before giving the allclear signal only then did opparizio emerge from the stretch mercedes inside the gallery opparizio was met by two women who disarmed him with their smiles and excitement about the arts and the painting he was about to see one woman handed him a glass flute of cristal to celebrate the moment the other gave him a thick folded packet of documents on the paintings pedigree and exhibition history because he held the champagne in one hand he could not open the documents he was told he could read it all later because he must see the painting now before the next appointment he was led into the viewing room where the piece sat on an ornate easel covered with a satin drape a lone spotlight lit the center of the room the women told him he could remove the drape himself and one of them took his glass of champagne she wore long gloves opparizio stepped forward his hand raised in anticipation he carefully pulled the satin off the frame and there pinned to the board was the subpoena confused he leaned forward to look perhaps thinking this was still the italian masters work youve been served mr opparizio jennifer aronson said you have the original in your hand i dont understand he said but he did and the whole thing from the moment you drove in is on videotape said lorna she stepped to the wall and hit the switch bathing the entire room in light she pointed to the two overhead cameras jennifer lifted the champagne flute as if giving a toast we have your prints too if needed she turned and raised a toast to one of the cameras no opparizio said yes lorna said well see you in court jennifer said the women headed to the side door of the gallery where a lincoln driven by cisco was waiting their job was done that was then this was now i sat in the honorable coleman perrys courtroom preparing to defend the service and validity of the opparizio subpoena and the very heart of the defenses case my cocounsel jennifer aronson sat next to me at the defense table and next to her was our client lisa trammel at the opposing table sat louis opparizio and his two attorneys martin zimmer and landon cross andrea freeman was in a seat located back against the rail as the prosecutor of the criminal case out of which this hearing arose she was an interested party but this wasnt her cause of action additionally detective kurlen was in the courtroom sitting three rows back in the gallery his presence was a mystery to me the cause of action was opparizios he and his legal crew were out to quash the subpoena and prevent his participation in the trial in strategizing how to do so they had thought it prudent to tip freeman to the hearing in case the prosecution also saw merit in keeping opparizio from the jury though largely there as a bystander freeman could step into the fray whenever she wanted and she knew that whether she joined in or not the hearing would likely offer her a good look at the defenses trial strategy it was the first time i saw opparizio in person he was a block of a man who somehow appeared as wide as he was tall the skin on his face had been stretched tight by the scalpel or by years of anger by the cut of his hair and of his suit he looked like money and he seemed to me to be the perfect straw man because he also looked like a man who could kill or at least give the order to kill opparizios lawyers had asked the judge to hold the hearing in camerabehind closed doors in his chambersso that the details revealed would not reach the media and therefore possibly taint the jury pool that would assemble the following day but everybody in the room knew that his lawyers were not being altruistic a closed hearing guarded against details about opparizio leaking to the press and informing something much larger than the jury pool public opinion i argued vigorously against closing the proceedings i warned that such a move would cause public suspicion about the subsequent trial and this outweighed any possible taint of the jury pool elected to the bench perry was ever mindful of public perception he agreed with me and declared the hearing open to the public score a big one for me my prevailing on that one argument probably saved the entire case for the defense not a lot of the media was there but there was enough for what i needed reporters from the los angeles business journal and the la times were in the front row a freelance video man who sold footage to all the networks was in the empty jury box with his camera i had tipped him to the hearing and told him to be there i figured that between the print media and the lone tv camera there would be enough pressure on opparizio to force the outcome i was looking for after dispensing with the request to hide behind closed doors the judge got down to business mr zimmer you have filed a motion to quash the subpoena of louis opparizio in the matter of california versus trammel why dont you state your case sir zimmer looked like a lawyer who had been around the block a few times and usually got to carry his enemies home in his briefcase he stood to respond to the judge we would love to address the court on this matter your honor i am going to speak first to the facts of the service of the subpoena itself and then my colleague mr cross will discuss the other issue for which we seek relief zimmer then proceeded to claim that my office had engaged in mail fraud in laying the trap that resulted in opparizio being served a subpoena he said that the glossy brochure that had baited his client was an instrument of fraud and its placement in the us mail constituted a felony that invalidated any action that followed such as service of the subpoena he further asked that the defense be penalized by being disallowed from any subsequent effort to subpoena opparizio to testify i didnt even have to stand up for this onewhich was a good thing because the simple acts of standing and sitting still set off flares of pain across my chest the judge raised his hand in my direction to hold me in check and then tersely dismissed zimmers argument calling it novel but ridiculous and without merit come on mr zimmer this is the big league perry said you have anything with some meat on the bone properly cowed zimmer deferred to his colleague and sat down landon cross stood up next to face the judge your honor he said louis opparizio is a man of means and standing in this community he has had nothing to do with this crime or this trial and objects to his name and reputation being sullied by his inclusion in it let me emphatically repeat he had nothing to do with this crime is not a suspect and has no knowledge of it he has no probative or exculpatory information to provide he objects to defense counsels putting him on the witness stand to conduct a fishing expedition and he objects to counsels using him as a deflection from the case at hand let mr haller fish for red herrings in a different pond cross turned and gestured to andrea freeman i might add your honor that the prosecution joins me in this motion to quash for the same reasons mentioned the judge swiveled on his seat and looked at me mr haller you want to respond to all of that i stood up slowly i was holding the foam gavel from my desk working it with my fingers which were newly freed from plaster but still stiff yes your honor i would first like to say that mr cross makes a good point about the fishing expedition mr opparizios testimony at trial if allowed to proceed would include a fair amount of fishing not all of it mind you but i would like to drop a line in the water but this is only your honor because mr opparizio and his defensive front have made it darn near impossible for the defense to conduct a thorough investigation of the murder of mitchell bondurant mr opparizio and his henchmen have thwarted all zimmer was up on his feet objecting loudly your honor i mean really henchmen counsel is clearly engaged in playing to the media in the courtroom at mr opparizios expense i once again urge you to move these proceedings to chambers before we continue were staying put perry said but mr haller im not going to allow you to call this witness just to let you grandstand for the jury whats his connection whats he got i nodded like i was ready with an obvious answer mr opparizio founded and operates a company that acts as a middleman in the foreclosure process when the victim in this case decided to foreclose on the home of the defendant he went to mr opparizio to get it done that to me your honor puts mr opparizio on the front line of this case and i would like to ask him about this because the prosecution has stated to the media that the foreclosure is the motive for the murder zimmer jumped in before the judge could respond that is a ridiculous assertion mr opparizios company has a hundred eightyfive employees it is housed in a threelevel office building to foreclosing on peoples homes is big business i interjected counsel the judge warned mr opparizio had nothing whatsoever to do with the defendants foreclosure other than the fact that it was handled by his company along with about a hundred thousand other such cases this year zimmer said a hundred thousand cases mr zimmer the judge asked thats right judge on average the company has been handling two thousand foreclosures a week for more than two years this would include the defendants foreclosure case mr opparizio has no specific knowledge of her case it was one of many and was never on his radar the judge dropped deep into thought and looked like he had heard enough i had hoped not to have to reveal my ace in the hole especially in front of the prosecutor but i had to assume freeman was already aware of the bondurant letter and its value i reached down to the file in front of me on the table and flipped it open there were the letter and four copies ready to go mr haller im inclined to your honor if the court would indulge me i would like to be allowed to ask mr opparizio the name of his personal secretary that gave perry another pause and he screwed his mouth up in confusion you want to know who his secretary is his personal secretary yes why would you want to know that sir i am asking the court to indulge me very well mr opparizio mr haller would like the name of your personal secretary opparizio leaned forward and looked at zimmer as if needing his approval zimmer signaled him to go on and answer the question uh judge i actually have two one is carmen esposito and the other is natalie lazarra he then leaned back the judge looked at me it was time to play the ace judge i have here copies of a certified letter that was written by mitchell bondurant the murder victim and sent to mr opparizio it was received and signed for by his personal secretary natalie lazarra the letter was turned over to me in discovery by the prosecution i would like mr opparizio to testify in court so that i can question him about it lets take a look perry said i stepped away from the table and delivered copies of the letter to the judge and then to zimmer on my way back i swung by freeman and offered her a copy no thanks i already have it i nodded and went back to the table but stayed standing your honor zimmer said can we have a short recess to look this over we havent seen it before fifteen minutes perry said the judge stepped down from the bench and went through the door to his chambers i waited to see if the opparizio team would take it out into the hall when they didnt move i didnt i wanted them to worry that i might overhear something i huddled with aronson and trammel what are they doing aronson whispered they had to have known about the letter already i am sure the prosecution gave them a copy i said opparizio acts like hes the smartest guy in the room now were going to see if he is the smartest guy in the room what do you mean weve got him between a rock and a hard place he knows he should tell the judge that if i ask about that letter he will take the fifth and therefore the subpoena should be kicked but he knows if he takes the fifth in front of the media here hes in trouble that puts blood in the water so what do you think hell do trammel asked act like the smartest guy i pushed back from the table and stood up i nonchalantly started to pace behind the tables zimmer looked over his shoulder at me and then leaned in closer to his client eventually i came back to freeman still in her chair when do you wade in oh im thinking i might not have to they already had the letter didnt they you gave it to them she shrugged her shoulders but didnt answer i looked past her to kurlen sitting three rows back whats kurlen doing here oh he might be needed that was a lot of help last week when you made the offer that was because you had found the letter wasnt it you thought your case was in real trouble she looked up at me and smiled not giving anything away what changed whyd you pull the offer back again she didnt answer you think hes going to take the fifth dont you the shrug again i would i said but him well know soon enough she said dismissively i went back to the table and sat down trammel whispered to me that she still wasnt clear on what was going on we want opparizio to testify at trial he doesnt want to but the only way the judge will let him out of the subpoena is if he says hell invoke his fifth amendment protection against selfincrimination if he does that were dead hes our straw man we need to get him on the stand do you think he will take the fifth im betting no too much at stake with the media here hes putting the finishing touches on a big merger and knows if he takes the nickel the media will be all over him i think hes just smart enough to think he can talk his way out of it on the stand thats what im counting on him thinking hes smarter than everybody else what if she was cut off by the return of the judge to the bench he quickly went back on record and zimmer asked to address the court your honor i would like the record to reflect that against the advice of counsel my client has instructed me to withdraw the motion to quash the judge nodded and pursed his lips he looked at opparizio so your client will testify in front of the jury he asked yes your honor zimmer said he has made that decision you sure about this mr opparizio you have a lot of experience sitting with you at that table yes your honor opparizio said im sure then motion withdrawn any other business before the court before we begin jury selection tomorrow morning perry looked past the tables to freeman it was a tell he knew there was further business to discuss freeman stood up file in hand yes your honor may i approach please do ms freeman freeman stepped forward but then waited for the opparizio team to finish packing and move off the prosecutions table the judge waited patiently finally she took her place at the table remaining standing let me guess perry said you want to talk about mr hallers updated witness list yes judge i do i also have an evidentiary issue to bring up which would you like to hear first evidentiary issue i suddenly knew why kurlen was in the courtroom lets go with the witness list first the judge said i saw that one coming yes your honor mr haller has put his cocounsel down on the witness list and i think first of all he needs to choose between having ms aronson as second chair and having her as a witness but second and more important ms aronson has already handled the preliminary hearing for the defense as well as other duties and so the state objects to this sudden move to make her a witness in the trial freeman sat down and the judge looked over at me sort of late in the game isnt it mr haller i stood yes your honor except for the fact that it is no game and its my clients freedom at stake here the defense would ask the court for wide latitude in this regard ms aronson was intimately involved in the defense against the foreclosure proceedings against my client and the defense has come to the conclusion that she will be needed to explain to jurors what the background was and what was happening at the time of the murder of mr bondurant and is it your plan to have her do double duty both witness and defense counsel thats not going to happen in my courtroom sir your honor i assumed when i put ms aronsons name on the final list that we would have this discussion with ms freeman the defense is open to the courts decision in regard to this perry looked at freeman to see if she had further argument she held still very well then he said you just lost your second chair mr haller i will allow ms aronson to remain on the witness list but tomorrow when we start picking the jury youre on your own ms aronson stays clear of my courtroom until she comes in to testify thank you your honor i said will she be able to join me as second chair after her testimony is concluded i dont see that as a problem perry asked ms freeman you had a second issue for the court freeman stood back up i sat down and leaned forward with my pen ready to take notes the movement caused a searing pain to cross my torso and i almost groaned out loud your honor the state wants to head off an objection and protest i am sure will come from counsel late yesterday we received a return on dna analysis of a very small blood trace found on a shoe belonging to the defendant and seized during the search of her house and garage on the day of the murder i felt an invisible punch in my stomach that made my rib pain disappear quickly i instinctively knew this was going to be a game changer the analysis matches the blood from the shoe to the victim mitchell bondurant before counsel protests i must inform the court that analysis of the blood was delayed because of the backup in the lab and because the sample being worked with was rather minute the difficulty was accentuated by the need to preserve a portion of the sample for the defense i flipped my pen up into the air it bounced onto the table and then clattered to the floor i stood up your honor this is just outrageous on the eve of jury selection to pull this now and boy oh boy that was sure nice of them to leave some for the defense well just run out and get it analyzed before jury selection starts tomorrow you know this is just point well taken counsel the judge interrupted it troubles me as well ms freeman youve had this evidence since the inception of the case how can it be that it conveniently lands the day before jury selection your honor freeman said i have a full understanding of the burden this places on the defense and the court but it is what it is i was informed of the findings at eight oclock this morning when i received the report from the lab this is the first opportunity ive had to bring it before the court as to the reason for its coming in now well there are a few i am sure the court is aware of the backup for dna analysis at the lab at cal state there are thousands of cases while homicide investigations certainly get a priority it is not to the exclusion of all other cases we elected not to go to a private lab that could have turned it around faster because of the concern over the size of the sample we knew if anything went wrong with an outside vendor then we would have completely lost the opportunity to test the bloodand hold a portion for the defense i shook my head in frustration while waiting for the chance to speak again this was indeed a game changer it had been a completely circumstantial case now it was a case involving direct evidence connecting the defendant to the crime mr haller the judge said you want to respond i sure do judge i think this goes beyond being sandbagged and i dont for a moment believe the timing here is happenstance i would ask that the court tell the prosecution that it is too late to spring this now i move that this socalled evidence be excluded from the trial what about delaying the trial the judge said what if you were given the time to get the analysis done and get up to speed on this get up to speed judge this isnt just about getting our own analysis done this is about changing the entire defense strategy the prosecution is seeking to change this from a circumstantial case to a sciencebased case on the eve of trial i dont only need time to do dna testing after two months i now need to rethink the entire case this is devastating your honor and it should not be allowed under the basic idea of fair play freeman wanted a comeback but the judge didnt allow it i took that as a good sign until i saw him looking at the calendar hanging on the wall behind the clerks corral that told me he was only willing to ameliorate the situation with time he was going to allow the dna into evidence and would just give me extra time to prepare for it i sat back down in defeat lisa trammel leaned toward me and desperately whispered mickey this cant be its a setup theres no way his blood could be on those shoes you have to believe me i put my hand up to cut her off i didnt have to believe a word out of her mouth and that was all beside the point the reality was that the case was shifting no wonder freeman had all her confidence back suddenly i realized something i quickly stood back up too quickly pain shot down my torso into my groin and i bent over the defense table your honor are you all right mr haller i slowly straightened up yes your honor but i need to add something to the record if i may go ahead your honor the defense questions the veracity of the prosecutions claim of learning about this dna result only this morning three weeks ago ms freeman offered my client a very attractive disposition giving ms trammel twentyfour hours to think it over then your honor freeman said dont interrupt the judge commanded continue mr haller i had no qualms about breaking my agreement with freeman not to reveal the disposition negotiations the gloves were off at this point thank you your honor so we get the offer on a thursday night and then on friday morning ms freeman mysteriously yanks it right back off the table without explanation well i think we now have that explanation judge she knew back thenthree weeks agoabout this supposed dna evidence but decided to sit on it in order to surprise the defense with it on the eve of trial and i thank you mr haller what about that ms freeman i could see the skin around the judges eyes had drawn tight he was upset what i had just revealed had the ring of truth to it your honor freeman said indignantly nothing could be further from the truth i have with me in the gallery here detective kurlen who will be happy to testify under oath that the dna report was delivered over the weekend to his office and opened by him shortly after his arrival at seven thirty this morning he then called me and i brought it to court the district attorneys office has not sat on anything and i resent the aspersion directed at me personally by counsel the judge glanced out to the rows of seats and spotted kurlen then looked back at freeman why did you withdraw the offer a day after making it he asked the milliondollar question freeman seemed unsettled that the judge would carry the inquiry any further judge that decision involved internal issues perhaps better not aired in court i want to understand this counsel if you want this evidence then you better allay my concerns internal issues or not freeman nodded yes your honor as you know there is an interim district attorney since mr williams joined the us attorney generals office in washington this has resulted in a situation where we dont always have clear lines of communication and direction suffice it to say that on that thursday i had a supervisors approval for the offer i made to mr haller but on friday morning i learned from a higher authority in the office that the offer was not approved internally and so i withdrew it it was a load of crap but she had delivered it well and i had nothing that contradicted it but when she told me the offer was gone that friday i knew by the tone of her voice that she had something new something else and her decision had nothing to do with internal communication and direction the judge made his ruling i am going to put back jury selection ten court days this should give the defense time to have dna testing of the evidence completed if it chooses to do so it also allows ample time to consider what strategic change will come with this information i will hold the state responsible for being totally cooperative in this matter and in getting the biological material to the defense without delay all parties will be prepared to begin jury selection two weeks from today court is adjourned the judge quickly left the bench i looked down at the empty page on my legal pad i had just been eviscerated slowly i started packing my briefcase what do we do aronson asked i dont know yet i said run the test lisa trammel said urgently theyve got it wrong it cant be his blood on my shoes this is unreal i looked at her her brown eyes fervent and believable dont worry ill figure something out the optimism tasted sour in my mouth i glanced over at freeman she was looking through files in her briefcase i sauntered over and she gave me a dismissive look she wasnt interested in hearing my tale of woe you look like things just went exactly the way you wanted them to go i said she showed nothing she closed her case and headed toward the gate before pushing through she looked back at me you want to play hardball haller she said then you have to be ready to catch nineteen the next two weeks went by quickly but not without progress the defense rethought and retooled i had an independent lab confirm the states dna findingsat a rush cost of four grandand then assimilated the devastating evidence into a view of the case that allowed for the science to be correct as well as my clients innocence to be possible if not probable the classic setup defense it would be an additional and natural dimension to the strawman gambit i began to believe it could work and my confidence began to rebuild by the time delayed jury selection finally started i had some momentum going and rolled it into the effort actively looking for the jurors who might lend themselves to believing the new story i was going to spin for them it wasnt until the fourth day of jury selection that yet one more freeman fastball came whistling at my head we were nearing completion of the panel and it was one of those rare times when both prosecution and defense were happy with the jurys makeup but for different reasons the panel was well stocked with workingclass men and women home owners who came from twoincome households few had college diplomas and none had advanced degrees real saltoftheearth people and this was a perfect composition for me i was going for people who lived close to the edge in the tough economy who felt the threat of foreclosure at all times and would have a hard time looking at a banker as a sympathetic victim on the other hand the prosecution asked detailed financial questions of each prospective juror and was looking for hard workers who wouldnt see someone who stopped paying her mortgage as a victim either the result until the morning of the fourth day was a panel full of jurors neither side objected to and who we each thought we could mold into our own soldiers of justice the fastball came when judge perry called for the midmorning break freeman immediately stood up and asked the judge if counsel could meet in chambers during the break to discuss an evidentiary issue that had just come up she asked if detective kurlen could join the meeting perry granted the request and doubled the break time to a half hour i then followed freeman who followed the court reporter and the judge into chambers kurlen came in last and i noticed that he was carrying a large manila envelope with red evidence tape on it it was bulky and appeared to have something heavy inside the paper envelope was the real giveaway though biological evidence was always wrapped in paper plastic evidence bags trapped air and humidity and could damage biologicals so i knew going in that freeman was about to drop another dna bomb on me here we go again i said under my breath as i entered the chambers the judge moved behind his desk and sat down his back to a window that looked south toward the hills over sherman oaks freeman and i took sidebyside seats opposite the desk kurlen pulled a chair over from a nearby table and the court reporter sat on a stool to the judges right her steno machine was on a tripod in front of her were on the record here the judge said ms freeman judge i wanted to meet with you and counsel for the defense as soon as possible because i am anticipating that once again mr haller will howl at the moon when he hears what i have to say and what i have to show then lets get on with it perry said freeman nodded to kurlen and he started peeling back the tape on the evidence envelope i said nothing i noticed that he had a rubber glove on his right hand the prosecution has come into possession of the murder weapon freeman stated matteroffactly and plans to introduce it as evidence as well as make it available to the defense for examination kurlen opened the envelope reached in and brought out a hammer it was a claw hammer with a brushed steel head and a circular striking surface it had a polished redwood handle tipped in black rubber at the end i saw a notch at twelve oclock on the strike face and knew it likely corresponded with the skull impressions cataloged during the autopsy i stood up angrily and walked away from the desk oh come on i said in full outrage are you kidding me i looked at the wall of shelved codebooks perry had at the far side of the room put my hands on my hips in indignation and then turned back to the desk judge excuse my language but this is bullshit she cant do this again to spring thiswhat four days into jury selection and a day before opening statements we have most of the box already picked we are possibly going to start tomorrow and shes suddenly laying the supposed murder weapon on me the judge leaned back in his seat as if distancing himself from the hammer kurlen was holding you better have a good and convincing story ms freeman he said i do judge i could not bring this forward until this morning and i am more than willing to explain why if you allowed this i said interrupting and pointing a finger at the judge excuse me mr haller but dont you dare point your finger at me he said with restraint im sorry judge but this is your fault you let her get away with the bullshit dna story and after that theres no reason for her not to excuse me sir but you had better proceed cautiously you are about five seconds away from seeing the inside of my holding cell you do not point your finger or address a superior court judge as you have do you understand me i turned back to the codebooks and took a deep breath i knew i had to get something out of this i had to come out of this room with the judge owing me something i understand i finally said good perry said now come back over here and take a seat lets hear what ms freeman and detective kurlen have to say and it better be good reluctantly i returned like a chastised child and dropped into my seat ms freeman lets hear it yes your honor the weapon was turned in to us late monday afternoon a land great i said i knew it so you wait until four days into jury selection before you decide to mr haller the judge barked i have lost all patience with you do not interrupt again continue ms freeman please of course your honor as i said we received this at the lapds van nuys division late monday afternoon i think it would be best if detective kurlen runs you through the chain of custody perry gestured to the detective to begin what happened was that a landscaper working in a yard on dickens street near kester avenue found it that morning lodged in a hedge near the front of his clients house this is in the street that runs behind westland national the house is approximately two blocks from the rear of the bank the landscaper who found the hammer is from gardenia and had no idea about the murder but thinking the tool belonged to his client he left it on the porch for him the home owner a man named donald meyers didnt see it until he came home from work about five oclock that afternoon he was confused because he knew it was not his hammer however he then remembered reading articles about the bondurant murder at least one of which indicated the murder weapon might be a hammer and that it had not been found yet he called his landscaper and got his story then he called the police well youve told us how you got it perry said you havent explained why were hearing about it three days later freeman nodded she was ready for this and took over the narrative judge we obviously had to confirm what we had and the chain of custody we immediately turned it over to the scientific investigation division for processing and only received the lab reports yesterday evening after court and what do those reports conclude the only fingerprints on the weapon belonged to wait a minute i said risking the judges ire again can we just refer to it as the hammer calling it the weapon on the record is a bit presumptuous at this point fine freeman said before the judge could respond the hammer the only fingerprints on the hammer belonged to mr meyers and his landscaper antonio ladera however two things tie it solidly into the case a small spot of blood found on the neck of the hammer has been conclusively matched through dna testing to mitchell bondurant we rushed this test with an outside vendor because of the protest counsel made over the precautions taken with the other test the hammer was also turned over to the medical examiners office for comparison to the wound patterns on the victim again we have a match mr haller you can refer to it as the hammer or the tool or whatever you want but im calling it the murder weapon and i have copies of the lab reports to turn over to you at this time she reached into the manila envelope removed two paperclipped documents and handed them to me with a satisfied smile on her face well thats nice of you i said in full sarcasm thank you very much oh and theres also this she reached into the envelope again and withdrew two eightbyten photos giving one to the judge and one to me it was a photo of a workbench with tools hung on a pegboard on the wall behind it i knew it was the workbench from lisa trammels garage i had been there this is from lisa trammels garage it was taken on the day of the murder during the search of the premises under the authority of a courtordered search warrant you will notice that one tool is missing from the pegboards hooks the open space created by this corresponds to the dimensions of a claw hammer this is crazy sid has identified the recovered hammer as a craftsman model manufactured by sears this particular hammer is not sold separately it comes only in the twohundredthirtyninepiece carpenters tool package from this photograph we have identified more than a hundred other tools from that package but no hammer its not there because lisa trammel threw it into the bushes after leaving the scene of the crime my mind was racing even with a defense based on the theory that the defendant was set up there was a law of diminishing returns explaining away the blood drop on the shoe was one thing explaining away your clients ownership of and connection to the murder weapon was not just a second thing there was an exponential increase in the odds against setup as each piece of evidence is revealed for the second time in three weeks the defense had been handed a devastating blow and i was left almost speechless the judge turned to me it was time to respond but i had no comeback that was worthy this is very compelling evidence mr haller he prompted you have anything to say i had nothing but i picked myself up off the mat before he reached the ten count your honor this socalled evidence that just sort of conveniently dropped from heaven should have been announced to the court and the defense the moment it was brought forward not three days later not even a day later if only to allow the defense to properly inspect the evidence conduct its own tests and observe those of the prosecution it was supposedly in the bushes undiscovered for what three months at this point and yetvoilàwe have dna to match to the victim this whole thing stinks of a setup and its too damn late your honor the train has left the station we might have opening statements as early as tomorrow the prosecution has had all week to think about how to drop the hammer into hers what am i supposed to do at this point were you planning to give your statement at the beginning or reserve until the defense phase the judge asked i was planning on giving it tomorrow i lied i already have it written but this is also information i could have used while picking the jurors we already have in the box judge this whole thinglook all i know is that five weeks ago the prosecution was desperate ms freeman came to my office to offer my client a deal whether shell admit it or not she was running scared and she gave me everything i asked for and then suddenly we have the dna on the shoe now lo and behold the hammer turns up and of course nobodys talking about a disposition anymore the coincidence of all of this puts it all to doubt but the malfeasance in how it was handled should alone lead you to refuse to allow it into evidence your honor freeman said as soon as i was finished may i respond to mr hallers allegation of mal no need to ms freeman as i already said this is compelling evidence it comes in at an inopportune time but it is clearly evidence the jury should consider i will allow it but i will also once again allow the defense extra time to prepare for it were going to go back out there now and finish picking a jury then i am going to give them a long weekend and bring them back monday for opening statements and the start of the trial that gives you three extra days to prepare your opener mr haller that should be enough time meanwhile your staff including that young gogetter you hired out of my alma mater can work on assembling whatever experts and testing youll need on the hammer i shook my head it wasnt good enough i was going down fast here your honor i move that the trial be stayed while i take this matter up on appeal you can take it up on appeal mr haller thats your right but its not going to stop the trial we go on monday he gave me a little nod that i took as a threat i take him up on appeal and he wont forget it during trial do we have anything else to discuss perry asked im good freeman said mr haller i shook my head as my voice deserted me then lets go out there and finish picking a jury lisa trammel was pensively waiting for me at the defense table what happened she asked in an urgent whisper what happened was that we just got our asses handed to us again this time its over what do you mean i mean they found the fucking hammer you threw in the bushes after you killed mitchell bondurant thats crazy i no youre crazy they can tie it directly to bondurant and they can tie it to you its right off your fucking workbench i dont know how you couldve been so stupid but thats beside the point it actually makes keeping the bloody shoes seem like a smart choice in comparison now i have to figure out a way to get a deal out of freeman when she has absolutely no need to make a deal shes got a slambang case so why cut a deal lisa reached over with one hand and grabbed the left side of my jacket collar she pulled me closer now she whispered through clenched teeth you listen to yourself how could i have been so stupid thats the question and the answer is i wasnt you know if anything im not stupid ive told you from day one this is a setup they wanted to get rid of me and this is what they did but i didnt do this youve had it right all along louis opparizio he needed to get rid of mitchell bondurant and he used me as the fall guy bondurant sent him your letter that started everything i didnt she faltered as the tears started to flood her eyes i put my hand over hers as if to calm her and detached it from my collar i was aware that the jury was filing into the box and didnt want them to see any attorneyclient discord i didnt do this she said you hear me i dont want any deal i wont say i did something i didnt do if thats your best shot then i want a new attorney i looked away from her to the bench judge perry was watching us ready to proceed mr haller i looked at my client and then back at the judge yes your honor ready to proceed twenty it was like being in the losing locker room but we had yet to play the game it was sunday afternoon eighteen hours before opening statements to the jury and i huddled with my crew already conceding defeat it was the bitter end before the trial had even begun i dont understand aronson said into the void of silence that had enveloped my office you said we needed a hypothesis of innocence an alternate theory we have that with opparizio we have it in spades where is the problem i looked over at cisco wojciechowski it was just the three of us i was in shorts and a tshirt cisco was in his riding clothes an armygreen tank top over black jeans and aronson was dressed for a day in court she hadnt gotten the memo about it being sunday the problem is were not going to get opparizio into the trial i said he withdrew the motion to quash aronson protested that doesnt matter the trial is about the states evidence against trammel its not about who else might have committed the crime mightves dont count i can put opparizio on the stand as the expert on trammels foreclosure and the foreclosure epidemic but im not going to get near him as an alternate suspect the judge wont let me unless i can prove relevance so weve come all this way and we still dont have relevancy we still dont have that one thing that pulls opparizio all the way in aronson was determined not to give up the fourteenth amendment guarantees trammel a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense an alternate theory is part of a complete defense so she could quote the constitution she was book smart but experience poor california versus hall nineteen eightysix look it up i pointed to her laptop which was open on the corner of my desk she leaned over and started typing do you know the citation try fortyone she typed it in got the ruling on her screen and started scanning i looked over at cisco who had no idea what i was doing read it out loud i said the pertinent parts uhevidence that another person had motive or opportunity to commit the charged crime or had some remote connection to the victim or crime scene is insufficient to raise the requisite reasonable doubt evidence of alternate party culpability is relevant and admissible only if it links the alternate party to the actual perpetration of the crime okay were screwed i nodded if we cant put opparizio or one of his goons in that parking garage then we are indeed screwed the letter doesnt do it cisco asked nope i said theres no way freeman will kick my ass if i say the letter opens the door it gives opparizio a motive yes but it doesnt link him directly to the crime shit thats about right right now we dont have it so we dont have a defense and the dna and the hammer well that nails it all down nicely for the state no pun intended our lab reports say there is no biological connection to lisa aronson said i also have a craftsman expert who will testify it is impossible to say that the hammer in evidence came from her specific set of tools plus we know the garage door was unlocked even if it is her hammer anyone couldve taken it and anyone could have planted the blood on the shoes yeah yeah i know all of that its not enough to say what couldve happened were going to have to say this is what happened and were going to have to back it up if we cant we wont even get it in opparizio is the key we need to be able to go at him without freeman standing up on every question and saying whats the relevance aronson wouldnt give it up there must be something she said theres always something we just havent found it yet i swiveled on my chair until i was looking directly at cisco he frowned and nodded he knew what was coming on you man i said youve got to find me something freemans going to take about a week to present the states case thats how much time you have but if i stand up tomorrow and throw the dice saying im going to prove somebody else did it then i have to deliver ill start over cisco said ground up ill find you something you do what you have to do tomorrow i nodded more in thanks than in faith that he would come through i didnt really believe there was anything out there to get i had a guilty client and justice was going to prevail end of story i looked down at my desk spread across it were crime scene photos and reports i held up the eightbyten of the victims briefcase lying open on the garages concrete floor it was the thing that had stuck with me since the beginning had given me hope that maybe my client didnt do it that is until the last two evidentiary rulings by the judge so still no report on the briefcase contents and if anything was missing i asked not that weve gotten aronson said i had put her in charge of the first review of discovery materials as they had come in so the guys briefcase was left wide open and they never tried to see if there was anything missing they inventoried the contents we have that i just dont think they made a report on what was possibly not in it kurlens cagey he wasnt going to create an opening for us yeah well he might be walking around with that briefcase shoved up his ass after im through with him on the stand aronson blushed i pointed at my investigator cisco the briefcase weve got the list of contents talk to bondurants secretary find out if anything was taken i already tried she wouldnt talk to me try again give her the gun show win her over he flexed his arms aronson continued to blush i stood up im going home to work on my opener you sure you want to give it tomorrow aronson asked if you defer until the defense phase youll know what ciscos been able to find i shook my head i got the weekend because i told the judge i want to give it at the start of the trial i go back on that and hes going to blame me for losing friday hes already a judge with a grudge because i lost it in chambers with him i moved around from behind the desk i handed the photo of the briefcase to cisco make sure you guys lock up no rojas on sundays i drove the lincoln home alone there was light traffic and i got back quickly even stopping to pick up a pizza at the little italian joint under the market at the bottom of laurel canyon when i got to the house i didnt bother edging the big lincoln into the garage next to its fleet twin i parked at the bottom of the steps locked it and went on up to the front door it wasnt until i got up to the deck that i saw that i had someone waiting for me unfortunately it wasnt maggie mcfierce rather a man i had never seen before sat in one of the directors chairs at the far end of the deck he was slightly built and disheveled a weeks worth of beard on his cheeks his eyes were closed and his head tilted back he was asleep i wasnt concerned for my safety he was alone and he wasnt wearing black gloves still i quietly put the key into the lock and opened the door without a sound i stepped in closed the door silently and put the pizza down on the kitchen counter i then moved back to my bedroom and into the walkin closet off the upper shelftoo high for my daughter to get toi took down the wooden box that held the colt woodsman id inherited from my father it had a tragic history and i hoped not to add to it now i loaded a full magazine of ammunition into it then headed back to the front door i took the other directors chair and moved it over until it faced the sleeping man only after i sat down holding the gun casually in my lap did i reach out with my foot and tap him on the knee he startled awake his eyes wide and darting about until they finally landed on my face then dropped to the gun whoa wait a minute man no you wait a minute who are you and what do you want i didnt point the gun i kept things casual he raised his hands palms out in surrender mr haller right im jeff man jeff trammel we talked on the phone remember i stared at him for a moment and realized i had not recognized him because i had never seen a photograph of him during the times i had been in lisa trammels home there were no framed photos of him she had excised his presence from the house after he had chosen to hightail it now here he was haunted eyes and hangdog look i thought i knew just what he was looking for how did you know where i live who told you to come here nobody told me i just came i looked your name up on the california bar website there was no office listed but this was the correspondence address i came and saw it was a house and figured you live here i didnt mean nothing by it i need to talk to you you couldve called that phone ran out of juice i gotta buy another one i decided to run a little test on jeff trammel that time you called me where were you he shrugged like it was no big deal to give up the information now down in rosarito i been staying down there that was a lie cisco had gotten the trace back on his call i had the number of the phone and the originating cell tower the call had come from venice beach about two hundred miles from rosarito beach in mexico what did you want to talk to me about jeff i can help you man help me how i was talking to lisa she told me about the hammer they found its not hersi mean ours i can tell you where ours is lead you right to it okay then where is it he nodded and looked off to the right and at the city down below the neverending hiss of traffic filtered up to us thats the thing mr haller i need some money i want to go back to mexico you dont need a lot down there but you need a start if you know what i mean so how much of a start do you want he turned and looked directly at me now because i was speaking his language just ten grand man you got all that movie money coming in and ten wont hurt you too bad you give me that and i give you the hammer and thats it yeah man ill be out of your hair what about testifying on lisas behalf at the trial remember we talked about that he shook his head no i cant do that im not the testifying type but i can help you on the outside like this you know lead you to the hammer stuff like that herb said the hammer is their biggest evidence and its bullshit because i know where the real one is so youre talking to herb dahl too i could tell by the grimace that hed made a slip he was supposed to keep herb dahl out of the conversation uh no no it was what lisa said he said i dont even know him let me ask you something jeff how am i going to know this is the real hammer and not some replacement youve cooked up with lisa and herb because im telling you i know i was the one who left it where it is me but youre not going to testify so all im left with is a hammer and no story do you know what fungible means jeff funuh no it means mutually interchangeable an item is fungible in the law if it can be replaced by an identical item and thats what we have here jeff your hammer is useless to me without the story attached if it is your story then you have to testify to it if you wont testify then it doesnt matter huh he seemed crestfallen wheres the hammer jeff im not telling you its all i have im not paying you a cent for it jeff even if i believed there was a hammerthe real hammeri wouldnt pay you a cent thats not how it works so you think things over and you let me know okay okay now get off my porch i carried the gun down at my side and stepped back into the house locking the door behind me i grabbed the car keys off the pizza box and hurried through the house to the back door i went through and then slipped along the side of the house to a wooden gate that opened onto the street i opened it a crack and looked for jeff trammel i didnt see him but i heard a car engine roar to life i waited and soon a car moved by i went through the gate and tried to get a look at the plate but i was too late the car coasted down the hill it was a blue sedan but i was too consumed with the plate to identify the make and model as soon as it took the first curve i hurried up the street to my own car if i was to follow him i would have to get down the hill in time to see if he turned left or right on laurel canyon boulevard otherwise it was a fiftyfifty chance of losing him but i was too late by the time the lincoln negotiated the sharp turns and the intersection at laurel canyon came into sight the blue sedan was gone i pulled up to the stop sign and didnt hesitate i turned right heading north toward the valley cisco had traced jeff trammels call to venice but everything else about the case was in the valley i headed that way it was a single lane on the northbound ascent of the roadway that cut over the hollywood hills it then opened to two lanes on the down slope into the valley but i never caught up to trammel and soon realized i had chosen the wrong way venice i shouldve turned south not being a fan of cold or reheated pizza i pulled off to eat at the daily grill at laurel and ventura i parked in the underground garage and was halfway to the escalator when i realized i had the woodsman tucked into the back of my pants not good i returned to the car and put it under the seat then doublechecked to make sure the car was locked it was early but nonetheless crowded in the restaurant i sat at the bar rather than wait for a table and ordered an iced tea and a chicken pot pie i then opened my phone and called my client she answered right away lisa its your attorney did you send your husband over to speak to me well i told him he should see you yes and was that your idea or herb dahls no mine i mean herb was here but it was my idea did you talk to him i did did he lead you to the hammer no he didnt he wanted ten thousand dollars to do that there was a pause but i waited mickey it doesnt seem like a lot to ask for something that will destroy the states evidence you dont pay for evidence lisa if you do you lose where is your husband staying these days he wouldnt tell me did you talk to him in person yes he came here he looked like something the cat dragged in i need to find him so i can subpoena him do you have any he wont testify he told me no matter what he just wants money and to see me in pain he doesnt even care about his own son he didnt even ask to see him when he came by my meal was placed down in front of me and the bartender topped off my tea i sliced into the top crust with my fork just to let some of the steam out it would be a good ten minutes before the dish would be cool enough to eat lisa listen to me this is important do you have any idea where he could be living or staying no he said he came up from mexico thats a lie hes been here all the time she seemed taken aback how do you know that phone records look it doesnt matter if he calls you or comes by find out where he is staying promise him theres money coming or whatever you need to do but get me a location if we can get him into court hell have to tell us about the hammer ill try dont try lisa do it this is your life were talking about here okay okay now did he drop any hint about the hammer at all when he spoke to you not really he just said remember how i used to keep the hammer in my car when i was on repo duty when he was at the dealership he had to repossess cars sometimes they took turns i think he kept the hammer for protection or in case they had to break into a car or something so he was saying the original hammer from your garage tool set was kept in his car i guess so the beemer but that car was taken away after he abandoned it and disappeared i nodded i could put cisco on it have him try to confirm the story by seeing if a hammer was found in the trunk of the bmw left behind by jeff trammel okay lisa who are jeffs friends up here in the city i dont know he had friends at the dealership but nobody that he brought around we didnt really have friends do you have any names of those people from the dealership not really lisa youre not helping me here im sorry i cant think i didnt like his friends i told him to keep them away i shook my head and then thought of myself who were my friends outside of work could maggie answer these same questions about me all right lisa enough of this for now i want you thinking about tomorrow remember what we talked about how you act and react in front of the jury a lot will ride on it i know im ready good i thought i wish i was twentyone judge perry wanted to make up for some of the court time lost the friday before so on monday morning he arbitrarily limited opening statements to the jury to thirty minutes apiece this ruling came even though both the prosecution and the defense had ostensibly been laboring through the weekend on statements previously scheduled to be an hour long the truth was the edict was fine by me i doubted i would even take ten minutes the more you say on the defense side the more the prosecution has to aim at in closing arguments less is always more when it comes to the defense however the capriciousness of the judges ruling was something else to consider it clearly sent a message the judge was telling us mere lawyers that he was firmly in charge of the courtroom and the trial we were just visitors freeman went first and as is my usual practice i never took my eyes off the jury as the prosecutor spoke i listened closely ready to object on a moments notice but i never once looked at her i wanted to see how the jurors eyes took freeman in i wanted to see if my hunches about them were going to pay off freeman spoke clearly and eloquently no histrionics no flash it was straightforward eyesontheprize stuff were here today about one thing she said standing firmly in the center of the well the open space directly in front of the jury box we are here because of one persons anger one persons need to lash out in frustration over her own failures and betrayals of course she spent most of her time warning the jurors off what she called the defenses smoke and mirrors confident in her own case she sought to tear down mine the defense is going to try to sell you a bill of goods big conspiracies and high drama this murder is big but the story is simple dont be led astray watch closely listen closely make sure that whatever is said here today is backed during the trial with evidence real evidence this was a wellplanned crime the killer knew mitchell bondurants routines the killer stalked mitchell bondurant the killer was lying in wait for mitchell bondurant and then attacked swiftly and with the ultimate malice that killer is lisa trammel and during this trial she will be brought to justice freeman pointed the accusatory finger at my client lisa as previously instructed by me stared back at her without blinking i zeroed in on juror number three who sat in the middle of the front row of the box leander lee furlong jr was my ace in the hole he was my hanger the one juror i was counting on to vote my way all the way even if it hung the jury about a half hour before the jury selection process had begun the court clerk gave me the list of eighty names composing the first jury pool i turned the list over to my investigator who stepped out into the hallway opened his laptop and went to work the internet provides many avenues for researching the backgrounds of potential jurors particularly when the trial will revolve around a financial transaction such as a foreclosure every person in the jury pool filled out a questionnaire answering basic questions have you or anyone in your immediate family been involved in a foreclosure have you ever had a car repossessed have you ever filed for bankruptcy these were weedout questions anyone who answered yes to these questions would be dismissed by either the judge or the prosecutor a person answering yes would be deemed biased and unable to fairly weigh evidence but the weedouts were very general and there were gray areas and room between the lines thats where cisco came in by the time the judge had sat the first panel of twelve prospective jurors and gone over their questionnaires cisco was back to me with background notes on seventeen of the eighty i was looking for people with bad experiences with and maybe even grudges against banks or government institutions the seventeen ran the gamut from people who had outright lied on their questionnaires about bankruptcies or repossessions to plaintiffs in civil claims against banks to leander furlong leander lee furlong jr was a twentynineyearold assistant manager at the ralphs supermarket in chatsworth he had answered no to the question about foreclosure in ciscos digital background search he went the extra mile and searched some national data sites he came up with a reference to a foreclosure auction of property in nashville tennessee on which leander lee furlong was listed as the owner the petitioner in the action was the first national bank of tennessee the name seemed unique and the two instances had to be related my prospective juror would have been thirteen at the time of the foreclosure i assumed it was his father who lost the property to the bank and leander lee furlong jr had left mention of it off his questionnaire as jury selection progressed over two days i nervously waited for furlong to be randomly selected and moved into the box for questioning by the judge and attorneys along the way i passed up a handful of good prospects using my peremptory challenges to clear spaces in the box finally on the fourth morning furlongs number came up and he was seated for questioning when i heard him speak with a southern accent i knew i had my hanger he had to carry a grudge against the bank that took away his parents property he was hiding it to get on the jury furlong passed the judges and prosecutors questions with flying colors saying just the right things and presenting himself as a godfearing hardworking man who had conservative values and an open mind when it was my turn i hung back and asked a few general questions then hit him with a zinger i needed him to appear acceptable to me i asked him if he thought people in foreclosure should be looked down upon or if it was possible that there were legitimate reasons why people sometimes could not pay for their home in his southern twang furlong said that each case was different and it would be wrong to generalize about all people in foreclosure a few minutes and few more questions later freeman punched his ticket and i concurred he was on the jury now i just had to hope his family history wasnt discovered by the prosecution if so he would be removed from the jury faster than a crip from a bloods holding cell was i being unethical or breaking the rules by not reporting furlongs secret to the court it depends on your definition of immediateas in immediate family the meaning of who and what constitutes your immediate family changes as you move through life furlongs sheet said he was married and had a young son his wife and child were his immediate family now for all i knew his father might not even be alive the question asked was have you or anyone in your immediate family been involved in a foreclosure the word ever was not in that sentence so it was a gray area and i felt i was under no obligation to help the prosecution by pointing out what was omitted from the question freeman had the same list of names and the power of the district attorneys office and the lapd at her immediate disposal there had to be someone in those two bureaucracies as smart as my investigator let them look and find for themselves if not it was their loss i watched furlong as freeman started listing the building blocks of her case the murder weapon the eyewitness the blood on the defendants shoe and her history of targeting the bank with her anger he sat with both elbows on the armrests of his chair his fingers steepled in front of his mouth it was like he was hiding his face peeking over his hands at her it was a posture that told me i had read him right he was my hanger for sure freeman began to lose steam as she hurried through a truncated recitation of how all the evidence fit together as guilt beyond a reasonable doubt this was where she had obviously chopped content out of her opener in deference to the judges arbitrary time constraint she knew she could tie it all up in closing arguments so she skipped a lot of it here and got to her conclusion ladies and gentlemen blood will tell she said follow the evidence and it will lead you without a doubt to lisa trammel she took mitchell bondurants life she took everything he had and now its time to bring her to justice she thanked the jurors and returned to her seat it was my turn now i put my hand down below the table to check my zipper you have to stand before a jury only once with your fly open and it will never happen again i got up and took the same spot in the well where freeman had stood i once again tried to show no sign of my stillhealing injuries and i began ladies and gentlemen i want to start with a couple of introductions my name is michael haller i am counsel for the defense it is my job to defend lisa trammel against these very serious charges our constitution ensures that anyone accused of a crime in this country is entitled to a full and vigorous defense and that is exactly what i intend to provide during the course of this trial if i rub some of you the wrong way as i do this then let me apologize up front but please remember my actions should not reflect on lisa i turned to the defense table and raised my hand as if welcoming trammel to the trial lisa would you please stand for a moment trammel stood up and turned slightly to the jury her eyes slowly scanning the twelve faces she looked resolute unbroken just the way i told her to be and this is lisa trammel the defendant ms freeman wants you to believe she committed this crime she is five foot three in height weighs a hundred nine pounds soaking wet and is a schoolteacher thank you lisa you can sit down now trammel took her seat and i turned back to the jury keeping my eyes moving from face to face as i spoke we agree with ms freeman that this crime was brutal and violent and coldblooded no one should have taken mitchell bondurants life and whoever did should be brought to justice but there should never be a rush to judgment and thats what the evidence will prove happened here the investigators on this case saw the little picture and the easy fit they missed the big picture they missed the real murderer from behind me i heard freemans voice your honor can we please approach for a sidebar perry frowned but then signaled us up i followed freeman to the side of the bench already formulating my response to what i knew she was going to object to the judge flipped on a sound distortion fan so the jurors wouldnt hear anything they shouldnt and we huddled at the side of the bench judge freeman began i hate interrupting an opening statement but this doesnt sound like an opening statement is defense counsel going to hit us with the facts his defense case will prove and the evidence he has or is he just going to talk in generalities about some mysterious killer that everybody else missed the judge looked at me for a response i looked at my watch judge i object to the objection i am less than five minutes into a thirtyminute allotment and shes already objecting because i havent put anything on the board come on judge shes trying to show me up in front of the jury and i request that you take a continuing objection from her and not allow her to interrupt again i think hes right ms freeman the judge said way too early to object ill carry it now as a running objection and will step in myself if i need to you go back to the prosecution table and sit tight he flipped the fan off and rolled his chair back to the center of the bench freeman and i returned to our positions as i was saying before being interrupted there is a big picture to this case and the defense is going to show it to you the prosecution would like you to believe that this is a simple case of vengeance but murder is never simple and if you look for shortcuts in an investigation or a prosecution then you are going to miss things including a killer lisa trammel did not even know mitchell bondurant had never met him before she had no motive to kill him because the motive the prosecution will tell you about was false theyll say she killed mitchell bondurant because he was going to take away her house the truth was he wasnt going to get the house and we will prove that a motive is like a rudder on a boat you take it away and the boat moves at the whim of the wind and thats what the prosecutions case is a lot of wind i put my hands in my pockets and looked down at my feet i counted to three in my head and when i looked up i was staring directly at furlong what this case is really about is money its about the epidemic of foreclosure that has swept across our country this was not a simple act of vengeance this was the cold and calculated murder of a man who was threatening to expose the corruption of our banks and their agents of foreclosure this is about money and those who have it and will not part with it at any costeven murder i paused again shifting my stance and moving my eyes across the whole panel they came to a female juror named esther marks and held i knew she was a single mother who worked as an office manager in the garment district she probably made less than the men doing the same job and i had her pegged as someone who would be sympathetic to my client lisa trammel was set up for a murder she did not commit she was the patsy the fall guy she protested the banks harsh and fraudulent foreclosure practices she fought against them and for that she was kept away with a restraining order the very things that made her a suspect to lazy investigators were what made her a perfect patsy and were going to prove it to you all their eyes were on me id captured their complete attention the states evidence wont stand i said piece by piece well knock it down the measure by which you are charged to make your decision here is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt i urge you to pay close attention and to think for yourself you do that and i guarantee that youll have more reasonable doubt than youll know what to do with and youll be left with only one question why why was this woman charged with this crime why was she put through this one final pause and then i nodded and thanked them for their attention i quickly moved back to my seat and sat down lisa reached over and put her hand on my arm as if to thank me for standing for her it was one of our choreographed moves i knew it was an act but it still felt good the judge called for a fifteenminute break before the start of testimony as the courtroom emptied i stayed in place at the defense table my opener had continued my sense of momentum the prosecution would hold sway over the next few days but freeman was now on notice that i was coming after her thank you mickey lisa trammel said as she got up to go out into the hall with herb dahl who had come through the gate to collect her i looked at him and then i looked at her dont thank me yet i said twentytwo after the break andrea freeman came out of the gate with what i called the prosecutions scenesetter witnesses their testimony was often dramatic but did not get to the guilt or innocence of the defendant they were merely called as part of the architecture of the states case to set the stage for the evidence that would come later the trials first witness was a bank receptionist named riki sanchez she was the woman who found the victims body in the parking garage her value was in helping to set a time of death and in bringing the shock of murder to the everyday people on the jury sanchez commuted to work from the santa clarita valley and therefore had a morning routine that she strictly adhered to she testified that she regularly pulled into the bank garage at am which gave her ten minutes to park get to the employee entrance and be at her desk by to prepare for the banks doors to open to the public at she testified that on the day of the murder she had followed her routine and found an unassigned parking slot approximately ten spaces from mitchell bondurants assigned space after leaving and locking her car she walked toward the bridge that connected the garage to the bank building it was then that she discovered the body she first saw the spilled coffee then the open briefcase on the ground and finally mitchell bondurant lying facedown and bloodied sanchez knelt next to the body and checked for signs of life then pulled her cell phone out of her purse and called its rare to score defense points off a scenesetter witness their testimony is usually very prescribed and rarely contributes to the question of guilt or innocence still you never know on crossexamination i stood and threw a few questions at sanchez just to see what might pop loose now ms sanchez you described your very precise morning routine here but there really is no routine once you drive into the banks garage correct im not sure what you mean i mean that you do not have an assigned parking space so there is no routine when it comes to that you get into the garage and have to start hunting for a space right well sort of the bank isnt open yet so there are always plenty of spaces i usually go up to the second floor and park in the area where i did that day all right in the past had you walked into work with mr bondurant no he was usually in earlier than me now on the day that you found mr bondurants body where was it that you saw the defendant lisa trammel in the garage she paused as if it was a trick question it was i donti mean i didnt see her thank you ms sanchez next up on the stand was the operator who took the am emergency call from sanchez her name was leshonda gaines and her testimony was used primarily to introduce the tape of the call from sanchez playing the tape was an overly dramatic and unneeded maneuver but the judge had allowed it over a pretrial objection from me freeman played forty seconds of the tape after handing out transcripts to the jurors as well as to the judge and the defense gaines nineoneone what is your emergency sanchez theres a man here i think hes dead hes all bloody and he wont move gaines what is your name maam sanchez riki sanchez im in the parking garage at westland national in sherman oaks pause gaines is that the ventura boulevard location sanchez yes are you sending someone gaines police and paramedics have been dispatched sanchez i think hes already dead theres a lot of blood gaines do you know who he is sanchez i think its mr bondurant but im not sure do you want me to turn him over gaines no just wait for the police are you in any danger ms sanchez pause sanchez uh i dont think so i dont see anybody around gaines okay wait for the police and keep this line open i didnt bother asking any questions on crossexamination there was nothing to be gained for the defense freeman threw her first curveball after gaines was excused i expected her to go with the first responding officer next have him testify about arriving and securing the scene and get the crime scene photos to the jury but instead she called margo schafer the eyewitness who put trammel close to the crime scene i immediately saw the strategy freeman was employing instead of sending the jury to lunch with crime scene photos in their minds send them out with the first ahha moment of the trial the first piece of testimony that connected trammel to the crime it was a good plan but freeman didnt know what i knew about her witness i just hoped i got to her before lunch schafer was a petite woman who looked nervous and pale as she took the witness stand she had to pull the stemmed microphone down from the position gaines had left it in under direct questioning freeman drew from schafer that she was a bank teller who had returned to work four years earlier after raising a family she had no corporate aspirations she just enjoyed the responsibility that came with the job and the interaction with the public after a few more personal questions designed to create a rapport between schafer and the jury freeman moved on to the meat of her testimony asking the witness about the morning of the murder i was running late schafer said i am supposed to be in place at my window at nine i first go to get my bank out of the vault and sign it out so usually i am there by quarter of but on that day i hit traffic on ventura boulevard because of an accident and was very late do you remember exactly how late ms schafer freeman asked yes ten minutes exactly i kept looking at the clock on the dashboard i was running exactly ten minutes behind schedule okay and when you got close to the bank did you see anything out of the ordinary or that caused you concern yes i did and what was that i saw lisa trammel on the sidewalk walking away from the bank i stood and objected saying that the witness would have no idea where the person she claimed was trammel was walking from the judge agreed and sustained what direction was ms trammel walking in freeman asked east and where was she in relation to the bank she was a half a block east of the bank also walking east so she was walking in a direction away from the bank correct yes correct and how close were you when you saw her i was going west on ventura and was in the left lane so that i could move into the turning lane to turn into the entrance to the banks garage so she was three lanes across from me you had your eyes on the road though didnt you no i was stopped at a traffic light when i first saw her so was she at a right angle to you when you saw her yes directly across the street from me and how was it that you knew this woman to be the defendant lisa trammel because her photo is posted in the employee lounge and in the vault plus her photo was shown to bank employees about three months before why was that done because the bank had been granted a restraining order prohibiting her from coming within a hundred feet of the bank we were shown her photo and told to immediately report to our supervisors any sighting of her on bank property can you tell the jury what time it was when you saw lisa trammel walking east on the sidewalk yes i know exactly what time it was because i was running late it was eight fiftyfive so at eight fiftyfive lisa trammel was walking east in a direction that was moving away from the bank correct yes correct freeman asked a few more questions designed to elicit answers that indicated that lisa trammel was only a half block from the bank within a few minutes of the call reporting the murder she finally finished with the witness at and the judge asked if i wanted to take an early lunch and begin my crossexamination afterward judge i think its only going to take me a half hour to handle this id rather go now im ready very well then mr haller proceed i stood up and went to the lectern located between the prosecution table and the jury box i carried a legal pad with me and two display boards i held these so that their displays faced each other and could not be seen i leaned them against the side of the lectern good morning ms schafer good morning you mentioned in your testimony that you were running late because of a traffic accident correct yes did you happen to come upon the accident site while making the commute yes it was just west of van nuys boulevard once i got past it i started to move smoothly which side of ventura was it on that was the thing it was in the eastbound lanes but everybody on my side had to slow down to gawk i made a note on my legal pad and changed direction ms schafer i noticed that the prosecutor forgot to ask you if ms trammel was carrying a hammer when you saw her you didnt see anything like that did you no i didnt but she was carrying a large shopping bag that was more than big enough for a hammer this was the first i had heard about a shopping bag it had not been mentioned in the discovery materials schafer the everhelpful witness was introducing new material or so i thought a shopping bag did you happen to mention this shopping bag during any of your interviews with the police or the prosecutor on this case schafer gave it some thought im not sure i may not have so as far as you remember the police didnt even ask if the defendant was carrying anything i think thats correct i didnt know what that meant or if it meant anything at all but i decided to stay away from the shopping bag for the moment and to steer once again in a new direction you never wanted the witness to know where you were going now ms schafer when you testified just a few minutes ago that you were three lanes from the sidewalk where you supposedly saw the defendant you miscounted didnt you the second abrupt change of subject matter and the question gave her a momentary pause uh no i did not well what cross street were you at when you saw her cedros avenue there are two lanes of eastbound traffic on ventura there arent there yes and then you have a turn lane onto cedros right yes thats right that makes three what about the lane of curbside parking she made an oh come on face thats not a real lane well its space between you and the woman you claim was lisa trammel isnt it if you say so i think thats being picky really i think its just being accurate wouldnt you say i believe most people would say there were three lanes of traffic between me and her well the parking zone lets call it is at least a carlength wide and actually wider correct okay if you want to nitpick call it a fourth lane my mistake it was a grudging if not bitter concession and i was sure that the jury was seeing who the real nitpicker was so then you are now saying that when you supposedly saw ms trammel you wouldve been about four lanes away from her not the three you previously testified to correct correct i said my mistake i made a notation on my legal pad that really didnt mean anything but that i hoped would look to the jurors as though i was keeping some sort of score i then reached down to my display boards separated them and chose one your honor i would like to display for the witness a photograph of the location we are talking about here has the prosecution seen it judge it was contained on the exhibits cd turned over in discovery i did not specifically provide the board to ms freeman and she did not ask to see it freeman made no objection and the judge told me to carry on calling the first board defense exhibit a i set up a folding easel in an open area between the jury box and the witness stand the prosecution planned to use the overhead screens to present exhibits and later i would as well but for this demonstration i wanted to go the oldfashioned way i put the display board up and then returned to the lectern ms schafer do you recognize the photograph i have put on the easel it was a thirtybyfiftyinch aerial view of the twoblock stretch of ventura boulevard in question bullocks had gotten it off google earth and all it cost us was the price of the blowup and the mounting on the board yes it looks like a top view of ventura boulevard and you can see the bank and also the intersection with cedros avenue about a block away yes an aerial view can you please step down and use the marker on the easels ledge to circle the spot where you believe you saw lisa trammel schafer looked at the judge as if to seek permission he nodded his approval and she stepped down she took the black marker from the ledge and circled an area on the sidewalk a half block from the banks entrance thank you ms schafer can you now mark for the jury where your car was located when you looked out the window and supposedly saw lisa trammel she marked a spot in the middle lane that appeared to be at least three car lengths from the crosswalk thank you ms schafer you can return to the witness stand now schafer put the marker back on the ledge and moved back to her seat so how many cars were in front of you at the light would you say at least two maybe three what about the turn lane to your immediate left were there any cars there waiting to turn she was ready for that one and wasnt going to let me trick her no i had a clear view of the sidewalk so it was rush hour and youre telling us there was nobody waiting in the turn lane to get to work not next to me but i was two or three cars back there couldve been someone waiting to turn just not next to me i asked the judge if i could put the second board defense exhibit b on the easel now and he told me to go ahead this was another photo blowup but it was from ground level it was a photo that cisco had taken from a car window while sitting at the traffic light in the middle westbound lane of ventura boulevard at cedros avenue at am on a monday a month after the murder there was a time imprint on the bottom right corner of the image back at the lectern i asked schafer to describe what she saw its a photo of that same block from the ground theres dannys deli we go there sometimes at lunch yes and do you know if dannys is open for breakfast yes it is have you ever been there for breakfast freeman stood to object judge i hardly see what this has to do with the witnesss testimony or the elements of this trial perry looked at me if your honor would give me a moment the relevance will become quite clear carry on but make it quick i refocused on schafer have you had occasion to have breakfast at dannys ms schafer no not breakfast but you do know that it is popular at breakfast correct i really wouldnt know it wasnt the answer i wanted but it was helpful it was the first time schafer was being clearly evasive purposely avoiding the obvious confession jurors who picked up on this would begin to see someone who wasnt being an impartial witness but a woman who refused to stray from the prosecutions line then let me ask you this what other businesses on this block are open before nine oclock in the morning mostly there are stores that wouldnt be open you can see the signs in the picture then what do you think accounts for the fact that every metered space in this photo is taken would it be customers of the deli freeman objected again saying the witness was hardly qualified to answer the question the judge agreed and sustained the objection telling me to move on on the monday morning at eight fiftyfive when you claim you saw ms trammel from four lanes away do you recall how many cars were parked in front of the deli and along the curb no i dont you testified just a few moments ago and i can have it read back to you if you wish that you had a clear view of lisa trammel is it your testimony that there were no vehicles in the parking lane there may have been some cars there but i saw her clearly what about the traffic lanes they were clear too yes i could see her you said you were running late because westbound traffic was moving very slowly because of an accident correct yes an accident in the eastbound lanes right yes so how far was traffic backed up in the eastbound lanes if the westbound lanes were backed up enough to make you ten minutes late for work i dont really recall perfect answer for me a dissembling witness always scores points for the d isnt it true ms schafer that you had to look across two lanes of backedup traffic plus a full parking lane in order to see the defendant on the sidewalk all i know is that i saw her she was there and she was even carrying a big shopping bag you say correct thats right what kind of shopping bag the kind with handles the kind you get in a department store what color was it it was red and could you tell if it was full or empty i couldnt tell and she carried this down at her side or in front of her down at her side with one hand you seem to have a good sense of this bag were you looking at the bag or the face of the woman who was carrying it i had time to look at both i shook my head as i looked at my notes ms schafer do you know how tall ms trammel is i turned to my client and signaled her to stand up i probably should have asked the judges permission first but i was on a roll and didnt want to hit any speed bumps perry said nothing i have no idea schafer said would it surprise you to know she is only five foot three i nodded to lisa and she sat back down no i dont think that would surprise me five foot three and you still picked her out across four lanes packed with cars freeman objected as i knew she would perry sustained the objection but i didnt need an answer for the point to be made i checked my watch and saw it was two minutes before noon i fired my final torpedo ms schafer can you look at the photograph and point to where you see the defendant on the sidewalk all eyes moved to the photo blowup because of the line of cars in the parking lane the pedestrians on the sidewalk were unidentifiable in the image freeman leapt to her feet and objected claiming the defense was trying to sandbag the witness and the court perry called us to a sidebar when we got there he had stern words for me mr haller yes or no is the defendant in the photo no your honor then youre engaged in attempting to trick the witness that will not happen in my courtroom take your photo down judge im not trying to trick anyone she could simply say that the defendant is not in the photo but she clearly cant see the pedestrians on the other side of the traffic and i am trying to make that clear to i dont care what youre trying to do take your photo down and if you try another move like that youre going to find yourself in a contempt hearing at the close of business understood yes sir your honor freeman said the jury should be told that the defendant is not in the photo i agree go back on my way back to the lectern i took the display boards off the easel ladies and gentlemen the judge said let it be noted that the defendant was not in the photo that defense counsel put on display the jury instruction was fine with me i still made my point the fact that the jurors had to be told that lisa was not in the photo underlined how hard it would have been to see and identify someone on the sidewalk the judge told me to continue my crossexamination and i leaned to the microphone no further questions i sat down and put the photo boards on the floor under the table they had served me well i took the hit from the judge but it was worth it its always worth it if you make your point twentythree lisa trammel was ecstatic about my crossexamination of margo schafer even herb dahl couldnt hold back from congratulating me as the trial was recessed for lunch i counseled them not to get overly excited it was early in the trial and eyewitnesses like schafer were usually the easiest to handle and damage on the stand there were still tough witnesses and tougher days ahead they could count on that i dont care lisa said you were marvelous and that lying bitch got just what she deserved the invective was dripping with hate and it made me pause for a moment before responding the prosecutor is still going to have a chance to rehabilitate her on redirect after lunch and then you can destroy her again on recross well i dont know about destroying anybody thats not what can you join us for lunch mickey she punctuated the request by swinging her arm around dahl clearly showing what i had been assuming that they were together in more than just business there is nothing good around here she continued were going down to ventura boulevard to find a place we might even try dannys deli thank you but no i need to get back to the office and meet with my crew theyre not here because they cant be theyre working and i need to check in lisa gave me a look that told me she didnt believe me it didnt much matter to me i represented her in court it didnt mean i had to eat with her and the man i was still sure was scheming to rip her off no matter the romantic entanglementif it even was romantic i headed out on my own and walked back to my office in the victory building lorna had already gone to the competing and far better jerrys famous deli in studio city and picked up turkey and coleslaw sandwiches i ate at my desk while telling cisco and bullocks what had happened that morning in court despite my reserve with my client i felt pretty good about my cross with schafer i thanked bullocks for the display board which i believed had impressed the jury nothing like a visual aid to help throw doubt on a supposed eyewitness when i finished recounting the trial testimony i asked them what they had been working on cisco said he was still reviewing the police investigation looking for errors and assumptions made by the detectives that could be turned against kurlen during crossexamination good i need all the ammo i can get i said bullocks anything from your end i pretty much spent the morning with the foreclosure file i want to be bulletproof when its my turn okay good but youve got some time there my guess is the defense wont start until next week freeman looks like shes trying to keep a certain rhythm and momentum going but shes got a lot of witnesses on her list and it doesnt look like a lot of smoke often prosecutors and defense attorneys pad their witness lists to keep the other side guessing as to who would actually get called and who was important in terms of testimony it didnt appear to me that freeman had engaged in this sort of subterfuge her list was lean and every name on it had something to bring to the case i dipped my sandwich into some thousand island dressing that had dripped onto the paper wrapper aronson pointed to one of the display boards i had brought back with me from court it was the groundlevel shot i had tried to fool margo schafer with wasnt that risky what if freeman hadnt objected i knew she would and if she didnt the judge would have they dont like you trying to trick witnesses like that yeah but then the jury knows youre lying i wasnt lying i asked the witness a question could she point out where lisa was in the photo i didnt say lisa was in the photo if she had been given the opportunity to answer the answer would have been no thats all aronson frowned remember what i said bullocks dont grow a conscience were playing hardball here i played freeman and shes trying to play me maybe she already has played me in some way and i dont even know it i took a risk and got a little handslap from the judge but every person on that jury was looking at that photo while we were at sidebar and every one of them was thinking how hard it would have been for margo schafer to see what she claimed she saw thats how it works its cold and calculating sometimes you win a point but most times you dont i know she said dismissively it doesnt mean i have to like it no you dont twentyfour freeman surprised me after lunch by not calling margo schafer back to the stand to try to repair the damage i had inflicted on cross my guess was that she had something else planned for later that would help salvage the schafer testimony instead she called lapd sergeant david covington who was the first officer to respond to westland national after the call from riki sanchez was logged covington was a seasoned veteran and a solid witness for the prosecution in the precise if not droll delivery of someone who has seen more dead bodies and testified about them more times than he can remember he described arriving on scene and determining that the victim was dead by means of foul play he then described closing access to the entire garage corralling riki sanchez and other possible witnesses and cordoning off the secondfloor area where the body was located through covington the crime scene photographs were introduced and displayed in all their bloody glory on the two overhead flat screens these more than any testimony from covington established the crime of murder a requirement for conviction id had marginal success during a pretrial skirmish involving the crime scene photos i had objected to their introduction particularly the prosecutions plan to display threebythree blowups on easels in front of the jury box i had argued that that they were prejudicial to my client photos of real victims of murder are always shocking and provoke strong emotions it is human nature to want to harshly punish those responsible photos can easily turn a jury against the accused regardless of what evidence connects the accused to the crime perry tried to split the baby he limited the number of photos the prosecution could introduce to four and told freeman she had to use the overhead screens thus limiting the size of the photos i had won a few points but knew that the judges order would not limit the visceral response of the jurors it was still a victory for the prosecution freeman chose the four photos that showed the most blood and the pitiful angle at which bondurant had dropped facefirst onto the concrete floor of the garage on crossexamination i zeroed in on one photo and tried to get the jury thinking about something other than avenging the dead the best way to do that is to plant questions if they are left with questions but no answers then i have done my job on cross with the judges permission i used the projection remote to eliminate three of the photos on the screens leaving only one remaining sergeant covington i want to draw your attention to the photo ive left on display i believe it is marked peoples exhibit three can you tell me what that is in the foreground of the photo yes that is an open briefcase okay and is that how you found it when you arrived at the scene yes it is it was sitting there open like that yes okay and did you make any inquiry of any witness or anyone else to determine if someone had opened it after the victim was discovered i asked the woman who had called nineoneone if she had opened it and she said she had not that was the extent of my inquiry on it i left it for the detectives okay and youve testified here that you have been working patrol for your entire career of twentytwo years correct yes thats correct you have responded to a lot of nineoneone calls yes what did seeing that open briefcase mean to you nothing really it was just part of the crime scene did your experience cause you to think there may have been a robbery involved in this murder not really im not a detective if robbery was not a motive in this crime why would the killer take the time to open the victims briefcase freeman objected before covington could answer she said that the question was beyond the witnesss scope of expertise and experience sergeant covington has spent his entire career working patrol he is not a detective he has never investigated a robbery the judge nodded i tend to agree with ms freeman mr haller your honor sergeant covington may not have ever been a detective but i think it is safe to say he has responded to robbery calls and conducted preliminary investigations i think he can certainly answer a question about his initial impressions of the crime scene im still going to sustain the objection ask your next question defeated on that point i looked down at the notes i had previously worked up for covington i felt confident that i had firmly planted the question about robbery and the motive for the murder in the jurors minds but i didnt want to leave it at that i decided to try a bluff sergeant after you arrived in response to the nineoneone call and surveyed the crime scene did you call for investigators and medical examiners and crime scene experts yes i contacted the com center confirming that we had a homicide and requesting the usual response of investigators from van nuys division and you maintained control of the crime scene until those people arrived yes that is how it works i transferred custody of the scene to the investigators detective kurlen to be exact okay and at any time during this process did you discuss with kurlen or any other law enforcement officer the possibility that the murder had come out of a robbery attempt no i did not are you sure sergeant quite sure i wrote something on my legal pad it was a meaningless scribble done for the jury i have no further questions covington was excused and one of the paramedics who had responded to the nineoneone call testified about confirming that the victim was dead at the scene he was on and off the stand in five minutes as freeman was interested only in confirming death and i had nothing to gain from crossexamination next up was the victims brother nathan bondurant he was used to confirm identification of the victim another requirement for conviction freeman also used him much as she did the crime scene photos to stir emotions in the jury he tearfully described being taken by detectives to the medical examiners office where he identified his younger brothers body freeman asked him when he had last seen his brother alive and his answer brought another torrent of tears as he described attending a lakers basketball game together just a week before the murder its a rule of thumb to leave a crying man alone there usually isnt anything to be gained from crossexamining a victims loved one but freeman had opened a door and i decided to step through it the risk i ran was that jurors might view me as cruel if i went too far in questioning the bereaved family member mr bondurant i am sorry for your familys loss i have only a few quick questions you mentioned that you and your brother went to the lakers game a week before this horrible crime occurred what did you talk about during that outing uh we talked about a lot of things it would be hard to remember everything right now only sports and lakers no of course not we were brothers we talked about a lot of things he asked about my kids i asked if he was seeing anyone things like that was he seeing anyone no not at the time he said he was too busy with work what else did he say about work he just said it was busy he was in charge of home loans and it was a bad time a lot of foreclosures and all of that sort of stuff he didnt really get into it did he talk about his own real estate holdings and what was happening with them freeman objected on relevance i asked for a sidebar and it was granted at the bench i argued that i had already put the jury on notice that i would not only be debunking the states case but putting forward a defense case that included evidence of an alternate theory of the crime this is that alternate theory judge that bondurant was in trouble financially and his efforts to get out of the hole brought about his demise i should be given the latitude to pursue this with any witness the prosecution puts before the jury judge freeman countered just because counsel says something is relevant doesnt mean it is the victims brother has no direct knowledge of mitchell bondurants financial or investment situation if thats the case judge nathan bondurant can say so and ill move on very well overruled ask your question mr haller back at the lectern i asked the witness the question again he spoke very briefly and without going into detail about it the witness replied what exactly did he say he just said that he was upsidedown on his investment properties he didnt say how many that was or how much was involved that was all he said what did that mean to you when he said he was upsidedown that he owed more on his properties than they were worth did he say he was trying to sell them he said he couldnt sell them without taking a bath thank you mr bondurant i have no further questions freeman completed her tour of minor players by calling a witness named gladys pickett who identified herself on the stand as the head teller at westland nationals main branch in sherman oaks after eliciting from pickett what her duties were at the bank freeman got right down to the salient testimony as the person in charge of the tellers at the bank you have how many people reporting to you mrs pickett about forty altogether is one of those people a teller named margo schafer yes margo is one of my tellers i would like to draw your attention back to the morning of mitchell bondurants murder did margo schafer come to you with a particular concern yes she did can you please tell the jury what ms schafer was concerned about she came to me and reported that she had seen lisa trammel just a half block from the bank walking down the sidewalk and moving in a direction away from the bank why was this a concern well we have lisa trammels photograph up in the employees lounge and inside our vault and we have been instructed to report any sighting of lisa trammel to our supervisors do you know why this instruction was put in place yes the bank has a restraining order keeping her away from the property can you tell the jury what time it was when margo schafer told you about seeing ms trammel near the bank yes it was as soon as she came into work that day it was the first thing she did now do you keep a record of when tellers arrive at work i keep a checkout list in the vault on which the time is posted this is when tellers come into the vault and get their money boxes to take to their stations yes thats right on the day in question at what time do you show margo schafers name being checked off it was nine ohnine she was the last one checked in she was late and would that have been when she told you about seeing lisa trammel yes precisely now at that time did you know that mitchell bondurant had been murdered in the banks garage no no one knew that yet because riki sanchez had stayed in the garage until the police came and then they kept her there for questioning we didnt know what was going on so the idea that margo schafer would have concocted the story about seeing lisa trammel after hearing about mr bondurants murder is not possible correct correct she told me about seeing her before she or i or anybody in the bank knew about mr bondurant so at what point did you learn of mr bondurants murder in the garage and offer the information you had received from margo schafer that was about a half hour later thats when we heard and i obviously thought the police needed to know that this woman had been seen nearby thank you mrs pickett i have no further questions it was freemans biggest hit so far pickett had successfully undone much of what i had been able to accomplish with schafer on the stand now i had to decide whether to leave it alone or risk making things worse i decided to cut my losses and move on they say never ask a question you dont already know the answer to the rule applied here pickett had refused to talk to my investigator freeman could be setting a trap leaving her up there with one more piece of information i might stumble into with an illadvised question i have no questions for this witness i said from my place at the defense table judge perry excused pickett and called for the afternoon break of fifteen minutes as people stood to leave the courtroom my client leaned into me at the table why didnt you go after her she whispered who pickett i didnt want to make it worse by asking the wrong thing are you kidding me you needed to destroy her like you did schafer the difference was i had something to work with on schafer i didnt have it on pickett and going after somebody with nothing to go after her with is potential disaster i left it alone i could see anger darkening her eyes well you shouldve gotten something on her it came out as a hiss through what i believed were clenched teeth look lisa im your attorney and i decide never mind i have to go she stood up and hurried through the gate and toward the courtroom exit i glanced over to freeman to see if she had caught the display of attorneyclient disagreement she gave me a knowing smile indicating she had i decided to go out into the hall to see why my client had so abruptly needed to leave i stepped out and was immediately drawn by the cameras to one of the benches that ran along the hallway between courtroom doors the focus was on lisa who was sitting on the bench hugging her son tyler the boy looked extremely uncomfortable in the camera lights jesus christ i whispered i saw lisas sister standing on the periphery of the group and walked over what is this jodie she knows the judge ruled she cant have the kid in court i know hes not going into the courtroom he had a half day at school and she wanted me to bring him by she thought if the media saw her with ty that it might help things i guess yeah well the medias got nothing to do with this dont bring him back i dont care what she says dont bring him back i looked around for herb dahl this had to be his move and i wanted to deliver the same message to him but there was no sign of the erstwhile hollywood player he had probably been smart enough to stay clear of me i headed back into the courtroom i still had ten minutes of the break left and planned to use it brooding about working for a client i didnt like and was beginning to despise twentyfive after the break freeman moved on to what i call the huntergatherer stage of the prosecutions case the crime scene technicians their testimony would be the platform on which she would present detective howard kurlen the lead investigator the first huntergatherer was a coroners investigator named william abbott who had responded to the crime scene and was charged with the bodys documentation and transport to the medical examiners office where the autopsy would be conducted his testimony covered his observations of the crime scene the head wounds sustained by the victim and the personal property found on the body this included bondurants wallet watch loose change and a money clip containing in currency there was also the receipt from the joes joe franchise that had helped investigators set the time of death abbott like covington before him was very matteroffact in his testimony being at the scene of a violent crime was routine for him when it was my turn to ask the questions i zeroed in on this mr abbott how long have you been a coroners investigator im going on twentynine years now all with la county thats right how many murder scenes do you estimate you have been to in that time oh gee probably a couple thousand a lot i bet and i assume many were scenes where great violence was involved thats the nature of the beast what about this scene you examined and photographed the wounds on the victim correct yes i did that is part of the protocol we follow before transporting the body you have a crime scene report in front of you that was admitted into evidence by pretrial agreement could you read the second paragraph of the summary to the jury abbott turned the page on his report and found the paragraph there are three distinct impact wounds on the crown of the head noted for their violence and damage positioning of the body indicates immediate loss of consciousness before impact on the ground then in parentheses i have the word overkill yes im curious about that what did you mean by putting overkill in the summary just that it looked to me like any one of these impacts wouldve done the job the victim was unconscious and possibly even dead before he hit the ground the first blow did that this would indicate that two of the impacts came after he was facedown on the ground it was overkill somebody was very angry at him is the way i was looking at it abbott probably thought he was smartly giving me the answer i most didnt want to hear freeman too but they were wrong so you are indicating in your summary that you detected there was some sort of emotional involvement in this murder correct yes that is what i was thinking what kind of training do you have in terms of homicide investigation well i trained for six months before starting the job way back thirty years ago and we have ongoing inservice training a couple of times a year were taught the latest investigative techniques and so forth is this specific to homicide investigation not all of it but a lot of it is isnt it a basic tenet of homicide that a crime of overkill usually indicates that the victim knew his or her killer that there was a personal relationship uh freeman finally got it she stood and objected saying that abbott was not a homicide investigator and the question called for expertise he did not have i didnt have to argue the judge held his hand up to stop me from speaking and told freeman that i had just walked abbott down the path without objection from the state the investigator had testified to his experience and training in the area of homicide without a peep from freeman you gambled ms freeman you thought it was going to cut your way you cant back out now the witness will answer the question go ahead mr abbott i said abbott stalled by asking for the question to be read to him by the court stenographer he then had to be prompted again by the judge there is that consideration he finally said consideration i asked what does that mean when you have a crime of high violence it should be considered that the victim personally knew his attacker his killer when you say crime of high violence do you mean overkill that could be part of it yes thank you mr abbott now what about other observations you made at the crime scene did you form any opinion in regard to the kind of power it took to make these three brutal strikes on the top of mr bondurants head freeman objected again stating that abbott was not a medical examiner and did not have the expertise to answer the question this time perry sustained the objection giving her a small victory i decided to take what i had gotten and be happy with it no further questions i said next up was paul roberts who was the senior criminalist in the threemember lapd crime scene unit that processed the scene his testimony was less eventful than abbotts because freeman kept him on a short leash he spoke only of procedures and what he collected at the scene and processed later in the sid lab on cross i was able to use the paucity of physical evidence to my clients advantage can you tell the jury the locations of the fingerprints you collected from the scene that were later matched to the defendant there were none that we found can you tell the jury what samples of blood collected at the scene came from the defendant there was none that we found well then what about hair and fiber evidence surely you connected the defendant to the crime scene through hair and fiber evidence correct we did not i took a few steps away from the lectern as if walking off my frustration and then came back mr haller the judge said lets skip the playacting thank you your honor freeman said i wasnt addressing you ms freeman i looked at the jury for a long moment before asking my next and final question in summary sir did you and your team gather a single shred of evidence in that garage that connects lisa trammel to the crime scene in the garage no we didnt thank you then i have nothing further i knew that freeman could hit back hard on redirect by asking roberts about the hammer with bondurants blood on it and the shoe with the same blood on it found in my clients garage he was part of the crime scene crews that handled both places but i was guessing she wouldnt do it she had choreographed the delivery of her case to the last piece of evidence and to change things now would be to knock the case out of rhythm threatening her momentum and the ultimate impact when all things came together she was too good to risk that she would take her lumps now knowing that she would eventually deliver the knockout punch later in the trial ms freeman redirect the judge asked once i had returned to my seat no your honor no redirect the witness may step down i had freemans witness list stapled to the inside flap of a case file on the table in front of me i drew a line through the names abbott and roberts and scanned the names that were left the first day of trial wasnt even quite over and she had already put a sizable dent into the list i scanned the remaining names and determined that detective kurlen was most likely the next witness up but this presented a bit of a problem for the prosecutor i checked my watch it was and court was scheduled to end at if freeman put kurlen on the stand she would just be getting started when the judge recessed for the day it was possible she could lead him toward a revelation that would be nice to have the jury considering overnight but this might entail shuffling the delivery of his testimony and again i didnt think freeman would consider it a worthy trade i scanned the list again to see if she had a floater a witness who could be dropped in anywhere in the prosecutions case i didnt see one and looked across the aisle at the prosecutor unsure what move she would make ms freeman the judge prompted call your next witness please freeman rose from her seat and addressed perry your honor it is expected that the witness i planned to call next will be providing lengthy testimony on both direct and crossexamination i would like to ask for the courts indulgence and allow me to call the witness first thing in the morning so that the jury will not feel a disruption in testimony the judge looked over freemans head at the clock on the rear wall of the courtroom he slowly shook his head no he said no were not going to do that we have more than a half hour of court time left and we are going to use it call your next witness ms freeman yes your honor freeman said the people call gilbert modesto i had been wrong about the floater modesto was head of corporate security at westland national and freeman must have believed his testimony could be dropped into the trial at any point and not be detrimental to momentum and flow after being sworn in and taking his seat on the stand modesto proceeded to outline his experience in law enforcement and his current duties at westland national freeman then brought the questioning around to his actions on the morning of mitchell bondurants slaying when i heard it was mitch the first thing i did was pull the threat file to give to the police he said what is the threat file freeman asked its a file we keep that contains every mailed or emailed threat to the bank or bank personnel it also contains notes on any other kind of threat that comes in through phone or third party or the police we have a protocol for weighing the severity of the threat and we have names that we flag and so forth how familiar are you personally with the threat file very familiar i study it its my job how many names were in that file on the morning of mitchell bondurants murder i didnt count but i would say a couple dozen and these were all considered legitimate threats to the bank and its employees no our rule is that if we get a threat it goes into the file doesnt matter how legitimate it is it goes into the file so most of them are not considered serious just somebody blowing off steam or a little frustration in the file that morning what name was on the top of the list in terms of seriousness of the threat the defendant lisa trammel freeman paused for effect i studied the jury almost all eyes looked toward my client why is that mr modesto did she make a specific threat against the bank or any bank employee no she didnt but she was engaged in a foreclosure fight with the bank and had a history of protesting outside the bank until our lawyers got a temporary restraining order keeping her away it was her actions that were perceived as a threat and it looks like we were right about that i jumped up and objected asking the judge to strike the end of modestos answer as being inflammatory and prejudicial the judge agreed and admonished modesto to keep such opinions to himself do you know mr modesto freeman said whether lisa trammel had made a direct threat against anyone at the bank including mitchell bondurant rule number one was to turn all weaknesses into advantages freeman was asking my questions now robbing me of the chance to inflect them with my own outrage no not specifically but it was our feeling in terms of threat assessment that she was someone we should keep an eye out for thank you mr modesto who did you give this file to within the lapd detective kurlen who was heading up the investigation i went directly to him with it and did you have occasion to speak to detective kurlen again later in the day well we spoke a few times as the investigation was progressing he had questions about the surveillance cameras in the garage and other things was there a second time when you contacted him yes when it came to my attention that one of our employees a teller had reported to her supervisor that she believed she had seen lisa trammel either near or on the bank property that morning i thought that was information the police needed to have so i called detective kurlen and set up an interview for him with the teller and was that margo schafer yes it was freeman ended her direct examination there and turned the witness over to me i decided it would be best to get in and out sow a few seeds and come back to harvest later mr modesto as chief of corporate security at westland did you have access to the foreclosure action the bank was taking against lisa trammel modesto emphatically shook his head no that was a legal case and as such i was not privy to it so when you gave detective kurlen that file with lisa trammels name at the top of the list you wouldnt have known if she was about to lose her house or not correct that is correct you wouldnt have known if the bank was in the process of backing off her foreclosure because it had employed a company engaged in fraudulent activities am i objection freeman shrieked assumes facts not in evidence sustained perry said mr haller be careful here yes your honor mr modesto at the time you gave the threat file to detective kurlen did you mention lisa trammel specifically or did you just hand him the file and let him go through it on his own i told him she was on the top of our list did he ask you why i dont really recall i just remember telling him about her but i cant say for sure whether that was volunteered by me or whether he asked me specifically and at the time you spoke to detective kurlen about lisa trammel as being a threat you had no idea what the status of her foreclosure case was correct yes that is correct so detective kurlen didnt have that information either am i right i cant speak for detective kurlen you would have to ask him dont worry i will i have no further questions at this time i checked the back wall as i returned to my seat it was five minutes before five and i knew we were finished for the day there was always so much that went into prepping for a trial the end of the first day usually was accompanied by a wave of fatigue i was just feeling it start to hit me the judge admonished the jurors to keep an open mind about what they had heard and seen during the day he told them to avoid media reports on the trial and not to discuss the case among themselves or with others he then sent them home my client went off with herb dahl who had returned to the courthouse and i followed freeman through the gate nice start i said to her not bad yourself well we both know you get to pick off the lowhanging fruit at the beginning of a trial then its gone and it gets tough yes its going to get tough good luck haller once in the hallway we went our separate ways freeman down the stairs to the das office and me to the elevator and then back to my office it didnt matter how tired i was i still had work to do kurlen would likely be on the stand all day the next day i was going to be ready twentysix the people call detective howard kurlen andrea freeman turned from the prosecution table where she stood and smiled at the detective as he walked down the aisle two impressively thick blue binders known as murder books under his arm he came through the gate and headed toward the witness stand he looked at ease this was routine for him he put the murder books down on the shelf in front of the witness chair and raised his hand to take the oath he shot me a sideways look at that point outwardly kurlen looked cool calm and collected but we had done this dance before and he had to be wondering what i would be bringing this time kurlen wore a sharply cut navy blue suit with a bright orange tie detectives always put on their best look to testify then i realized something there was no gray in kurlens hair he was closing in on sixty and had no gray he had dyed it for the tv cameras vanity i wondered if it was something i could use as an edge when it was my turn to ask him questions after kurlen was sworn in he took the witness seat and made himself comfortable hed probably be there the whole day and maybe longer he poured himself a glass of water from the pitcher set up by the judges clerk took a sip and looked at freeman he was ready to go good morning detective kurlen i would like to start this morning with you telling the jury a little bit about your experience and history id be glad to kurlen said with a warm smile i am fiftysix years old and i joined the lapd twentyfour years ago after spending ten years in the marines i have been a homicide detective assigned to the van nuys division for the past nine years before that i spent three years working homicides at the foothill division how many homicide investigations have you worked this case is my sixtyfirst homicide i was a detective assigned to investigations of other crimesrobbery burglary and auto theftfor six years before moving to homicide freeman was standing at the lectern she flipped back a page on a legal pad ready to move on to what mattered detective lets begin on the morning of the murder of mitchell bondurant can you walk us through the initial stages of the case smart move saying us implying that the jury and prosecutor were part of the same team i had no doubts about freemans skills and she would be at her sharpest with her lead detective on the stand she knew that if i could damage kurlen the whole thing might come tumbling down i was at my desk at about nine fifteen when the detective lieutenant came to me and my partner detective cynthia longstreth and said a homicide had occurred in the parking garage of the westland national headquarters on ventura boulevard detective longstreth and i immediately rolled on it you went to the scene yes immediately we arrived at nine thirty and took control of the scene what did that entail well the first priority is to preserve and collect the evidence from the crime scene the patrol officers had already taped off the area and were keeping people away once we were satisfied that everything was covered there we divvied up responsibilities i left my partner in charge of overseeing the crime scene investigation and i would conduct preliminary interviews of the witnesses the patrol officers were holding for questioning detective longstreth is a less experienced detective than you correct yes she has been working homicide investigations with me for three years why did you give the junior member of your team the very important job of overseeing the crime scene investigation i did it that way because i knew that the crime scene people and the coroners investigator who were on scene were all veterans with many years on the job and that cynthia would be with good experienced hands freeman then led kurlen through a series of questions about his interviews with the gathered witnesses starting with riki sanchez who had discovered the body and called kurlen was at ease on the stand and almost folksy in his delivery the word that came to mind was charming i didnt like charming but i had to bide my time i knew it might be the end of the day before i got the chance to go after kurlen in the meantime i had to hope that by then the jury hadnt fallen completely in love with him freeman was smart enough to know you cant keep a jurys attention with charm alone eventually she moved out of the scenesetting preliminaries and started to deliver the case against lisa trammel detective was there a time during the investigation when the defendants name became known to you yes there was the banks head of security came to the garage and asked to see me or my partner i spoke to him briefly and then accompanied him to his office where we reviewed video from the cameras located at the vehicle entrance and exits to the garage and in the elevators and did the review of those videos provide you with any investigative leads nothing initially i saw no one carrying a weapon or acting in a suspicious way before or after the approximate time of the murder nobody running from the garage there was nothing suspicious about the vehicles going in and out of course we would run every license plate but there was nothing on video upon that initial viewing that helped us and of course the actual murder itself was not captured by any camera that was another detail that the perpetrator of the crime seemed to be aware of i rose and objected to kurlens last line and the judge struck it from the record and told the jury to ignore it detective freeman prompted i believe you were going to tell us how lisa trammels name first came up in the investigation yes right well mr modesto the bank security chief also provided me with a file what he called the threatassessment file he turned that over to me and it contained several names including the name of the defendant then just a short while later mr modesto called me and informed me that lisa trammel one of the people listed in the file happened to be seen that morning in close proximity to the bank the defendant and so this was how her name came up in the investigation correct correct what did you do with this information detective i first returned to the crime scene i then sent my partner to interview the witness who said she saw lisa trammel near the bank it was important that we confirm that sighting and get the details i then began to go through the threatassessment file to study all of the names and the details of the perceived threats and did you draw any immediate conclusions i didnt believe there was any individual listed who would immediately jump to the level of a person of interest based solely on what was reported in the file about them and their disputes with the bank obviously they would all have to be looked at carefully however lisa trammel did rise to the level of being a person of interest because i knew from mr modesto that she had allegedly been seen in the vicinity of the bank at the time of the murder so lisa trammels time and geographic proximity to the murder was key to your thinking at this point yes because proximity could mean access it appeared from the crime scene that someone had been waiting for the victim he had an assigned parking space with his name on the wall there was a large support column next to the space our initial theory was that the killer had hidden behind the column and waited for mr bondurant to pull in and park it appeared that he was struck the first time from behind just as he left his car thank you detective freeman led her witness through a few more of the steps taken at the crime scene before bringing the focus back to lisa trammel did your partner return to the crime scene at some point to report back about her interview with the bank employee who claimed to have seen lisa trammel near the bank yes she did my partner and i felt that the identification made by the witness was solid we then discussed lisa trammel and the need for us to speak to her quickly but detective you had a crime scene investigation under way and a file full of the names of people who had made threats against the bank or its employees why the urgency involving lisa trammel kurlen leaned back in his witness chair and adopted the pose of a wise and wily old veteran well there were a couple things that gave us a sense of urgency in regard to ms trammel first of all her dispute with the bank was over the foreclosure of her property that put her dispute specifically in the home loan division the victim mr bondurant was a senior vice president directly in charge of the home loan division so we were looking at that connection additionally and more importantly let me interrupt you there detective you called that a connection did you know if the victim and lisa trammel knew each other not at that point no what we knew was that ms trammel had a history of protesting the foreclosure of her home and that the foreclosure action was initiated by mr bondurant the victim but we did not know at that time whether these two people knew each other or had ever even met it was a smooth move bringing out the deficiencies in her case to the jury before i did it made it harder for the defense to make its case okay detective freeman said i interrupted you when you were going to tell us a second reason for having some urgency in regard to ms trammel what i wanted to explain is that a murder investigation is a fluid situation you must move carefully and cautiously but at the same time you must go where the case takes you if you dont then evidence could be at riskand possibly other victims we felt there was a need to make contact with lisa trammel at this point in the investigation we couldnt wait we could not give her time to destroy evidence or harm other persons we had to move i checked the jury kurlen was giving one of his best performances ever he held every eye in the jury box if clegg mcreynolds ever made a movie maybe kurlen should play himself so what did you do detective we ran a check on lisa trammels drivers license got her address in woodland hills and proceeded to her home who was left at the crime scene several people our coordinator and all the sid techs and the coroners people they still had a lot to do and we were waiting on them anyway going to lisa trammels house in no way compromised the scene or the investigation your coordinator whos that the detectivethree in charge of the homicide unit jack newsome he was the supervisor on scene i see so what happened when you got to ms trammels home was she there yes she was we knocked and she answered can you take us through what happened next we identified ourselves and said we were conducting an investigation of a crime didnt say what it was just said it was serious we asked if we could come inside to ask her a few questions she said yes so we entered i felt a vibration in my pocket and knew i had received a text on my cell phone i slipped it out of my pocket and held it down below the table so the judge would not see it the message was from cisco need to talk show you something i texted back and we had a quick digital conversation you verify the letter no something else still working the letter then after court get me the letter i put the phone away and went back to watching freemans direct examination the letter in question had come in the afternoon before in the mail to my po box it came anonymously but if its contents could be confirmed by cisco i would have a new weapon a powerful weapon what was ms trammels demeanor when you met her freeman asked she seemed pretty calm to me kurlen said she didnt seem particularly curious about why we wanted to talk to her or what the crime was she was nonchalant about the whole thing where did you and your partner speak to her she walked us into the kitchen where there was a table and she invited us to sit down she asked if we wanted water or coffee and we both said no and you started asking her questions then yes we started by asking if she had been in the house all morning she said she had been except for when she drove her son to school in sherman oaks at eight i asked if she had made any other stops on the way home and she said no and what did that mean to you well that somebody was lying we had the witness who put her near the bank at close to nine so somebody was wrong or somebody was lying what did you do at that point i asked if she would be willing to come with us to the police station where she would be interviewed and asked to look at some photographs she said yes and we took her to van nuys did you first apprise her of her constitutional rights not to speak to you without an attorney present not at that time she was not a suspect at this point she was simply a person of interest whose name had come to the surface i didnt believe that we needed to give her the rights warning until we crossed that threshold we werent close to being there yet we had a discrepancy between what she told us and what a witness had told us we needed to explore that further before anybody became a suspect freeman was at it again trying to patch holes before i could tear them open it was frustrating but there was nothing i could do about it i was busy writing down questions i would later ask kurlen ones that freeman wouldnt anticipate skillfully freeman led kurlen back to van nuys station and the interview room where he had sat with my client she used him to introduce the video of the session it was played for the jury on two overhead screens aronson had ably argued against showing the interview but to no avail judge perry had allowed it we could appeal after conviction but success there was a long shot i had to turn things now i had to find a way to make the jury see it as an unfair process a trap into which my innocent client had stumbled the video was shot from an overhead angle and the defense scored a minor point right off the bat because howard kurlen was a big man and lisa trammel was small sitting across a table from trammel kurlen looked like he was crowding her cornering her even bullying her this was good this was part of a theme i planned to put into my crossexamination the audio was clear and the sound crisp over my objection the jurors as well as the other players in the trial had been given transcripts with which to read along i had objected because i didnt want the jurors reading i wanted them watching i wanted them to see the big man bullying the little woman there was sympathy to be gained there but not in the words on the page kurlen started casually announcing the names of those in the room and asking trammel if she was there voluntarily my client said that she was but the starkness and angle of the video belied her words she looked like she was being held in a prison why dont we start with you telling us about your movements today kurlen asked next starting when trammel responded how about with the moment you woke up trammel outlined her early morning routine of waking and preparing her son for school then driving him there the boy attended a private school and the drive usually ranged from twenty to forty minutes depending on traffic she said she stopped after the dropoff to get coffee and then she went back home you told us at your home you didnt make any stops now you stopped for coffee i guess i forgot where a place called joes joe on ventura a veteran interrogator kurlen abruptly went in a new direction keeping his quarry off guard did you go by westland national this morning no is that what this is about so if someone said they saw you there they would be lying yes who said that i have not violated the order you do you know mitchell bondurant know him no i know of him i know who he is but i dont know him did you see him today trammel paused here and this was detrimental to her cause on the video you could see the wheels working she was considering whether to tell the truth i glanced at the jury i didnt see one face that wasnt turned up toward the screens yes i saw him but you just said you didnt go on westland property i didnt look i dont know who told you they saw me at the bank and if it was him then hes a liar i wasnt there i saw him yes but that was at the coffee shop not the why didnt you tell us that this morning at your home tell you what you didnt ask have you changed clothes since this morning what did you change clothes this morning after you got back home look what is this you asked me to come down to talk and this is some sort of setup i have not violated the order i did you attack mitchell bondurant what kurlen didnt answer he just stared at trammel as her mouth came open in a perfect o i checked the jury all eyes were still on the screens i hoped they saw what i saw genuine shock on my clients face is thatmitchell bondurant was attacked is he all right no actually hes dead and at this point i want to advise you of your constitutional rights kurlen read trammel the miranda rights warning and trammel said the magic words the smartest four words to ever come out of her mouth i want my attorney that ended the interview and the video concluded with kurlen placing trammel under arrest for murder and that was how freeman ended kurlens testimony she surprised me by abruptly saying she was finished with the witness and then sitting down she still had the search of my clients house to cover with the jury and the hammer but it looked like she wouldnt be using kurlen for these it was and the judge broke for an early lunch that gave me an hour and fifteen minutes to make final preparations for kurlen once more we were about to do the jury dance twentyseven i stepped over to the lectern carrying two thick files and my trusty legal pad the files were superfluous to my crossexamination but my hope was that they would make an impressive prop i took my time organizing everything on top of the lectern i wanted kurlen to dangle my plan was to treat him in the same manner he had treated my client bobbing and weaving jabbing with the left when he was expecting the right a hitandrun mission freeman had made the smart play breaking up the testimony between the partners i wouldnt get the chance to make a cohesive attack on the case through just kurlen i would have to deal with him now and his partner longstreth much later case choreography was one of freemans strong points and she was showing it here anytime mr haller the judge prompted yes your honor just getting my notes in order good afternoon detective kurlen i wonder if we could start by going back to the crime scene did you whatever you want yes thank you how long were you and your partner at the crime scene before you went off to chase down lisa trammel well i wouldnt call it chasing her down we is that because she wasnt a suspect thats one of the reasons she was just a person of interest is that what you call it thats right so then how long were you at the crime scene before you left to find this woman who was not a suspect but only a person of interest kurlen referred to his notes my partner and i arrived at the crime scene at nine twentyseven and one or both of us were there until we left together at ten thirtynine thats an hour and twelve minutes you spent only seventytwo minutes at the crime scene before feeling the need to leave to pick up a woman who was not even a suspect do i have that right its one way to look at it how did you look at it detective first of all leaving the crime scene was not an issue because the crime scene was under the control and direction of the homicide squad coordinator several technicians from the scientific investigation division were also on hand our job was not the crime scene our job was to follow the leads wherever they took us and they led us at that point to lisa trammel she wasnt a suspect when we went to see her but she became one when she started giving inconsistent and contradictory statements during the interview youre talking about the interview back at van nuys division yes thats correct okay then what were the inconsistent and contradictory statements you just mentioned at her house she said she made no stops after dropping the kid off at the station she suddenly remembers getting coffee and seeing the victim there she says she wasnt near the bank but we had a witness who put her a half a block away that was the big one right there i smiled and shook my head like i was dealing with a simpleton detective youre kidding us right kurlen gave me the first look of annoyance it was just what i wanted if it was perceived as arrogance it would be all the better when i humiliated him no i am not kidding kurlen said i take my job very seriously i asked the judge to allow me to replay a portion of the trammel interview permission granted i fastforwarded the playback keeping my eye on the time code at the bottom i slowed it to normal play just in time for the jury to watch the exchange centering on trammels denial of being near westland national did you go by westland national this morning no is that what this is about so if someone said they saw you there they would be lying yes who said that i have not violated the order you do you know mitchell bondurant know him no i know of him i know who he is but i dont know him did you see him today yes i saw him but you just said you didnt go on westland property i didnt look i dont know who told you they saw me at the bank and if it was him then hes a liar i wasnt there i saw him yes but that was at the coffee shop not the why didnt you tell us that this morning at your home tell you what you didnt ask i stopped the video and looked at kurlen detective where is it that lisa trammel contradicts herself she says right there that she wasnt near the bank and we have a witness who says she was so you have a contradiction between two statements by different people but lisa trammel did not contradict herself correct you are talking semantics can you answer the question detective yes right a contradiction between two statements kurlen didnt consider the distinction important but i hoped the jury would isnt it true detective that lisa trammel has never contradicted her statement that she was not near the bank on the day of the murder i wouldnt know i am not privy to everything she has ever said since then now he was just being churlish which was fine by me okay then as far as you know detective has she ever contradicted that very first statement to you that she was not near the bank no thank you detective i asked the judge if i could replay another segment of the video and was granted permission i moved the video back to a time spot early in the interview and froze it i then asked the judge if i could put one of the prosecutions crime scene photos on one of the overhead screens while leaving the video on the other the judge gave me the goahead the crime scene photo i put up was a wideangle shot that took in almost the entire crime scene the tableau included bondurants body as well as his car the open briefcase and the spilled cup of coffee on the ground detective let me draw your attention to the crime scene photo marked peoples exhibit three can you describe what you see in the foreground you mean the briefcase or the body what else detective youve got the spilled coffee and the evidence marker on the left is where they found a tissue fragment later identified as coming from the victims scalp you cant really see that in the photo i asked the judge to strike the part of the answer concerning the tissue fragment as nonresponsive i had asked kurlen to describe what he could see in the photo not what he couldnt see the judge didnt agree and let the whole answer stand i shook it off and tried again detective can you read what it says on the side of the coffee cup yes it says joes joe its a gourmet coffee shop about four blocks from the bank very good detective your eyes are better than mine maybe because they look for the truth i looked at the judge and spread my hands like a baseball manager who just saw a fastball down the pipe called a ball before i could verbally react the judge was all over kurlen detective perry barked you know better than that im sorry your honor kurlen said contritely his eyes holding on mine mr haller somehow always seems to bring out the worst in me thats no excuse another one like that and you and i are going to have a serious problem it wont happen again judge i promise the jury will disregard the witnesss comment mr haller proceed and take us away from this thank you your honor ill do my best detective when you were at the crime scene for seventytwo minutes before leaving to question ms trammel did you determine whose coffee cup that was well we later found out that no no no i didnt ask you what you later found out detective i asked you about those first seventytwo minutes when you were at the crime scene during that time before you went to lisa trammels house in woodland hills did you know whose coffee that was no we had not determined that yet okay so you didnt know who dropped that coffee at the crime scene correct objection asked and answered freeman said it was a useless objection but she had to do something to try to knock me out of rhythm ill allow it the judge said before i could respond you can answer the question detective did you know who dropped that cup of coffee at the crime scene not at that time i went back to the video and played the segment i had cued and ready to go it was from the early part of the interview when trammel was recounting her routine activities during the morning of the murder you stopped for coffee i guess i forgot where did you stop to get the coffee a place called joes joe its on van nuys boulevard right by the intersection with ventura do you remember did you get a large or small cup large i drink a lot of coffee i stopped the video tell me something now detective why did you ask what size coffee she got at joes joe you throw out a big net you go for as many details as you can was it not because you believed the coffee cup found at the scene of the murder might have been lisa trammels that was one possibility at that point did you count this as one of those admissions from lisa trammel i thought it was significant at that point in the conversation i wouldnt call it an admission but then under further questioning she told you she saw the victim at the coffee shop correct correct so didnt that change your thinking on the coffee cup at the scene it was just additional information to consider it was very early in the investigation we had no independent information that the victim had been in the coffee shop we had this one persons statement but it was inconsistent with the statement of a witness we had already spoken to so we had lisa trammel saying she saw mitchell bondurant at the coffee shop but that didnt make it a fact we still needed to confirm that and later we did but do you see where what you considered an inconsistency early in the interview turned out to be totally consistent with the facts later in this one instance kurlen would give no quarter he knew i was trying to back him up to the edge of a cliff his job was to keep from going over in fact detective wouldnt you say that when all was said and done the only thing inconsistent about the interview with lisa trammel was that she said she wasnt near the bank and you had a witness who claimed she was its always easy to look back with twentytwenty vision but that one inconsistency was and is pretty important a reliable witness put her close to the scene of the crime at the time of the crime that hasnt changed since day one a reliable witness based on one short interview with margo schafer she was deemed a reliable witness i put the proper mix of outrage and confusion in my voice freeman objected saying that i was simply badgering the witness because i was not getting the answers i wanted the judge overruled but it was a good message for her to get to the jurythe idea that i wasnt getting what i wanted because in fact i was the first interview with margo schafer was short kurlen said but she was reinterviewed several times by several investigators her observations on that day have not changed one iota i believe she saw what she said she saw good for you detective i said lets go back to the coffee cup did there come a time that you came to a conclusion as to whose coffee was spilled and left at the crime scene yes we found a joes joe receipt in the victims pocket for a large cup of coffee purchased that morning at eight twentyone once we found that we believed that the coffee cup at the crime scene was his this was later confirmed by fingerprint analysis he got out of the car with it and dropped it when he was attacked from behind i nodded making sure the jury understood that i was indeed getting the answers i wanted what time was it when that receipt was found in the victims pocket kurlen checked his notes and didnt find an answer i am not sure because the receipt was found by the coroners investigator who was in charge of checking the victims pockets and securing all property that had been on the victims person this would have been done before the body was transported to the coroners office but it was well after you and your partner took off in pursuit of lisa trammel correct we didnt take off in pursuit of trammel but the discovery of the receipt would have been after we left to talk to trammel did the coroners investigator call you and tell you about the receipt no did you find out about the receipt before or after you arrested lisa trammel for murder after but there was other evidence in support of thank you detective just answer the question i ask if you dont mind i dont mind telling the truth good thats what were here for now wouldnt you agree that you arrested lisa trammel on the basis of inconsistent and contradictory statements that later turned out to be in fact consistent and not in contradiction with the evidence and the facts of the case kurlen answered as if by rote we had the witness who placed her near the scene of the crime at the time of the crime and thats all you had correct there was other evidence tying her to the murder we have her hammer and im talking about at the time of her arrest i yelled please answer the question i ask you detective hey the judge exclaimed theres only one person whos going to be allowed to raise their voice in my courtroom and mr haller you arent that person im sorry your honor could you please instruct the witness to answer the questions he is asked and not those that are not asked consider the witness so advised proceed mr haller i paused for a moment to collect myself and swept my eyes across the jury i was looking for sympathetic reactions but i didnt see any not even from furlong who didnt meet my eyes with his i looked back at kurlen you just mentioned the hammer the defendants hammer this was evidence you didnt have at the time of the arrest correct thats correct isnt it true that once you made the arrest and realized that the inconsistent statements you relied upon were not actually inconsistent you began looking for evidence to fit your theory of the case not true at all we had the witness but we still kept a wideopen view of this thing we werent wearing blinders i wouldve been happy to drop the charges against the defendant but the investigation was ongoing and the evidence that we started accumulating and evaluating did not cut her way not only that but you had motive too didnt you the victim was foreclosing on the defendants house as far as motive went that looked pretty strong to me but you were not privy to the details of that foreclosure only that there was a foreclosure in process correct yes and that there was a temporary restraining order against her too you mean you are saying that the restraining order itself was a motive to kill mitchell bondurant no thats not what im saying and not what i mean im just saying it was part of the whole picture the whole picture adding up at that point to a rush to judgment correct detective freeman jumped up and objected and the judge sustained it that was okay i wasnt interested in kurlens answer to the question i was only interested in putting the question in each jurors mind i checked the rear wall of the courtroom and saw that it was three thirty i told the judge that i was going to move in a new direction with my crossexamination and that it might be a good time to take the afternoon break the judge agreed and dismissed the jury for fifteen minutes i sat back down at the defense table and my client reached over and squeezed my forearm with a powerful grip youre doing so good she whispered well see theres still a long way to go she pushed her chair back to get up are you going for coffee she asked no i need to make a call you go just remember no talking to the media dont talk to anybody i know mickey loose lips sink ships you got it she left the table then and i watched her head out of the courtroom i didnt see her constant companion herb dahl anywhere i pulled my phone and called ciscos cell number he answered right away im out of time cisco i need the letter you got it what do you mean its confirmed totally legit were lucky were talking on the phone whys that boss because i might have to kiss you for this uh that wont be necessary twentyeight i used the last few minutes of the break to prepare the second part of my crossexamination of kurlen ciscos news was going to send a wave through the whole trial how i handled the new information with kurlen would impact the rest of the trial soon everyone was back in the courtroom and i was at the lectern and ready to go i had one last item on my list to hit before i got to the letter detective kurlen lets go back to the crime scene photo you see on the screen did you identify the ownership of the briefcase that was found open next to the victims body yes it had the victims property in it and his initials engraved on the brass locking plate it was his and when you arrived at the crime scene and saw the open briefcase next to the body what were your initial impressions of it none i try to keep an open mind about everything especially when i first come into a case did you think the open briefcase could mean that robbery was a motive for the murder among many possibilities yes did you think here is a banker dead and an open briefcase next to him i wonder what the killer was after i had to think of that as a possible scenario but as i said it was thank you detective freeman objected saying i was not giving the witness time to fully answer the question the judge agreed and let kurlen finish i was just saying that the possibility of this being a robbery was just one scenario leaving the briefcase open could just as easily have been a move to make it look like a robbery when it wasnt i pushed on without losing a beat did you determine what was taken from the briefcase as far as we knew then and know now nothing was taken from it but there was no inventory as to what should have been in the briefcase we had mr bondurants secretary look at his files and work product to see if she could determine if anything was missing like a file or something she found nothing missing then do you have any explanation for why it was left open as i said before it could have been done as misdirection but we also believe there is a good chance that the case sprung open when it was dropped on the concrete during the attack i put my incredulous look on and how did you come to that determination sir the briefcase has a faulty locking mechanism any sort of jarring of the case could lead to its release we conducted experiments with the case and found that when it was dropped to a hard surface from a height of three feet or more it sprung open about one out of every three times i nodded and acted like i was computing this information for the first time even though i already had it from one of the investigative reports received in discovery so what youre saying is that there was a one in three chance that the briefcase came open on its own when mr bondurant dropped it thats correct and you called that a good chance correct a solid chance and of course there was a greater chance that that was not how the briefcase came open right you can look at it that way there is a greater chance that someone opened the briefcase correct again you can look at it that way but we determined that nothing was missing from the briefcase so there was no apparent reason for it to have been opened except to create a misdirection of some kind our working theory was that it sprung open when it was dropped do you notice in the crime scene photograph detective that none of the contents of the case have fallen out and onto the pavement thats correct do you have an inventory of the briefcase in your binder there that you can read to us kurlen took his time finding it and then read it to the jury the briefcase contained six files five pens an ipad a calculator an address book and two blank notebooks when you conducted your tests in which you dropped the briefcase to the ground to see about the possibility of it popping open did the case have the same contents it had similar contents yes and on the times that the case popped open how often did all the contents remain inside it not every time but most of the time it definitely could have happened was that the scientific conclusion to your scientific experiment detective it was done in the lab it wasnt my experiment with a pen and a noticeable wrist flourish i made several check marks on my legal pad i then moved on to the most important avenue of my crossexamination detective i said you told us earlier today that you received a threatassessment file from westland national and that it contained information about the defendant did you ever check out any of the other names in the file we reviewed the file several times and did some limited followup but as evidence came in against the defendant we saw less and less of a need to you werent going to go chasing rainbows when you had your suspect already in hand is that it i wouldnt put it that way our investigation was thorough and exhaustive did this thorough and exhaustive investigation include pursuing any other leads at any time that did not involve lisa trammel as a suspect of course thats what the job involves did you review mr bondurants work product and look for any leads unrelated to lisa trammel yes we did you have testified about investigating threats made against the victim in this case did you investigate any threats he might have made against others where the victim threatened someone else not that i recall i asked the courts permission to approach the witness with defense exhibit i handed copies to all parties freeman objected but she was simply going through the motions the issue regarding bondurants letter of complaint to louis opparizio had already been decided during pretrial arguments perry was allowing it if only to even the score for allowing the state to enter the hammer and the dna he overruled freemans objection and told me i could proceed detective kurlen you hold a letter sent by certified mail from mitchell bondurant the victim to louis opparizio president of aloft a contracted vendor to westland national could you please read the letter to the jury kurlen stared at the page i gave him for a long moment before reading dear louis attached you will find correspondence from an attorney named michael haller who is representing the home owner in one of the foreclosure cases you are handling for westland her name is lisa trammel and the loan number is ohfourohninesevenonenine the mortgage is jointly held by jeffrey and lisa trammel in his letter mr haller makes allegations that the file is replete with fraudulent actions perpetrated in the case you will note that he gives specific instances all of which were carried out by aloft as you know and we have discussed there have been other complaints these new allegations against aloft if true have put westland in a vulnerable position especially considering the governments recent interest in this aspect of the mortgage business unless we come to some sort of arrangement and understanding in regard to this i will be recommending to the board that westland withdraw from its contract with your company for cause and any ongoing business be terminated this action would also require the bank to file an sar with appropriate authorities please contact me at your earliest convenience to further discuss these matters kurlen held the letter out to me as if he was finished with it i ignored the gesture thank you detective now the letter mentions the filing of an sar do you know what that is a suspicious activity report all banks are required to file them with the federal trade commission if such activity comes to their attention have you ever before seen the letter you hold detective yes i have when while reviewing the victims work product i noticed it then can you give me a date when this happened not an exact date i would say i became aware of this letter about two weeks into the investigation and that would have been two weeks after lisa trammel was already arrested for the murder did you investigate further upon becoming aware of this letter maybe talk to louis opparizio at some point i made inquiries and learned that mr opparizio had a solid alibi for the time of the killing i left it at that what about the people working for opparizio did they all have alibis i dont know you dont know thats right i did not pursue this because it appeared to be a business dispute and not a legitimate motive for murder i do not view this letter as a threat you did not consider it unusual that in this day of instant communication the victim chose to send a certified letter instead of an email or a text or a fax not really there were several other copies of letters sent by certified mail it seemed to be a way of doing business and keeping a record of it i nodded fair enough do you know if mr bondurant ever filed a suspicious activity report in regard to louis opparizio or his company i checked with the federal trade commission he did not did you check with any other government agency to see if louis opparizio or his company were the subject of an investigation as best i could there was nothing as best you could and so this whole thing was a dead end to you correct thats correct you checked with the ftc and you ran down a mans alibi but then dropped it you already had a suspect and the case against her was easy and just fell right into place for you correct a murder case is never easy you have to be thorough you can leave no stone unturned what about the us secret service did you leave that stone unturned the secret service im not sure what you mean did you have any interaction with the us secret service during this investigation no i didnt how about the us attorneys office in los angeles i did not i cant speak for my partner or other colleagues who worked the case it was a good answer but not good enough in my peripheral vision i could see that freeman had moved to the edge of her seat ready for the right moment to object to my line of questioning detective kurlen do you know what a federal target letter is freeman leapt to her feet before kurlen could respond she objected and asked for a sidebar i think wed better step back into chambers for this the judge said i want the jury and court personnel to stay in place while i confer with counsel mr haller ms freeman lets go i pulled a document and the attached envelope from one of my files and followed freeman toward the door that led to the judges chambers i was confident that i was about to tilt the case in the defenses direction or i was headed to jail for contempt twentynine judge perry was not a happy jurist he didnt even bother to go behind his desk and sit down we entered his chambers and he immediately turned on me and folded his arms across his chest he stared hard at me and waited for his court reporter to take a seat and set up her machine before he spoke okay mr haller ms freeman is objecting because my guess is that this is the first shes heard about the secret service and the us attorneys office and a federal target letter and what it all may or may not have to do with this case im objecting myself because its the first i remember any mention of the federal government and im not going to allow you to go on a federal fishing trip in front of the jury now if you have something i want an offer of proof on it right now and then i want to know why ms freeman doesnt know anything about it thank you judge freeman said indignantly hands on her hips i tried to defuse the situation a bit by casually stepping away from our tight grouping and moving toward the window with the view that rolled up the side of the santa monica mountains i could see the cantilevered homes along the crest they looked like matchboxes ready to drop with the next earthquake i knew what that was like clinging to the edge your honor my office received an anonymously sent envelope in the mail that contained a copy of a federal target letter addressed to louis opparizio and aloft it informed him that he and his company were the target of an investigation into fraudulent foreclosure practices undertaken on behalf of his client banks i held up the document and envelope i have the letter right here it is dated two weeks before the murder and just eight days after the letter of complaint bondurant sent to opparizio when did you receive this supposedly anonymous envelope freeman asked her voice dripping with skepticism it turned up yesterday in my po box but wasnt opened until last night if counsel does not believe me i will have my office manager come over and you can ask her any question you like shes the one who went to the box let me see it the judge demanded i handed perry the letter and envelope freeman moved in close to him to read it as well it was a short letter and he soon gave it back to me without asking freeman if she was finished reading you shouldve brought this up this morning the judge said at the very least you should have provided a copy to opposing counsel and told her you planned to introduce it judge i would have but its obviously a photocopy and it came in the mail ive been sandbagged before we probably all have i needed to verify the document and make sure it was legitimate before i told anyone i didnt get that confirmation until less than an hour ago during the afternoon break what was the source of the confirmation freeman asked before the judge could i dont know the exact details my investigator simply told me that the letter was confirmed by the feds as legitimate if you want further detail i can also call in my investigator that wont be necessary because i am sure ms freeman will want to do her own due diligence but bringing it up in crossexamination was far out of line mr haller you should have informed the court this morning that you had received something in the mail that you were in the process of checking out and planned to introduce in court you blindsided the state and the court i apologize your honor my intention was to handle it properly i guess it was a learned behavior seeing how the state has blindsided me at least twice so far with surprise evidence and questions about timing and chain of custody perry gave me a hard look but i knew he got the point ultimately i believed he was a fair judge and would act accordingly he knew the letter was legitimate and vital to the defenses case basic fairness held that i be allowed to pursue it freeman read the same thing i did and tried to head the judge off your honor its four fifteen i request that court be adjourned for the day so that the prosecution can digest this new material and be adequately prepared to proceed in the morning perry shook his head i dont like losing court time he said i dont either judge freeman responded but no doubt as you just said ive been blindsided here counsel should have brought this information forward this morning you cannot allow him to just proceed with it without the prosecution being prepared and conducting its own confirmation and due diligence as to the context of this information i am asking for fortyfive minutes judge surely the state is entitled to that the judge looked at me for opposing argument i held my hands wide doesnt matter to me judge she can take all the time in the world but it doesnt change the fact that opparizio was and is under federal investigation for his dealings with westland among other banks that would make the victim in this case a potential witness against himthe letter we introduced earlier makes that clear the police and prosecution completely missed this aspect of the case and now ms freeman wants to blame the messenger for their shallow invest okay mr haller were not in front of the jury here perry said cutting me off i understand your point im going to adjourn early today but well start at nine sharp tomorrow and i expect all parties to be prepared and for there to be no further delays thank you your honor freeman said lets go back perry said and we did my client was clinging to me as we left the courthouse she wanted to know what other details i had about the federal investigation herb dahl trailed behind us like the tail on a kite i was uncomfortable speaking to both of them look i dont know what it means lisa thats one reason why the judge broke early today so both the defense and the prosecution can do some work on it you have to just back off for a bit and let me and my staff handle it but this could be it right mickey what do you mean it the evidence that shows it wasnt methat proves it i stopped and turned to her her eyes were searching my face for any sign of affirmation something about her desperation made me think for the first time that she may have truly been framed for bondurants murder but that wasnt like me to believe in innocence look lisa i am hoping that it will very clearly demonstrate to the jury that there is a strong alternate possibility complete with motive and opportunity but you need to calm down and recognize that it might not be evidence of anything i expect that the prosecution is going to come in tomorrow with an argument to keep it away from the jury we have to be prepared to fend that off as well as to proceed without it so i have a lot they cant just do that this is evidence lisa they can argue anything they want and the judge will decide the good thing is he owes us one in fact he owes us two for the hammer and the dna dropping out of the sky so i hope hell do the right thing here and well get it in thats why you have to let me go now i need to get back to the office and get to work on this she reached up and patted down my tie and adjusted the collar on my suit coat okay i get it you do what you have to do but call me tonight okay i want to know where things stand at the end of the day if theres time lisa if im not too tired i will call i looked over her shoulder at dahl who stood two feet behind her i actually needed the guy at the moment herb take care of her get her home so i can go back to work ive got her he said no worries right no worries i had the whole case to worry about and i couldnt help but worry about my client going off with the man i just sent her with was dahl for real or was he just protecting his investment i watched them head off across the plaza toward the parking garage i then walked past the library and north toward my office i was probably more excited about the possibilities that had dropped into my lap than lisa was i just wasnt showing it you never show your cards unless your opponent has called the final bet when i got back to the office i was still floating on adrenaline the pure highoctane form that comes with the unexpected twist in your favor cisco and bullocks were waiting for me when i entered they both started talking at once and i had to raise my hands to cut them both off hold on hold on i said one at a time and i go first perry adjourned early so the state could jump on the target letter we need to be ready for their best shot in the morning because i want to get it before the jury cisco now you whatve you got tell me about the letter my momentum carried all the way from the courthouse took us into my office and i went behind the desk the seat was warm and i could tell someone had been working there all afternoon okay cisco said we confirmed the letter was legit the us attorneys office wouldnt talk to us but i found out that the secret service agent whos named in the letter charles vasquez is assigned to a joint task force with the fbi that is looking into all angles of mortgage fraud in the southern california district remember last year when all the big banks temporarily halted foreclosures and everybody in congress said they would investigate yeah i thought i was going out of business until the banks started foreclosing again yeah well one of the investigations that did get going was right here lattimore put together this task force reggie lattimore was the us attorney assigned to the district i knew him years ago when he was a public defender he later switched sides and became a federal prosecutor and we moved in different orbits i tried to stay away from the federal courthouse i saw him from time to time at lunch counters downtown okay he wont talk to us what about vasquez i tried him too i got him on the line but as soon as he knew what it was about he had no comment i called back a second time and he just hung up on me i think if we want to talk to him were going to have to paper him i knew from experience that trying to serve a subpoena on a federal agent could be like fishing without a hook on the end of your line if they dont want to be papered theyll be able to avoid it we might not have to i said the judge adjourned early so the prosecution could run the letter down my guess is shell bring either lattimore or vasquez in and put him on before we can do it then she can try to spin it her way she wont want this to blow up in her face during the defense phase aronson added like the seasoned trial veteran she was not and the best way to guard against that is to bring vasquez in as a witness herself what do we know about this task force i asked i dont have anybody inside cisco said but ive got someone close enough to know what is going on the task force is obviously very political the thinking was that there is so much fraud out there it would be like shooting fish and they could grab headlines and look like they were doing something on their end about the whole mess opparizio is a perfect target rich arrogant and republican whatever they are working in regard to him its just starting and hasnt gone very deep doesnt matter i said the target letter is all we need it will make bondurants letter look like a legitimate threat do you really think this is what happened or are we just using this coincidence to deflect the jurys attention aronson asked she was still standing even though cisco and i had sat down there was something symbolic about it as if by not sitting down with us as we schemed this out she was not buying in or selling her soul it doesnt matter bullocks i said we have one job here and thats to put a not guilty on the scoreboard how we get there i didnt need to finish i could see in her face that she was continuing to have difficulty with the lessons taught outside the classroom i turned back to cisco so who leaked the letter to us that i dont know he said i kind of doubt it was vasquez he acted too surprised and edgy on the phone im thinking somebody in the us attorneys office i agreed maybe lattimore himself if were lucky enough to get opparizio on the stand it might actually help the feds to have him locked into some sworn testimony cisco nodded it was as good a possibility as anything else i moved on cisco i said the text you sent me in the courtroom said you had something unrelated to this to tell me to show you we need to take a ride when were finished here where id rather just show you i could tell by the way his face froze that he wasnt going to talk in front of bullocks it didnt matter that she was a trusted part of the team i got the message and turned back to her bullocks you wanted to say something when i first came in uh no i just wanted to talk about my testimony but we have a few days before we need to touch base i guess we should just stay in the moment you sure i can talk no go with cisco maybe well get some time tomorrow i could tell that something in the initial conversation was bothering her i let it go and got up from my desk i felt sympathy for her but not too much idealism dies hard with everybody thirty i drove the lincoln because cisco had ridden his motorcycle to work he directed me north on van nuys boulevard is this about lisas husband i asked you found him uh no not about that its about the two guys in the garage boss the guys who attacked me you connected them to opparizio yes and no its about them but its not connected to opparizio then who the hell sent them after me herb dahl what you gotta be shitting me i wish i looked over at my investigator i completely trusted him but wasnt seeing the logic in dahls putting the two goons on me wed had the dispute over movie control and money but how would busting my ribs and twisting my nuts help him in that regard at the time of the attack i had just found out he had made the deal with mcreynolds i got mugged before i could even register a protest you better run this down for me cisco i cant really do that yet thats why were in the car then talk to me whats going on im in the middle of trial here okay you told me you didnt trust dahl and that i should check him out i did i also had a couple of my guys start to keep an eye on him by your guys you mean saints thats right once upon a time long before he married lorna cisco was with the road saints a motorcycle club that was somewhere on the spectrum between the hells angels and the shriners clowns on wheels he managed to retire from membership without a criminal record and now maintained an association with the club for a long time i did too serving as house counsel and handling various traffic brawling and drug offenses that distracted the membership that was how i had first met cisco he was running security investigations for the club and i started using him on the criminal cases that came up the rest was history on more than one occasion over the years cisco had enlisted the saints on my behalf i even credit them with saving my family from potential harm when i was involved in the louis roulet case so it was not a surprise to me that he had called on them again except that he hadnt bothered to clue me in why didnt you tell me this i didnt want to complicate things for you you had the case to worry about i was handling the two dirtbags who messed you up by messed up he meant more than physically he was keeping me out of things because he knew that sometimes the psychological beating you take is worse than the physical he didnt want me distracted or looking over my shoulder okay i get it i said cisco reached inside his blackleather riding vest and pulled out a folded photograph he handed it to me and i waited until i stopped at the light at roscoe before i looked i unfolded it and saw a picture of herb dahl getting into a car with the two blackgloved assailants who had so expertly put me down on the floor of the parking garage by the victory building recognize them cisco asked yeah its them i said anger rising in my throat fucking dahl im going to kick his fucking ass maybe turn left here were going to the compound i looked over my shoulder and squeezed the car into the turning lane just as the light changed and i got the signal we headed west and i had to flip down the visor against the dropping sun by compound i knew he meant the saints clubhouse which was near the brewery on the other side of the freeway it had been a while since i had been there when was that photo taken i asked while you were in the hospital they didnt youve been sitting on this since then relax i wasnt checking with my guys every day okay they also didnt know about your ass getting kicked so they saw dahl with these guys took a couple of pictures and never showed them to me because they didnt print them out for more than a month it was a fuckup i know but these guys arent pros theyre lazy i take responsibility for it so if you need to blame someone blame me i saw the photo for the first time last night the other thing is my guys told me they didnt get it with the camera but they also saw dahl give both of these assholes a roll of cash so i think its pretty clear he hired them to kick your ass mick son of a bitch i was seized with the same sense of helplessness i had felt when one of the assailants had pinned my arms and held me while the other one hit me with his gloved fists i felt sweat popping on my scalp and sympathetic pain throbbed in my ribs and testicles if i ever get a chance to i stopped and looked across the seat at cisco he had a slight smile playing on his face is that what this is you have these two guys at the clubhouse he didnt answer but he kept the smile cisco im in the middle of a trial and now youre telling me the guy who has his fingers in my clients pie is the one who set me up for that that assault i dont have time for this man i have too much they want to talk that shut my protest down quick did you interview them nope waiting for you thought you should get first crack at them i drove in silence the rest of the way pondering what lay ahead soon we pulled to a stop in front of a compound on the east side of the brewery cisco got out to open the gate and the car immediately became infected with the sour smell of the brewery the compound was surrounded by a chainlink fence with a twist of razor wire running along top the concreteblock clubhouse which sat in the middle of the hardscrabble lot looked unimpressive in comparison to the gleaming row of machines parked out front harleys and triumphs only no rice rockets for this crew we entered the clubhouse took a moment to let our eyes adjust and then i saw cisco walk up to a serveyourself bar where two other men in leather vests sat on stools ready to do this he said the two men spun off their stools and stood up both of them went an easy six foot four and three hundred pounds they were enforcers cisco introduced them to me as tommy guns and bam bam theyre back here said tommy guns the two men led us down a hallway behind the bar they were so big they had to walk in single file there were doors on either side bam bam opened a door midway down the right side and we entered a windowless room with the walls and ceiling painted black and a single bulb hanging from above in the dim light i could see sketches painted on the walls men with beards and long hair i realized this was like a dark chapel where the fallen saints were memorialized my first thought as i looked about was pulp fiction my second was that i didnt want to be here two men were lying on the floor hogtied with their arms and feet up behind their backs they had black bags over their heads bam bam leaned down and started to pull the bags off this started a chorus of groans and fearful sounds from the two men wait a minute i said cisco i cant be here youre bringing me into is it them cisco said not waiting for me to finish my protest look closely you dont want to make a mistake me its not my mistake i didnt ask you to do this calm down youre here so just look is it them jesus christ both men were gagged with duct tape wrapped completely around their heads their faces were distorted further by the swelling and bruising already forming around their eyes they had been beaten the features didnt match with what i remembered from the victory building garage or even the photograph cisco had showed me earlier i bent down to look closer both men looked up at me complete fear in their eyes i cant tell i said its a yesorno question mick yeah but they werent scared shitless when they beat the crap out of me and they werent gagged take off the tape cisco ordered bam bam moved in springing a switchblade open and roughly cutting through the tape on the first man he then tore it off taking chunks of neck hair with it the man yelped in pain shut the fuck up tommy guns yelled the second man learned from his friends example he took the harsh taperemoval process without making a sound bam bam threw the gag to the side of the room and then moved behind the men he grabbed the nexus of the rope that tied the arms and legs together and knocked each man onto his side so i could see his face better please dont kill us one of the men said desperation tightening his voice it wasnt personal we were paid to do a job we coulda killed you but we didnt i suddenly recognized him as the one who did all the talking in the garage its them i said pointing down he did the talking and he did the punching who are they cisco nodded as though the confirmation was only a formality theyre brothers the talker is joey mack the puncher is get this angel mack listen we dont even know what it was about the talker yelled out please we made a mistake we youre fuckinga right you made a mistake cisco yelled his voice coming down on both of them like the wrath of god and now you pay who wants to go first the puncher started to whimper cisco walked over to a card table where there was a spread of tools and weapons plus the roll of tape he chose a pipe wrench and a set of pliers and turned back i thought and hoped it was all an act but if it was cisco was turning in an oscarcaliber performance i put my hand on his shoulder and held him from approaching the two men i didnt have to say anything but the message was clear let me have a shot at them i took the wrench from cisco and squatted like a baseball catcher in front of the captives i hefted the heavy tool in my hand for a few seconds getting a good feel for its weight before speaking who hired you to hurt me the talker answered immediately he wasnt interested in protecting anybody but himself and his brother a guy named dahl he told us to hit you hard but not kill you you cant do this man i think we can do whatever we want how do you know dahl we dont but we had a mutual connection and who was that no answer i didnt have to wait long before bam bam lived up to his moniker and leaned down and hit them both with pistonlike punches to the jaw the talker was spitting blood when he gave me the name jerry castille and whos jerry castille look you cant tell anybody this youre not in a position to tell me what i can or cant do whos jerry castille hes the west coast representative i waited but that was it i dont have all night man west coast representative of what the bloodied man nodded like he knew there was only one way to go here of a certain eastcoast organization you get it i looked at cisco herb dahl had ties to eastcoast organized crime it seemed farfetched no you dont get it i said im a lawyer i want a direct answer which organization you have exactly five seconds until he works for joey giordano outta brooklyn okay now youve sealed the deal on us anyway so go fuck yourself he reared back and spit blood at me i had left my suit coat and tie at the office i looked down at my white shirt and saw a bloodstain just outside the area that would be covered by a tie this is a monogrammed shirt you shit head tommy guns suddenly moved between us and i heard the brutal impact of fist on face but didnt see it because of tommys massive size he then stepped back and i could see the talker was now spitting out teeth monogrammed shirt man tommy guns said as if offering an explanation for his vicious action i stood up okay cut them loose i said cisco and the two saints turned to look at me cut em loose i said again you sure cisco said theyll probably go running back to this fucker castille and tell him we know i looked down at the two men on the floor and shook my head no they wont they tell him that they talked and theyll probably end up dead so cut them loose and its like this never happened theyll drop out of sight until the bruises go away and that will be the end of it i bent down to get close to the two captives i have that right right yeah said the talker a bulge the size of a marble forming on his upper lip i looked at his brother is that right i want to hear it from both of you yeah yeah right the puncher said i looked at cisco we were finished here he gave the order okay guns listen up you wait till dark you leave them in here and wait till dark then you bag em and take em back to wherever they want to go you drop them off but you leave em alone you got it yeah i got it poor tommy guns he truly looked disappointed i took one last look at the bloodied men on the floor and they looked up at me the feeling of holding their lives in my hands sent an electric jolt through me cisco tapped me on the back and i followed him from the room closing the door behind me we started down the hall but i put my hand on my investigators arm and stopped him you shouldnt have done that you shouldnt have brought me here are you kidding i had to bring you here what are you talking about why because they did something to you inside you lost something mick and if you dont get it back you arent going to be much good to yourself or anybody else i stared at him for a long moment and then nodded i got it back good now we never have to talk about this again can you take me back to the office so i can pick up my bike yeah i can do that thirtyone driving by myself after dropping cisco in the garage i thought about the law of the land and the law of the streets and the differences between them i stood in courtrooms and insisted that the law of the land be applied fairly and appropriately there was nothing that had been fair and appropriate about what i had just been party to in the black room still it didnt bother me cisco had been right i needed to gain the upper hand inside my own soul before i could gain it in court or anywhere else i felt renewed as i drove i opened all the lincolns windows and let the evening air course through the car as i came down laurel canyon toward home this time maggie had used her key she was already inside when i got there an unexpected but pleasant surprise the refrigerator door was open and she was leaning down and looking in i really came because you always used to stock up before a trial your refrigerator was like going down the cold aisle at gelsons but what happened theres nothing here i dropped my keys on the table she had been to her own home from work first and had changed she wore faded denim jeans a peasant shirt and sandals with thick cork heels she knew i liked that outfit i guess i didnt get around to it this time well i wish id known mightve considered going somewhere else on my one night this week with a sitter she smiled slyly i couldnt figure out why we werent still living together how about we go down to dans dan tanas i thought you went there only when you won a case you already counting your chickens haller i smiled and shook my head no no way but if i went there only when i won then id hardly ever get to eat there she pointed a finger at me and smiled it was a dance and we were both well used to it she closed the fridge and walked through the kitchen door and then right past me without so much as a kiss dan tanas is open late she said i watched her walk down the hallway toward the master bedroom she pulled the peasant blouse up over her head just as she disappeared into the room we didnt really make love something about what i had seen and felt in the black room at the saints was still with me call it residual aggression or the release of the impotent anger i had felt whatever it was it informed all my moves with her i pulled and pushed too hard i bit her lip and held her wrists together above her head i controlled her and i knew what it was all about while i did it maggie went with it at first the newness of it was probably interesting but curiosity eventually turned to concern and she turned her face from mine and struggled to free her hands i held her wrists tighter finally i saw tears well in her eyes what i whispered into her ear my nose pressing hard into her hair just finish she said all aggression and drive and desire went down the psychic drain after that her tears and telling me to finish made me unable to i pulled out and off rolling to the side of the bed i put a forearm across my eyes but still could feel her watching me what what is with you tonight is this something to do with andrea getting me back for whats going on in court or something i felt her move off the bed maggie of course not courts got nothing to do with it then what but the bathroom door had closed before i could answer and the shower immediately was turned on cutting off the exchange ill tell you at dinner i said even though i knew she couldnt hear me dan tanas was packed but christian came through and got us quickly into a booth in the left corner maggie and i had not spoken during the fifteenminute ride into west hollywood i had tried some small talk about our daughter but maggie had been unresponsive so i let it go i thought that i would try again in the restaurant we both ordered the steak helen with pasta on the side alfredo for maggie and bolognese for me maggie picked an italian red for herself and i ordered a bottle of fizzy water after the waiter left i reached across the table and put my hand on her wrist gently this time im sorry maggie lets start over she pulled her arm away from me you still owe me an explanation haller that wasnt making love i dont know whats going on with you i dont think you should treat anyone that way but especially not me maggie i think youre overdoing it a bit for a while there you liked it and you know it and then you started to hurt me im sorry i never want to hurt you and dont try to act like it was a passing thing if you ever want to be with me again youd better start telling me what is happening with you i shook my head and looked out at the crowded room the lakers were on the overhead tv in the bar that divided the place people were crowded three deep behind the lucky patrons who had the stools the waiter brought our drinks and that bought me some more time but as soon as he left the table maggie was on me talk to me michael or im taking my dinner to go ill take a cab i took a long drink of water and then looked at her it has nothing to do with court or andrea freeman or anybody or anything else you know okay no not okay talk to me i put my glass down and folded my arms on the table cisco found the two guys who attacked me where who are they that doesnt matter he didnt call the police he didnt turn them in you mean he just let them go i laughed and shook my head no he held them him and two of his associates from the saints for me in this place they have to do what i wanted whatever i wanted he said i needed it she reached across the checked tablecloth and put her hand on my forearm haller what did you do i held her eyes for a moment nothing i questioned them and then told cisco to let them go i know who hired them who im not going to get into that its not important but you know what maggie when i was in the hospital waiting to find out if they were going to be able to save my twisted nut all i could think about were these violent images of me getting those two guys back i mean hieronymus bosch torture stuff medieval shit i wanted to hurt them so bad then i get my chance and believe me these guys would have just disappeared after and i let it go and then im with you and she leaned back in the booth she stared off into space a mixture of sadness and resignation on her face pretty fucked up huh i wish you hadnt told me all of that you mean as a prosecutor theres that well you kept asking i guess i shouldve made up a story about being mad at andrea freeman that wouldve been okay with you right if it was about men and women you could understand that she looked back at me dont patronize me sorry we sat in silence and watched the activities in the bar people drinking being happy at least outwardly the waiters in tuxedos moving about and squeezing between the crowded tables when our food came i was no longer particularly hungry even though the best steak in town was on the plate in front of me can i ask you one final thing about it maggie asked i shrugged i didnt see the point in talking about it anymore but relented ask away how do you know for sure that cisco and his associates let those two men go i cut into my steak and blood oozed onto the plate it was undercooked i looked up at maggie i guess i dont know for sure i went back to my steak and in my peripheral vision i saw maggie wave down the busboy im going to take this to go and try to grab a cab out front can you bring it out to me of course right away he hustled off with the plate maggie i said i just need some time to think about all of this she slid out of the booth i can drive you no ill be fine she stood next to the table opening her purse dont worry about it ive got it you sure if theres no cab out there look down the street at the palm there might be one there okay thanks she left then to wait for her food outside i pushed my plate a few inches back and contemplated the halffull glass of wine she left behind five minutes later i was still considering it when maggie suddenly appeared the togo bag in her hand they had to call a cab she said it should be here any minute she picked up her glass and sipped from it lets talk after your trial she said okay she put the glass down leaned over and kissed me on the cheek then she left i sat there for a while thinking about things i thought maybe that last kiss had saved my life thirtytwo this time in his chambers judge perry sat down it was wednesday morning and i was there along with andrea freeman and the court reporter before resuming trial the judge had agreed with freemans request for one more conference out of the public eye perry waited for us to settle in our seats then checked that his reporters fingers were poised over the keys of her steno machine okay were on the record here in california versus trammel he said ms freeman you called for an in camera conference i hope youre not going to tell me you need more time to pursue the issue involving the federal target letter freeman moved to the front edge of her seat not at all your honor there is nothing worth pursuing the issue has been thoroughly vetted but full knowledge of what is going on with the federal agencies involved does not comfort me i believe it is clear from what i know now that mr haller is going to attempt to push this trial off the rails with issues that are definitely irrelevant to the matter before the jury i cleared my throat but the judge stepped in first we handled the issue of thirdparty guilt in pretrial ms freeman i am allowing the defense the leeway to pursue it to a point but you have to give me something here just because you dont want mr haller to pursue this target letter doesnt make it irrelevant i understand that judge but what excuse me i said do i get a turn here id like the chance to respond to the insinuation that im pushing let ms freeman finish and then youll get a good long tug mr haller i promise you that ms freeman thank you your honor what im trying to say is that a federal target letter essentially means almost nothing it is a notice of a pending investigation it is not a charge its not even an allegation it doesnt mean that they have found something or will find something it is simply a tool used by the feds to say hey we heard something and were going to look into it but in mr hallers hands in front of the jury hes going to spin this into the harbinger of doom and attach it to someone not even on trial here lisa trammel is the one on trial and this whole thing about federal target letters is not even remotely relevant to the material issues i would ask that you disallow mr haller from making any further inquiry of detective kurlen in this regard the judge was leaning back with his hands in front of his chest the fingers of each hand pressed against each other he swiveled to face me finally my cue judge if i were in your honors position i think that i would ask counsel since she says she thoroughly vetted this letter and its origin if there is a sitting federal grand jury looking into foreclosure fraud in southern california and then i would ask how she has concluded that a federal target letter amounts to almost nothing because i dont think the court is getting a very accurate assessment of what the letter means or what its impact is on this case the judge swiveled back to freeman and broke one of his fingers free to point in her direction what about that ms freeman is there a grand jury judge you are putting me in an awkward position here grand juries work in secret and were all friends here ms freeman the judge said sternly is there a grand jury she hesitated and then nodded there is a grand jury your honor but it has not heard any testimony in regard to louis opparizio as i said the target letter is nothing more than a notice of a pending investigation its hearsay judge and it doesnt fit into any exception that would speak to its admissibility in this trial though the letter was signed by the us attorney for this district it was actually authored by a secret service agent handling the inquiry i have the agent waiting downstairs in my office if the court wishes i can have him in chambers in ten minutes to tell you exactly what i just did that this is a lot of smoke and mirrors on mr hallers part at the time of mr bondurants death there was no active investigation yet and no connection between the two there was just the letter that was a mistake by revealing that vasquez the secret service agent who penned the target letter was in the building freeman had put the judge into a difficult position that the agent was nearby and easily accessible would make it harder for the judge to dismiss the issue out of hand i stepped in before the judge could respond judge perry i would suggest that since counsel says she has the federal agent who wrote the letter right here in the courthouse she simply put him on the stand to counter anything that i might draw from detective kurlen on crossexamination if ms freeman is so sure the agent will say the target letter he wrote amounts to nothing then let him tell the jury that let him blow me out of the water i remind the court that weve already dipped our toes into these waters i asked kurlen about the letter yesterday to simply go back out there and not mention it again or have you tell the jurors to unring the bell and dismiss it from memory that could be more damaging to our collective cause than a full airing of this issue perry answered without hesitation i tend to think that you are correct about this mr haller i dont like the idea of leaving the jury all night with this mysterious target letter to ponder and then pulling the rug out from under them this morning your honor freeman said quickly may i be heard once more no i dont think that is necessary we need to stop wasting time in here and get the trial started but your honor there is one other exigent issue the court has not even considered the judge looked frustrated and what is that ms freeman my patience is drawing thin allowing testimony about a target letter directed at the defenses key witness will likely complicate that witnesss previous decision not to invoke his fifth amendment rights during testimony in this case louis opparizio and his legal counsel may well reconsider that decision once this target letter is introduced and discussed publicly therefore mr haller may be building a defense case that ultimately results in his key witness and straw man if you will refusing to testify i want it on record now that if mr haller plays this game he must abide by the consequences when opparizio decides next week that its in his best interest not to testify and asks for a new hearing on the subpoena i dont want defense counsel crying to the court for a doover no doovers judge the judge nodded agreeing with her i guess that would be tantamount to the man who killed his parents asking the court to show mercy on him because hes an orphan im in agreement mr haller you are on notice that if you play it this way you must be prepared to shoulder the consequences i understand judge i said and i will make sure my client does as well i only have one point of argument and that is counsels labeling of louis opparizio as a straw man hes no straw man and well prove it well the judge said at least youll get a chance to now time is wasting lets get back into the courtroom i followed freeman out leaving the judge behind while he put on his robe i expected her to hit me with a verbal assault but i got the opposite well played counselor she said thanks i think who do you think sent you the letter i wish i knew have the feds contacted you my guess is theyre going to want to find out whos leaking sensitive and confidential documents to the public nobodys said jack yet maybe it was the feds who leaked it if i get opparizio on the stand hes stuck with his testimony maybe im just an instrument of the federal government here ever think of that the suggestion seemed to put a pause in her step as i passed her i smiled as we entered the courtroom i saw herb dahl in the front row of the gallery behind the defense table i suppressed the urge to pull him over the rail and pound his face into the stone floor freeman and i took our positions at our respective tables and in a whisper i filled my client in on what had happened in chambers the judge entered and brought the jury in the last piece of the picture was filled in when detective kurlen returned to the witness stand i grabbed my files and legal pad and went back to the lectern it seemed like a week since my crossexamination had been interrupted but it had been less than a day i acted as though it had been less than a minute now detective kurlen when we left off yesterday i had just asked you if you knew what a federal target letter is can you answer that question now my understanding is that when a federal agency is interested in gathering information from an individual or company they sometimes send out a letter that tells that individual or company that they want to talk its sort of a letter that says come on in and lets talk about this so theres no misunderstanding and thats it im not a federal agent well do you think its a serious matter to receive a letter from the federal government telling you that you are the target of an investigation it could be i guess i would assume that it depends on the crime theyre looking into i asked the judge for permission to approach the witness with a document freeman objected for the record citing relevance the judge overruled without comment and told me i could give the document to the witness after handing the document to kurlen i returned to the lectern and asked the judge to mark the document as defense exhibit i then told kurlen to read the letter dear mr opparizio this letter is to inform wait i interrupted could you first read and describe what is at the top of the letter the letterhead it says office of the united states attorney los angeles and its got a picture of an eagle on one side and the us flag on the other should i read the letter part now yes please do dear mr opparizio this letter is to inform you that a louis opparizio financial technologiesknown as aloftand you individually are among the targets of a multiagency task force investigating all levels of mortgage fraud in southern california receipt of this letter puts you on notice not to remove or destroy any documents or work materials related to the business of your company should you wish to discuss this investigation and cooperate with members of the task force please do not hesitate to call or have your legal counsel make contact with me or charles vasquez of the us secret service who has been assigned to the aloft investigation as case agent we will make every effort to meet with you to discuss this matter if you do not wish to cooperate you can be assured that you will be contacted shortly by agents of the task force i once again have to remind you not to destroy or remove any documents or work product from your offices or associated premises to do so after receiving this notice would be to commit a serious crime against the united states of america sincerely reginald lattimore us attorney los angeles thats it except it gives everybodys phone numbers at the bottom a low murmur went through the courtroom i was sure most of the general citizenry was unaware of things like federal target letters it was law enforcement in the new era i was sure the socalled task force amounted to token contributions of agents from a handful of agencies and no budget instead of mounting expensive investigations it would take a shot at scaring people into coming in and begging for mercy a design to pick the lowhanging fruit grab a few headlines and call it a day someone like opparizio probably used the original letter received via certified mail as toilet paper but that didnt matter to me my plan was to use the letter to help keep my client out of prison thank you detective kurlen now can you tell us is the letter dated kurlen checked the copy before answering its dated january eighteenth of this year now detective had you seen that letter before yesterday no why should i have seen it its got nothing to do with move to strike as unresponsive i said quickly your honor the question was simply whether he had seen the letter before the judge instructed kurlen to answer only the question asked i had not seen this letter before yesterday thank you detective and now lets go back to the other letter i asked you to read yesterday from the victim mitchell bondurant to the same louis opparizio who is addressed in the federal target letter do you have that handy there in your binder if i could have a moment please kurlen found the letter in the binder removed it and held it up good can you tell us the date of that letter please january tenth this year and that letter was delivered to mr opparizio by certified mail correct it was sent certified i cannot tell you if mr opparizio received it or ever saw it it has someone elses name listed as signing for it but no matter who signed for it it is a certainty that it was sent on january tenth correct i think thats correct and the second letter weve talked about here the target letter from the secret service agent was sent by certified mail as well am i right thats right so the date of january eighteenth is certified as to when it was mailed correct so let me see if i have this right mr bondurant sends louis opparizio a certified letter that threatens to expose alleged fraudulent practices in his company and then eight days later a federal task force sends mr opparizio another certified letter this one saying he is the target of an investigation into foreclosure fraud do i have this time line right detective kurlen as far as i know yes and then less than two weeks later mr bondurant is brutally murdered in the garage at westland right thats right i paused and rubbed my chin like a deep thinker i really wanted to hold the jury with this i wanted to look at their faces but knew it would reveal my play so i went with the deep thinker pose detective you have testified about your wealth of experience as a homicide detective correct i have a lot of experience yes hypothetically speaking do you wish you knew then what you know now kurlen squinted like he was confused even though he knew exactly what i was doing and where i was going im not sure i understand he said put it this way would it have been good for you to have those letters in hand on the first day of the murder investigation sure why not id take all evidence and information on the first day anytime but that never happens hypothetically speaking if you knew that your victim mitchell bondurant had sent a letter threatening to expose another mans criminal behavior just eight days before that man learned he was the target of a criminal investigation wouldnt that be a significant avenue of investigation for you it is hard to say now i looked at the jury kurlen was waffling refusing to acknowledge what common sense dictated he should own up to you didnt need to be a detective to understand that hard to say are you saying that if you had this information and these letters on the day of the murder it would be hard to say if you would follow up on them as a significant lead im saying that we dont have all the details so it is hard to say how significant it was or wasnt but as a general answer all leads are followed up its as simple as that as simple as that yet you never pursued this angle of investigation did you i didnt have this letter how could i have followed it up you had the victims letter and you did nothing with it did you not true at all i checked it out and determined it had nothing to do with the murder but isnt it true that by that time you already had your supposed murderer and you werent going to let anything change your mind or make you deviate from that path no not true not true at all i stared at kurlen for a long time hoping that my face showed my disgust no further questions at this time i finally said thirtythree freeman kept kurlen on the stand for another fifteen minutes of redirect and did her best to resculpt his account of the investigation into a sterling effort of crime fighting when she was through i passed on another crack at him because i was convinced that i was already ahead on kurlen my effort had been to sell the investigation as an exercise in tunnel vision and i believed i had succeeded freeman apparently felt that the need to address the federal target letter was urgent her next witness was the secret service agent charles vasquez he had not even been known to her twentyfour hours earlier but had now been interjected into her carefully orchestrated lineup of witnesses and evidence i could have objected to his testimony on the grounds that i had not had the opportunity to question or prepare for vasquez but i thought that would be pushing it with judge perry i decided to at least see what the agent had to say on direct before id go that far vasquez was about forty with a dark complexion and hair to match during the preliminaries he said he had formerly been a dea agent before shifting to the secret service he went from chasing drug dealers to chasing counterfeiters until the opportunity came to join the foreclosure task force he said the task force had a supervisor and ten agents coming from the secret service fbi the postal service and the irs an assistant us attorney oversaw their work but the agents assigned to pairs largely worked autonomously with freedom to pursue targets of their choice agent vasquez on january eighteenth of this year you authored a socalled target letter to a man named louis opparizio and it was signed by us attorney reginald lattimore do you recall that yes i do before we get into that specific letter can you tell the jury exactly what a target letter is its a tool we use to smoke out suspects and offenders how so we basically inform them that we are looking into their affairs their business practices and actions they have taken a target letter always invites the recipient to come in to discuss the situation with the agents a high percentage of the time the recipients do just that sometimes it leads to cases sometimes it leads to other investigations its become a useful tool because investigations cost a lot we dont have the budget if a letter can result in charges being filed or a witness cooperating or a solid investigative lead then its a good deal for us so in regard to the letter to louis opparizio what made you send him a target letter well my partner and i were very familiar with his name because it came up often in other cases we were working not necessarily in a bad way just that opparizios company is what we call a foreclosure mill it handles all the paperwork and filing on foreclosures for many of the banks operating in southern california thousands of cases so we kept seeing the companyaloftand sometimes there were complaints about the methods the company was using my partner and i decided to take a closer look we sent out the letter to see what sort of response wed get does that mean you were fishing for a reaction it was more than fishing as i said there was quite a lot of smoke from this place we were looking for fire and sometimes the reaction we get from a target letter dictates what our next moves will be at the time you authored and sent the target letter had you gathered any evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of louis opparizio or his company not at that point no what happened after you sent the letter nothing so far has louis opparizio responded to the letter we got a response from an attorney saying that mr opparizio welcomed the investigation because it would give him the opportunity to show he ran a clean business have you availed yourself of that welcome and investigated mr opparizio or his company further no there hasnt been time we have several other ongoing investigations that appear to be more fruitful freeman checked her notes before finishing finally agent vasquez is louis opparizio or aloft currently under investigation by your task force technically no but we plan to follow up on the letter so the answer is no correct thank you agent vasquez freeman sat down she was beaming and obviously pleased with the testimony she had drawn from the agent i stood up and took my legal pad back to the lectern i had written down a few questions off the direct examination agent vasquez are you telling the jury that an individual who does not respond to your target letter by immediately coming in and confessing must be innocent of any wrongdoing no im not because louis opparizio did not do so do you consider him to be in the clear now no i dont do you make it a practice to send target letters to individuals you believe are innocent of any criminal activity no i dont then what is the threshold agent vasquez what does one need to do to receive a target letter basically if you come across my radar in any sort of suspicious way then ill do some preliminary checking and that may lead to the letter were not sending these out scattershot we know what were doing did you or your partner or anyone from the task force speak with mitchell bondurant in regard to the practices of aloft no we didnt nobody did would he have been someone you wouldve talked to freeman objected calling the question vague the judge sustained the objection i decided to leave the question floating out there unanswered in front of the jury thank you agent vasquez freeman went back to her scheduled rollout of the case after vasquez calling the gardener who found the hammer in the bushes of the home a block and a half from the scene of the murder his testimony was quick and uneventful by itself unimportant until it would be tied in later with testimony from the states forensic witnesses i did score a minor point by getting the gardener to acknowledge that he had worked in and around the bushes at least twelve different times before he found the hammer it was a little seed to plant for the jury the idea that maybe the hammer itself had been planted long after the murder after the gardener the prosecution followed with a few quick hits of testimony from the home owner and the cops who carried the chain of custody of the hammer to the forensic lab i didnt even bother with crossexamination i was not going to contest chain of custody or the fact that the hammer was the murder weapon my plan was to agree not only that it was the weapon that killed mitchell bondurant but also that it belonged to lisa trammel it would be an unexpected move but the only one that worked with the defense theory of a setup the lead through jeff trammel that the hammer might be in the back of the bmw hed left behind when he disappeared to mexico didnt pan out cisco was able to locate that car still in use at the dealership where jeff trammel had worked but there was no hammer in the trunk and the man in charge of fleet management said there never was i dismissed jeff trammels story as an effort to get paid off for information that might be helpful to his estranged wifes case the murder weapon sequence brought us to lunch and the judge as was beginning to be his custom broke fifteen minutes early i turned to my client and invited her to go to lunch with me what about herb she said i promised him i would go to lunch with him herb can come too really sure why not because i thought you didnt never mind ill tell him good ill drive i had rojas pick us up and we went down van nuys to the hamlet near ventura the place had been there for decades and while it had classed itself up since the days it was called hamburger hamlet the food was just the same because the judge had gotten us out early we avoided the noon lineup and were immediately shown to a booth i love this place dahl said but i havent been here in ages i sat across from dahl and my client i didnt respond to his enthusiasm for the restaurant i was too busy working out how i was going to play the lunch we ordered quickly because even with the early start our time window was small our conversation was focused on the case and how lisa perceived things to be going she was pleased so far you get something that helps me from every witness she said its quite remarkable but the question is do i get enough i responded and what you have to remember is that the mountain gets steeper with each witness do you know the piece boléro its classical music i think it was composed by ravel lisa gave me a blank stare bo derek in ten dahl said love it right anyway the point is its a long piece maybe fifteen minutes or so and it starts off slow with just a few quiet instruments and then it gathers momentum and builds and builds into a crescendo a big finish with all the instruments in the orchestra coming in together and at the same time the emotions of the listeners build and come together at the same moment and thats what the prosecutor is doing here shes building sound and momentum her best stuff is still to come because shes going to bring everything together with drums and strings and horns by the time shes finished you understand lisa she nodded reluctantly im not trying to knock you down you are excited and hopeful and righteous and i want you to stay that way because the jury picks up on it and it helps just as much as anything i do in there but you have to remember the mountain is getting steeper shes got the science still to come and juries love science because it gives them a way out a way of deferring people think they want to be on jury duty you get out of work you sit front row on an interesting case reallife drama in front of you instead of on the tube at home but eventually they have to go back into that room and look at each other and decide they have to decide somebodys life believe me not too many people want to do that the science makes it easier oh well if the dna matches then it cant be wrong guilty as charged you see this is what we still face lisa and i dont want there to be any illusions about it dahl gallantly put his hand on her arm which leaned on the table he gave it a comforting squeeze well what will we do about their dna trammel asked nothing i said theres nothing i can do i told you before trial we had our own people test it and we got the same answers its legit her eyes were cast down in defeat and i saw the start of tears which was what i wanted the waitress chose that moment to show up with our lunch plates i waited until we were left alone before continuing cheer up lisa the dna is just window dressing she looked up at me in confusion i thought you just said its legit it is but that doesnt mean there isnt an explanation for it ill handle the dna like you said when we sat down my job here is to drop a doubt into each piece of their puzzle then we hope when all their pieces are in place and they hold the picture up to the jury that all the little seeds of doubt we have sown have grown into something that changes that picture if we do that then we get tan whats that mean we go home we go to the beach and we get tan i smiled at her and she smiled back her tearing up had smeared the intricate makeup work she had performed that morning the rest of lunch was punctuated by small talk and uninformed or inane observations of the criminal justice system by my client and her paramour this was a common thing i had observed in my clients they dont know the law but are quick to tell me what is wrong with it i waited until trammel forked the last bite of salad into her mouth lisa your mascara got a little smeared during the first part of our conversation its very important that you stay strong and look strong i want you to go into the restroom and make yourself look strong okay can i just do it at the courthouse no because we might be going in at the same time as some of the jurors or the reporters you never know who will see you i dont want anyone thinking youre spending your lunch hour crying okay i want you to do it now and ill call rojas to come pick us up it might take me a few minutes i checked my watch okay take your time ill wait a little bit on rojas dahl got up so she could slide out of the booth then we were left alone i had pushed my plate to the side and had my elbows on the table i had my hands clasped together in front of my mouth like a poker player holding up his cards to help hide his face at heart a good lawyer was a negotiator and now it was time to negotiate herb dahls exit so herb its time for you to go he gave me a small smile of misunderstanding what do you mean we all came together no i mean from the case from lisa its time for you to disappear he kept the i dont understand demeanor going im not going anywhere lisa and me were close and i have a lot of money tied up in this thing well your moneys gone and as far as lisa goes thats a charade that is coming to an end right now i reached into the inside pocket of my coat and pulled out the photo of herb with the brothers mack that cisco had given me the night before i handed it across the table to him he gave it a quick look and then laughed uneasily okay ill bite who are they the mack brothers the men you hired to work me over he shook his head and glanced over his shoulder at the rear hallway that led to the restrooms he then turned back to me sorry mickey but i dont know what youre talking about i think you have to remember here that you and i have a deal on the movie a deal involving circumstances i am sure the california bar would be interested in reviewing but other than that are you threatening me dahl because if you are youre making a mistake no no threat im just trying to figure out where youre coming from im coming from a dark room where i had an interesting conversation with the mack brothers dahl refolded the photo and handed it back to me these two they were asking me for directions thats all directions huh are you sure it wasnt money they were asking for because we have photos of that too i mightve given them a few bucks they asked for help and seemed nice enough now i had to smile you know youre good herb but i got their story so lets just skip all the bullshit and get down to the play he shrugged okay this is your show whats the play the play is what i said at the top youre gone herb you kiss lisa goodbye you kiss the movie deal goodbye you kiss your money goodbye thats a lot of kissing what do i get for all that you get to stay out of prison thats what you get he shook his head and glanced over his shoulder again doesnt work that way mick you see that wasnt my money it didnt come from me whod it come from jerry castille his eyes made a quick movement and then settled the name had hit him like an invisible punch he now knew that the mack brothers had caved and talked yeah i know about jerry and i know about joey in new york too no honor among thugs herb the mack brothers are ready to start singing like sonny and cher and the song is ive got you babe ive got you all wrapped up in a nice little package and unless you slink on out of lisas life and my life today im going to drop it off at the das office where i happen to have an exwife whos a prosecutor and who was very distressed by that attack on me i figure shell sail this one through the grand jury in a single morning and you asshole will go down for aggravated assault with gbh that means with great bodily harm its called a charging enhancement it will get you an extra three years on the sentence and as the victim im going to insist on that thats for my twisted nut id say that all told with gain time youre looking at four years inside herb and theres one thing you should know they dont let you wear no fucking peace sign in soledad dahl put his elbows on the table and leaned forward for the first time i could see desperation enter his eyes you dont know what the fuck youre doing you dont know who youre dealing with listen assholecan i call you assholei dont give a rats ass who im dealing with im looking at you and i want you away from me and this case and no no you dont get it i can help you you think you know whats going on in this case you dont know shit but i can school you haller i can help you reach the beach and we can all get tan i leaned back away from him my arm up on the booths padded backrest now i was puzzled i flicked a wrist like this was a complete waste of time so school me you think i just showed up on her picket line and said lets make a movie you dumb fuck i was sent there before bondurant was even put down i was getting close to lisa you think that was happenstance sent by who who do you think i stared at him and felt the coalescing of all aspects of the case like streams to the river the hypothesis of innocence was not a hypothesis the setup was real opparizio he made one slight nod in confirmation and at that moment i saw lisa come through the back hallway heading toward us her eyes shiny and bright again for court i looked back at dahl i wanted to ask many questions but we were out of time seven oclock tonight be at my office alone you tell me about opparizio then you tell me about everything or i go to the da the one thing is ill never testify to anything never seven oclock im supposed to have dinner with lisa yeah well change of plans think of something you just be there now lets go i started to slide out of the booth as lisa arrived i pulled my phone and called rojas were ready i said pick us up out front thirtyfour after court reconvened the prosecution called detective cynthia longstreth to the witness stand by going with kurlens partner as her next witness freeman was confirming what had been my growing assumption that her version of boléro climaxed with the science it was the smart play go with what cant be questioned or denied lay out the investigation through kurlen and longstreth and then bring it all together with the forensics she would finish out the case with the medical examiner and the dna evidence a nice tight package detective longstreth did not look as tough and as severe as she did the first day of the case when i had met her at van nuys division first of all she was wearing a dress that made her look more like a schoolteacher than a detective i had seen this sort of transformation before and it always bothered me whether it was at the instruction of the prosecutor or by the detectives own wiles many a time i had been faced with a female police witness who had transformed herself to be softer and more pleasing to the jury but if i dared point this out to the judge or anybody for that matter i ran the risk of being slapped down as a misogynist so most times i just had to grin and eat it freeman was using longstreth to outline the second half of the investigation her testimony would be primarily about the search of the trammel house and its findings i was expecting no surprises here after freeman got her witnesss bona fides on the record she went right to it did you obtain a search warrant from a judge granting you access to lisa trammels home freeman asked yes i did what is that process how do you get a judge to issue such an order you make a request that contains a probable cause statement which lists the facts and evidence that have led you to the point of needing to search the premises i did that here using the statement of the witness who saw the suspect in the vicinity of the bank as well as the suspects own inconsistent statements during the interview the warrant was signed and issued by judge companioni and we proceeded to the house in woodland hills who is we detective my partner detective kurlen and i and we decided to bring a videographer and a crime scene team with us to process anything we might find during the search so the whole search was put on video well i would not say it was the whole search my partner and i split up to make things move faster but there was only one cameraman and he couldnt be with both of us at once the way we worked it was that when we found something that looked like evidence or something we wanted to take into custody for examination we would call for the camera i see and did you bring the video with you today i did and it has been placed in the player and is ready to go perfect the jury was then treated to a ninetyminute video accompanied by longstreths narration the camera followed the police team as they arrived at the house and made a complete circuit around it before entering while the view was in the backyard longstreth made sure to point out to jurors an herb garden stepped with railroad ties and freshly turned soil it was what the great filmmakers would call foreshadowing its meaning would become apparent later once the camera was inside the garage i was having trouble concentrating on the testimony dahl had dropped a bomb when he revealed the connection to opparizio i kept thinking about the possible scenario and what it could mean to the case i wanted court to be over and for it to be seven oclock on the video a key taken from lisa trammels belongings following her arrest was used to gain entrance to the house without damaging the property once inside the team began a systematic search of the premises that seemed to follow a protocol born of experience the shower and bathtub drains were examined for blood evidence the washer and dryer as well the longest part of the search took place in the closets where every shoe and piece of clothing was carefully examined and subjected to chemical and lighting treatments designed to draw attention to blood evidence the camera eventually followed longstreth as she left a side door to the house and crossed a small portico to another door this door was unlocked and she went through it bringing the camera into the garage freeman stopped the video here like an expert hollywood craftsman she had built her viewers anticipation and now came the big tease what was found in the garage became very important to the investigation correct detective yes it did what did you find well in one incidence it was what we didnt find can you explain what you mean by that yes there was a tool bench that ran along the back wall of the garage it appeared to be fully stocked with tools most of them were hanging on hooks attached to a pegboard installed above the bench and along the wall the different locations for hanging the tools were marked with the name of the tool everything had its place on the board okay can you show us the video was restarted and soon it came to a headon view of the workbench at this point freeman froze the image on the overhead screens okay so this is the workbench correct yes we see the tools hanging on the pegboard is there anything missing yes the hammer is missing freeman asked the judge for permission for longstreth to step down and use a laser pointer to show on the screens where the spot for the hammer was on the pegboard the judge allowed it longstreth pointed it out on both screens and then returned to the witness stand now detective was that spot specifically marked as being for a hammer yes it was so the hammer was missing it was not found anywhere in the garage or the house and did there come a time when you identified the make and model of the tools that were on the pegboard yes by using the tools that were still there we were able to determine that the trammels had a set of craftsman tools that came in a specific package it was a twohundredthirtyninepiece set called the carpenters tool package and was the hammer from this package available outside of this set no it was not there was a specific hammer that came from this particular set of tools and it was missing from the tool set in lisa trammels garage that is correct now did there come a time during the investigation that a hammer was turned in to police that had been found near the scene of the murder of mitchell bondurant yes a hammer was found by a gardener in some bushes a block and a half from the garage where the murder took place did you examine this hammer i examined it briefly before turning it over to the scientific investigation division for analysis what kind of hammer was it it was a claw hammer and do you know who manufactured the hammer it was produced by sears craftsman freeman paused as though she was expecting the jury to collectively gasp at the revelation when everybody in the courtroom had known exactly what was coming she then stepped over to the prosecution table and opened a brown evidence bag from it she pulled out a hammer that was encased in a clear plastic bag holding the hammer aloft she returned to the lectern your honor may i approach the witness with an exhibit you may she walked the hammer to longstreth and handed it to her detective i ask you to identify the hammer you are holding this is the hammer that was found and turned over to me my initials and badge number are on this evidence bag freeman retrieved the hammer from her and asked that it be marked as states evidence judge perry gave his approval after returning the hammer to the prosecution table freeman went back to the lectern and proceeded with her examination you testified that the hammer was turned over to sid for forensic examination correct yes correct and subsequent to that did you get a forensics report on the tool yes and i have it here what were their findings two things of note one was that they identified the hammer as being made exclusively for the craftsman carpenters tool package the same set that was found in the defendants garage yes but minus the hammer correct and the other forensic finding of note was what they found blood on the hammers handle even though it had been found in the bushes and been there for several weeks i stood and objected arguing that no testimony or evidence established how long the hammer had been in the bushes your honor freeman responded the hammer was found several weeks after the murder occurred it only stands to reason that it was in the bushes during that time before the judge could make a ruling i quickly countered again judge the state has introduced nothing in the way of evidence or testimony that concludes the hammer was in that bush for that long a time in fact the man who found it testified he had worked in and around those bushes at least twelve times since the murder and didnt see it until the morning he actually found it the hammer could have easily been planted the night before it was objection your honor freeman shouted counsel is using his objection to put forth the defenses case because he knows it will enough the judge bellowed from both of you the objection is sustained ms freeman you need to reword your question so that it does not assume facts not in evidence freeman looked down at her notes calming herself detective did you see blood on the hammer when it was turned in to you no i did not then how much blood was actually on the hammer it is described in the report as trace blood a minute amount that was beneath the upper part of the rubber grip that encases the wood handle okay so what did you do after receiving the report i arranged for the blood from the hammer to be tested at a private dna lab in santa monica why didnt you use the regional crime lab at cal state isnt that normal procedure it is normal procedure but we wanted to put a rush on this we had the money in the budget so we thought we should move quickly with it i had the results reviewed by our lab freeman paused there and asked the judge to include the forensic report on the hammer as a prosecution exhibit i didnt object and the judge approved freeman then changed course leaving the dna revelation for the dna expert who would come in at the end of the prosecutions case lets go back to the garage now detective were there any other significant findings i objected again this time to the form of the question which assumed that there had been a significant finding when in fact none had been testified to it was a cheap shot but i took it because the last skirmish over an objection had knocked down freemans momentum i wanted to keep trying to do that the judge told her to rephrase the question and she did detective you have testified about what you didnt find in the garage the hammer what can you tell us that you did find freeman turned to me after asking it as if to get my approval i nodded at her and smiled the fact that she would even acknowledge me was a sign i had gotten to her with the last two objections we found a pair of gardening shoes and got a positive reaction for blood when we conducted a luminol test luminol being one of the agents that reacts to blood under ultraviolet lighting correct thats correct it is used to detect locations where blood has been cleaned or wiped away where was the blood found here on the shoelace of the left shoe why were these particular shoes tested with luminol first of all it is routine to test all shoes and clothing when you are looking for the possibility of blood evidence there was blood at the scene of the crime so you work under the assumption that some must have gotten on the assailant secondly we had noticed in the backyard that the garden had been recently worked the soil had been overturned and yet these shoes were very clean well wouldnt someone clean their gardening shoes before going into the house possibly but we werent in the house we were in the garage and the shoes were in a cardboard box that contained a lot of loose dirt presumably from the garden and yet the shoes were quite clean it drew our attention freeman forwarded the video to the point where the shoes were shown they were sitting side by side in a box that said cocacola they were on a shelf under the workbench not hidden by any means just in the spot where they were probably routinely stored are these the shoes yes you can see one of the forensic techs collecting them there so you are saying that the fact that they were so clean but stored in a dirty box made them suspicious i objected stating she was leading the witness i won the point but the message got to the jury freeman moved on what made you think the shoes were lisa trammels because they were small obviously a womans shoes and because we found a framed photograph in the house that depicted lisa working in the garden she was wearing the shoes thank you detective what became of the shoes and the spot on the one shoelace that initially tested as showing blood the shoelace was turned over to the regional crime lab at cal state for dna testing why didnt you use the private lab for this the sample of blood was quite small we decided not to risk that we might lose the sample in an outside lab my partner and i actually handdelivered it to the cal state lab we also sent along other exemplars for comparison other exemplars for comparisonwhat does that mean blood from the victim was sent under separate delivery to the lab as well so that it could be compared to what was found on the shoe why separate delivery so there would be no chance of crosscontamination thank you detective longstreth i have no further questions at this time the judge called for the midafternoon break before crossexamination would begin my client unaware of the true purpose of my lunch invitation invited me to join her and dahl for coffee i declined saying i had to write out my questions for cross the truth was i already had my questions ready while before the trial i had thought freeman would use kurlen to introduce and testify about the hammer the shoes and the search of lisa trammels home i was nonetheless ready because the direct examination had gone exactly as i had expected it would instead i spent the break on the phone with cisco preparing him for the meeting with dahl at seven i told him to clue in bullocks and have tommy guns and bam bam outside the victory building for security i wasnt sure whether dahl was going to play it straight or not but i was going to be ready either way thirtyfive after the break detective longstreth retook the stand and the judge turned it over to me i threw no softballs and got right to the points i wanted to make in front of the jury primarily this was testimony that informed the jury that the neighborhood surrounding westland was searched by police on the day of the murder this included the house and presumably the landscaping where the hammer was eventually found detective i asked did it trouble you that this hammer was found so long after the murder and yet so close to the murder scene and in a spot that was inside a rather intense search perimeter no not really after the hammer was found i went out and looked at the bushes in front of that house they were big and very dense it didnt surprise me or trouble me at all that a hammer could have been in there all that time in fact i thought we had been pretty lucky that it had been found at all good answer i was beginning to see why freeman had broken things up between kurlen and longstreth longstreth was damn good on the stand maybe even better than her veteran partner i moved on one of the rules of the game was to distance yourself from mistakes dont compound things by dwelling okay lets move to the house in woodland hills now detective wouldnt you agree that the search of the house was a bust a bust im not sure i would call it a bust i did you find the defendants bloody clothes no we did not did you find the victims blood in the shower or bathtub drains no we did not what about in the washing machine no what evidence has the state presented during this trial that was obtained from inside the defendants home i am not talking about the garage just the home it took longstreth a few long moments of silence as she conducted an internal inventory finally she shook her head i cant recall anything at the moment but that still doesnt mean the search was a bust sometimes not finding evidence is just as useful as finding it i paused she was baiting me she wanted me to ask her to explain but if i did that i had no idea where she would go i decided to pull back not take the bait and move on okay but the real treasurethe evidence you did findwas found in the garage right the evidence that has been or will be brought to court in this trial i would think so yes were talking about the shoe with the blood on it and the tool set missing the hammer correct that is correct am i missing something else i dont think so okay then let me show you something here on the overhead screens i grabbed the remote which freeman had conveniently left on the lectern i reversed the search video keeping my eyes on the rewinding images i ran it right by the images i wanted and stopped it then moved forward to the right spot and paused okay can you tell the jury what is happening at this point in the video i hit the play button and the image on the screen started to move it showed longstreth and one of the forensic techs leaving the main house and crossing the portico to the door that led to the garage uh this is when we go into the garage longstreth said then her voice came from the recording we might need the key from kurlen she said but on the video she reached a gloved hand to the doorknob and it turned never mind its open i let the video run until longstreth and the forensic tech had entered the garage and turned on the lights i then paused it again was this the first time you had entered the garage detective yes i see you turned on the lights here had anybody else from the search team entered the garage before you no they had not i slowly backed up the video to the point where she had opened the door to enter i started the playback again and asked my questions as it played i notice you dont use a key to enter the garage detective why is that i tried the door as you can see here and it was unlocked do you know why no it was just unlocked was anybody at the home when the search team arrived no the house was empty and the door to the house itself was locked correct yes ms trammel had locked it when she agreed to accompany us to van nuys did she want to lock it or did you have to tell her no she wanted to lock up so at the time that she locked the house she left the outside door that led into the garage unlocked correct it would appear so its safe to say that it was unlocked at the time you and the others arrived with the search warrant correct that is correct meaning anyone could have entered the garage while its owner lisa trammel was in police custody correct i guess its possible yes by the way when you and detective kurlen left the house with ms trammel that morning did you leave a police officer on post at the house to sort of watch over it make sure nothing was disturbed or taken from inside no we did not didnt you think that would be prudent considering that the house might contain evidence in a murder investigation at the time she was not a suspect she was just someone we wanted to talk to i almost smiled and longstreth almost smiled she had tiptoed past a trap i had set for her she was good ah i said not a suspect thats right so how long would you say was that side door left unlocked and the garage available for anyone to enter that would be impossible for me to tell i dont know when it was left unlocked in the first place its possible she never locked the garage i nodded and put a pause under her answer did you or detective kurlen instruct the forensics team to see if there were any fingerprints on the door leading to the garage no we did not why not detective we didnt think it was necessary we were searching the house not holding it as a crime scene let me ask you hypothetically detective do you think that someone who has carefully planned and carried out a murder would then leave a pair of bloody shoes in their unlocked garage especially after taking the time to get rid of the murder weapon freeman objected citing the compound nature of the question and arguing that it assumed facts not in evidence i didnt care the question hadnt been for longstreth to consider it had been directed at the jury your honor i withdraw the question i announced and i have nothing further for this witness i moved away from the lectern and sat down i stared pointedly at the jurors my eyes sweeping across one row of them and then the other finally i held them on furlong in the three spot he held my stare and didnt look away i took that as a very good sign thirtysix herb dahl came alone cisco met him at the door of the office suite and escorted him into my office where i was waiting bullocks sat to my left and we had an empty seat for dahl right in front of my desk cisco stayed standing which was by design i wanted cisco pacing and pensive i wanted dahl to feel unease that the wrong word spoken could unleash the big man in the tight black tshirt i didnt offer dahl coffee soda or water i didnt start with any platitudes or efforts to mend our strained relationship i simply got down to business what were going to do here herb is find out exactly what youve done what your involvement with louis opparizio has been and what were going to do about it as far as i know im not needed anywhere until nine oclock tomorrow morning so weve got all night if thats what it takes before we start i want to know that we have a deal if i cooperate dahl said i told you at lunch the deal is you stay out of prison in exchange you tell me what you know beyond that no promises i wont testify to anything this is informational only besides i have something better for you than my testifying well see about that but right now why dont we start at the beginning you said today that you were told to go on lisa trammels picket line start there dahl nodded but then disagreed i think i have to start before that this goes back to the beginning of last year i raised two open hands have at it weve got all night dahl then proceeded to tell a long story about a movie he produced a year earlier called blood racer it was a warm family movie about a girl who is given a horse named chester she finds a tattooed number inside the animals lower lip that indicates he was once a thoroughbred racehorse thought to have been killed in a barn fire years before so she and her pop do some more investigating and look i interrupted it sounds like a nice story but can we talk about louis opparizio i may have all night but lets stay on point anyway that is the point this movie it was supposed to be low budget all the way but i love horses ever since i was a little kid and i really thought i could get out of the racks with this one the racks the straighttodvd dreck you see out there i was thinking this story was a diamond in the rough and if we did it right we could get a major theatrical release but to get that you need production value and to get that you need money it always comes down to money you borrowed the money i borrowed the money and put it into the flick stupid i know and this was on top of the investor money i took at the start but the director was this perfectionist freak from spain guy barely spoke english but we hired him he did take after take on every setupthirty takes at a frickin snack bar scene bottom line is we ran out of money and i needed a quarter mill minimum just to finish the film i had already been all over town and everybody was tapped but i loved this flick to me it was like the little movie that could you know you got the money on the street cisco said from a position behind dahls chair dahl twisted around to look up at him and nodded yeah from a guy i know a bentnose guy whats his name i asked we dont need his name in this dahl said yes we do what is his name danny greene i thought you said yeah i know hes with them but his names greenewhat can i say its green with an e at the end i gave cisco a look he would need to check this out okay so you took a quarter million from danny greene and what happened dahl raised his palms in a gesture indicating frustration thats just it nothing happened i finished the flick but i couldnt sell it i took it to every frickin festival in north america and nobody wanted it i took it to the american film market rented a frickin suite at the loews in santa monica and only sold it to spain of course the one country that was interested was where my asshole director was from so danny greene wasnt too happy was he nope he wasnt i mean i had been keeping up with the payments but it was a sixmonth loan and he called it in i couldnt pay it all i gave him the spanish money but most of that was on the come they gotta dub it and all that shit and i wont see most of that cash till the end of this year when the movie comes out over there so i was seriously fucked what happened well one day danny comes to me i mean he just shows up and im thinking hes here to break my legs but instead he says they need me to do something its like a longterm job and if i do it theyll restructure my loan and i can even lay off a good chunk of the remaining principal so man im sitting there ive got no choice whatm i going to do tell danny greene no uhuh doesnt work that way so you said yes thats right i said yes and what was the job to get close to these people who were agitating and protesting about all the foreclosures this organization called flag he wanted me to get inside their camp if i could so i did and thats how i met lisa she was the top agitator this sounded crazy but i played along with it were you told why not really i was just told there was a guy out there who was sort of paranoid and he wanted to know what she was up to he had some kind of deal going and didnt want these people to mess it up so if lisa was planning a protest or something then i was supposed to tell danny where it would be and who the target was and like that the story was starting to have the ring of truth to it i thought about the lemure deal opparizio had been in the process of setting up the sale of aloft to the publicly traded company it was prudent business practice to keep tabs on any potential threats to the deal before it was finished in february that could even include lisa trammel bad publicity could hinder the sale stockholders always want squeakyclean acquisitions okay what else not a whole lot else just intelligence gathering i got close to lisa but then like a month later she got popped for the murder danny came back then i thought he was going to say deals off because she was in jail but he said he wanted me to put up the money and get her out he gave me the money in a bagtwo hundred thou then when i got her out i was supposed to do the same thing again only with you people get inside the defense camp see what was going on and report back i looked over at cisco his pensive moves were no longer an act we both knew that dahl could be the tip of an iceberg that would tear the bottom out of the prosecutions case and sink it we also knew we might have a client in lisa trammel who was completely unlikable but innocent and if she was innocent where does opparizio come into this i asked well he sort of doesntat least not directly but when i call danny to check in he always wants to know what youve got on opparizio thats how he says it what do they have on opparizio he asks that every time so im thinking maybe hes the guy im really doing this work for you know i didnt respond at first i swiveled in my chair thinking the story over you know what i dont get and what isnt in your story dahl cisco said what the part about you hiring those two guys to go after mick you left that part out asshole what about that i added dahl raised his hands in surrender to show his innocence hey they told me to do it they sent me those two guys why beat me up what did that do it slowed you down didnt it they want lisa to go down for this and they started thinking you were too good they wanted to slow you down dahl avoided eye contact by brushing imaginary lint off his thigh as he spoke it made me think he might be lying about the reason behind the attack on me it was the first false note i had picked up during the confession my guess was that dahl had been freelancing on the attack that maybe he was the one who wanted me hurt i looked at bullocks and then at cisco my quibble with dahls last answer aside we had an opportunity here i knew what dahl was going to offer next himself as a double agent wed reach the beach with him feeding opparizio false intelligence i had to think about this i could easily give dahl misleading information to take back to danny greene but it would be a risky maneuver not to mention the ethical considerations i stood up and signaled cisco toward the door everybody sit tight for a minute i want to talk to my investigator out here we stepped into the reception area and i closed the door behind me i walked over to lornas desk you know what this means i asked it means were going to win this fucking case i opened the middle drawer of lornas desk and took out the stack of delivery menus for local restaurants and fastfood chains no it means those two guys at the clubhouse they mightve been bondurants killers and we fucked things up with that little play in the back room i dont know about that boss yeah what did your two associates do with them exactly what i told them to do drop them off they told me later that both of them wanted to be left off at some bottle club in downtown that was it i mean it mick its still fucked up with the menus in my hand i headed toward the door to my office cisco spoke to my back do you believe dahl i looked back at him before opening the door to a point i went into the office and put the menus down in the middle of the desk i took my seat again and looked at dahl he was a weasel always on the make and i was about to go down the path with him we shouldnt do it bullocks said i looked at her do what use him to feed bad intel back to opparizio we should put him on the stand and make him tell the story to the jury dahl immediately protested im not testifying who the fuck is she saying how this i raised my hands in a calming gesture youre not testifying i said even if i wanted you to i couldnt get you on the stand you have nothing that directly connects opparizio to this have you ever even met the man no have you ever seen him before yeah in the court before that no and i had never even heard his name until danny asked me about him i looked at bullocks and shook my head theyre too smart to leave a direct link out there the judge wouldnt let him anywhere near the stand then what about danny greene we put him on the stand and what do we use to compel him to testify hed take the fifth before we even got to his name there is only one thing to do here i waited for further protest but bullocks was finally and sullenly silent i looked back at dahl i disliked the man intensely and trusted him about as much as i trusted that he had his own hair but that didnt stop me from taking the next step dahl how is contact initiated with danny greene i usually call him about ten every night yeah during the trial its been that way he always wants to hear from me most nights he answers and if not he calls me back pretty quick okay lets dig in and order some takeout tonight you make the call from here what am i going to say were going to work that out between now and ten when you make the call but essentially i think you are going to tell danny greene that louis opparizio doesnt have a thing to worry about when he takes the stand youre going to tell him that weve got nothing that weve been bluffing and that the coast is clear thirtyseven thursday was supposed to be the day when all the orchestral elements came together in a crescendo for the prosecution since monday morning andrea freeman had carefully rolled out her case easily handling the variables and unknowns like the potshots i had taken and the intrusion of the federal target letter in a strategic buildup that gathered momentum and led inalterably to this day thursday was the science day the day that all elements of evidence and testimony would be tied together with the unbreakable bindings of scientific fact it was a good strategy but this is where i intended to turn her plans upsidedown in the courtroom there are three things for the lawyer to always consider the knowns the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns whether at the prosecution or defense table it is the lawyers job to master the first two and always be prepared for the third on thursday i intended to be one of the unknown unknowns i had seen andrea freemans strategy from a mile away she would not see mine until she had stepped into it like quicksand and it silenced her crescendo her first witness was dr joachim gutierrez the assistant medical examiner who performed the autopsy on mitchell bondurants body using a morbid slide show that i had halfheartedly and unsuccessfully objected to the doctor took the jury on a magical mystery tour of the victims body cataloging every bruise abrasion and broken tooth of course he spent the most time describing and showing on the screens the damage created by the three impacts of the murder weapon he pointed out which had been the first blow and why it was fatal he called the second two strikes delivered when the victim was facedown on the ground overkill and testified that in his experience overkill was equated with an emotional context the three brutal strikes revealed that the killer had personal animosity toward the victim i could have objected to both the question and answer but they played nicely into a question i would later ask doctor freeman asked at one point you have three brutal strikes on the top of the head all within a circle with a fourinch diameter how is it that you can tell which one came first and which one was the fatal blow it is a painstaking process yet a very simple one the blows to the skull created two fracture patterns the immediate and most damaging impact was in the contact area where each strike of the weapon created what is termed a depressed calvarial fracture which is really just a fancy way of saying it created a depression in the skull or a dent a dent you see all bone has a certain elasticity with injuries like thisa forceful traumatic impactthe skull bone depresses in the shape of the striking instrument and two things happen you get parallel break lines on the surfacethese are called terraced fracturesand on the interior you get a deep depression fracturethe dent on the inside of the skull this depression causes a fracture that we call a pyramid splinter this splinter projects through the dura which is the interior lining and directly into the brain often and as was found in this case the splinter breaks and is propelled deep into the brain tissue like a bullet it instantly causes the termination of brain function and death like a bullet you said so these three impacts on the victims head were so forceful that it was literally tantamount to him being shot three times in the head yes that is correct but it only took one of these splinters to kill him the first one which brings me back to my initial question how can you tell which impact was the first one can i demonstrate this the judge gave permission for gutierrez to put a diagram of a skull on the video screens it was an overhead view and it showed the three impact spots where the hammer had struck these points were drawn in blue other fractures were drawn in red to determine the sequence of blows in a multipletrauma situation we go to the secondary fractures those are the fractures in red i called these parallel breaks terraced fractures because as i said earlier they are like steps moving away from the impact point a fracture or crack like this can extend completely across the bone and here you see that with this victim these fracture lines stretch across the parietaltemporal region but such fractures always end when they reach an alreadyexisting fracture the energy is simply absorbed by the existing fracture therefore by studying the victims skull and tracing the terraced fractures it becomes possible to determine which of these fractures came first and then of course you trace these back to the impact point and you can easily see the order of the blows on the drawing on the screen the numbers and were in place depicting the order of blows that rained down on mitchell bondurants head the first blowthe fatal impacthad been to the very top of his head freeman moved on from there and spent most of the morning milking the testimony finally reaching a point where she was belaboring the obvious in many areas with too many questions that were repetitive or not germane twice the judge asked her to move along to other areas of testimony and i began to believe she was trying to stall she had to keep the witness going through the morning because her next witness was possibly not on hand and may have even flaked out on her but if she was nervous about some problem freeman didnt show it she kept her focus on gutierrez and steadfastly walked him through his testimony finishing with what was most importanttying the craftsman hammer found in the bushes to the wounds on the victims head to do this she brought out the props following the bondurant autopsy gutierrez had made a mold of the victims skull he also took a series of photos of the scalp and had prints made that depicted the wounds in onetoone size presented with the hammer that had been entered into evidence gutierrez removed it from its plastic bag and began a demonstration that showed how its flat circular face fit the wounds and skull indentations perfectly the hammer also had a notch on the top edge of its facing that could be used to hold a nail this notch was clearly seen in the depression left on the skull it all fit together in a perfect prosecutorial puzzle freeman was beaming as she saw a key element of proof solidify in front of the jury doctor do you have any hesitation in telling the jury that this tool could have created the fatal injury to the victim none you realize that this tool is not unique correct of course i am not saying that this specific hammer caused these injuries i am saying it was either this hammer or one that came out of the same mold i cant be more specific than that thank you doctor now lets talk about the notch on the strike surface of the hammer what can you tell about the position of the notch in the wound pattern gutierrez held up the hammer and pointed to the notch the notch is on the top edge this area is magnetized you put the nail in place here the hammer holds it and then you drive the nail into the surface of the material you are working with because we know the notch is on the top edge we can then look at the wounds and see which direction they came from and what direction is that from the rear the victim was struck from behind so he may have never even seen his assailant coming that is correct thank you dr gutierrez i have no further questions at this time the judge turned the witness over to me and as i passed freeman on the way to the lectern she gave me a deadpan look that transmitted the message take your best shot asshole i intended to i put my legal pad down on the lectern tightened my tie and shot my cuffs then looked at the witness before i sat down again i wanted to own him around the medical examiners office they call you dr guts dont they sir it was a good outofthegate question it would make the witness wonder what other inside information i knew and could possibly spring on him uh sometimes yes informally you might say why is that doctor freeman objected on relevance and it got the judges attention do you want to tell me how this ties into the reason we are here today mr haller he asked your honor i think if allowed to respond the answer dr gutierrez will give will reveal that he has an expertise in pathology that is not in the area of tool patterns and head wounds perry mulled things over and then nodded the witness will answer i turned my focus back to gutierrez doctor you can answer the question why are you called dr guts it is because as you said i have an expertise in identifying diseases of the gastrointestinal tractthe gutsand it also goes with the name especially when it is pronounced incorrectly thank you doctor now can you tell us how many times you have had a case in which you matched a hammer to the wounds on a victims skull this would be the first one i nodded to underline the point so youre sort of a rookie when it comes to a killing with a hammer thats right but my comparison was painstaking and cautious my conclusions are not wrong play to his superiority complex i am a doctor i am not wrong have you ever been wrong before in giving court testimony as a witness everyone makes mistakes i am sure i have what about the stoneridge case freeman quickly objected as i knew she would she asked for a sidebar and the judge waved us up i knew this would go no further but i had gotten it out in front of the jury they knew from what little had just been said that somewhere in his past gutierrez had testified and been wrong that was all i needed judge we both know where counsel is going and not only is it not relevant to this matter but stoneridge is still under investigation and there has been no official conclusion what could i withdraw it she looked at me with searing hostility in her eyes no problem i have another question oh as long as the jury hears the question you dont care what the answer is judge i want an instruction on this because what he is doing is not right ill take care of it go back and mr haller you watch yourself thank you your honor the judge instructed the jurors to disregard my question and reminded them that it would be unfair of them to consider anything outside of the evidence and testimony while later conducting their deliberations he then told me to proceed and i went in a new direction doctor lets zero in on the fatal wound and get a little more detailed you called this a depression fracture correct actually i called it a depressed calvarial fracture i always loved it when the prosecutions witnesses corrected me okay so the depression or dent that was left by this traumatic impact did you measure it measure it in what way how about its depth did you measure that yes i did may i refer to my notes you sure can doctor gutierrez checked his copy of the autopsy protocol yes we called the fatal impact wound onea and yes indeed i did measure the definitions of the wound pattern shall i give you those measurements my next question please tell us doctor how did it measure out gutierrez looked at his report while speaking measurements were taken at four points of the circular impact location using a clockface the measurements were at three six nine and twelve the twelve being where the notch on the surface was located and what did the measurements tell you there was very little play in these numbers less than a quarter of a centimeter separated the four measurements they averaged out to seven millimeters in depth which is approximately a quarter of an inch he looked up from his notes i was writing his numbers down even though i had already gotten them off the autopsy protocol i glanced over at the box and saw a few jurors writing in their notebooks a good sign so doctor i noticed that this part of your work didnt come up on direct examination by ms freeman what did these measurements mean to you in terms of the angle of impact of the weapon gutierrez shrugged he stole a glance at freeman and got the message be careful here there is nothing really to conclude from these numbers really wouldnt the fact that the impression in the bonethe dent as you called itleft by the hammer was almost even at all measurable points indicate to you that the hammer struck the victim evenly on the top of the head gutierrez looked down at his notes he was a man of science i had just asked him a sciencebased question and he knew how to answer it but he also knew he had somehow strayed into a minefield he didnt know how or why only that the prosecutor sitting fifteen feet from him was nervous doctor do you want me to repeat the question no that is not necessary you must remember that in science onetenth of a centimeter can mean quite a difference are you saying that the hammer did not strike mr bondurant evenly sir no he said in an annoyed tone i am just saying that it is not as cut and dried as people think yes it appears that the hammer struck the victim flush if you will thank you doctor and when you look at your wounddepth measurements on the second and third strikes they are not as even correct yes that is correct in both of these impacts the deviation ranges up to three millimeters in each i had him now i was rolling i stepped back from the lectern and started to wander to my left into the open space between the lectern and the jury box i put my hands in my pockets and adopted a pose of a completely confident man and so doctor you have the fatal blow delivered clean and flush to the top of the head the next two not the same way what would account for this difference the orientation of the skull the first strike stopped brain function within a second the abrasions and other injuries to the bodythe broken teeth for exampleindicate an immediate dead fall from a standing position it is likely that the second and third strikes occurred after he was down you just said the other injuries indicate an immediate dead fall from a standing position why are you sure the victim was standing when attacked from behind the abrasions to both knees are indicative of this so he could not have been kneeling when attacked it seems unlikely the abrasions on the knees indicate otherwise what about crouching like a baseball catcher again not possible when you look at the damage to his knees deep abrasions and a fracture to the left patella the kneecap as it is more commonly called so no doubt in your mind that he was standing when struck with the fatal blow none it was perhaps the most important answer to any question in the whole trial but i glided on like it was just part of the routine thank you doctor now lets go back to the skull for a moment how strong would you say the skull is in the area where the fatal impact occurred depends on the age of the subject our skulls grow thicker as we age our subject is mitchell bondurant doctor how thick was his skull did you measure it i did it was point eight centimeters thick in the impact region about onethird of an inch and have you conducted any sort of study or test to determine what kind of force it would have taken for a hammer to create the fatal dent fracture in this case i have not no are you aware of any such studies of this question in general there are studies in the area the conclusions are very broad i happen to think each case is unique you cant go by general studies isnt it widely held that the threshold measurement of pressure needed to create a depression fracture is one thousand pounds of pressure per square inch freeman stood and objected she said that i was asking questions outside the scope of dr gutierrezs expertise as a witness mr haller himself was quick to point out in his crossexamination that the witnesss expertise is in diseases of the gi tract not bone elasticity and depression it was a nowin situation for her and she had chosen the lesser of two evils burning her witness or allowing me to continue to ask him questions that he didnt know the answers to sustained the judge said lets move on mr haller ask your next question yes your honor i flipped a few pages on my pad and acted like i was reading it would buy me a few moments while i considered the next move i then turned and looked at the clock on the back wall of the courtroom it was fifteen minutes till lunch if i wanted to send the jury out with a final bit of food for thought i needed to act now doctor i said did you record the height of the victim gutierrez checked his notes mr bondurant was six feet one inch tall at the time of his death so this area at the crown of the head would be six feet and one inch high is that fair to say doctor yes it is actually with mr bondurant wearing shoes he would have been even taller correct yes maybe an inch and a half to account for the heels okay so knowing the victims height and knowing that the fatal wound came in flush on the top of his head what does that tell us about the angle of attack i am not sure what you mean by angle of attack are you sure about that doctor i am talking about the angle the hammer was at in relation to the impact area but this would be impossible to know because we dont know the posture of the victim or whether he was ducking from the blow or what the exact situation was when he was struck gutierrez ended his answer with a nod as though proud of the way he had handled the challenge but doctor didnt you testify during direct examination from ms freeman that it appeared to you at least that mr bondurant was struck from behind in a surprise attack i did doesnt that contradict what you just said about ducking from the blow which is it doctor feeling cornered gutierrez reacted in the way most cornered men do with arrogance my testimony is that we do not know exactly what happened in that garage or what posture the victim was in or what the orientation of his skull was when he was struck with the fatal blow to be minutely guessing and secondguessing at this point is a fools errand you are saying it is foolish to attempt to understand what happened in the garage no i am not saying that at all you are taking the words and twisting them freeman had to do something she stood and objected and said i was badgering the witness i wasnt and the judge said as much but the little interruption was enough for gutierrez to collect himself and resume his calm and superior demeanor i decided to wrap things up i had largely been using dr guts as a setup man for my own expert who would testify during the defense phase i believed i was almost there doctor would you agree that if we could determine the victims posture and the orientation of his skull at the time of that first fatal blow then we would have insight as to the angle at which the murder weapon was held gutierrez considered the question for longer than it had taken me to ask it then reluctantly nodded yes it would give us some insight but it is imposs thank you doctor my next question is if we knew all of these thingsthe posture the orientation the angle of the weaponwouldnt we then be able to make some assumptions about the height of the attacker it doesnt make sense we cant know these things he held both his hands up in frustration and turned to look at the judge for help he got none doctor you are not answering the question let me ask you again if we did indeed know all of these factors could we then make assumptions about the attackers height he dropped his hands in an i give up gesture of course of course but we do not know these factors we doctor dont you mean you dont know these factors because you didnt look for them no i dont you mean you didnt want to know these factors because they would reveal that it was physically impossible for the defendant at five foot three to have ever committed objection this crime against a man ten inches taller than her luckily they no longer used gavels in california courtrooms perry would have smashed his through the bench sustained sustained sustained i picked up my pad and flipped over all the folded back pages in a show of frustration and finality i have nothing further for mr haller the judge barked i have warned you repeatedly about acting out in front of the jury consider this your last warning next time there will be consequences noted your honor thank you the jury will disregard the last exchange between counsel and the witness it is stricken from the record i sat down not daring to glance at the jury box but that was okay i felt the vibe their eyes were on me they were riding with me not all of them but enough thirtyeight i spent the lunch hour schooling lisa trammel on what to expect during the afternoon session of court herb dahl was not present having been dispatched on a phony errand so i could be alone with my client as best i could i tried to explain to her the risks we would be taking as the prosecutions case wound down and the defense took center stage she was scared but she trusted me and thats about all you can ask from a client the truth no but trust yes once court reconvened freeman called dr henrietta stanley to the witness stand she identified herself as a supervising biologist for the los angeles regional crime laboratory at cal state la my guess was that she would be the last witness for the prosecution and her testimony would have two parts of major significance she would confirm that dna testing of the blood found on the recovered hammer matched mitchell bondurants dna perfectly and that the blood found on lisa trammels gardening shoe also matched the victims the scientific testimony would bring the case full circle with blood being the link my only intention was to rob the prosecution of the moment dr stanley freeman began you either conducted or supervised all dna analysis that came from the investigation of mitchell bondurants death did you not i supervised and reconfirmed one analysis conducted by an outside vendor the other analysis i handled myself but i must add that i have two assistants in the lab who help me and they do a good portion of the work under my supervision at one point in the investigation you were asked to have a small amount of blood that had been found on a hammer analyzed for a dna comparison to the victim were you not we used an outside vendor on that analysis because time was of the essence i supervised that process and later confirmed the findings your honor i was standing at the defense table the judge looked annoyed with me for interrupting freemans examination what is it mr haller to save the courts time and the jury from going through a longdrawnout explanation of dna analysis and matching the defense stipulates stipulates to what mr haller that the blood on the hammer came from mitchell bondurant the judge didnt miss a beat the chance to jump the trial forward an hour or more was welcomedwith caution very well mr haller but you will not get the opportunity to challenge this during the defense phase you know that right i know it judge there will be no need to challenge it and your client does not object to this tactic i turned my body slightly toward lisa trammel and gestured to her she is perfectly aware of this tactic and agrees she is also willing to go on record if you wish to ask her directly i dont think that is necessary how does the state feel about this freeman looked suspicious like she was looking for the trap judge she said i want it clear that the defendant is acknowledging that the blood found on the hammer was indeed mitchell bondurants blood and i want a waiver on ineffective counsel i dont think a waiver is necessary perry said but i will get the stipulation directly from the defendant he then asked lisa questions that confirmed she was on board with the stipulation once freeman said she was satisfied perry turned his chair and rolled to the end of the bench so he could address the jury ladies and gentlemen the witness was going to take you through an explanation of the science of dna typing and matching leading you to testimony in regard to lab tests matching blood found on the hammer that is in evidence to that of our victim mitchell bondurant by stipulating the defense is saying they agree with those findings and will not object to them so what you take from this is that the blood found on the handle of the hammer found in the bushes near the bank did indeed come from the victim mitchell bondurant this is now stipulated as a proven fact and i will have that in writing for you when you begin your deliberations he nodded once and then rolled back into place where he told freeman to proceed knocked out of rhythm by my unexpected move she asked the judge for a few moments while she got her bearings and found the place from which to restart her examination finally she looked up at her witness okay dr stanley the blood from the hammer was not the only sample of blood from this case that you were asked to have analyzed correct that is correct we were also given a separate sample of blood discovered on a shoe found on the defendants premises in the garage i believe we typed your honor i said as i rose from my seat again once more the defense wishes to stipulate this time the move brought complete silence to the courtroom nobody was whispering in the gallery the bailiff wasnt using his hand to muffle his voice on his telephone the court reporters fingers were held steady over the keys complete silence the judge had been sitting with the fingers of both hands knitted together beneath his chin he held his pose for a long moment before using both hands to signal freeman and me forward to the bench come on up here counsel freeman and i stood side by side in front of the bench the judge whispered mr haller your reputation preceded you when you came into my courtroom on this case i was told by more than one source that you were a damn fine lawyer and a tireless advocate i need to ask however if you know what youre doing here you want to stipulate to the prosecutions contention that the victims blood was found on your clients own shoe are you sure about that mr haller i nodded as if to concede that he had made a good point in questioning my trial strategy judge we did the analysis ourselves and it came back as a match the science doesnt lie and the defense is not interested in trying to mislead the court or the jury if a trial is a search for truth then let the truth come out the defense stipulates we will prove later that the blood was planted on the shoe that is where the real truth lies not with whether or not it was his blood we acknowledge that it was and were ready to move on your honor may i be heard freeman said go ahead ms freeman the state objects to the stipulation she had finally caught on the judge looked aghast i dont understand ms freeman you get what you want the victims blood on the defendants shoes your honor dr stanley is my last witness counsel is seeking to undercut the states case by robbing me of the ability to present evidence in the way i wish to present it this witnesss testimony is devastating to the defense he just wants to stipulate to lessen its impact on the jury but a stipulation must be agreed to by both parties i made a mistake taking the stipulation on the hammer but not this time not on the shoes the state objects to this the judge was undaunted he saw a savings of at least a half day of court time and he wasnt going to let it go counsel understand that the court can overrule your objection in the cause of judicial economy id rather not do that he was telling her not to go against him on this to accept the stipulation im sorry your honor but the state still objects overruled you can step back and so it went as with the hammer the judge relayed the stipulation to the jury and promised they would receive a document outlining the evidence and facts agreed to by the start of deliberations i had successfully silenced the crescendo of the prosecutions case instead of going out with the crashing of cymbals drums and evidence that screamed she did it she did it she did it the prosecution went out with a whimper freeman was seething she knew how important the payoff was to the gradual buildup you dont listen to boléro for ten minutes and turn it off with the final two minutes to go not only did the truncating of her case hurt but i had effectively turned her last and most important witness into the first witness for the defense by stipulating i had made it seem as if the dna returns were the initial building blocks of my case and there was nothing freeman could do she had put the whole case out and had nothing left after excusing stanley from the witness stand she sat at the prosecution table turning through her notes probably thinking about whether she should put kurlen or longstreth back on the stand to finish the case with a detectives roundup of all the evidence but there were risks to that she had rehearsed their testimony before but not this time ms freeman the judge finally asked do you have another witness freeman looked over at the jury box she had to believe she had the verdict so what if the evidence wasnt delivered according to the plan she had choreographed the evidence was still there and in the record the vics blood on the hammer and on the defendants shoes it was more than enough she had the verdict in her pocket she slowly rose still looking at the jurors then she turned and addressed the judge your honor the people rest it was a solemn moment and again the courtroom turned still and silent this time for almost a whole minute very well the judge finally said i dont think any of us thought we would be at this place so soon mr haller are you ready to proceed with the presentation of the defenses case i stood your honor the defense is ready to proceed the judge nodded he still seemed a bit shellshocked by the defenses decision to acknowledge and accept as evidence the victims blood on the defendants shoes then well take our afternoon break a little early he said and when we come back the defense phase will begin part fourthe fifth witness thirtynine if the defense tactics during the latter stages of the prosecutions case were surprising the first step out of the corner during the defense phase did nothing to lessen some observers doubts as to the competence of counsel once everyone was back in place following the afternoon break i went to the lectern and threw another what the hell move into the trial the defense calls the defendant lisa trammel the judge asked for quiet as my client stood and made her way to the stand that she was called at all was shocking and caused a roll of whispers and chatter in the courtroom as a general rule defense attorneys dont like to put a client on the witness stand in a risktoreward ratio this tactic ranks quite low you can never be sure what your client will say because you can never fully believe anything she has told you and to be caught in a single lie while under oath and on the stand in front of the twelve people determining your guilt or innocence is devastating but this time and this case were different lisa trammel had never wavered in her claim to innocence she had never once waffled in her response to the evidence against her and she had never once been remotely interested in any sort of deal given this and the developments regarding the herb dahllouis opparizio connection i was viewing her differently than i had at the start of the trial she had insisted on having a chance to tell the jury she was innocent and it occurred to me the night before that she should be given the opportunity the very moment it became available she would be the first witness the defendant took the oath with a slight smile on her face it may have seemed out of place to some after she was seated and her name was in the record i jumped right on it lisa i just saw you smiling a little bit when you were taking the oath to tell the truth why were you smiling oh you know nervousness and relief relief yes relief i finally get the chance to tell my side to tell the truth it started out well from there i quickly took her through the standard list of basic questions about who she was what she did for a living and the state of her marriage as well as touching on the state of her home ownership did you know the victim of this terrible crime mitchell bondurant know him no know of him yes what do you mean by that well over the past year or so when i started to get in trouble with the mortgage i had seen him i went to the bank a couple times to plead my case to him they never let me talk to him but i saw him back there in his office the wall of his office was completely made of glass which was a joke like you could see him but not talk to him i checked the jury i didnt see any outright head nods but i thought the answer and the image my client had conjured were perfect the banker hiding behind a wall of glass while the downtrodden and disadvantaged are kept away did you ever see him anywhere else on the morning of the murder i saw him at the coffee shop i stop at he was two people behind me in line thats why i was confused when i was talking to the detectives they were asking about mr bondurant and i had just seen him that morning i didnt know he was dead i didnt realize they were investigating me for a murder i didnt know had even been committed so far so good she was playing it as we had discussed and rehearsed right down to always referring to the victim with complete respect if not sympathy did you talk to mr bondurant that morning no i didnt i was afraid he might think i was stalking him or something and take me to court also i had been warned by you to avoid any encounter or confrontation with people from the bank so i quickly got my coffee and left lisa did you kill mr bondurant no of course not did you sneak up behind him with a hammer from your garage and hit him on the head so hard that he was dead before he hit the ground no i did not did you hit him two more times when he was on the ground no i paused as if to study my notes i wanted her denials to echo in the courtroom and in each jurors mind lisa you made quite a name for yourself fighting the foreclosure of your home didnt you it wasnt my intention i just wanted to keep my home for myself and my son i did what i thought was right it ended up getting a lot of attention it wasnt good attention for the bank was it freeman objected arguing that i was asking trammel a question she would not have the knowledge to answer the judge agreed and told me to ask something else there came a time when the bank sought to stop your protests and other activities correct yes they took me to court and got a restraining order against me i couldnt have any more protests at the bank so i had them at the courthouse and did people join your cause yes i started a website and hundreds of peoplea lot of them like me losing their homesjoined in you became quite visible as the leader of this group didnt you i guess so but it was never about getting attention for myself it was about what they were doing the frauds they were committing when they took away peoples houses and condos and everything how many times do you think you were on the television news or in the newspaper i didnt keep count but a few times i went national i was on cnn and fox by the way speaking of going national lisa on the morning of the murder did you walk by westland national in sherman oaks no i didnt that wasnt you on the sidewalk just a half block away no it was not so the woman who testified she saw you was lying under oath i dont want to call anyone a liar but it wasnt me maybe she just made a mistake thank you lisa i looked down at my notes and shifted direction by seemingly keeping my own client off guard with changing subjects and questions i was in effect keeping the jury off guard which is what i wanted to do i didnt want them thinking ahead of me i wanted their undivided attention and i wanted to feed them the story in pieces and in an order of my choosing do you normally keep your garage door locked i asked yes always why is that well its not attached to the house you have to go outside the house to go into the garage so i always have the door locked i have mostly junk in there but some stuff is valuable my husband always treated the tools like they were precious and i have the helium tank for balloons and parties and i dont want any of the older kids in the neighborhood to get into that and well i once read about somebody who had a detached garage like mine and she never locked her door and then one day she went into the garage and a man was in there stealing stuff he raped her so i always keep the door locked do you have any idea why it was unlocked when the police searched your home on the day of the murder no i always kept it locked when was the last time before this trial that you saw the hammer from your workbench in its place in the garage i dont remember ever seeing it my husband was the one who had all the tools set up in there im not really good with tools what about gardening tools well i take that back if you mean tools like that i do the gardening and those are my tools do you have any idea how a microdot of blood from mr bondurant ended up on one of your gardening shoes lisa stared forward with a troubled look on her face her chin wavered slightly as she spoke i dont know theres no explanation i hadnt worn those shoes in a long time and i didnt kill mr bondurant her last line was spoken almost as a plea it carried a sense of desperation and truth i paused to savor it and hoped the jurors had noted it as well after that i spent another half hour with her working mostly the same themes and denials i got into more detail about her coffeeshop encounter with bondurant as well as the foreclosure process and the hopes she had of winning the case her purpose in the defense case was threefold i needed her denial and explanations on record i needed her personality to engender sympathy from the jury and put a human face on a case about murder and finally i needed to have the jurors start to wonder if this diminutive and seemingly fragile woman could lie in wait and then forcefully swing a hammer at a mans head three times by the time i came to the end of the direct examination i felt i had gone a long way toward accomplishing all three of these goals i tried to go out with a little crescendo of my own did you hate mitchell bondurant i asked i hated what he and his bank were doing to me and others like me but i didnt hate him personally i didnt even know him but you had lost your marriage and you had lost your job and now you were in danger of losing your house didnt you wish to lash out at the forces you believed were hurting you i was already lashing out i was protesting my mistreatment i had hired a lawyer and was fighting the foreclosure yes i was angry but i wasnt violent i am not a violent person im a schoolteacher i was lashing out if you have to use those words in the only way i knew peacefully protesting something that was wrong very definitely wrong i glanced at the jury and thought i caught a woman in the back row wiping away a tear i hoped to god she was i turned back to my client and moved in for the big closing i ask you once again lisa did you kill mitchell bondurant no i didnt did you take a hammer and strike him with it in the garage at the bank no i wasnt there it wasnt me then how was the hammer from your garage used to kill him i dont know how was his blood found on your shoes i dont know i didnt do it i was set up i paused for a moment and calmed my voice before finishing one last question lisa how tall are you she looked confused like a rag doll that had been pulled one way and then the other what do you mean just tell us how tall you are im five three thank you lisa i have nothing further freeman had her work cut out for her lisa trammel had been a solid witness and the prosecutor wasnt going to break her she tried in a few places to get contradictory responses but lisa more than held her own after a half hour of freeman trying to break down a door with a toothpick i began to think my client was going to sail through but it never pays to think youre safe until your client is off the stand and sitting next to you freeman had at least one card up her sleeve and she eventually played it when mr haller asked you a little while ago if you had committed this crime you said you were not violent you said you were a schoolteacher and that you werent violent do you remember that yes its true but isnt it true that you were forced to change schools and undergo angermanagement treatment four years ago when you struck a student with a threesided ruler i quickly stood and objected and asked for a sidebar the judge allowed us to approach judge i whispered before perry even asked theres nothing in any of the discovery about a threesided ruler wheres this coming from judge freeman whispered before perry even asked its new information that just came to us late last week we had to verify it oh come on i said youre going to say you didnt have her full teaching record from the getgo you expect us to believe that you can believe whatever you want freeman responded we didnt offer it in discovery because i had no intention of bringing it up until your client started testifying about her nonviolent history this obviously puts a lie to that and has become fair game i turned my attention back to perry judge her excuse doesnt matter shes not playing by the rules of discovery the question should be stricken and she should not be allowed to pursue this line of questioning judge this is counsel is right ms freeman you can save it for rebuttal provided you come up with the witnesses but youre not going to bring it in here it should have been part of discovery we returned to our positions i would now have to put cisco on the incident because no doubt freeman would be bringing it up again later this annoyed me because one of the first assignments i had given cisco when we got the case was to completely vet our client this event had somehow been missed the judge instructed the jury to disregard the prosecutors question and then told freeman to proceed with a different line of questioning but i knew that bell had been rung loud and clear for the jury the question might have been wiped from the record but not from their minds freeman went on with her crossexamination potshotting trammel here and there but not penetrating the armor of her direct testimony my client could not be shaken from her contention that she was not walking near westland national on the morning of the murder with the exception of the threesided ruler it was a damn good start because it put the jury on immediate notice that we were engaged in an affirmative defense we would not be going down without a fight the prosecutor took it right on up to five oclock thus preserving the ability to come up with something overnight and hit trammel with it in the morning the judge recessed for the evening and everybody was sent home except for me i was heading back to the office there was still more to do before leaving the courtroom i huddled with my client at the defense table and whispered angrily to her thanks for telling me about the threesided ruler what else dont i know nothing that was stupid what was stupid that you hit a kid with a ruler or that you didnt tell me it was four years ago and he deserved it thats all im going to say about it its not going to be your choice freeman can still bring it up on rebuttal so you better start thinking about what youre going to say a look of concern creased her face how can she the judge told the jury to forget it was brought up she cant bring it up on cross but shell find a way to bring it up later there are different rules about rebuttal so youd better tell me all about it and anything else i should know but youve neglected to tell me she glanced over my shoulder and i knew she was looking for herb dahl she had no idea what dahl had revealed to me or about the doubleagent work he was doing dahl isnt here i said talk to me lisa what else should i know when i got back to the office i found cisco in the reception area hands in his pockets and chatting up lorna who was behind the front desk what going on i demanded i thought you were going to the airport to get shami i sent bullocks cisco said she got her and is on the way back she should have stayed here preparing for her testimony which will probably come tomorrow youre the investigator you shouldve gone to the airport both of them together probably cant carry the dummy relax boss they got it covered and theyre fine together bullocks just called from the road so you keep your cool and well do the rest i stared hard at him i didnt care if he was six inches taller and seventyfive more pounds of muscle id had it id been carrying everything and id had it you want me to relax you want me to be cool fuck you cisco we just started the defense and the problem is we dont have a defense i have a lot of talk and a dummy the problem is unless you get your hands out of your fucking pockets and find me something im the one who is going to look like the dummy so dont tell me to be cool okay im the one whos standing in front of the jury every fucking day first lorna burst out laughing and soon cisco followed you think this is funny i said in full outrage its not funny what the fuck makes it so fucking funny cisco held up his hands in a calming gesture until he could contain himself sorry boss its just that when you get yourself worked up and that thing about the dummy this made lorna start another cycle of laughter i made a mental note to fire her after the trial in fact id fire them both that would really be funny look cisco said apparently sensing i wasnt picking up on the humor of the situation go into your office take your tie off and sit down in the big chair ill go get my stuff and ill show you what ive got working ive been dealing with sacramento all day so the going is slow but im getting close sacramento the state crime lab no corporate records bureaucrats mickey thats why its taking forever but you dont have to worry you do your job and ill do mine kind of hard to do my job when im waiting on you to do yours i headed toward my office i threw a baleful look at lorna as i went by it only served to make her laugh again forty i was uninvited and unexpected but having not seen my daughter in a weekid had to cancel wednesday night pancakes because of the trialand leaving things last time on a rough note with maggie i felt compelled to drop by the home they shared in sherman oaks maggie opened the door with a frown apparently after seeing me through the peephole bad night for surprise visitors haller she said well ill just visit hayley for a bit if thats okay shes the one having the bad night she stepped back and to the side to allow me to enter really i said whats the problem shes got a ton of homework and she doesnt want to be bothered by anyone even me i looked from the entry area into the living room but didnt see my daughter shes in her room with the door closed good luck ill be cleaning up in the kitchen she left me there and i looked up the stairs hayleys bedroom was up there and all at once the climb looked forbidding my daughter was a teenager and subject to all the mood swings that come with that designation you never knew what you were going to get i made the journey anyway and my polite knock on her bedroom door was greeted with a what its dad can i come in dad i have a ton of homework so that means i cant come in whatever i opened the door and stepped in she was in the bed and under the covers she was surrounded by binders books and a laptop and you cant kiss me i have zit cream on i came to the side of the bed and leaned down i managed to kiss her on the top of the head before the arm came up to push me away how much more have you got i told you tons the math book was open and facedown so she wouldnt lose her place i picked it up to see what the lesson was dont lose my spot sheer panic endoftheworld angst in her voice dont worry ive been handling books going on forty years now as far as i could tell the lesson was about equations assigning values to x and y and i was completely lost they were teaching her things beyond my reach it was too bad it was stuff shed never use boy i couldnt help you even if i wanted to i know neither can mom im all alone in the world arent we all i realized that she hadnt looked up at me once since id been in the room it was depressing well i just wanted to say hi ill leave now bye i love you still no eye contact good night i closed the door behind me and went down to the kitchen the other female who seemed to be able to control my mood at her whim was sitting on a stool at the breakfast counter she had a glass of chardonnay in front of her and an open file she at least looked up at me she didnt smile but she made eye contact and i took that as a victory in this home her eyes then went back to the file what are you working on oh just refreshing i have a prelim tomorrow on a strong arm and i havent really looked at it since i filed it the usual grind of the justice system she didnt offer me a glass of wine because she knew i didnt drink i leaned against the counter opposite the breakfast bar so im thinking of running for district attorney i said her head shot up and she looked at me what nothing just trying to get somebodys attention around here sorry but its a busy night ive got to work yeah well ill go your pal andys probably burning the oil too i think so i was supposed to meet her for a drink after work but she canceled what did you do to her haller oh i clipped her wings a little bit at the end of her case then came out on mine like gangbusters shes probably trying to figure out how to counter probably she went back to her file i was clearly being wordlessly dismissed first my daughter now the exwife i still loved i did not want to go gentle into that good night so what about us i asked what do you mean you and me things didnt end so good the other night at dan tanas she closed the file slid it aside and looked up at me finally some nights are like that it doesnt change anything i pushed off the counter and came to the breakfast bar i leaned down on two elbows we were eye to eye so if nothings changed then what about us what are we doing she shrugged i want to try again i still love you mags you know that i also know that it didnt work before we are the kind of people who bring home what we do it wasnt good im beginning to think my client is innocent and that she was set up and that even with all of that i still might not be able to get her off how would you like to bring that home with you if it bothers you so much then maybe you should run for da the jobs open you know yeah maybe i just will haller for the people yeah i hung around for a few minutes after that but could tell i wasnt making any headway with maggie she had a skill for freezing you out and making you feel it i told her i was going and to tell hayley i said good night there was no rush to bar the door before i could exit but maggie did call one thing after me that made me feel good just give it time michael i turned back to her what are you talking about not what who hayley and me i nodded and said i would driving back to my place i let the accomplishments of the court day boost my spirits i started thinking about the next witness i planned to put on the stand after lisa the task ahead was still formidable but it didnt help to think that far in advance you start with a days momentum and go from there i took beverly glen up to the top then drove mulholland east toward laurel canyon i got glimpses of the city lights both to the north and the south los angeles spread out like a shimmering ocean i kept the music off and the windows down i let the chill air work like loneliness into my bones fortyone all that had been won the day before was lost in a span of twenty minutes friday morning when andrea freeman continued her crossexamination of lisa trammel being sandbagged by the prosecution in the midst of trial is certainly never a good thing but in many ways it is acceptable as part of the game its one of the unknown unknowns but being sandbagged by your own client is the worst thing that can happen one of the unknown unknowns should never be the person you are defending with trammel in place on the witness stand freeman went to the lectern carrying a thick document with crisp edges and one pink postit sticking out of the pages i thought it was a prop designed to distract me and paid it no mind she started things off with what i call setup questions these were designed to get a witnesss answers on the record before they were proven false i could see the trap forming but wasnt sure where the net was going to fall now you testified yesterday that you did not know mitchell bondurant is that correct yes correct you never met him never never spoke to him never but you tried to meet him and speak to him right yes i went to the bank twice to try to meet him to talk about my home but he wouldnt see me do you remember when you made those efforts they were last year but i dont remember the exact dates freeman then seemed to shift directions but i knew it was all part of a careful plan she asked trammel a series of seemingly innocuous questions about her flag organization and its purpose much of this had already been touched on during my direct examination i still couldnt see the play i glanced over at the document with the bright pink postit and started to believe it was no prop maggie had told me yesterday that freeman was working the night shift now i knew why she had obviously found something i leaned across the defense table in the direction of the witness stand as if being closer to the source would speed the arrival of understanding and you have a website that you use to support the efforts of flag dont you freeman asked yes trammel replied california foreclosure fighters dot com and you are also on facebook arent you yes i could tell by the timid cautious way in which my client said that one word that this was where the trap was set it was the first id heard of lisa on facebook for those on the jury who might not know what exactly is facebook ms trammel i leaned back in my chair and surreptitiously pulled my phone i quickly tapped out a text to bullocks telling her to drop whatever she was doing and see what she could find out about lisas facebook page see whats there i said well its a networking site and it lets me stay in touch with people involved in flag i post updates on what is happening i tell them where we are going to meet or march things like that people can set it up so they get automatic notifications on their phone or computer whenever i put a post on there it has been very useful in our organizing you can post on your facebook page right from your phone too correct yes i can and this digital location where you make these posts is called your wall correct yes and you have used your wall to do more than just send out messages about protest marches havent you sometimes you gave regular updates on your own foreclosure case as well didnt you yes i wanted it to be like a personal journal of a foreclosure did you also use facebook to alert the media to your activities yes that too so in order to receive this information someone would have to sign up as a friend correct yes thats how it works people who want to friend me make the request i accept them and then they have access to my wall how many friends do you have i didnt know where this was going but i knew it wasnt going to be good i stood and objected telling the judge that it appeared we were on a fishing expedition with no defined purpose or relevance freeman promised that relevance would become clear very soon and perry let her go on you can answer the question he said to trammel um i think well last time i checked i had over a thousand when did you first join facebook last year i think it was in july or august when i filed papers for flag and started the website i did it all at once so lets make this very clear as far as the website goes anybody with a computer and the internet has access correct right but your facebook page is a little more private and personal to gain access a person has to be accepted by you as a friend is that correct yes but i generally friend anybody who asks i dont know them all because there are too many i just assume theyve heard about our good work and are interested i dont turn anybody down thats how i got to a thousand in less than a year okay and you have been making regular posts on your wall since you joined facebook correct pretty regular yes in fact youve posted updates on this trial have you not yes just my opinion of things i could feel my temperature rising my suit was beginning to feel like it was made of plastic and was trapping my body heat inside i wanted to loosen my tie but knew if a juror saw such a move during this questioning it would send a disastrous signal now can anyone go on the page and post a message under your name no just me people can respond and make their own posts but not under my name how many posts would you say youve put on your wall since last summer i have no idea a lot freeman held up the thick document with the postit sticking out would you believe that you have posted more than twelve hundred times on your wall i dont know well i do i have every one of your posts printed right here your honor may i approach the witness with this document before the judge could respond i asked for a sidebar perry waved us up freeman brought the thick document with her your honor whats going on i said i have the same objection i did yesterday to the prosecutions deliberate avoidance of discovery there has been nothing about this previously and now she wants to introduce twelve hundred facebook posts come on judge this isnt right there has been nothing in discovery because this facebook account was unknown until last night judge if you believe that i have some property west of malibu id like to sell you judge yesterday afternoon my office came into possession of a printout of all posts made by the defendant to her facebook page i was pointed to a set of posts from last september that are relevant to this case and the defendants own testimony if i can be allowed to proceed this will become very obvious even to counsel came into possession i said whats that mean judge you have to be an invited friend to see my clients facebook wall if the government engaged in subter it was given to me by a member of the media who is friends with the defendant on facebook freeman interjected there was no subterfuge but its source should not be at issue here res ipsa loquiturthe document speaks for itself judge and i am sure the defendant can identify her own facebook posts for the jury counsel is simply engaged in trying to prevent the jurors from seeing what he knows is evidence of his clients judge i have no idea what shes even talking about the first i heard about a facebook page was during her cross counsels view of very well ms freeman perry interrupted give her the document but get to the point quickly thank you your honor as i sat back down i felt my phone vibrate in my pocket i pulled it and read the text under the table and out of the judges view it was from bullocks and she simply said she had access to lisas facebook wall and was working on my request i typed with one hand telling her to check the posts from september then pocketed the phone freeman gave trammel the printout and had her verify the most recent posts as coming from her facebook wall thank you ms trammel could you now go to the page i have marked with the postit lisa reluctantly did as instructed you will see that i have highlighted a series of three of your posts from last september seventh could you please read the first one to the jury including the time of the posting um one fortysix i am heading into westland to see bondurant this time im not taking no for an answer now you just pronounced the name bondurant but it is misspelled is it not in the post yes how is it spelled in your post bondurunt bondurunt i notice that the name is spelled that way on all posts in which he is mentioned was that intentional or a mistake he was taking away my house could you please answer the question yes it was intentional i called him bondurunt because he was not a good man i could feel the sweat moving through my hair the hidden lisa was about to come out could you please read the next highlighted post with the time two eighteen they wouldnt let me see him again so unfair and now please read the next post and time two twentyone found his spot im going to wait for him in the garage the quiet in the courtroom was as loud as a train ms trammel did you wait for mitchell bondurant in the parking garage at westland national on september seventh of last year yes but not that long i realized it was dumb and he wouldnt even be out until the end of the day so i left did you go back to that garage and wait for him on the morning of his murder no i didnt i wasnt there you saw him in the coffee shop you became enraged and knew just where he would be didnt you you went to the garage and waited for him and then objection i yelled you killed him with the hammer didnt you no no no trammel yelled i didnt do it she burst into tears loudly moaning like some kind of cornered animal your honor objection shes badgering the perry seemed to snap out of some reverie as he watched trammel sustained freeman stopped the courtroom was again silent except for the sound of my client sobbing the courtroom deputy came over with a box of tissues and lisas tears finally subsided thank you your honor freeman finally said i have no further questions i asked for an early morning break so my client could compose herself and id have time to decide whether to continue on redirect the judge granted the request probably because he felt sorry for me lisas tears did not undercut the fact that freeman had been masterful in setting her trap but all was not lost the best thing about a setup defense is that almost every piece of damning evidence or testimonyeven when it comes from your own clientcan become part of the setup after the jury was led out i walked up to the witness stand to console my client i pulled two tissues out of the box and handed them to her she took them and started dabbing her eyes i cupped my hand over the microphone to avoid broadcasting our conversation across the courtroom i tried my best to control my tone lisa why the hell am i finding out about facebook now do you have any idea what this could do to our case i thought you knew i friended jennifer my jennifer yes nothing like having both your junior associate and your client know more than you but what about these posts from september do you know how damaging they are im sorry i totally forgot about them they were so long ago it looked like another cascade of tears was coming i tried to head it off well were lucky we might be able to make this work for us she stopped dabbing at her face with the tissue and looked at me really maybe but i need to go outside and call bullocks whos bullocks sorry its what we call jennifer you sit tight and pull yourself together am i going to be asked more questions yes i want to do some redirect then can i go fix my face thats a good idea just dont take long i finally got out to the hallway and called bullocks at the office did you see the entries on september seventh i asked by way of a greeting just saw them if freeman she already did shit yeah well it was bad but there might be a way out lisa said youre her friend on facebook yes and im sorry i knew she had a page it never occurred to me to go back and look at previous posts on her wall well talk about it later right now i need to know if you have access to her list of friends im looking at it right now okay first i want you to print out all the names give them to lorna and have rojas drive her over here with them right away then i want you and cisco to start working the names yourselves find out who these people are theres more than a thousand you want us to run them all down if you have to im looking for a connection to opparizio opparizio why would trammel was a threat to him just like she was a threat to the bank she was protesting fraud in foreclosure the fraud was being committed by opparizios company we know through herb dahl that she was on opparizios radar it stands to reason that somebody in that company was checking on her through facebook lisa just testified that she accepted anybody who asked to friend her maybe well get lucky and find a name we know there was a silence and then bullocks tumbled to what i was thinking by tracking her on facebook they would know what she was up to and they could have known that at one time she waited for bondurant in the garage and then they could have constructed his murder around that record bullocks i hate to tell you this but youre thinking like a defense lawyer well get right on this i could hear the urgency in her voice good but first print that list and get it over to me i start redirect in about fifteen minutes tell lorna to walk it right in to me then if you and cisco find something text it to me right away you got it fortytwo freeman was still swelling with pride over her morning victory when i got back to the courtroom she sauntered over folded her arms and leaned her hip against the defense table haller tell me that was just an act you not knowing about the facebook page sorry i cant tell you that she rolled her eyes uhoh sounds like somebody needs a client who isnt hiding things or maybe a new investigator who can find them i ignored the taunt hoping she would stop gloating and go back to her table i started flipping through the pages of a legal pad pretending i was looking for something that was like manna from heaven last night when i got that printout and read those posts you mustve been very pleased with yourself which asshole reporter gave it to you wouldnt you like to know i will know whichever one breaks out the next exclusive from the das office will be the one who helped you out theyll never get so much as a no comment from me she chuckled my threat had nothing to do with her she had gotten the posts out before the jury and nothing else mattered i finally looked up at her and squinted you dont get it do you get what that the jury now knows your client was previously at the scene of the crimeproving that she had knowledge of where to find the victim no i completely get that i looked away and shook my head youll see excuse me i stood up and headed toward the witness stand lisa trammel had just returned from the restroom she had redrawn the makeup on her eyes when she started to speak i cupped the microphone again what were you doing talking to that bitch shes a horrible person she said a bit stunned by the unbridled anger i looked back at freeman now sitting at the prosecution table shes not horrible and shes not a bitch okay shes just doing yes she is you dont know i leaned close to her and whispered and what you do look lisa dont go bipolar on me youve got less than a half hour of testimony still to go lets just get through it without cluing the jury in to your issues okay i dont know what youre talking about but its very hurtful well im sorry about that im trying to defend you and it doesnt help me to have to find out about things like facebook when youre being crossexamined by the prosecution i told you im sorry but your associate knew yeah well i didnt look you said before that you might be able to make this work in our favor how simple if someone was going to set you up this facebook page would have been a damn good place to start talk about manna from heaven her eyes looked upward and pure relief colored her face as she came to understand the tactic i was about to employ the anger that had darkened her expression only a minute before was now completely gone it was just then that the judge entered the courtroom ready to go i nodded to my client and went back to the defense table as the judge instructed the deputy to bring in the jury once everyone was situated the judge asked if i wished to question my client on redirect examination i jumped up from my seat like i had been waiting ten years for the opportunity it cost me a jolt of pain moved like lightning across my torso the ribs may have mended but the wrong move still lit me up just as i walked to the lectern the rear door of the courtroom opened and lorna came in perfect timing carrying a file and a motorcycle helmet she walked swiftly down the center aisle to the gate your honor could i have a moment with my associate make it fast please i met lorna at the gate and she handed over the file thats the list of all her facebook friends but as of when i left dennis and jennifer hadnt found any connection to you know who it was strange hearing cisco and bullocks referred to by their real names i looked down at the helmet she carried i whispered you rode ciscos motorcycle over here you wanted it quick and i knew i could park up close wheres rojas i dont know he didnt answer his cell great listen i want you to leave ciscos bike where it is and walk back to the office i dont want you riding that suicide machine im not your wife anymore im his just as she whispered this i looked over her shoulder and saw maggie mcpherson sitting in the gallery i wondered if she was there for me or for freeman look i said thats got nothing to do with mr haller the judge intoned from behind me were waiting yes your honor i said loudly without turning around then in a whisper to lorna i said walk back i returned to the lectern opening the file it contained nothing more than raw dataa thousandplus names listed in two columns per pagebut i looked at it as if i had just been given the holy grail okay lisa lets talk about your facebook page you testified earlier that you have more than a thousand friends are all of these people personally known to you no not at all because so many people know about me through flag i just assume that when someone wants to friend me they are supportive of that cause i just accept them so then the posts on your wall are open to a significant number of people who are facebook friends but in reality complete strangers to you is that right yes thats correct i felt my phone vibrate in my pocket so any one of these strangers who was interested in your movements past or present could just go to your facebook page and see the posts on your wall am i right yes thats right for example someone could go to that page right now and scroll through your updates and see that back in september of last year you hung out in the garage at westland waiting for mitchell bondurant correct yes they could i pulled my phone out of my pocket and using the lectern as a blind brought it up and put it down on the work surface while leafing through the printout of names with one hand i used the other to open the text i had just received the message was from bullocks rd page right column th from bottomdon driscoll we have a donald driscoll as former aloft in it were working it bingo now i had something i could hit out of the park your honor i would like to show the witness this document it is a printout of the names of people who have friended lisa trammel on facebook freeman seeing her victorious morning in jeopardy objected but the judge overruled without argument from me saying freeman had opened this door herself i gave my client the list and returned to the lectern can you please go to the third page of the printout and read the name that is fifth up from the bottom in the rightside column freeman objected again stating that the list was unverified the judge advised her to challenge it on recross if she thought i was introducing a bogus exhibit i told lisa she could read the name don driscoll thank you now is that name familiar to you not really no but he is one of your facebook friends i know but like i said i dont know everybody who friends me there are too many well do you recall if don driscoll ever contacted you directly and identified himself as working for a company called aloft freeman objected and asked for a sidebar we were called to the bench judge whats going on here counsel cant just throw names around i want an offer of proof that he isnt just throwing darts at the list and picking out a name perry nodded thoughtfully i agree mr haller my phone was still on the lectern if i had gotten any updates from bullocks they werent going to help me now judge we could go into chambers and get my investigator on the phone if you wish but i would ask the court for some leeway here the prosecution opened up this facebook issue just this morning and i am trying to respond we can hold things up for an offer of proof or we can wait until the defense calls don driscoll to the stand and ms freeman can have at him and see if i am mischaracterizing who he is you are going to call him i dont think i have any choice in light of the states decision to pursue my clients old facebook posts very well well wait for mr driscoll to testify dont disappoint me mr haller and come into court and say you changed your mind i wont be happy if that happens yes your honor we returned to our places and i asked lisa the question again did don driscoll ever contact you on facebook or anywhere else and say he worked for aloft no he didnt are you familiar with aloft yes that is the name of the foreclosure mill that banks like westland use to file all the paperwork on their foreclosures was this company involved in the foreclosure of your home yes totally is aloft an acronym do you know what it stands for a louis opparizio financial technologies thats the name of the company now what would it mean to you if this person donald driscoll who was one of your friends on facebook was employed by aloft it would mean that somebody from aloft was getting all my posts so essentially this person driscoll would know where youve been and where youre going correct thats correct he would have been privy to your posts from last september that said you had found mr bondurants parking spot at the bank and that you were going to wait for him correct yes correct thank you lisa i have nothing further on my way back to my seat i had to steal a glance at freeman she was no longer beaming she was staring straight ahead i then looked out into the gallery for maggie but she was gone fortythree the afternoon belonged to shamiram arslanian my forensics expert from new york i had used shami to great effect in previous trials and that was again the plan here she had degrees from harvard mit and john jay was currently a research fellow at the latter and had a winning and telegenic personality on top of that she had an integrity that shone through on the witness stand with every word of testimony she was a defense lawyers dream no doubt she was a gun for hire but she took the job only if she believed in the science and in what she was going to say on the stand whats more there was a bonus for me in this case she was the exact same height as my client during the lunch break arslanian had set up a mannequin in front of the jury box it was a male figure standing exactly six foot two and a half inches tall the same height as mitchell bondurant in his shoes it wore a suit similar to the one bondurant was wearing on the morning of his murder and the exact same shoes the mannequin had joints that allowed for a full range of natural human motion after court resumed and my witness took the stand i took my time going through her voluminous bona fides i wanted the jurors to understand this womans accomplishments and to like her offhand manner of answering questions i also wanted them to realize that her skills and knowledge put her on a different plane than the states forensic witnesses a higher plane once the impression had been made i got down to the business of the mannequin now dr arslanian i asked you to review aspects of the murder of mitchell bondurant is that true yes you did and in particular i wanted to examine the physics of the crime true yes you basically asked me to find out if your client couldve actually done the crime in the way the police said she did and did you conclude that she could have well yes and no i determined that yes she could have done it but it wouldnt have been in the manner the detectives out here were saying can you explain your conclusion i would rather demonstrate using myself in the place of your client how tall are you dr arslanian im five foot three in my stocking feet same height that i was told lisa trammel is and did i send you a hammer that was a duplicate of the hammer recovered by police and declared to be the murder weapon yes you did and i brought it with me she held the duplicate hammer up from the shelf at the front of the witness box and did you get photos from me depicting the gardening shoes that were seized from the defendants unlocked garage and later found to have the victims blood on them yes you did that too and i was able to procure an exact duplicate pair on the internet im wearing them now she kicked one leg out from the side of the witness box showing off the waterproof shoe there was a polite round of laughter in the courtroom i asked the judge to allow my witness to conduct the demonstration of her findings and he agreed over objection from the prosecution arslanian left the witness box with the hammer and proceeded with her demonstration the question i was asking myself was could a woman the defendants height which is five foot three like mine have struck the fatal blow on the crown of the head of a man who is six foot two and a half in his work shoes now the hammer which adds about an extra ten inches in reach is helpful in this regard but is it enough that was my question doctor if i can interrupt can you tell us about your mannequin and how you prepared it for your testimony of course everybody this is manny and i use him all the time when i testify in trials and when i conduct tests in my lab back at john jay he has all the joints like a real human being and he comes apart if i need him to and the best thing is he never talks back or says i look fat in my jeans again she scored some polite laughter thank you doctor i said quickly before the judge could tell her to keep it serious if you could go on with your demonstration sure well what i did was use the autopsy report and the photos and drawings to exactly locate the spot on the skull of the mannequin where the fatal blow was struck now we know because of the notch in the striking face that mr bondurant was struck from behind we also know by the even depth of the depression fracture to the skull that he was struck evenly on the top of the head so by attaching the hammer at a flush angle like so climbing onto a short stepladder next to manny she was able to place the strike face of the hammer against the crown of the skull and then hold it in place with two bands that went under the faceless mannequins chin she then stepped down and gestured to the hammer and its handle which was extending at a right angle and parallel to the floor so as you can see this doesnt work im five four in these shoes the defendant is five four in these shoes and the handle is way up here she reached up to the hammer it was impossible for her to grasp it properly what this tells us is that the fatal blow could not have been struck by the defendant with the victim in this positionstanding up straight head level now what other positions are available that do work with what we know we know the attack was from behind so if the victim was leaning forwardsay he dropped his keys or somethingyou see that it still doesnt work because i cant reach the hammer over his back as she spoke she manipulated the mannequin bending it over at the waist and then reaching toward the hammers handle from the rear no doesnt work now for two days between classes i looked for other ways to strike the blow but the only way i could make it work was if the victim was on his knees or crouched down for some reason or if he happened to be looking up at the ceiling she manipulated the mannequin again and stood it up straight she then bent the head back at the neck and the handle came down she grasped it and the position looked comfortable but the mannequin was looking almost straight up now according to the autopsy there were significant abrasions on both knees and one even had a cracked patella these were described as impact injuries coming from mr bondurants fall to the ground after he was struck he dropped to his knees first and then fell forward facefirst what we call a dead fall so with that kind of injury to the knees i rule out that he was kneeling or crouched close to the ground that leaves only this she gestured toward the mannequins head angled sharply back with the faceplate up i checked the jury everybody was watching intently it was like showandtell in first grade okay doctor if you put the angle of the head back to even or just slightly elevated did you come up with a range of heights for the real perpetrator of this crime freeman jumped up and objected in a tone of complete exasperation your honor this isnt science this is junk science the whole thing is smoke and mirrors and now hes asking her to give the height of someone who could have done it it is impossible to know exactly what posture or neck angle the victim of this horrible your honor closing arguments are not till next week i interjected if the state has an objection then counsel should state it to the court instead of speaking to the jury and trying to sell all right the judge said both of you stop it mr haller youve been given wide latitude with this witness but i was beginning to agree with ms freeman until she got on her soapbox objection sustained thank you your honor freeman said as though she had just been rescued from abandonment in a desert i composed myself looked at my witness and her mannequin then checked my notes and finally nodded id gotten what i could i have no further questions i said freeman did have questions but try as she might to shake shami arslanian from her direct testimony and conclusions the veteran prosecutor never got the veteran witness to concede an inch freeman worked her on cross for nearly forty minutes but the closest she got to scoring a point for the prosecution was to get arslanian to acknowledge that there was no way of knowing for sure what happened in the garage when bondurant was murdered the judge had announced earlier in the week that friday would be a short day because of a districtwide judges meeting planned for late in the afternoon so there was no afternoon break and we worked until almost four before perry recessed the trial for the weekend we moved into the twoday break with me feeling like i had the upper hand we had weathered the states case by potshotting much of the evidence then closed out the week with lisa trammels denial and claim to be the victim of a setup and my forensic witnesss supposition that it was physically impossible for the defendant to commit the crime unless of course she happened to strike the fatal blow to the victim while he was looking straight up at the ceiling of the parking garage i believed these were powerful seeds of doubt things felt good to me and when i finished packing my briefcase i lingered at the defense table looking through a file for something that wasnt really there i was half expecting freeman to come over and beg me to sell my client a plea bargain but it didnt happen when i looked up from my phony busywork she was gone i took the elevator down to two the judges might all be getting off early for a meeting on the eroding rules of courtroom decorum but i figured the das office was still working until five i asked at the counter for maggie mcpherson and was allowed back she shared an office with another deputy da but luckily he was on vacation we were alone i pulled the missing mans chair away from his desk and sat down in front of maggie i came by court a couple times today she said watched some of your direct with the lady from john jay shes a good witness yeah shes good and i saw you there i didnt know who you were there forme or freeman she smiled maybe i was there for myself i still learn things from you haller now i smiled maggie mcfierce learning from me really well no dont answer that we both laughed either way im glad you came by i said whats going on this weekend with you and hay i dont know well be around you have to work i guess i nodded we have to track somebody down i think and monday and tuesday are going to be the biggest days of the trial but maybe we can do a movie or something sure we were silent for a few moments i had just come off one of my best days in court ever yet i felt pierced by a growing sense of loss and sadness i looked at my exwife were never going to get back together are we maggie what it just kind of hit me you want it the way it is now there when one of us really needs it but never what it was you wont ever give me that why do you want to talk about this now michael youre in the middle of a trial you have im in the middle of my life mags i just wish there was a way to make you and hayley proud of me she leaned forward and reached out she put her hand against my cheek for a moment and then pulled it back i think hayley is proud of you yeah what about you she smiled but it was sort of in a sad way i think you should go home and not think about this or the trial or anything else just for tonight let your mind clear of the clutter relax i shook my head cant i have a meeting at five with a snitch on the trammel case what snitch never mind and youre just trying to change the subject youll never completely forgive and forget will you its not in you and maybe its what makes you such a good prosecutor oh im so good all right thats why im stuck out here in van nuys filing armed robberies thats politics has nothing to do with skills and dedication it doesnt matter and i cant have this conversation now im still on the clock and you need to go see your snitch why dont you call me tomorrow if you want to take hayley to a movie ill probably let you take her while i run errands or something i stood up i knew a losing cause when i saw one okay im leaving ill call you tomorrow but i hope youll come with us to the movie well see right i took the stairs down for a quick exit i crossed the plaza and headed north on sylmar toward victory i soon came to a motorcycle parked at the curb i recognized it as ciscos a prized hd panhead with a black pearl tank and matching fenders i chuckled lorna my second exwife had actually done what i had told her to do it was a first she had left the bike unlocked probably figuring it was safe in front of the courthouse and adjoining police station i steered it away from the curb and walked it down sylmar i mustve been quite a sight a man in his nicest corneliani suit pushing a harley down the street briefcase propped on the handlebars when i finally got back to the office it was only four thirty a half hour before herb dahl was scheduled to come in for a briefing i called for a staff meeting and tried plugging back into the case as a means of pushing out thoughts about the conversation with maggie i told cisco where i had parked his bike and i asked for an update on the list of our clients facebook friends first of all why the hell didnt i know about her facebook account i asked its my fault aronson said quickly like i told you earlier i knew about it and even accepted her friend request i just didnt realize the significance of it i missed it too cisco said she friended me too i looked and didnt see anything i shouldve looked harder me too lorna added i looked at their faces it was a unified front great i said i guess all four of us missed it and our client didnt bother to tell us so the bunch of us i guess were all fired i paused for effect now what about this name you came up with this don driscoll where did that come from and do we know anything more freeman couldve unwittingly dropped the key to the whole case in our laps this morning people whatve we got bullocks looked at cisco deferring as you know he said aloft was sold in february to the lemure fund with opparizio still in place to run it because lemure is a publicly traded company everything about the deal was monitored by the federal trade commission and made public to shareholders including a list of employees that would remain at aloft following the transition i have the list dated december fifteenth so we started crossreferencing the aloft employees to the list of lisas facebook friends bullocks said luckily donald driscoll was early in the alphabet we came up with him pretty quickly i nodded impressed so who is driscoll in the ftc docs his name was in a group listed under information technology cisco said so what the hell i called it at aloft and asked for him i was told that donald driscoll used to work there but his employment contract expired on february first and it wasnt extended hes gone youve started the trace i asked we have but its a common name and thats slowing us down as soon as we have something youll be the first to know running names from the private sector always took time it wasnt as easy as being a cop and simply typing a name into one of the many law enforcement databases dont let up i said this could be the whole game right here dont worry boss cisco said nobodys letting up fortyfour donald driscoll thirtyone formerly employed by aloft lived in the belmont shore area of long beach on sunday morning i rode down with cisco to tag driscoll with a subpoena the hope being that he would talk to me before i had to put him on the witness stand blind rojas agreed to work on his day off to help make up for his misdeeds he drove the lincoln and we sat in the back cisco updating me on his conclusions regarding his latest investigations of the bondurant murder there was no doubt that the defense case was coming together and driscoll just might be the witness who could cap it all off you know i said we could actually win this thing if driscoll cooperates and says what i think hes going to say thats a big if cisco replied and look we have to be prepared for anything with this guy for all we know he could be the guy do you know how tall he is six four has it on his drivers license i looked over at him which i wasnt supposed to see but happened to get access to he said dont tell me about any crimes cisco im just saying i saw the info on his license thats all fine leave it at that so what do you suggest we do when we get down there i thought we were just going to knock on the door we are but you still have to be careful ill be standing behind you yeah youre a true friend i am and by the way if i put you on the stand tomorrow youre going to have to come up with a shirt that has sleeves and a collar make yourself presentable man i dont know how lorna puts up with your shit so far shes put up with it longer than she ever put up with yours yeah i guess thats true i turned and looked out the window i had two exwives who were probably also my two best friends but it didnt go past that id had them but couldnt hold them what did that say about me i lived in a daydream that one day maggie my daughter and i would live together again as a family the reality was it was never going to happen you all right boss i turned back to cisco yeah why i dont know youre looking a little shaky there why dont you let me go knock on the door and if hell talk ill give you a bump on the cell and you come in no we do it together youre the boss yeah im the boss but i felt like the loser i decided right at that moment that i was going to change things and find a way to redeem myself right after the trial belmont shore had the feel of a rustic beach town even though it was part of long beach driscolls residence was a twostory sstyle apartment building of aqua blue and white off bayshore near the pier driscolls place was on the second floor where an exterior walkway ran along the front of the building apartment was halfway down cisco knocked and then took a position to the side of the door leaving me standing there are you kidding i asked he just looked at me he wasnt i took a step to the side we waited but nobody answered even though it was before ten on a sunday morning cisco looked at me and raised his eyes as if to ask what do you want to do i didnt answer i turned to the railing and looked down at the parking lot in front i saw some empty spaces and they were numbered i pointed lets find twentyfour and see if his car is here you go cisco said ill check around up here what i didnt see anything to check around for we were on a fivefootwide walkway that ran in front of every secondfloor apartment no furniture no bikes just concrete just go check the parking lot i headed back downstairs after ducking to look under the front of three cars to get the number painted on the curb i realized that the parking slot numbers did not correspond to the apartment numbers it was a twelveunit building apartments through on the bottom and through up top but the parking lot spaces were numbered through i took a guess that under that number scheme driscoll had number if each apartment got one space which stood to reason since there were only sixteen spots and i saw that two were labeled as guest parking and two were marked for handicapped parking i was in the middle of turning these numbers in my head and looking at the tenyearold bmw parked in slot when cisco called my name from the walkway above i looked and he waved me up when i got back up there he was standing in the open door of apartment he waved me in he was asleep but he finally answered i walked in and saw a disheveled man sitting on a couch in a sparsely furnished living room his hair was sticking up in frozen curls and knots on the right side he huddled with a blanket around his shoulders even so i could tell he matched a photo cisco had pulled off donald driscolls own facebook account thats a lie he said i didnt invite him in he broke in no you invited me cisco said i have a witness he pointed to me the blearyeyed man followed the finger and looked at me for the first time i could see recognition in his eyes i knew then that it was driscoll and that we were on to something here hey look i dont know what this are you donald driscoll i asked im not telling you shit man you cant just break hey cisco yelled loudly the man jumped in his seat even i startled not having expected ciscos new interviewing tactic just answer the question cisco continued in a calmer voice are you donald driscoll who wants to know you know who wants to know i said you recognized me the moment you looked at me and you know why were here donald dont you i walked across the room pulling the subpoena out of my windbreaker driscoll was tall but slightly built and vampire white which was strange for a guy living a block from the beach i dropped the folded document in his lap what is this he said slapping it onto the floor without even unfolding it its a subpoena and you can throw it on the floor and choose not to read it but that doesnt matter youve been served donald i have a witness and i am an officer of the court you dont show up tomorrow at nine to testify and youll be in jail on a charge of contempt by lunchtime driscoll reached down and grabbed the subpoena are you fucking kidding me youre going to get me killed i glanced over at cisco we were definitely on to something what are you talking about im talking about that i cant testify if i come anywhere near that courthouse theyll kill me theyre probably watching this place right fucking now i looked again at cisco and then back down at the man on the couch who is going to kill you donald im not saying who the fuck do you think he threw the subpoena at me and it bounced off my chest and fluttered to the ground he jumped from the couch and started to break for the open door the blanket fell and i saw he was wearing only gym shorts and a tshirt before he made it three strides cisco hit him with his body like an outside linebacker driscoll caromed into the wall and fell to the floor a framed poster of a girl on a surfboard slid down the wall and the frame broke on the floor next to him cisco calmly bent down pulled driscoll up and walked him right back to the couch i stepped over to the door and closed it just in case the wall banging brought out a curious neighbor i then came back to the living room you cant run from this donald i said you tell us what you know and what you did and we can help you help me get killed you assholes and i think you fucking broke my shoulder he started working his arm and shoulder like he was warming up to pitch nine innings he grimaced hows it feel i said i told you it feels broken i felt something give you wouldnt be able to move it cisco said ciscos voice had a threatening tone to it as if there would be further consequences if the shoulder actually was broken when i spoke my voice was calm and welcoming what do you know donald what would make you a danger to opparizio i dont know anything and i didnt say that nameyou did you have to understand something you have been served with a valid subpoena you show up and you testify or you stay in jail until you do but think about this donald if you testify about what you know about aloft and what you did then youre protected nobody will make a move against you because it would be obvious where it came from its your only move here he shook his head yeah obvious if they did it now what about in ten years when nobody remembers your stupidass trial and they can still hide behind all the money in the world i didnt really have an answer to that one look ive got a client on trial for what amounts to her life shes got a little boy and theyre trying to take everything away from her im not going to fuck off man she probably did it were talking about two different things here i cant help her i have no evidence ive got nothing just leave me the hell alone would you what about my life i want to have a life too i looked at him and sadly shook my head i cant leave you alone im putting you on the stand tomorrow you can refuse to answer questions you can even take the fifth if youve committed crimes but youll be there and theyll be there theyll know theyve got a continuing problem with you your best bet is to spill it all donald put it out there and be protected five years ten years theyll never be able to do a damn thing to you because there will be a record driscoll was staring at an ashtray full of coins on the coffee table but he was seeing something else maybe i should get an attorney he said i gave cisco a look this was exactly what i didnt want to have happen a witness with his own attorney was never a good thing sure fine if youve got a lawyer bring him but a lawyer is not going to stop the forward progress of this trial that subpoena is bulletproof donald a lawyer will charge you a grand to try to knock it down but it wont work it will only make the judge mad at you for making him take time out of the trial my phone started to buzz in my pocket it was early enough on a sunday to be unusual i pulled it out to check the display maggie mcpherson think about what i said donald i have to take this but ill be quick as i answered i walked into the kitchen maggie everything all right sure why not i dont know its kind of early for a sunday is hayley still asleep sunday was always my daughters catchup day she could easily sleep past noon if not roused of course im just calling because we didnt hear from you yesterday so i guess that makes today movie day uh i vaguely remembered promising a movie outing when i had been in maggies office friday afternoon youre busy the tone had entered her voice the judgmental youarefullofshit tone i am at the moment im down in long beach talking to a wit so no movie is that what i should tell her i could hear both ciscos and driscolls voices from the living room but was too distracted to hear what was said no maggie dont tell her that im just not sure when im going to be out of here let me finish here and ill call you back before she even wakes up okay fine well wait on you before i could respond she disconnected i put the phone away and then looked around it appeared that the kitchen was the least used room in the apartment i went back to the living room driscoll was still on the couch and cisco was still standing close enough to prevent another escape attempt donald was just telling me how he wanted to testify cisco said is that right how come you changed your mind donald i moved past cisco so that i stood right in front of driscoll he looked up at me and shrugged then nodded in ciscos direction he said youve never lost a witness and that if it comes down to it he knows people who can handle their people without breaking a sweat i kind of believe him i nodded and momentarily had a vision from the dark room at the saints clubhouse i quickly shut it out yeah well hes right i said so you are saying you want to cooperate yeah ill tell you everything i know good then why dont we start right now fortyfive at the start of the trial andrea freeman had successfully kept my associate jennifer aronson off the defense table as my second chair by challenging her listing as a defense witness as well on monday morning when it was time for aronson to testify the prosecutor sought to prevent her testimony challenging it as irrelevant to the charges i couldnt prevent the first challenge from succeeding but felt i had the legal gods on my side for the second i also had a judge who still owed me after toeing the prosecutions line on two critical decisions earlier in the trial your honor i said this cant really be a sincere objection by counsel the state has set before the jury a motive for the defendants supposedly having committed this crime the victim was engaged in taking her house away she was angry and frustrated and she killed thats their case in its entirety so now to object to a witness who will provide the details of that inciting action the foreclosure on grounds of relevance is specious at best and at worst pure hypocrisy the judge wasted no time in his response and ruling objection to the witness is overruled we will now bring in the jury once the jury was in place and aronson was in the witnesss seat i proceeded with my direct examination starting with a clarification of why she was the defense expert on the foreclosure of lisa trammels home now ms aronson you were not counsel of record on the trammel foreclosure were you no i was associate counsel to you i nodded as such you really did all the work while my name was on the pleadings correct yes correct most of the documents in the foreclosure file were prepared by me i was intimately involved in the case such is the life of a firstyear associate correct i guess so we shared a smile from there i walked her step by step through the foreclosure proceedings i dont ever say you have to talk down to a jury but you do have to talk in ways that are universally understandable from stockbrokers to soccer moms there are twelve minds on the jury and theyve all been marinated in different life experiences you have to tell them all the same story and you only get one chance thats the trick twelve minds one story its got to be a story that speaks to each of them once i established the financial and legal issues my client was facing i moved on to how the game was played by westland and its representative aloft so when you were given the file on this matter what was the first thing you did well you had told me to make a practice of checking all the dates and details you said to make sure with every case that the petitioner actually has standing meaning that we needed to make sure that the institution making the claim of foreclosure actually had standing to make such a claim but wouldnt that have been obvious in this case since the trammels had been making mortgage payments to westland for almost four years before their financial difficulties changed things not necessarily because what we were finding was that the mortgage business exploded in the middle of the decade so many mortgages were made and then repackaged and resold that in many instances the conveyances were never completed it didnt really matter in this case who the trammels made their mortgage payments to what mattered was what entity legitimately held the mortgage okay so what did you find when you checked dates and details on the trammel foreclosure freeman objected again on relevance and she was again overruled i didnt need to ask aronson the question again when i reviewed the dates and details i found discrepancies and indications of fraud can you describe these indications yes there was irrefutable evidence that conveyance documents were forged giving westland false standing to seek the foreclosure do you have those documents ms aronson yes i do and we are able to display them in our powerpoint presentation please do aronson opened a laptop on the shelf in front of her and started the program the document in question appeared on the overhead screens and i sought further explanation from aronson what are we looking at here ms aronson if i could explain six years ago lisa and jeff trammel bought their house obtaining a mortgage through a broker called citypro home loans citypro then grouped their mortgage in a portfolio with fiftynine other mortgages of similar value the entire portfolio was bought by westland it was up to westland at that point to make sure the mortgage for each of those properties was properly conveyed through legal documentation to the bank but that never happened the assignment of mortgage in the case of the trammel home was not done how do you know that isnt this the conveyance right here in front of us i stepped out from behind the lectern and gestured toward the overhead screens aronson continued this document purports to be the assignment of mortgage but if you go to the last page she hit the down arrow button on her computer and flipped through the document to the final page it was the signing page with the signatures of an officer of the bank and a notary as well as the notarys required state seal two things here aronson said according to the notarization you see that the document was purportedly signed on march sixth two thousand seven this would have been shortly after westland bought the mortgage portfolio from citypro the signing officer listed here is michelle monet we have so far been unable to find a michelle monet who is or was an employee of westland national in any capacity at any bank branch or location the second issue is if you look at the notary seal the expiration date is clearly seen here as two thousand fourteen she stopped there just as we had rehearsed as if the fraud involving the notary seal was obvious to all i held a long moment as if waiting for more okay whats wrong with the expiration being two thousand fourteen in the state of california notary licenses are awarded for five years this would mean that this notarys seal was issued in two thousand nine yet the date being notarized on this document is march sixth two thousand seven this notary seal had not been issued in two thousand seven this means that this document was created to falsely convey the mortgage note on the trammel property to westland national i stepped back to the lectern to check my notes and let aronsons testimony float in front of the jury a little longer i stole a quick glance at the box and noticed several of the jurors were still staring up at the screens this was good so what did this tell you when you discovered this fraud that we could challenge westlands right to foreclose on the trammel property westland was not the legitimate holder of the mortgage it still remained with citypro did you inform lisa trammel of this discovery on december seventeenth of last year we had a client meeting which was attended by lisa you and myself she was informed then that we had clear and convincing evidence of fraud in the foreclosure filing we also told her that we would use the evidence as leverage to negotiate a positive outcome to her situation how did she react to this freeman objected saying i was asking a question requiring a hearsay answer i argued that i was allowed to establish the defendants state of mind at the time of the murder the judge agreed and aronson was allowed to answer she was very happy and positive she said it was an early christmas present knowing that she wasnt going to lose her house anytime soon thank you now did there come a time when you wrote a letter to westland national for my signature yes i wrote a letter for your signature that outlined these findings of fraud it was addressed to mitchell bondurant and what was the purpose of this letter this was part of the negotiation we told lisa trammel about the idea was to inform mr bondurant of what aloft was doing in the banks name we believed that if mr bondurant was concerned about the banks exposure on this it would help facilitate a negotiation beneficial to our client when you wrote that letter for my signature did you know or intend that mr bondurant would forward it to louis opparizio at aloft no i did not thank you ms aronson i have no further questions the judge called for the morning break and aronson took the defendants seat when lisa and herb dahl left to stretch their legs in the hallway finally i get to sit here she said dont worry after today youre there you did great bullocks now comes the hard part i glanced over at freeman who was staying at the prosecution table during the break finishing her plan for the crossexamination just remember you are entitled to take your time when she asks the tough ones you just take a breath compose yourself and then answer if you know the answer she looked at me as if questioning whether i really meant it you mean tell the truth i nodded youll do fine after the break freeman went to the lectern and spread open a file containing notes and her written questions it was just a show for the most part she did what she could but it is always a challenge to crossexamine an attorney even a new one for nearly an hour she tried to shake aronson on her direct testimony but to no avail eventually she went in a different direction using sarcasm whenever possible a sure sign that she was frustrated so after that wonderful happy client conference you had before christmas when was the next time you saw your client aronson had to think for a long moment before answering it would have been after she was arrested well what about phone calls after the client conference when was the next time you talked to her on the phone i am pretty sure she spoke to mr haller a number of times but i did not speak to her again until after her arrest so during the time between the meeting and the murder you would have no idea what sort of state of mind your client was in as instructed my young associate took her time before answering if there had been a change in her view of the case and how it was going i think i would have been informed of it by her directly or through mr haller but nothing like that occurred im sorry but i didnt ask what you think i asked what you directly know are you telling this jury that based on your meeting in december you know what your clients state of mind was a whole month later no im not so you cant sit there and tell us what lisa trammels state of mind was on the morning of the murder can you i can tell you only what i know from our meeting and can you tell us what she was thinking when she saw mitchell bondurant the man who was trying to take away her home that morning at the coffee shop no i cant freeman looked down at her notes and seemed to hesitate i knew why she had a tough decision to make she knew she had just scored some solid points with the jury and now had to decide whether to try to scrape up a few more or let it end on the high note she finally decided shed gotten enough and folded her file i have nothing further your honor cisco was scheduled to come up next but the judge broke for an early lunch i took my team over to jerrys famous deli in studio city lorna was waiting there in a booth near the door that led to the bowling alley behind the restaurant i sat next to jennifer and across from lorna and cisco so how did it go this morning lorna asked good i think i answered freeman scored some points on cross but i think overall we came out ahead jennifer did very well i dont know if anybody had noticed but i had decided i would no longer be calling her bullocks in my estimation she had outgrown the nickname with her performance on the witness stand she was no longer the young lawyer from the departmentstore school she had made her bones on this case with her work in and out of the courtroom and now she gets to sit at the big table i added lorna cheered and clapped and now its ciscos turn aronson said clearly uncomfortable with the attention maybe not i said i think i need to go to driscoll next how come aronson said because this morning in chambers i informed the court and the prosecution of his existence and his addition to my wit list freeman objected but she was the one who brought up facebook so the judge called driscoll fair game so now im thinking that the faster i get to him the less time freeman will have to prepare if i stick with the plan and put cisco on freeman can work him all afternoon while her investigators are running down driscoll only lorna nodded at my reasoning but that was good enough for me shit and i got all dressed up cisco exclaimed it was true my investigator was wearing a longsleeved collared shirt that looked like it would burst at the seams if he flexed his muscles i had seen it before though it was his testifying shirt i ignored his complaint speaking of driscoll whats his status cisco my guys picked him up this morning and brought him up last i heard he was shooting pool at the club i stared at my investigator theyre not giving him alcohol right course not thats all i need a drunk witness on the stand dont worry i told them no alcohol well call your guys have them deliver driscoll to the courthouse by one hes next it was too loud in the restaurant for a phone call cisco slipped out of the booth and headed toward the door while pulling his cell we watched him go you know he looks good in a real shirt like that aronson said really lorna responded i dont like the sleeves fortysix i almost didnt recognize donald driscoll with his hair combed and a suit on cisco had placed him in a witness room down the hall from the courtroom when i stepped in he looked up at me from the table with scared eyes how was the saints club i asked i wouldve rather been somewhere else he said i nodded in false sympathy are you ready for this no but im here okay in a few minutes cisco will come get you and bring you to the courtroom whatever look i know it doesnt seem like it now but youre doing the right thing youre right about it not seeming like it now i didnt know what to say to that all right ill see you in there i left the room and signaled to cisco who was standing in the hallway with the two men who had been minding driscoll i pointed down the hall toward the courtroom and cisco nodded i proceeded on and entered the courtroom to find jennifer aronson and lisa trammel at the defense table i sat down but before i could say anything to either one of them the judge entered the courtroom and took the bench he called for the jury and we quickly went back on the record i called donald driscoll to the stand after he was sworn in i got right down to business mr driscoll what is your profession im in it and what does it mean information technology it means i work with computers the internet i find the best way to use new technologies to gather information for the client or employer or whoever it may be you are a former employee of aloft correct yes i worked there for ten months until earlier this year in it yes what exactly did you do in it for aloft i had several duties its a very computerreliant business a lot of employees and a great need for access to information through the internet and you helped them get it yes now do you know the defendant lisa trammel ive never met her i know of her you know of her from this case yeah but also from before from before how so one of my duties at aloft was to try to keep tabs on lisa trammel why i dont know why i was just told to do it and i did it who told you to keep tabs on lisa trammel mr borden my supervisor did he tell you to keep tabs on anybody else yes a bunch of other people how many is a bunch i guess there were about ten who were they other mortgage protestors like trammel plus employees of some of the banks we did business with like who the man who was killed mr bondurant i checked my notes for a while and let that percolate with the jury now by keeping tabs what did that mean i was to look for whatever i could find on these people online did mr borden ever tell you why you had this assignment i asked him once and he said because mr opparizio wants the information is that louis opparizio founder and president of aloft yes now were there any specific instructions from mr borden in regard to lisa trammel no it was just sort of see what you can find out there and when did this become your assignment it was last year i started working at aloft in april and so it would have been a few months after that could it have been july or august yeah right about then did you give the information you got to mr borden yes i did did there come a time that you became aware that lisa trammel was on facebook yes it was sort of an obvious thing to check did you become her friend on facebook yes and this put you in a position to monitor her posts about the flag organization and the foreclosure of her home correct yes did you tell your supervisor about this specifically i told him that she was on facebook and was fairly active and that it was a good spot for monitoring what she was doing and planning for flag how did he respond he told me to monitor it and then summarize everything once a week in an email so thats what i did and did you use your own name when you sent lisa trammel your friend request yes i was already on facebook as you know myself so i didnt hide it i mean i doubted she knew who i was anyway what sort of reports did you give mr borden you know like if her group was planning a protest somewhere i would tell them the date and time that sort of stuff you just said them were you giving these reports to someone other than mr borden no but i knew he was forwarding them to mr opparizio because mr o would send me emails every now and then about the stuff i sent mr borden so i knew he was seeing the reports in all of this did you do anything illegal while snooping around for borden and opparizio no sir now did one of your weekly summaries of lisa trammels activities ever include reference to her posts about being in the garage at westland national and waiting to talk to mitchell bondurant yes there was one westland was one of the companys biggest clients and i thought maybe mr bondurant should know if he didnt already that this woman had waited for him out there so you gave mr borden the details of how lisa trammel had found mr bondurants parking spot and waited for him yes and he said thanks yes and this was all in emails yes did you keep a copy of the email you sent mr borden yes i did why did you do that its just kind of a general practice of mine to keep copies especially when dealing with important people did you happen to bring a copy of that email with you today i did freeman objected and asked for a sidebar at the bench she successfully argued that there was no way of legitimizing what purported to be a printout of an old email the judge wouldnt let me introduce it saying i would have to stick with driscolls recollections returning to the lectern i decided i had made it clear to the jury that borden knew trammel had previously been in the garage and that borden was a conduit to opparizio the elements of a setup were right there the prosecution would have them believe that the first time lisa was in the garage was a dry run for the murder she would later commit i would have them believe that whoever set trammel up had all he needed to know thanks to facebook i moved on mr driscoll you said that mitchell bondurant was one of the people you were asked to gather information on is that correct yes what information did you gather on him mostly about his personal real estate holdings what properties he owned when he bought them and for how much who held the mortgages that sort of thing so you supplied to mr borden a financial snapshot thats right did you come across any liens against mr bondurant or his properties yes there were several he owed money around and all of this information went to borden yes it did i decided to leave it there on bondurant i didnt want the jury straying too far from the main point of driscolls testimony that aloft had been watching lisa and had all the information needed to set her up for murder driscoll had been effective and i would now close out his testimony with a bang mr driscoll when did you leave your position at aloft february first was it your choice or were you fired i told them i was quitting so they fired me why did you want to quit because mr bondurant had gotten murdered in the parking garage and i didnt know whether the lady who got arrested lisa trammel did it or if there was something else going on i saw mr opparizio in the elevator the day after it was in the news and everybody in the office knew about it we were going up but when we got to my floor he held my arm while everybody else got off we went up to his floor alone and he didnt say anything until the doors opened then he said keep your fucking mouth shut and got off and the doors closed those were his words keep your fucking mouth shut yes did he say anything else no so this led you to quit your job yes about an hour later i gave two weeks notice but about ten minutes after i did that mr borden came to my desk and told me i was out fired he had a box for my personal stuff and he had a security guard come watch me while i packed up then they walked me out did they give you a severance package as i was leaving mr borden gave me an envelope it had a check in it for a years salary that was pretty generous giving you a years salary considering you hadnt even worked there a full year and you had said you were quitting dont you think freeman objected on relevance and it was sustained i have nothing further for this witness freeman took my place arriving at the lectern with her trusty file which she spread open i had not put driscoll on my witness list until that morning but his name had come up during fridays testimony i was sure freeman had done some prep work i was about to find out how much mr driscoll you dont have a college degree do you uh no but you attended ucla did you not yes why didnt you graduate i stood and objected saying her questions were going way outside the scope of driscolls direct testimony but the judge said i opened the door when i asked the witness about his credentials and experience in it he told driscoll to answer the question i didnt graduate because i was expelled for what cheating i hacked into a teachers computer and downloaded an exam the night before it was given driscoll said it with an almost bored tone to his voice like he knew this was going to come out i knew this was in his background i told him that if it came out he had only one choice to be absolutely honest otherwise he would be inviting disaster so you are a cheater and a thief correct i was and that was more than ten years ago i dont cheat anymore theres nothing to cheat for really and what about stealing same thing i dont steal isnt it true that your employment at aloft was severed abruptly when it was discovered that you were systematically stealing from the company that is a lie i told them i was quitting and then they canned me arent you the one who is lying here no im telling the truth you think i could just make this stuff up driscoll made a desperate glance toward me and i wished he hadnt it could be interpreted as collusion between us driscoll was on his own up there i couldnt help him as a matter of fact i do mr driscoll freeman said isnt it true that you had quite a little business for yourself running out of aloft no driscoll demonstrably shook his head in support of his denial i read him as lying right there and i realized i was in deep trouble the severance package i thought the years pay they dont fire people and give them a years pay if theyve been stealing bring up the severance package were you not using aloft as a front to order expensive software then break the security codes and sell bootleg copies over the internet thats not true i knew this would happen if i told anyone what i know this time he did more than look at me he pointed at me i told you this would happen i told you these people dont mr driscoll the judge boomed you answer the question posed to you by counsel you do not talk to defense counsel or anyone else trying to keep her momentum freeman swooped in for the kill your honor may i approach the witness with a document you may are you going to mark it peoples exhibit nine your honor she had copies for everybody i leaned close to aronson so we could read it together it was a copy of an internal investigation report from aloft did you know about any of this aronson whispered of course not i whispered back i leaned forward to focus on the examination i didnt want a firstyear lawyer tsktsking me over a gigantic vetting failure what is that document mr driscoll freeman asked i dont know the witness responded ive never seen it before it is an internal investigation summary from aloft isnt it if you say so when is it dated february first that was your last day of work at aloft wasnt it yes it was that morning i gave my supervisor two weeks notice and then they erased my login and fired me for cause for no cause why do you think they gave me the big check at the door i knew things and they were trying to shut me up freeman looked up at the judge your honor could you instruct the witness to refrain from answering my questions with his own questions perry nodded the witness will answer questions not pose them it didnt matter i thought he had gotten it out there mr driscoll could you please read the paragraph of the report i have highlighted in yellow i objected stating that the report was not in evidence the judge overruled allowing the reading to proceed subject to a later evidentiary ruling driscoll read the paragraph to himself and then shook his head out loud mr driscoll the judge prompted but this is all complete lies this is what they do to mr driscoll the judge intoned grumpily read the paragraph aloud please driscoll hesitated one last time and then finally read the employee admitted that he had purchased the software packages with a company requisition and then returned them after copying the copyrighted materials the employee admitted he has been selling counterfeit copies of the software over the internet using company computers to facilitate this business the employee admitted earning more than one hundred thousand driscoll suddenly crushed the document with both hands into a ball and threw it across the courtroom right at me you did this he yelled at me following his pitch with a pointed finger i was fine in the world till you showed up once again judge perry couldve used a gavel he called for order and for the jury to return to the deliberations room they quickly filed out of the courtroom as if being chased by driscoll himself once the door was closed the judge took further action signaling the courtroom deputy forward jimmy take the witness to the holding cell while counsel and i discuss this in chambers he got up and stepped off the bench and quickly slipped through the door to his chambers before i could mount a protest over how my witness was being treated freeman followed and i detoured to the witness stand just go and ill get this over youll be right back out you fucking liar he said anger jumping in his eyes you said it would be easy and safe and now look at this the whole world thinks im a fucking software thief you think ill ever find work again well if i had known you were hijacking software i probably wouldnt have put you on the stand fuck you haller you better hope this is over because if i have to come back here im going to make up some shit about you the deputy was leading him toward the door that led to the holding cell next to the courtroom as he went i noticed aronson standing at the defense table her face told the story all her good work of the morning possibly undone mr haller the court clerk said from her corral the judge is waiting yeah i said im coming i headed toward the door fortyseven four green fields was always dead on monday nights it was a bar that catered to the legal crowd and it usually wasnt until a few days into the week that lawyers started to need alcohol to dampen the burdens of conscience we couldve had our pick of the place but we took to the bar aronson sitting between me and cisco we ordered a beer a cosmo and a vodka tonic with lime and without the vodka still smarting from the donald driscoll fiasco i had called the afterhours meeting to talk about tuesday and because i thought my two associates could use a drink there was a basketball game on the tv but i didnt even bother to check who was playing or what the score was i didnt care and couldnt see much further than the driscoll disaster his testimony had ended after the blowup and finger pointing in chambers the judge had worked out a curative address to the jurors telling them that both the prosecution and defense had agreed that he would be dismissed from giving further testimony driscoll at best had been a wash his direct testimony certainly set up the defense contention that louis opparizio had brought about the demise of mitchell bondurant but his credibility had been undermined during crossexamination and his volatile behavior and enmity toward me didnt help plus the judge was obviously holding me responsible for the spectacle and that would probably end up hurting the defense so aronson said after her first sip of cosmo what do we do now we keep fighting is what we do we had one bad witness one fiasco every trial has a moment like this i pointed up to the tv you a football fan jennifer i knew she had gone to ucsanta barbara for her undergraduate degree then southwestern not much in the way of collegiate football powers thats not football thats basketball yeah i know but do you like football i like the raiders i knew it cisco said gleefully a girl after my own heart well i said when youre a defense lawyer you have to be like a cornerback you know youre going to get burned from time to time its just part of the game so when it happens you have to pick yourself up dust yourself off and forget about it because theyre about to snap the ball again we gave them a touchdown todayi gave them a touchdown but the games not over jennifer not by a long shot right so what do we do what weve planned to do all along go after opparizio it comes down to him ive got to push him to the edge i think ciscos given me the firepower to do it and hopefully his guard will be down because weve had dahl telling him its going to be a walk in the park realistically right now i think the score is tied even with driscoll blowing up id say were either tied or maybe the prosecutions got a few points up on us ive got to change that tomorrow if i dont we lose a somber silence followed until aronson asked another question what about driscoll mickey what about him were done with driscoll yeah but did you believe him about all the software stuff do you think opparizios people set him up was all of that about him stealing software madeup lies because now its out in front of the media i dont know freeman did a smart thing she coupled it with something he wouldnt or couldnt denystealing the test so it all sort of flowed together anyway it doesnt matter what i believe its what the jury believes i think youre wrong i think that what you believe is always important i nodded maybe so jennifer i took a long sip of my anemic drink aronson then went in a new direction how come you stopped calling me bullocks i looked at her and then looked back at my drink i shrugged because you did so well today its like youre all grown up or something and you shouldnt be called by a nickname i looked past her at cisco and pointed but him with a name like wojciechowski hes got his nickname for life and thats just the way it is we all laughed and it seemed to relieve some of the pressure i knew alcohol could help with that but it had been two years now and i was strong i wouldnt slip what did you tell dahl to go back with today cisco asked i shrugged again the defense is in disarray they lost their best shot with driscoll when freeman destroyed him then the usual we dont have anything on opparizio and testifying will be like cutting butter left out on the counter hes supposed to call me after he talks to his handler cisco nodded i continued in another direction im thinking opparizio is the way to end it if i can get what cisco has gotten for me to the jury in questions and his answers and i push him to the nickel then i think ill just end it there and cisco you wont testify aronson frowned like she wasnt sure that would be a good move good cisco said i wont have to wear the monkey suit tomorrow he tugged at his collar like it was made of sandpaper no you have to wear it again just in case you have another shirt like that dont you not really i guess ill have to wash this tonight are you kidding me you only cisco made a low whistling sound and nodded toward the door behind me i turned just as maggie mcpherson slipped onto the open stool next to me there you are maggie mcfierce she pointed to my drink that better not be what i think it is dont worry its not good she ordered a real vodka tonic from randy the bartender probably just to rub it in so drowning your sorrows without the drown i did hear it was a good day for the good guys meaning the prosecution always maybe you hired a sitter for a monday night no the sitter offered to sit tonight i take it when i can get it because shes got a boyfriend now so ive probably seen my last friday and saturday nights out on the town okay so you get her tonight and you go out to the bar by yourself maybe i was looking for you haller ever think of that i turned on my stool so my back was to aronson and i was directly facing maggie really maybe i thought you could use some company youre not answering your cell i forgot its still off from court i pulled the phone and turned it on no wonder i hadnt gotten the call from herb dahl you want to go to your place she asked i looked at her for a long moment before answering tomorrows going to be the most important day of the trial i should i have till midnight i took a deep breath but more air went out than came in i leaned toward her and then tilted so that our heads were touching sort of like how they touch sabers before a fencing match i whispered in her ear i cant keep doing things this way we have to go forward or be done she put her hand on my chest and pushed me back i was afraid of what my life would be like with her completely gone from it i regretted the ultimatum i had just set out because i knew that if forced to make a choice she would pick the latter what do you say we just worry about tonight haller okay i said so quickly that we both started laughing i had dodged a bullet i had fired at myself for now i still have to get some work done at some point yeah well see about that she reached to the bar for her drink but took mine by mistake or maybe not by mistake she sipped and then screwed up her face in disgust that tastes just awful without vodka whats the point i know was that some sort of test no just a mistake sure she drank from her own glass now i turned slightly and looked back at cisco and aronson they were leaning toward each other engaged in a conversation and ignoring me i turned back to maggie marry me again maggie im going to change everything after this case ive heard that before the second part yeah but this time its going to happen it already is do i have to answer right now is it a onetime thing or can i think about it sure take a few minutes im going to hit the head and then ill be back we laughed again and then i leaned forward and kissed her and held my face in her hair i whispered again i cant think of being with anybody else she turned in to me and kissed my neck then pulled back i hate public displays of affection especially in bars seems so cheap sorry lets go now she slid off the stool and took a last sip of her drink while standing i pulled my cash and peeled off enough to cover everybody including the bartender i told cisco and aronson i was going i thought we were still talking about opparizio aronson protested i saw cisco surreptitiously touch her arm in a not now signal i appreciated that you know what i said its been a long day sometimes not thinking about something is the best way to prepare for it ill be in the office early tomorrow before going to court if you want to come by otherwise ill see you in court at nine we said our goodbyes and i walked out with my exwife you want to leave a car here or what i asked no too dangerous to come back here after dinner and being in bed with you ill want to go in for one last drink and then it might not be the last i have the sitter to relieve and work tomorrow too is that how you view it just dinner and sex and getting home by midnight she couldve really hurt me then said i was whining like a woman complaining about men but she didnt no she said i actually view it as the best night of the week i raised my hand and clasped the back of her neck as we walked to our cars she always liked that even if it was a public display of affection fortyeight you could feel the tension rise with each step as louis opparizio made his way to the witness stand on tuesday morning he wore a light tan suit with a blue shirt and maroon tie he looked dignified in a way that bespoke money and power and it was clear that he looked at me through contemptuous eyes he was my witness but obviously there was no love lost here since the start of the trial i had pointed the finger of guilt at someone other than my client i had pointed at opparizio and now he sat before me this was the main event and as such it had drawn the biggest crowdboth media and onlookersof the trial i started things out cordially but wasnt planning to continue that way i had one goal here and the verdict was riding on whether i achieved it i had to push the man in the witness box to the limit he was there only because he had been cornered by his own avarice and vanity he had ignored legal counsel declined to hide behind the fifth amendment and accepted the challenge of going oneonone with me in front of a packed house my job was to make him regret those decisions my job was to make him take the fifth in front of the jury if he did that then lisa trammel would walk there could be no stronger reasonable doubt than to have the straw man youve been pointing at all trial long hide behind the fifth to refuse to answer questions on the grounds that he would incriminate himself how could any honest juror vote guilty beyond a reasonable doubt after that good morning mr opparizio how are you id rather be somewhere else how are you i smiled he was feisty from the start ill tell you that in a few hours i answered thank you for being here today i noticed a bit of a northeastern accent are you not from los angeles i was born in brooklyn fiftyone years ago i moved out here for law school and never left you and your company have been mentioned here during the trial more than a few times it seems to hold the lions share of foreclosure work in at least this county i was your honor freeman interrupted from her seat is there going to be a question here perry looked down at her for a moment is that an objection ms freeman she realized she had not stood the judge had instructed us in pretrial meetings that we must stand to make an objection she quickly stood up yes your honor ask a question mr haller i was about to your honor mr opparizio could you tell us in your words what it is that aloft does opparizio cleared his throat and turned directly toward the jurors when he answered he was a polished and proficient witness i had my work cut out for me id be happy to essentially aloft is a processing firm large loan servicers such as westland national pay my company to handle property foreclosures from start to finish we handle everything from drawing up the paperwork to serving notices to appearing in court as necessary all for one allinclusive fee nobody likes to hear about foreclosures we all struggle on some level to pay our bills and try to keep our homes but sometimes it doesnt work out and foreclosure is required thats where we come in you say but sometimes it doesnt work out over the past few years it has been working out pretty good for you though hasnt it our business has seen tremendous growth in the past four years and it has only now finally started to level off you mentioned westland national as a client westland was a significant client correct it was and still is about how many foreclosures do you handle for westland in a year i wouldnt know off the top of my head but i think its safe to say that with all of their locations in the western united states we get close to ten thousand files from them in a year would you believe that over the past four years you have averaged over sixteen thousand cases a year referred by westland its in the banks annual report i held it up for all to see yes i would believe that annual reports dont lie what is the fee that aloft charges per foreclosure on residential we charge twentyfive hundred dollars and thats for everything even if we have to go to court on the matter so doing the math your company takes in forty million dollars a year from westland alone correct if the figures you used are correct that sounds right i take it then that the westland account was very big at aloft yes but all our clients are important so you must have known mitchell bondurant the victim in this case pretty well correct of course i knew him well and i think its a terrible shame about what happened to him he was a good man trying to do a good job i am sure we all appreciate your sympathy but at the time of his death you werent very happy with mr bondurant were you im not sure what you mean we were business associates we had minor disputes from time to time but that always happens in the natural course of business well im not talking about minor disputes or the natural course of business im asking you about a letter mr bondurant sent to you shortly before his murder that threatened to expose fraudulent practices within your company the certified letter was signed for by your personal secretary did you read it i skimmed it it indicated to me that one of my hundred eightyfive employees had taken a shortcut this was a minor dispute and nothing about it was threatening as you say i told the person who had that particular file to fix it thats all mr haller but that wasnt all i had to say about the letter i made opparizio read it to the jury and for the next half hour i asked increasingly specific and uncomfortable questions about its allegations i then moved on to the federal target letter and made the witness read that as well but again opparizio was unflappable dismissing the federal letter as a shot in the dark i welcomed them with open arms he said but you know what nobodys come in all this time later and not a word from mr lattimore or agent vasquez or any other federal agent because their letter didnt pay off i didnt run i didnt sweat i didnt cry foul or hide behind a lawyer i said i know youve got a job to do come on in and check us out our doors are open and weve got absolutely nothing to hide it was a good and wellrehearsed answer and opparizio was clearly winning the early rounds but that was okay because i was saving my best punches i wanted him to feel confident and in control through herb dahl he had been fed a steady diet of no worries he had been led to believe i had nothing but a few desperate hints of conspiracy that he could easily swat away as he was doing right now his confidence was growing but when he got too confident and complacent i was going to move in and go for the knockout this fight wouldnt go fifteen rounds it couldnt now at the time these letters were coming in you were engaged in a secret negotiation were you not opparizio paused for the first time since i had begun asking him questions i was engaged at the time in private business discussions as i am at almost all times i would not use the word secret because of the connotation secrecy being wrong when in fact keeping ones business private is a matter of course okay then this private discussion was actually a negotiation to sell your company aloft to a publicly traded company correct yes that is so a company called lemure yes correct this deal would be worth a lot of money to you would it not freeman stood and asked for a sidebar we approached and she stated her objection in a forceful whisper how is this relevant where are we going with this he now has us on wall street and that has nothing to do with lisa trammel and the evidence against her your honor i said quickly before he could cut me off the relevance will become apparent soon ms freeman knows exactly where this is headed and she just doesnt want to go there but the court has given me the latitude to put forth a defense involving thirdparty guilt well this is it judge this is where it comes together and so i ask for the courts continued indulgence perry didnt have to think too long before answering mr haller you may proceed but i want you to land this plane soon thank you judge we returned to our positions and i decided to move things along at a quicker pace mr opparizio back in january when you were in the midst of these negotiations with lemure you knew you stood to make a great deal of money if this deal went through did you not i would be generously compensated for the years i spent growing the company but if you lost one of your biggest clientsto the tune of forty million in annual revenuesthat deal would have been in peril correct there was no threat from any client to leave i draw your attention back to the letter mr bondurant sent you sir wouldnt you say that there is a clear threat from mr bondurant to take westlands business away from you i believe you still have a copy of the letter there in front of you if you want to refer to it i dont need to look at the letter there was no threat to me whatsoever mitch sent me the letter and i took care of the problem like the way you took care of donald driscoll objection freeman said argumentative ill withdraw it mr opparizio you received this letter smackdab in the middle of your deal making with lemure correct it was during negotiations yes and at the time you received this letter from mr bondurant you knew he was in financial straits himself correct i knew nothing about mr bondurants personal financial situation did you not have an employee of your company do financial background searches on mr bondurant and other bankers you dealt with no thats ridiculous whoever said that is a liar it was time for me to test herb dahls work as a double agent at the time mr bondurant sent you that letter was he aware of your secret dealings with lemure opparizios answer should have been i dont know but i had told dahl to send back word through his handler that the trammel legal team had found nothing on this key part of the defense strategy he knew nothing about it opparizio said i had kept all of our client banks in the dark while negotiations were ongoing who is lemures chief financial officer opparizio seemed momentarily nonplussed by the question and the seeming change in direction that would be syd jenkins sydney jenkins and was he the leader of the acquisition team you dealt with on the lemure deal freeman objected and asked where this was going i told the judge he would know shortly and he allowed me to continue telling opparizio to answer the question yes i dealt with syd jenkins on the acquisition i opened a file and removed a document while asking the judge for permission to approach the witness with it as expected freeman objected and we had a spirited sidebar over the admissibility of the document but just as freeman had won the battle over presenting driscoll with the internal investigation report from aloft judge perry evened the score allowing me to introduce the document subject to his later ruling permission granted i handed a copy to the witness mr opparizio can you tell the jury what that document is i cant tell for sure is it not a printout from a digital daybook if you say so and what name is on the top of the sheet there mitchell bondurant and what is the date on the page december thirteenth can you read the appointment entry for ten oclock freeman asked for a sidebar and once more we stood in front of the judge your honor lisa trammel is on trial here not louis opparizio or mitchell bondurant this is what happens when someone takes advantage of the courts goodwill when given leeway i object to this line of questioning counsel is taking us far afield of the matter this jury must decide judge i said again this goes to thirdparty guilt this is a page from the digital diary turned over to the defense in discovery the answer to this question will make it clear to the jury that the victim in this case was involved in subtly extorting the witness and that is a motive for murder judge this thats enough ms freeman i will allow it we returned to our places and the judge told opparizio to answer the question i repeated it for the sake of the jury what is listed on mr bondurants calendar for ten oclock on december thirteenth it says sydney jenkins lemure so would you not take from that log line that mr bondurant became aware of the aloftlemure deal in december of last year i couldnt begin to know what was said at that meeting or if it even took place what reason would the man leading the acquisition of aloft have for meeting with one of alofts most important bank clients you would have to ask mr jenkins that perhaps i will opparizio had developed a scowl in the course of the questioning the herb dahl plant had worked well i moved on when did the deal on the sale of aloft to lemure close the deal closed in late february how much was it sold for id rather not say lemure is a publicly traded company sir the information is out there could you save us the time and ninetysix million dollars most of which as sole owner went to you correct a good portion of it yes and you got stock in lemure as well correct thats right and you remain president of aloft dont you yes i still run the company i just have bosses now he tried a smile but most of the working stiffs in the courtroom didnt see the humor in the comment considering the millions he had taken out of the deal so you are still intimately involved in the daytoday operations of the company yes sir i am mr opparizio was your personal take in the sale of aloft sixtyone million dollars as reported by the wall street journal they got that wrong how so my deal was worth that amount but it didnt come to me all at once you get deferred payments something along those lines but i dont really see what this has to do with who killed mitch bondurant mr haller why am i here i had nothing to your honor hold on a moment mr opparizio the judge said he then leaned forward over the bench and paused as if to contemplate something were going to take our morning break now and counsel will join me in chambers the court is in recess once more we followed the judge back into chambers once more i was going to be the one put on the spot but i was so angry at perry that i went on the offensive i stayed standing while both he and freeman took seats your honor with all due respect i had a certain momentum going out there and taking the morning break early is killing it mr haller you may have had plenty of momentum but it was taking you far away from this case i have bent over backward to allow you to present a thirdparty defense but i am beginning to feel ive been had judge i was four questions away from bringing it all back home to this case but you just stopped me you stopped yourself counsel i cant sit up there and let this go on ms freemans been objecting now even the witness is objecting and im looking like a fool youre fishing you told me and you told those jurors that you would not only prove that your client didnt commit the crime but that you would prove who did but we are now five witnesses into the defense case and you are still fishing your honor i cant believelook i am not fishing here i am proving bondurant had threatened to cost that man out there sixtyone million dollars it is obvious and anyone with common sense sees this and if that is not motive for a murder then i guess i motive isnt proof freeman said its not evidence and you obviously dont have any the defenses whole case is a charade whats next you name everybody bondurant was foreclosing on as a suspect i pointed down at her in the chair that wouldnt be a bad idea but the fact is the defense case is not a charade and if allowed to continue my examination of the witness i will get to the evidence very quickly sit down mr haller and please watch your tone when you are addressing me yes your honor i apologize i sat down and waited while perry brooded over the situation finally he spoke ms freeman anything else i think the court is well aware of how the prosecution views what mr haller has been allowed to do i warned early and often that he would create a sideshow that had nothing to do with the case at hand we are well past that point now and i have to agree with the courts assessment that all of this makes the court look foolish and manipulated she had gone too far i could see the skin around perrys eyes tighten as she stated that he looked like a fool i think shed had him in her hand but then lost him well thank you very much ms freeman i think at this time im inclined to go back out and give mr haller one final chance to tie it all in do you understand what i mean by final chance mr haller yes your honor i will comply youd better sir because the courts patience has drawn thin lets go back now out at the defense table i saw aronson waiting by herself and realized she hadnt followed me into chambers i sat down wearily wheres lisa in the hallway with dahl what happened ive got one more chance i have to move things up and go in for the kill now can you do it well see ive got to run out to the facilities before we start again why didnt you come into chambers no one asked me to and i didnt know if i should just follow you in next time follow me in courthouse designs are good at separating parties jurors have their own assembly and deliberation rooms and there are aisles and gates to separate opposing parties and supporters but the restrooms are the great equalizers you step into one of these and you never know who you will encounter i pushed through the inner door of the mens room and almost walked right into opparizio who was washing his hands at the sink he was bent over and looked up at me in the mirror well counselor did the judge slap your hands a little bit thats none of your business ill find another restroom i turned around to leave but opparizio stopped me dont bother im leaving he shook his wet hands off and moved toward the door coming very close to me and then suddenly stopping you are despicable haller he said your client is a murderer and you have the balls to try to cast the blame on me how do you look at yourself in the mirror he turned and gestured toward the line of urinals this is where you belong he said in the toilet fortynine it all came down to the next half hourmaybe an hour at the most i sat at the defense table composing my thoughts and waiting everyone was in place except for the judge who remained in chambers and opparizio who was smugly conferring with his two attorneys in the first row of the gallery where they had reserved seats my client leaned toward me and whispered so that not even aronson could hear you have more right excuse me you have more dont you mickey more to go after him with even she knew that what i had already trotted out was not enough i whispered back well know before lunch well either be drinking champagne or crying in our soup the door to the judges chambers opened and perry emerged he called for the jury and the witness to return to the stand before he was even seated on the bench a few minutes later i was back at the lectern staring down opparizio the restroom confrontation seemed to give him renewed confidence he adopted a relaxed posture that announced to the world that he was home free i decided that there was no sense in waiting it was time to start swinging now then mr opparizio continuing our discussion from before you have not been completely truthful in your testimony today have you i have been completely honest and i resent the question you lied from the start didnt you sir giving a false name when sworn in by the clerk my name was legally changed thirtyone years ago i did not lie and it has nothing to do with this what is the name that is on your birth certificate opparizio paused and i think i saw the first inkling or recognition of where i was going with this my birth name was antonio luigi apparizio like now but spelled with an a growing up people called me lou or louie because there were a lot of anthonys and antonios in the neighborhood i decided to go with louis i legally changed my name to anthony louis opparizio i americanized it thats it but why did you change the spelling of your last name too there was a professional baseball player at the time named luis aparicio i thought the names were too close louis apparizio and luis aparicio i didnt want to have a name so close to a famous persons so i changed the spelling is that okay with you mr haller the judge admonished opparizio to simply answer the questions and not ask them do you know when luis aparicio retired from professional baseball i asked i glanced at the judge after asking the question if his patience was being stretched before it was now probably as thin as the piece of paper a contempt citation would be printed on no i dont know when he retired does it surprise you to learn that it was eight years before you changed your name no it doesnt surprise me but you expect the jury to believe that you changed your name to avoid a match to a baseball player long out of the game opparizio shrugged its what happened isnt it true that you changed your name from apparizio to opparizio because you were an ambitious young man and wanted to at least outwardly distance yourself from your family no untrue i did want to have a more americansounding name but i wasnt distancing myself from anyone i saw opparizios eyes make a quick dart in the direction of his attorneys you were originally named after your uncle were you not i asked no thats not true opparizio answered quickly i wasnt named after anyone you had an uncle named antonio luigi apparizio the same name as on your birth certificate and you are saying it was just coincidence realizing his mistake in lying opparizio tried to recover but only made it worse my parents never told me who i was named after or even if i was named after someone and a bright person like you didnt put it together i never thought about it when i was twentyone i came west and was not close to my family anymore you mean geographically in any way i started a new life i stayed out here your father and your uncle were involved in organized crime were they not freeman quickly objected and asked for a sidebar when we got there she did everything but roll her eyes back into her head as she tried to communicate her frustration your honor enough is enough counsel may show no shame in besmirching the reputations of his own witnesses but this has to end this is a trial judge not a deepsea fishing trip your honor you told me to move quickly and that is what i am doing i have an offer of proof that clearly shows this is no fishing trip well what is it mr haller i handed the judge a thick bound document i had carried to the sidebar there were several postits of different colors protruding from its pages that is the us attorney generals report to congress on organized crime its dated nineteen eightysix and the ag at the time was edwin meese if you go to the yellow postit and open the page the highlighted paragraph is my offer of proof the judge read the passage and then turned the book around so freeman could read it before she was finished he ruled on the objection ask your questions mr haller but im giving you about ten minutes to connect the dots if you dont do it by then im going to shut you down thank you judge i went back to the lectern and asked the question again but in a different way mr opparizio were you aware that your father and your uncle were members of an organized crime group known as the gambino family opparizio had seen me offer the bound book to the judge he knew i had something to back my question rather than throw out a full denial he went with the vague response as i said i left my family behind when i went off to school i didnt know about them after that and i was told nothing before it was time to be relentless to back opparizio to the edge of the cliff wasnt your uncle known as anthony the ape apparizio because of his reputation for brutality and violence i wouldnt know didnt your uncle act as a father figure in your life while your own father spent most of your teenage years in prison for extortion my uncle took care of us financially but he was not a father figure when you moved out west at age twentyone was it to distance yourself from your family or to extend your familys business opportunities to the west coast now thats a lie i came out here for law school i had nothing and brought nothing with me including family connections are you familiar with the term sleeper as it is applied in organized crime investigations i dont know what youre talking about would it surprise you to learn that the fbi starting in the s believed that the mob was attempting to move into legitimate areas of business by sending its next generation of members to schools and other locales so that they could sink roots and start businesses and that these people were called sleepers i am a legitimate businessman no one sent me anywhere and i put myself through law school working for a process server i nodded as though i expected the answer speaking of process servers you own several companies dont you sir i dont understand let me rephrase when you sold aloft to the lemure fund you kept ownership of a variety of companies that contracted with aloft correct opparizio took his time thinking about an answer he made another furtive glance toward his attorneys it was a get me out of this look he knew where i was going and he knew i couldnt be allowed to get there but he was on the witness stand and there was only one way out i have ownership and part ownership in a variety of different enterprises all of them legal all of them aboveboard and legitimate it was a good answer but it was not going to be good enough what kind of companies what services do they provide you mentioned process serving thats one of them i have a paralegal referral and placement company theres an office staffing company and an office furniture supply entity theres do you own a courier service the witness paused before answering he was trying to think two questions ahead and i wasnt staying in a rhythm he could pick up on im an investor im not the sole owner lets talk about the courier service first of all whats it called wing nuts courier services and is that a los angelesbased company based here but with offices in seven cities it operates all over this state and nevada exactly how much of wing nuts do you own i am a partial participant i believe i own forty percent of it and who are some of the other participants well there are several some arent people theyre other companies like aabest consultants of brooklyn new york which is listed on corporate records in sacramento as part owner of wing nuts opparizio was again slow to answer this time he seemed lost in a dark thought until the judge prompted him yes i believe that is one of the investors now corporation documents held by the state of new york show that the majority owner of aabest is one dominic capelli are you familiar with him no i am not you are saying that you are unfamiliar with one of your partners in wing nuts sir aabest invested i invested i dont know all the individuals involved freeman stood it was about time i had been waiting for her to object for at least four questions i was spinning my wheels waiting your honor is there a point to all of this she asked i was beginning to wonder about that myself perry said you want to enlighten us mr haller three more questions your honor and i think the relevance here will be crystal clear to everyone i said i beg the courts indulgence for just three more questions i had stared at opparizio the whole time id said it i was sending the message pull the plug now or your secrets will be put out there in the world lemure will know your stockholders will know the us attorneys office will know everyone will know very well mr haller thank you your honor i looked down at my notes now was the time if i had opparizio right now was the time i looked back up at him mr opparizio would it surprise you to learn that dominic capelli the partner you claim not to know is listed by the new york your honor it was opparizio he had cut me off on advice of counsel and pursuant to my fifth amendment rights and privileges granted by the constitution of the united states and the state of california i respectfully decline to answer this or further questions there i stood totally still but that was only on the outside energy flooded through me like a scream i was barely aware of the rumble of whispers that went through the courtroom then from behind me a voice firmly addressed the court your honor may i address the court please i turned and saw it was one of opparizios attorneys martin zimmer then i heard freeman her voice high and tight calling an objection and asking for a sidebar but i knew a sidebar wasnt going to do it this time and so did perry mr zimmer you may sit down we are going to break now for lunch and i expect all parties to be back in court at one oclock this afternoon the jury is directed not to discuss the case with one another or to draw any conclusions from the testimony and request of this witness court broke loudly after that with the members of the media talking among themselves as the last juror was going through the door i stepped away from the lectern and leaned down to the defense table to whisper in aronsons ear you might want to come back to chambers this time she was about to ask what i meant when perry made it official i want counsel to join me in chambers immediately mr opparizio i want you to stay right there you can consult with your counsel but dont leave the courtroom with that the judge got up and headed back i followed fifty by now i was intimately getting to know the wall hangings and furnishings and everything else in the judges chambers but i expected that this would be my last visit and probably the most difficult as we entered the judge stripped off his robe and threw it haphazardly over the hat rack in the corner rather than carefully put it on a hanger as he had for prior in camera meetings he then dropped into his seat and loudly exhaled he leaned far back and looked up at the ceiling he had a petulant look on his face as though his concerns over what would be decided here were more about his own reputation as a jurist than about justice for a murder victim mr haller he said as though he was releasing a great burden yes your honor the judge rubbed his face please tell me that it was not your plan all along and from the beginning to force mr opparizio into taking the fifth in front of the jury judge i said i had no idea he was going to take the fifth after the motion to quash hearing we had i thought there was no way he would i was pushing him sure but i wanted the answers to my questions freeman shook her head you have something to add ms freeman your honor i think defense counsel has treated the court and the justice system with nothing but contempt from the start of this trial he didnt even answer your question just now he didnt say it wasnt his plan your honor he just said he had no idea those are two separate things and they underline the fact that defense counsel is sneaky and has tried to sabotage this trial from the start he has now succeeded all along opparizio was a fifth witnessa straw man he could set up in front of the jury and then knock down when he took the fifth that was the plan and if that is not a subverting of the adversarial system then i dont know what is i glanced at aronson she looked mortified and maybe even swayed by freemans statement judge i said calmly i can only say one thing to ms freeman prove it if shes so sure this was some kind of master plan then she can try to prove it the truth is and my young idealistic colleague here can back me on this we did not even become aware of opparizios organized crime connections until just recently my investigator literally stumbled across them while tracking back all of opparizios holdings as listed in his sec filings the police and prosecution had the opportunity to do this but either chose to ignore it or came up short of the mark i think counsels upset largely extends from that not what tactics i employ in court the judge who was still leaning back and looking at the ceiling made a waving gesture with his hand i didnt know what it meant judge perry swung the chair around and leaned forward addressing all three of us so what do we do about this he looked at me first i glanced at aronson to see if she had something to offer but she looked frozen in place i turned back to the judge i dont think there is anything that can be done the witness invoked the fifth hes done testifying we cant go on with him selectively using the fifth whenever or wherever he wants he invoked hes done next witness i have one more and then im done too ill be ready to give my closing tomorrow morning freeman could no longer take it sitting down she stood up and started pacing a short pattern near the window this is so unfair and so much a part of mr hallers plan he brings out the testimony he wants on direct then pushes opparizio into the fifth and then the state gets no cross no redress at all is that even remotely fair your honor perry didnt answer he didnt have to everybody in the room knew the situation was unfair to the state freeman now had no opportunity to question opparizio im going to strike his entire testimony perry declared ill tell the jury not to consider it freeman folded her arms across her chest and shook her head in frustration thats a helluva big bell to unring she said this is a disaster for the prosecution judge its completely unfair i said nothing because freeman was right the judge could tell the jurors not to consider anything opparizio had said but it was too late the message was delivered and was floating around in all their heads just as i had intended sadly i see no alternative perry said well take lunch now and ill be thinking further on the issue i suggest you three do the same if you come up with something else before one i will certainly entertain it no one said anything it was hard to believe it had come to this the end of the case in sight and things falling just as planned that means you can all leave now perry added ill tell the deputy that mr opparizio is relieved as a witness he probably has the whole media throng in the hallway waiting to devour him and he probably blames you for that mr haller you might want to steer clear of him while hes in the courthouse yes your honor perry picked up the phone to call the deputy as we headed toward the door i followed freeman out and down the hallway to the courtroom i was expecting it when she turned on me with nothing but pure and piercing anger in her eyes now i know haller now you know what why you and maggie will never get back together again that put a pause in my step and aronson walked right into me from behind freeman turned back around and kept going that was a low blow mickey aronson said i watched freeman go through the door to the courtroom no i said it wasnt fiftyone my last witness was my trusty investigator dennis cisco wojciechowski took the witness stand after lunch after the judge told the jurors that all of louis opparizios testimony was stricken from the record cisco had to spell his last name twice for the clerk but that was expected he was indeed wearing the same shirt from the day before but no jacket and no tie the fluorescent lighting in the courtroom made the black ink chains that wrapped his biceps clearly visible through the stretched sleeves of the pale blue shirt im just going to call you dennis if that is okay i said it will be easier on the court reporter polite laughter rolled through the courtroom thats fine with me the witness said okay now you work for me handling investigations for the defense is that correct dennis yes thats what i do and you worked extensively for the defense on the mitchell bondurant murder investigation correct correct you could say that i piggybacked my investigation on the police investigation checking to see if they missed anything or maybe got something wrong did you work from investigative materials that were turned over to the defense by the prosecution yes i did included in that material was a list of license plate numbers correct yes the garage at westland national had a camera positioned over the drivein entrance detectives kurlen and longstreth studied the recording from the camera and wrote down the plate number of every car that entered the garage between seven when the garage opened and nine when it was determined that mr bondurant was already dead they then ran the plates through the law enforcement computer to see if any of the owners had criminal records or should be further investigated for other reasons and were any further investigations generated from this list according to their investigative records no now dennis you mentioned you piggybacked on their investigation did you take this list and check these plate numbers out yourself i did all seventyeight of them as best i could without access to law enforcement computers and did any merit further attention or did you reach the same conclusion as detectives kurlen and longstreth yes one car merited more attention in my opinion and so i followed up on it i asked permission to give the witness a copy of the seventyeight license plate numbers the judge allowed it cisco pulled his reading glasses out of his shirt pocket and put them on which license plate did you want to further check out wnutznine why were you interested in that one because at the time i looked at this list we were already far down the road in our other avenues of investigation i knew that louis opparizio was part owner in a business called wing nuts i thought maybe there was a connection to the vehicle that carried that plate so what did you find out that the car was registered to wing nuts a courier service that is partially owned by louis opparizio and again why was that worthy of attention well as i said i had the benefit of time kurlen and longstreth put this list together on the day of the murder they did not know all the key factors or individuals involved i was looking at this several weeks down the road and at that point i knew that the victim mr bondurant had sent an incendiary letter to mr opparizio and freeman objected to his description of the letter and the judge struck the word incendiary from the record i then told cisco to continue from our viewpoint that letter cut opparizio in as a person of interest and so i was doing a lot of background work on him i connected him through wing nuts to a partner named dominic capelli capelli is known to law enforcement in new york as an associate of an organized crime family run by a man named joey giordano capelli has various connections to other unsavory freeman objected again and the judge sustained it i put on my best show of frustration acting as though both the judge and prosecutor were keeping the truth from the jury okay lets go back to the list and what it means what did it show occurred at the garage involving a car owned by wing nuts it showed that the car entered the garage at eight ohfive and what time did it leave the exit camera showed it leaving at eight fifty so this vehicle entered the garage before the murder and left after the murder do i have that right thats correct and the vehicle was owned by a company that was owned by a man with direct ties to organized crime is that also right yes it is okay did you determine if there was a legitimate business reason for a vehicle belonging to wing nuts to be in that garage of course the business is a courier service it is used regularly by aloft to deliver documents to westland national but what was curious to me is why the car entered at eight ohfive and then left before the bank even opened at nine i looked at cisco for a long moment my gut said i had gotten all i needed to get there was still chicken on the bone but sometimes you just have to push the plate away sometimes leaving the jury with a question is the best way to go i have nothing further i said my direct examination had been very precise in scope to include only testimony about the license plates this left freeman little to work with on cross however she did score one point when she elicited from cisco a reminder to the jury that westland national occupied only three floors of a tenstory building the courier from wing nuts could have been going somewhere other than the bank thus explaining his early arrival in the garage i was sure that if there was a record of a courier delivery to an office in the building other than the bank then she would produce itor opparizios people would magically produce it for herby the time she could put on rebuttal witnesses after a half hour freeman threw in the towel and sat down that was when the judge asked if i had another witness to call no your honor i said the defense rests the judge dismissed the jury for the day and instructed them to be in the assembly room by nine the next morning once they were gone perry set the stage for the end of the trial asking the attorneys if they would have rebuttal witnesses i said no freeman said she wanted to reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses in the morning okay then we will reserve the morning session for rebuttal if there is any rebuttal perry said closing arguments will begin first thing after the lunch break and each side will be limited to one hour with any luck and no more surprises our jury will go into deliberations by this time tomorrow perry left the bench then and i was left at the defense table with aronson and trammel lisa reached over and put her hand on top of mine that was brilliant she said the whole morning was brilliant i think that the jurors finally get it as well i was watching them i think they know the truth i looked back at trammel and then at aronson two different expressions on their faces thank you lisa i guess it wont be long before we find out fiftytwo in the morning andrea freeman surprised me by not surprising me she stood before the judge and said she had no rebuttal witnesses she then rested the states case this gave me pause i had come to court fully prepared to face at least one final tilt with her testimony explaining the wing nuts car in the bank garage or maybe driscolls supervisor putting the boots to him even a prosecution foreclosure expert to contradict aronsons assertions but nothing she folded the tent she was going with the blood whether i had robbed her of her boléro crescendo or not she was going to make her stand on the one incontrovertible aspect of the entire trial the blood judge perry recessed court for the morning so the attorneys could work on their closing arguments and he could retreat to chambers to work on the jury chargethe final set of instructions jurors would take with them into deliberations i called rojas and had him pick me up on delano i didnt want to go back to the office too many distractions i told rojas just to drive and i spread my files and notes out in the backseat of the lincoln this was where i did my best thinking my best prep work at one oclock sharp court reconvened like everything else in the criminal justice system closing arguments were tipped toward the state the prosecution got to speak first and last the defense got the middle it looked to me like freeman was going with the standard prosecutorial format build the house with the facts on the first swing and then pull their emotional strings on the second block by block she outlined the evidence against lisa trammel seemingly leaving out nothing presented since the start of the trial the discourse was dry but cumulative she covered means and motive and she brought it all home with the blood the hammer the shoes the uncontested dna findings i told you at the beginning of this trial that blood would tell the tale she said and here we are you can discount everything else but the blood evidence alone warrants a vote of guilty as charged i am sure you will follow your conscience and do just that she sat down and then it was my turn i stood in the opening in front of the jury box and addressed the twelve directly but i wasnt alone in the well as previously approved by the judge i brought manny out to stand with me dr shamiram arslanians erstwhile companion stood upright with the hammer attached to the crown of his head his head snapped back at the unusual angle that would have been necessary if lisa trammel had struck the fatal blow ladies and gentlemen of the jury i began ive got good news we should all be out of here and back to our normal lives by the end of the day i appreciate your patience and your attentiveness during this trial i appreciate your consideration of the evidence i am not going to take a lot of time up here because i want to get you home as soon as possible today should be easy this is a quick one this case comes down to what i call a fiveminute verdict a case where reasonable doubt is so pervasive that a unanimous verdict will undoubtedly be reached on your very first ballot from there i highlighted the evidence the defense had brought forth and the contradictions and deficiencies in the states case i asked the unanswered questions why was the briefcase open why did the hammer go so long without being found why was lisa trammels garage found unlocked and why would someone who was clearly going to succeed in defending her foreclosure case lash out against bondurant it eventually brought me to the centerpiece of my closingthe mannequin the demonstration by dr arslanian alone puts the lie to the states case without considering another single part of the defense case manny here gives you reasonable doubt we know from the injuries to the knees of the victim that he was standing when struck with the fatal blow and if he was standing then this is the only position that he could have been in for lisa trammel to have been the killer head back face to the ceiling is that possible you must ask yourself is that likely what would make mitchell bondurant look up what was he looking up at i paused there hand in one pocket adopting a casual and confident pose i checked their eyes all twelve of them were locked in on the mannequin i then reached up to the handle of the hammer and slowly pushed it up until the plastic face came down to a normal level and the handle stood out at a ninetydegree angle too high for lisa trammel to grasp the answer ladies and gentlemen is that he wasnt looking up because lisa trammel didnt do this lisa trammel was driving home with her coffee while someone else carried out the plan to eliminate the threat that mitchell bondurant had become another pause to let it sink in mitchell bondurant had poked the sleeping tiger with his letter to louis opparizio whether intended or not the letter was a threat to the two things that give the tiger its strength and fierceness money and power it threatened a deal that was bigger than louis opparizio and mitchell bondurant it threatened commerce and therefore it had to be dealt with and it was lisa trammel was chosen as the fall guy she was known to the perpetrators of this crime her movements had been monitored by them and she came with what appeared to be a credible motive she was the perfect patsy no one would believe her when she said i didnt do this no one would give it a second thought a plan was set in motion and carried out brazenly and efficiently mitchell bondurant was left dead on the concrete floor of a garage his briefcase pilfered on the floor right next to him and the police showed up and went right along for the ride i shook my head in dismay as though i carried the disgust of all society the police had blinders on like those blinders put on horses so they stay on track the police were on a track that led to lisa trammel and they would look at nothing else lisa trammel lisa trammel lisa trammel well what about aloft and the tens of millions of dollars that mitchell bondurant was threatening nope not interested lisa trammel lisa trammel lisa trammel the train was on the track and they rode it home i paused and paced in front of the jury for the first time i looked about the courtroom it was filled to capacity with even some people standing in the back i saw maggie mcpherson standing back there and next to her was my daughter i froze in midstep but then quickly recovered it made my heart feel good as i turned to the jury and brought my case to an end but you see what they didnt see or refused to see you see that they got on the wrong track you see that they were cleverly manipulated you see the truth i gestured to the mannequin the physical evidence doesnt work the circumstantial evidence doesnt work the case doesnt bear scrutiny in the light of day the only thing this case adds up to is reasonable doubt common sense tells you this your instincts tell you this i urge you to set lisa trammel free let her go it is the right thing to do i said thank you and returned to my seat patting manny on the shoulder as i passed as we had previously planned lisa trammel grabbed and squeezed my arm once i sat down she mouthed the words thank you for all on the jury to see i checked my watch under the defense table and saw i had taken only twentyfive minutes i started to settle in for the second part of the states closer when freeman asked the judge to have me remove the mannequin from the courtroom the judge told me to do so and i got back up i carried the mannequin to the gate where i was met by cisco who had been in the audience i got it boss he whispered ill take him outside thanks you did good thanks freeman moved to the well to deliver the second part of her summation she wasted no time in attacking the contentions of the defense i dont need any props to try to mislead you i dont need any conspiracies or unnamed or unknown killers i have the facts and the evidence that prove well beyond any reasonable doubt that lisa trammel murdered mitchell bondurant and it went from there freeman used her entire allotment of time hammering the defense case while bolstering the evidence the state had shown it was a fairly routine joe friday closing just the facts or the supposed facts delivered like a steady drumbeat not bad but not all that good either i saw the attention of some of the jurors wandering through parts of it which could be taken two ways one they werent buying it or two they had already bought it and didnt need to hear it again freeman steadily amped it up until her big finish a standard summing of the power and might of the state to cast judgment and exact justice the facts of this case are unalterable the facts do not lie the evidence clearly shows that the defendant waited behind the pillar in the garage for mitchell bondurant the evidence clearly shows that when he stepped out of his car the defendant attacked it was his blood on her hammer and his blood on her shoe these are facts ladies and gentlemen these are undisputed facts these are the building blocks of evidence evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that lisa trammel killed mitchell bondurant that she came up behind him and brutally struck him with her hammer that she even hit him again and again after he was down and dead we dont know exactly what position he was in or she was in she is the only one who knows that but we do know that she did it the evidence in this case points to one person and of course freeman had to point the finger at my client her lisa trammel she did it and now through the tricks of her attorney she asks you to let her go dont do it give mitchell bondurant justice find his killer guilty of this crime thank you freeman took her seat i gave her closing a b but i had already awarded myself an aegotist that i am still usually all it took was a c for the prosecution to triumph its always a stacked deck for the state and often the defense attorneys very best work is simply not good enough to overcome the power and the might judge perry moved directly into the jury charge reading his final instructions to them these were not only the rules of deliberations but also instructions specific to the case he gave great attention to louis opparizio and warned again that his testimony was not to be considered during the deliberations the charge ended up being nearly as long as my closing but finally just after three the judge sent the twelve jurors back to the assembly room to begin their task as i watched them file through the door i was at least relaxed if not confident i had put the best case forward that i could i had certainly bent some rules and pushed some boundaries i had even put myself at risk at risk based on the law but also something more dangerous i had risked myself by believing in the possibility of my clients innocence i looked over at lisa as the door to the deliberations room closed i saw no fear in her eyes and once again i bought in she was already sure of the verdict there wasnt a doubt on her face what do you think aronson whispered to me i think weve got a fiftyfifty shot at this and thats better than we usually get especially on a murder well see the judge recessed court after making sure the clerk had contact numbers for all parties and urging us to stay somewhere no more than fifteen minutes away should a verdict come in my office was in that range so we decided to head back there feeling optimistic and magnanimous i even told lisa she could invite herb dahl along i felt it would be my obligation to eventually inform her of her guardian angels treachery but that conversation would be saved for another day as the defense party walked out into the hallway the media started to gather around us clamoring for a statement from lisa or at least me behind the crowd i saw maggie leaning against a wall my daughter sitting on a bench next to her while texting away on her phone i told aronson to handle the reporters and i started to slip away me aronson said you know what to say just dont let lisa talk not till we have a verdict i waved off a couple of trailing reporters and got to maggie and hayley i made a quick feint one way and then went the other kissing my daughter on the cheek before she could duck daaaaddd i straightened up and looked at maggie she had a small smile on her face you pulled her out of school for me i thought she should be here it was a major concession thank you i said so what did you think i think you could sell ice in antarctica she said i smiled but that doesnt mean youre going to win she added i frowned thanks a lot well what do you want from me im a prosecutor i dont like to see the guilty go free well that wont be a problem in this case i guess you have to believe what you have to believe i was back to smiling i checked my daughter and saw she was back to texting oblivious to our conversation as usual did freeman talk to you yesterday you mean about you pulling the fifth witness move yes you dont play fair haller its not a fair game did she tell you what she said to me after no what did she say never mind she was wrong she knitted her eyebrows she was intrigued ill tell you later i said were all going to walk over to my office to wait you two want to come no i think i need to get hayley home shes got homework my phone buzzed in my pocket i pulled it and took a look the screen said la superior court i took the call it was judge perrys clerk i listened and then hung up i looked around to make sure lisa trammel was still nearby what is it maggie asked i looked back at her we already have a verdict a fiveminute verdict part fivethe hypocrisy of innocence fiftythree they came in droves pouring in from all over southern california all brought by the siren song of facebook lisa trammel had announced the party the morning after the verdict and now on saturday afternoon they were ten deep at the cash bars they waved the stars and stripes and wore red white and blue fighting foreclosure with the nearly martyred leader of the cause was now more american than ever before at every door to the house and spaced at intervals in the front and back yards were tengallon buckets for donations to defray trammels expenses and keep the fight going flag pins for a buck cheap cotton tshirts for ten and posing with lisa for a photo required a minimum twentydollar donation but nobody complained fired in the kiln of false accusation lisa trammel had emerged unscathed and appeared to be about to make the jump from activist to icon and she wasnt unhappy about it the rumor was that julia roberts was in talks to play the part in the movie my crew and i were stationed in the backyard at a picnic table with an umbrella we had come early and gotten the spot cisco and lorna were drinking canned beer and aronson and i were on bottled water there was a slight tension at the table and i picked up enough innuendo to understand that it had something to do with how late cisco had stayed at four green fields with aronson back on monday night after id left with maggie mcfierce jeez look at all of these people lorna said dont they know that a notguilty verdict doesnt mean shes innocent thats bad etiquette lorna i said youre never supposed to say that especially when its your own client youre talking about i know she frowned and shook her head youre not a believer lorna well dont tell me you are i was glad i was wearing sunglasses i didnt want to reveal myself on this one i shrugged like i didnt know or it didnt matter but it did you have to live with yourself knowing that there was a solid chance that lisa trammel actually deserved the verdict she got made things a whole lot better when i looked in the mirror well ill tell you one thing lorna said our phone hasnt stopped ringing since the verdict came in were back in business big time cisco nodded approvingly it was true it seemed as though every accused criminal in the city wanted to hire me now this wouldve been great if i had wanted things to continue the way they were going did you check out the closing price on lemure yesterday on nasdaq cisco asked i gave him a look you following the street now just wanted to see if anybody was paying attention and it looks like they were lemure dropped thirty percent of its value in two days didnt help that the wall street journal ran a story connecting opparizio to joey giordano and questioning how much of that sixtyone mill he got went into the mobs pocket probably all of it lorna said so mickey aronson said howd you know know what that opparizio would take the nickel i shrugged again i didnt i just figured that once it became apparent that his connections were going to come out in open court he would do what he had to do to stop it he had one choice the fifth aronson didnt look as though my answer appeased her i turned away and looked across the crowded yard my clients son was at a nearby table with her sister they both looked bored as if forced to be there a large group of children had gathered near the terraced herb garden a woman in the middle of the circle was handing out candy from a bag she was wearing a red white and blue top hat like uncle sams how long do we need to stay boss cisco asked youre not on the clock i said i just thought we should put in an appearance i want to stay lorna said probably just to spite him maybe some hollywood people will show up a few minutes later the main attraction of the day came out the back door followed by a reporter and a cameraman they picked a location with the crowd in the background and lisa trammel stood for a quick interview i didnt bother to try to listen id heard and seen the same interview enough over the past two days after lisa finished the interview she broke away from the media shook some hands and posed for some photos eventually she made her way to our table stopping to ruffle her sons hair on the way there they are the victors hows my team doing today i managed to smile were good lisa and you look fine too wheres herb she looked around as if searching for dahl in the crowd i dont know he was supposed to be here too bad cisco said well miss him lisa didnt seem to register the sarcasm you know i need to talk to you later mickey she said i need your advice on which show to do good morning america or today they both want me next week but i have to pick one because neither will take seconds i flipped my hand as if the answer didnt matter i dont know herb can probably help you with that hes the media guy lisa looked back at the gathering of children and started to smile oh i have just the thing for those children excuse me everybody she hurried off and went around the corner of the house shes sure loving it isnt she cisco said i would be too lorna said i looked at aronson why so quiet she shrugged i dont know im not so sure i like criminal defense anymore i think if you take on some of those people who have been calling ill stick with the foreclosures if you dont mind i nodded i think i know what youre feeling you can do the foreclosure work if you want to theres going to be plenty of that for a while especially with guys like opparizio still in business but that feeling youve got does go away believe me bullocks it does she didnt respond to the return of her nickname or anything else i had said i turned to look across the yard lisa was back and she had rolled out the helium tank from the garage she told the children to gather around and started filling balloons the tv cameraman moved in to get the shot it would be perfect for the six oclock news now is she doing that for the kids or for the camera cisco asked you really have to ask lorna responded lisa pulled a blue balloon off the tank and expertly tied it off with a string she handed it to a girl of about six who grabbed the string and let the balloon shoot six feet above her head the girl smiled and turned her face up to gaze at her new toy and in that moment i knew what mitchell bondurant was looking up at when lisa hit him with the hammer she did it i whispered under my breath i felt the burn of a million synapses firing down my neck and across my shoulders what did you say aronson asked me i looked at her but didnt answer and then looked back at my client she filled another balloon with gas tied the knot and handed it to a boy the same thing happened again the boy held the string and turned his cheery face up to look at the red balloon an instinctive natural response to look up at the balloon oh my god aronson said she had put it together too thats how she did it now cisco and lorna had turned the witness said she was carrying a big shopping bag on the sidewalk aronson said big enough to hold a hammer yes but also big enough to hold balloons i took it from there she sneaks into the garage and puts the balloons up over bondurants parking space maybe theres a note on the end of each string so hes sure to see them yeah cisco said like heres your balloon payment she hides behind the pillar and waits i said and when bondurant looks up at the balloons cisco concluded bang right on the back of the head i nodded and the two pops somebody thought were gunshots but were dismissed as backfire were neither i said she popped the balloons on the way out a dreadful silence fell over the table until lorna spoke wait a minute youre saying she planned it that way like she knew if she hit him on the top of the head it would throw the jury i shook my head no that was just luck she just wanted to stop him she used the balloons to make sure he paused and she could come up behind him the rest was just dumb luck something that a defense lawyer knew how to use i couldnt look at my colleagues i stared off at lisa filling balloons so we helped her get away with it it was a statement from lorna not a question double jeopardy aronson said she can never be tried again as if on cue lisa looked over at us while she tied off the end of a white balloon she handed it to another child and she smiled at me cisco how much are they charging for the beer five bucks a can its a ripoff mickey dont lorna said its not worth it youve been so good i pulled my eyes away from my client and looked at lorna good are you saying im one of the good guys i got up and left them there and headed toward the backyard bar where i took my place in line i expected lorna to follow me but it was aronson who came up next to me she spoke in a very low voice look what are you doing you told me not to grow a conscience are you telling me you did i dont know i whispered all i know is that she played me like a fucking fiddle and you know what she knows i know she just gave me that smile i saw it in her eyes shes proud of it she pulled the tank into the yard so i would see it and i would know i shook my head she had me wired from day one everything was part of her plan every last i stopped as i realized something what aronson asked i paused as i continued to put it together what mickey her husband wasnt even her husband what do you mean the guy calling me the guy who showed up where is he now for the big payday hes not here because that wasnt him he was just part of the play then where is the husband that was the question but i had no answer i didnt have any answers anymore im leaving i stepped out of the line and headed toward the back door mickey where are you going i didnt answer i quickly passed through the house and out the front door i had arrived early enough to grab a curb slot only two houses down i was almost to the lincoln when i heard my name called from behind it was lisa she was walking toward me in the street mickey youre leaving yes im leaving why the partys just starting she came up close to me and stopped im leaving because i know lisa i know what do you think you know that you used me like you use everybody even herb dahl oh come on youre a defense lawyer youll get more business out of this than youve ever had before just like that she acknowledged everything what if i didnt want the business what if i just wanted to believe something was true she paused she didnt get it get over yourself mickey wake up i nodded it was good advice who was he lisa i asked who was who the guy you sent me who said he was your husband now a small proud smile curled her bottom lip goodbye mickey thank you for everything she turned and started walking back toward her house and i got in my lincoln and drove away fiftyfour i was in the backseat of the lincoln cruising through the third street tunnel when my phone started to buzz the screen said it was maggie i told rojas to kill the musicit was judgement day off the latest eric clapton albumand took the call did you do it she asked first thing i looked out the window as we broke clear of the tunnel and into the bright sunlight it fit with the way i was feeling it had been three weeks since the verdict and the further i got away from it the better i felt i was on the road to something else now i did wow congratulations im still the longest long shot youll ever see the field is full and ive got no money doesnt matter youre a name in this town and theres a certain integrity about you that people see and respond to i know i did plus youre an outsider outsiders always win so dont kid yourself the money will come i wasnt sure integrity and me belonged in the same sentence but id take the rest and besides it was the happiest id heard maggie mcfierce in a long long time well well see i said but as long as i have your vote i dont care if i get another thats sweet haller whats next good question i have to go open a bank account and assemble a my phone started beeping i had another call coming in i checked the screen and saw that it was blocked mags hold on a second let me just check this call go ahead i switched over this is michael haller you did this i recognized the angry voice lisa trammel did what the police are here theyre digging up the garden looking for him you sent them i assumed the him she referred to was her missing husband who never quite made it to mexico her voice had the familiar shrill tone it took on when she was on the edge of losing it lisa i i need you here i need a lawyer theyre going to arrest me meaning that she knew what the police would find in the garden lisa im not your lawyer anymore i can recommend a nooooo you cant abandon me not now lisa you just accused me of sending the cops now you want me to represent you i need you mickey please she started crying that long echoing sob i had heard too many times before get somebody else lisa im done with any luck i might even get to prosecute you what are you talking about i just filed im running for district attorney i dont understand im changing my life im tired of being around people like you there was no response at first but i could hear her breathing when she finally spoke her voice had a flat emotionless tone to it i should have told herb to have them maim you thats what you deserve now i was silent i knew what she was talking about the mack brothers dahl had lied to me and said opparizio had ordered the beating but that didnt fit with the rest of the story this did it had been lisa who wanted it done she was willing to have her own attorney attacked if it would deflect suspicion and help her case if it would help me believe in other possibilities i managed to find my voice and say my final words to her goodbye lisa and good luck i composed myself and switched back over to my exwife sorry it was a client a former client everything all right i leaned against the window rojas was just turning on alvarado and heading to the im good so you want to go somewhere tonight and talk about the campaign you know while i was on hold i was thinking why dont you come to my place we can eat with hayley and then talk while she does her homework it was a rare invite to her home so a guy has to run for da to get invited over to your place dont press your luck haller i wont what time six see you then i disconnected and stared out the window for a little while mr haller rojas asked youre running for da yeah you have a problem with that rojas no boss but do you still need a driver sure rojas your job is safe i called the office and lorna answered where is everybody theyre here jennifer is using your office for a new
