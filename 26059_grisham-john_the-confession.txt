john grisham the confession chapter the custodian at st marks had just scraped three inches of snow off the sidewalks when the man with the cane appeared the sun was up but the winds were howling the temperature was stuck at the freezing mark the man wore only a pair of thin dungarees a summer shirt wellworn hiking boots and a light windbreaker that stood little chance against the chill but he did not appear to be uncomfortable nor was he in a hurry he was on foot walking with a limp and a slight tilt to his left the side aided by the cane he shuffled along the sidewalk near the chapel and stopped at a side door with the word office painted in dark red he did not knock and the door was not locked he stepped inside just as another gust of wind hit him in the back the room was a reception area with the cluttered dusty look one would expect to find in an old church in the center was a desk with a nameplate that announced the presence of charlotte junger who sat not far behind her name she said with a smile good morning good morning the man said a pause its very cold out there it is indeed she said as she quickly sized him up the obvious problem was that he had no coat and nothing on his hands or head i assume youre ms junger he said staring at her name no ms junger is out today the flu im dana schroeder the ministers wife just filling in what can we do for you there was one empty chair and the man looked hopefully at it may i of course she said he carefully sat down as if all movements needed forethought is the minister in he asked as he looked at a large closed door off to the left yes but hes in a meeting what can we do for you she was petite with a nice chest tight sweater he couldnt see anything below the waist under the desk he had always preferred the smaller ones cute face big blue eyes high cheekbones a wholesome pretty girl the perfect little ministers wife it had been so long since hed touched a woman i need to see reverend schroeder he said as he folded his hands together prayerfully i was in church yesterday listened to his sermon and well i need some guidance hes very busy today she said with a smile really nice teeth im in a rather urgent situation he said dana had been married to keith schroeder long enough to know that no one had ever been sent away from his office appointment or not besides it was a frigid monday morning and keith wasnt really that busy a few phone calls one consultation with a young couple in the process of retreating from a wedding under way at that very moment then the usual visits to the hospitals she fussed around the desk found the simple questionnaire she was looking for and said okay ill take some basic information and well see what can be done her pen was ready thank you he said bowing slightly name travis boyette he instinctively spelled his last name for her date of birth october place joplin missouri age fortyfour single divorced no children no address no place of employment no prospects dana absorbed this as her pen frantically searched for the proper blanks to be filled his response created far more questions than her little form was designed to accommodate okay about the address she said still writing where are you staying these days these days im the property of the kansas department of corrections im assigned to a halfway house on seventeenth street a few blocks from here im in the process of being released reentry as they like to call it a few months in the halfway house here in topeka then im a free man with nothing to look forward to but parole for the rest of my life the pen stopped moving but dana stared at it anyway her interest in the inquiry had suddenly lost steam she was hesitant to ask anything more however since she had started the interrogation she felt compelled to press on what else were they supposed to do while they waited on the minister would you like some coffee she asked certain that the question was harmless there was a pause much too long as if he couldnt decide yes thanks just black with a little sugar dana scurried from the room and went to find coffee he watched her leave watched everything about her noticed the nice round backside under the everyday slacks the slender legs the athletic shoulders even the ponytail five feet three maybe four pounds max she took her time and when she returned travis boyette was right where shed left him still sitting monklike the fingertips of his right hand gently tapping those of his left his black wooden cane across his thighs his eyes gazing forlornly at nothing on the far wall his head was completely shaved small and perfectly round and shiny and as she handed him the cup she pondered the frivolous question of whether hed gone bald at an early age or simply preferred the skinned look there was a sinister tattoo creeping up the left side of his neck he took the coffee and thanked her for it she resumed her position with the desk between them are you lutheran she asked again with the pen i doubt it im nothing really never saw the need for church but you were here yesterday why boyette held the cup with both hands at his chin like a mouse nibbling on a morsel if a simple question about coffee took a full ten seconds then one about church attendance might require an hour he sipped licked his lips how long do you think itll be before i can see the reverend he finally asked not soon enough dana thought anxious now to pass this one along to her husband she glanced at a clock on the wall and said any minute now would it be possible just to sit here in silence as we wait he asked with complete politeness dana absorbed the stiffarm and quickly decided that silence wasnt a bad idea then her curiosity returned sure but one last question she was looking at the questionnaire as if it required one last question how long were you in prison she asked half my life boyette said with no hesitation as if he fielded that one five times a day dana scribbled something and then the desktop keyboard caught her attention she pecked away with a flourish as if suddenly facing a deadline her email to keith read theres a convicted felon out here who says he must see you not leaving until seems nice enough having coffee lets wrap things up back there five minutes later the pastors door opened and a young woman escaped through it she was wiping her eyes she was followed by her exfiance who managed both a frown and a smile at the same time neither spoke to dana neither noticed travis boyette they disappeared when the door slammed shut dana said to boyette just a minute she hustled into her husbands office for a quick briefing the reverend keith schroeder was thirtyfive years old happily married to dana for ten years now the father of three boys all born separately within the span of twenty months hed been the senior pastor at st marks for two years before that at a church in kansas city his father was a retired lutheran minister and keith had never dreamed of being anything else he was raised in a small town near st louis educated in schools not far from there and except for a class trip to new york and a honeymoon in florida had never left the midwest he was generally admired by his congregation though there had been issues the biggest row occurred when he opened up the churchs basement to shelter some homeless folks during a blizzard the previous winter after the snow melted some of the homeless were reluctant to leave the city issued a citation for unauthorized use and there was a slightly embarrassing story in the newspaper the topic of his sermon the day before had been forgivenessgods infinite and overwhelming power to forgive our sins regardless of how heinous they might be travis boyettes sins were atrocious unbelievable horrific his crimes against humanity would surely condemn him to eternal suffering and death at this point in his miserable life travis was convinced he could never be forgiven but he was curious weve had several men from the halfway house keith was saying ive even held services there they were in a corner of his office away from the desk two new friends having a chat in saggy canvas chairs nearby fake logs burned in a fake fireplace not a bad place boyette said sure beats prison he was a frail man with the pale skin of one confined to unlit places his bony knees were touching and the black cane rested across them and where was prison keith held a mug of steaming tea here and there last six years at lansing and you were convicted of what he asked anxious to know about the crimes so he would know much more about the man violence drugs probably on the other hand maybe travis here was an embezzler or a tax cheat he certainly didnt seem to be the type to hurt anyone lot of bad stuff pastor i cant remember it all he preferred to avoid eye contact the rug below them kept his attention keith sipped his tea watched the man carefully and then noticed the tic every few seconds his entire head dipped slightly to his left it was a quick nod followed by a more radical corrective jerk back into position after a period of absolute quiet keith said what would you like to talk about travis i have a brain tumor pastor malignant deadly basically untreatable if i had some money i could fight itradiation chemo the usual routinewhich might give me ten months maybe a year but its glioblastoma grade four and that means im a dead man half a year a whole year it really doesnt matter ill be gone in a few months as if on cue the tumor said hello boyette grimaced and leaned forward and began massaging his temples his breathing was heavy labored and his entire body seemed to ache im very sorry keith said realizing full well how inadequate he sounded damned headaches boyette said his eyes still tightly closed he fought the pain for a few minutes as nothing was said keith watched helplessly biting his tongue to keep from saying something stupid like can i get you some tylenol then the suffering eased and boyette relaxed sorry he said when was this diagnosed keith asked i dont know a month ago the headaches started at lansing back in the summer you can imagine the quality of health care there so i got no help once i was released and sent here they took me to st francis hospital ran tests did the scans found a nice little egg in the middle of my head right between the ears too deep for surgery he took a deep breath exhaled and managed his first smile there was a tooth missing on the upper left side and the gap was prominent keith suspected the dental care in prison left something to be desired i suppose youve seen people like me before boyette said people facing death from time to time it goes with the territory and i suppose these folks tend to get real serious about god and heaven and hell and all that stuff they do indeed its human nature when faced with our own mortality we think about the afterlife what about you travis do you believe in god some days i do some days i dont but even when i do im still pretty skeptical its easy for you to believe in god because youve had an easy life different story for me you want to tell me your story not really then why are you here travis the tic when his head was still again his eyes looked around the room then settled on those of the pastor they stared at each other for a long time neither blinking finally boyette said pastor ive done some bad things hurt some innocent people im not sure i want to take all of it to my grave now were getting somewhere keith thought the burden of unconfessed sin the shame of buried guilt it would be helpful if you told me about these bad things confession is the best place to start and this is confidential for the most part yes but there are exceptions what exceptions if you confide in me and i believe youre a danger to yourself or to someone else then the confidentiality is waived i can take reasonable steps to protect you or the other person in other words i can go get help sounds complicated not really look pastor ive done some terrible things but this one has nagged at me for many years now i gotta talk to someone and i got no place else to go if i told you about a terrible crime that i committed years ago you cant tell anyone dana went straight to the web site for the kansas department of corrections and within seconds plunged into the wretched life of travis dale boyette sentenced in to ten years for attempted sexual assault current status incarcerated current status is in my husbands office she mumbled as she continued hitting keys sentenced in to twelve years for aggravated sexual battery in oklahoma paroled in sentenced in to eight years for attempted sexual battery in missouri paroled in sentenced in to twenty years for aggravated sexual battery in arkansas paroled in boyette was a registered sex offender in kansas missouri arkansas and oklahoma a monster she said to herself his file photo was that of a much heavier and much younger man with dark thinning hair she quickly summarized his record and sent an email to keiths desktop she wasnt worried about her husbands safety but she wanted this creep out of the building after half an hour of strained conversation and little progress keith was beginning to tire of the meeting boyette showed no interest in god and since god was keiths area of expertise there seemed little for him to do he wasnt a brain surgeon he had no jobs to offer a message arrived on his computer its appearance made known by the distant sound of an oldfashioned doorbell two chimes meant anyone might be checking in but three chimes signaled a message from the front desk he pretended to ignore it whats with the cane he asked pleasantly prisons a rough place boyette said got in one fight too many a head injury probably led to the tumor he thought that was funny and laughed at his own humor keith obliged with a chuckle of his own then stood walked to his desk and said well let me give you one of my cards feel free to call anytime youre always welcome here travis he picked up a card and glanced at his monitor four count em four convictions all related to sexual assault he walked back to the chair handed travis a card and sat down prisons especially rough for rapists isnt it travis keith said you move to a new town youre required to hustle down to the police station or the courthouse and register as a sex offender after twenty years of this you just assume that everybody knows everybodys watching boyette did not seem surprised very rough he agreed i cant remember the times ive been attacked travis look im not keen on discussing this subject i have some appointments if youd like to visit again fine just call ahead and i welcome you back to our services this sunday keith wasnt sure he meant that but he sounded sincere from a pocket of his windbreaker boyette removed a folded sheet of paper you ever hear of the case of donte drumm he asked as he handed the paper to keith no black kid small town in east texas convicted of murder in said he killed a high school cheerleader white girl bodys never been found keith unfolded the sheet of paper it was a copy of a brief article in the topeka newspaper dated sunday the day before keith read it quickly and looked at the mug shot of donte drumm there was nothing remarkable about the story just another routine execution in texas involving another defendant claiming to be innocent the execution is set for this thursday keith said looking up ill tell you something pastor they got the wrong guy that kid had nothing to do with her murder and how do you know this theres no evidence not one piece of evidence the cops decided he did it beat a confession out of him and now theyre going to kill him its wrong pastor so wrong how do you know so much boyette leaned in closer as if he might whisper something hed never uttered before keiths pulse was increasing by the second no words came though another long pause as the two men stared at each other it says the body was never found keith said make him talk right they concocted this wild tale about the boy grabbing the girl raping her choking her and then throwing her body off a bridge into the red river total fabrication so you know where the body is boyette sat straight up and crossed his arms over his chest he began to nod the tic then another tic they happened quicker when he was under pressure did you kill her travis keith asked stunned by his own question not five minutes earlier he was making a mental list of all the church members he needed to visit in the hospitals he was thinking of ways to ease travis out of the building now they were dancing around a murder and a hidden body i dont know what to do boyette said as another wave of pain hit hard he bent over as if to throw up and then began pressing both palms against his head im dying okay ill be dead in a few months why should that kid have to die too he didnt do anything his eyes were wet his face contorted keith watched him as he trembled he handed him a kleenex and watched as travis wiped his face the tumor is growing he said each day it puts more pressure on the skull do you have medications some they dont work i need to go i dont think were finished yes we are wheres the body travis you dont want to know yes i do maybe we can stop the execution boyette laughed oh really fat chance in texas he slowly stood and tapped his cane on the rug thank you pastor keith did not stand instead he watched boyette shuffle quickly out of his office dana was staring at the door refusing a smile she managed a weak goodbye after he said thanks then he was gone back on the street without a coat and gloves and she really didnt care her husband hadnt moved he was still slouched in his chair dazed staring blankly at a wall and holding the copy of the newspaper article you all right she asked keith handed her the article and she read it im not connecting the dots here she said when she finished travis boyette knows where the body is buried he knows because he killed her did he admit he killed her almost he says he has an inoperable brain tumor and will be dead in a few months he says donte drumm had nothing to do with the murder he strongly implied that he knows where the body is dana fell onto the sofa and sank amid the pillows and throws and you believe him hes a career criminal dana a con man hed rather lie than tell the truth you cant believe a word he says do you believe him i think so how can you believe him why hes suffering dana and not just from the tumor he knows something about the murder and the body he knows a lot and hes genuinely disturbed by the fact that an innocent man is facing an execution for a man who spent much of his time listening to the delicate problems of others and offering advice and counsel that they relied on keith had become a wise and astute observer and he was seldom wrong dana was much quicker on the draw much more likely to criticize and judge and be wrong about it so what are you thinking pastor she asked lets take the next hour and do nothing but research lets verify a few things is he really on parole if so who is his parole officer is he being treated at st francis does he have a brain tumor if so is it terminal it will be impossible to get his medical records without his consent sure but lets see how much we can verify call dr herzlichwas he in church yesterday yes i thought so call him and fish around he should be making rounds this morning at st francis call the parole board and see how far you can dig and what might you be doing while im burning up the phones ill go online see what i can find about the murder the trial the defendant everything that happened down there they both stood in a hurry now dana said and what if its all true keith what if we convince ourselves that this creep is telling the truth then we have to do something such as i have no earthly idea chapter robbie flaks father purchased the old train station in downtown slone in while robbie was still in high school and just before the city was about to tear it down mr flak sr had made some money suing drilling companies and needed to spend a little of it he and his partners renovated the station and reestablished themselves there and for the next twenty years prospered nicely they certainly werent rich not by texas standards anyway but they were successful lawyers and the small firm was well regarded in town then along came robbie he began working at the firm when he was a teenager and it was soon evident to the other lawyers there that he was different he showed little interest in profits but was consumed with social injustice he urged his father to take on civilrights cases age and sexdiscrimination cases unfairhousing cases policebrutality cases the type of work that can get one ostracized in a small southern town brilliant and brash robbie finished college up north in three years and sailed through law school at the university of texas at austin he never interviewed for a job never thought about working anywhere but the train station in downtown slone there were so many people there he wanted to sue so many mistreated and downtrodden clients who needed him he and his father fought from day one the other lawyers either retired or moved on in at the age of thirtyfive robbie sued the city of tyler texas for housing discrimination the trial in tyler lasted for a month and at one point robbie was forced to hire bodyguards when the death threats became too credible when the jury returned a verdict for million robbie flak became a legend a wealthy man and an unrestrained radical lawyer now with the money to raise more hell than he could ever imagine to get out of his way his father retired to a golf course robbies first wife took a small cut and hurried back to st paul the flak law firm became the destination for those who considered themselves even remotely slighted by society the abused the accused the mistreated the injured they eventually sought out mr flak to screen the cases robbie hired young associates and paralegals by the boatload he picked through the net each day took the good catches and tossed the rest away the firm grew then it imploded it grew again then it broke up in another meltdown lawyers came and went he sued them they sued him the money evaporated then robbie won big in another case the lowest point of his colorful career happened when he caught his bookkeeper embezzling and beat him with a briefcase he escaped serious punishment by negotiating a thirtyday misdemeanor jail sentence it was a frontpage story and slone hung on every word robbie who not surprisingly craved publicity was bothered more by the bad press than by the incarceration the state bar association issued a public reprimand and a ninetyday suspension of his license it was his third entanglement with the ethics panel he vowed it would not be his last wife no eventually left with a nice check his life like his personality was chaotic outrageous and in constant conflict with itself and those around him but it was never dull behind his back he was often referred to as robbie flake and as his drinking grew worse robbie flask was born but regardless of the turmoil of the hangovers and crazy women and feuding partners and shaky finances and lost causes and scorn of those in power robbie flak arrived at the train station early each morning with a fierce determination to spend the day fighting for the little people and he did not always wait for them to find him if robbie got wind of an injustice he often jumped in his car and went searching for it this relentless zeal led him to the most notorious case of his career in slone was stunned by the most sensational crime in its history a seventeenyearold senior at slone high nicole yarber vanished and was never seen again dead or alive for two weeks the town stood still as thousands of volunteers combed the alleys and fields and ditches and abandoned buildings the search was futile nicole was a popular girl a b student a member of the usual clubs church on sunday at first baptist where she sometimes sang in the youth choir her most important achievement though was that of being a cheerleader at slone high by her senior year she had become the captain of the squad perhaps the most envied position in school at least for girls she was on and off with a boyfriend a football player with big dreams but limited talent the night she disappeared she had just spoken to her mother by cell and promised to be home before midnight it was a friday in early december football was over for the slone warriors and life had returned to normal her mother would later state and the phone records bore this out that she and nicole spoke by cell phone at least six times a day they also averaged four text messages they were in touch and the idea that nicole would simply run away without a word to her mom was inconceivable nicole had no history of emotional problems eating disorders erratic behavior psychiatric care or drug use she simply vanished no witnesses no explanations nothing prayer vigils in churches and schools ran nonstop a hotline was established and calls flooded in but none proved credible a web site was created to monitor the search and filter the gossip experts both real and fake came to town to give advice a psychic appeared unsolicited but left town when no one offered to pay as the search dragged on the gossip seethed nonstop as the town talked of little else a police car was parked in front of her home twentyfour hours a day ostensibly to make the family feel better slones only television station hired another rookie reporter to get to the bottom of things volunteers scoured the earth as the search spread throughout the countryside doors and windows were bolted fathers slept with their guns on their nightstands little children were watched closely by their parents and babysitters preachers reworked their sermons to beef up their slant against evil the police gave daily briefings for the first week but when they realized they had nothing to say they began skipping days they waited and waited hoping for the lead the unexpected phone call the snitch looking for the reward money they prayed for a break it finally came sixteen days after nicole disappeared at am the home phone of detective drew kerber rang twice before he grabbed it though exhausted he had not been sleeping well instinctively he flipped a switch to record what was about to be said the recording later played a thousand times ran kerber hello voice is this detective kerber kerber it is whos calling voice thats not important whats important is that i know who killed her kerber i need your name voice forget it kerber you wanna talk about the girl kerber go ahead voice she was seeing donte drumm a big secret she was trying to break it off but he wouldnt go away kerber whos donte drumm voice come on detective everybody knows drumm hes your killer he grabbed her outside the mall tossed her over the bridge on route shes at the bottom of the red river the line went dead the call was traced to a pay phone at an allnight convenience store in slone and there the trail ended detective kerber had heard the hushed rumors of nicole seeing a black football player but no one had been able to verify this her boyfriend adamantly denied it he claimed that they had dated on and off for a year and he was certain that nicole was not yet sexually active but like many rumors too salacious to leave alone it persisted it was so repulsive and so potentially explosive that kerber had thus far been unwilling to discuss it with nicoles parents kerber stared at the phone then removed the tape he drove to the slone police department made a pot of coffee and listened to the tape again he was elated and couldnt wait to share the news with his investigative team everything fit nowthe teenage love affair black on white still very much taboo in east texas the attempted breakup by nicole the bad reaction from her scorned lover it made perfect sense they had their man two days later donte drumm was arrested and charged with the abduction aggravated rape and murder of nicole yarber he confessed to the crime and admitted that hed tossed her body into the red river robbie flak and detective kerber had a history that had almost been violent they had clashed several times in criminal cases over the years kerber loathed the lawyer as much as he loathed the other lowlifes who represented criminals flak considered kerber an abusive thug a rogue cop a dangerous man with a badge and gun who would do anything to get a conviction in one memorable exchange in front of a jury flak caught kerber in an outright lie and to underscore the obvious yelled at the witness youre just a lying son of a bitch arent you kerber robbie was admonished held in contempt required to apologize to kerber and the jurors and fined but his client was found not guilty and nothing else mattered in the history of the chester county bar association no lawyer had ever been held in contempt as often as robbie flak it was a record he was quite proud of as soon as he heard the news about donte drumms arrest robbie made a few frantic phone calls then took off to the black section of slone a neighborhood he knew well he was accompanied by aaron rey a former gang member whod served time for drug distribution and was now gainfully employed by the flak law firm as a bodyguard runner driver investigator and anything else robbie might need rey carried at least two guns on his person and two more in a satchel all legal because mr flak had gotten his rights restored and now he could even vote around slone robbie flak had more than his share of enemies however all of these enemies knew about mr aaron rey drumms mother worked at the hospital and his father drove a truck for a lumber mill south of town they lived with their four children in a small whiteframed house with christmas lights around the windows and garland on the door their minister arrived not long after robbie they talked for hours the parents were confused devastated furious and frightened beyond reason they were also grateful that mr flak would come and see them they had no idea what to do i can get myself appointed to handle the case robbie said and they agreed nine years later he was still handling it robbie arrived at the station early on monday morning november he had worked on saturday and sunday and did not feel at all rested from the weekend his mood was gloomy even foul the next four days would be a chaotic mess a frenzy of events some anticipated and others wholly unexpected and when the dust settled at pm on thursday robbie knew that in all likelihood he would be standing in a cramped witness room at the huntsville prison holding hands with roberta drumm as the state of texas injected her son with enough chemicals to kill a horse hed been there once before he turned off the engine of his bmw but could not unfasten his seat belt his hands clutched the steering wheel as he looked through the windshield and saw nothing for nine years he had fought for donte drumm he had waged war as he had never done before he had fought like a madman at the ridiculous trial in which donte was convicted of the murder he had abused the appellate courts during his appeals he had danced around ethics and skirted the law he had written grating articles declaring his clients innocence he had paid experts to concoct novel theories that no one bought he had pestered the governor to the point that his calls were no longer returned not even by lowly staffers he had lobbied politicians innocence groups religious groups bar associations civilrights advocates the aclu amnesty international deathpenalty abolitionists anybody and everybody who might possibly be able to do something to save his client yet the clock had not stopped it was still ticking louder and louder in the process robbie flak had spent all his money burned every bridge alienated almost every friend and driven himself to the point of exhaustion and instability he had blown the trumpet for so long that no one heard it anymore to most observers he was just another loudmouthed lawyer screaming about his innocent client not exactly an unusual sight the case had pushed him over the edge and when it was over when the state of texas finally succeeded in executing donte robbie seriously doubted if he could go on he planned to move to sell his real estate retire tell slone and texas to kiss his ass and go live in the mountains somewhere probably in vermont where the summers are cool and the state does not kill people the lights came on in the conference room someone else was already there opening up the place preparing for the week from hell robbie finally left his car and went inside he spoke to carlos one of his longtime paralegals and they spent a few minutes over coffee the talk soon turned to football you watch the cowboys carlos asked no i couldnt i heard preston had a big day over two hundred yards three touchdowns im not a cowboys fan anymore me neither a month earlier rahmad preston had been right there in the conference room signing autographs and posing for photos rahmad had a distant cousin whod been executed in georgia ten years earlier and he had taken up the cause of donte drumm with big plans to enlist other cowboys and nfl heavyweights to help wave the flag he would meet with the governor the parole board big business boys politicians a couple of rappers he claimed to know well maybe even some hollywood types he would lead a parade so noisy that the state would be forced to back down rahmad though proved to be all talk he suddenly went silent went into seclusion according to his agent who also explained that the cause was too distracting for the great running back robbie always on the conspiracy trail suspected that the cowboys organization and its network of corporate sponsors somehow pressured rahmad by the entire firm had assembled in the conference room and robbie called the meeting to order at the moment he had no partnersthe last had left in a feud that was still tied up in litigationbut there were two associates two paralegals three secretaries and aaron rey who was always close by after fifteen years with robbie aaron knew more law than most seasoned paralegals also present was a lawyer from amnesty now a londonbased human rights group that had donated thousands of skilled hours to the drumm appeals participating by teleconference was a lawyer in austin an appellate advocate furnished by the texas capital defender group robbie ran through the plans for the week duties were defined tasks distributed responsibilities clarified he tried to appear upbeat hopeful confident that a miracle was on the way the miracle was slowly coming together some four hundred miles due north in topeka kansas chapter a few of the details were confirmed with little effort dana calling from st marks lutheran and just going about her business of following up on those kind enough to visit their church chatted with the supervisor at anchor house who said that boyette had been there for three weeks his stay was scheduled for ninety days and if all went well he would then be a free man subject of course to some rather stringent parole requirements the facility currently had twentytwo male residents no females and it was operated under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections boyette like the others was expected to leave each morning at and return each evening at in time for dinner employment was encouraged and the supervisor usually kept the men busy in janitorial work and odd parttime jobs boyette was working four hours a day at an hour watching security cameras in the basement of a government office building he was reliable and neat said little and had yet to cause trouble as a general rule the men were very well behaved because a broken rule or an ugly incident could send them back to prison they could see feel and smell freedom and they didnt want to screw up about the cane the supervisor knew little boyette was using it the day he arrived however among a group of bored criminals there is little privacy and an avalanche of gossip and the rumor was that boyette had been severely beaten in prison yes everybody knew he had a nasty record and they gave him plenty of room he was weird kept to himself and slept alone in a small room behind the kitchen while the rest bunked down in the main room but we get all types in here the supervisor said from murderers to pickpockets we dont ask too many questions fudging a bit or perhaps a lot dana breezily mentioned a medical concern that boyette noted on the visitors card hed been kind enough to fill out a prayer request there was no card and dana asked for forgiveness with a quick petition to the almighty she justified the small and harmless lie with what was at stake here yes the supervisor said theyd hauled him to the hospital when he wouldnt shut up about his headaches these guys love medical treatment at st francis they ran a bunch of tests but the supervisor knew nothing more boyette had some prescriptions but they were his business it was a medical matter and offlimits dana thanked him and reminded him that st marks welcomed everyone including the men from anchor house she then called dr herzlich who was a thoracic surgeon at st francis and a longtime member of st marks she had no plans to inquire into the medical status of travis boyette since such nosiness was far out of bounds and certain to go nowhere she would let her husband chat with the doctor with his door shut and in their veiled and professional voices they might find common ground the call went straight to voice mail and dana left a request for herzlich to phone her husband while she worked the phone keith was glued to his computer lost in the case of donte drumm the web site was extensive click here for a factual summary pages long click here for a complete trial transcript pages long click farther down for the appellate briefs with exhibits and affidavits another or so pages a case history ran for pages and included the rulings from the appeals courts there was a tab for the death penalty in texas and one for dontes photo gallery donte on death row the donte drumm defense fund how you can help press coverage and editorials wrongful convictions and false confessions and the last one was for robbie flak attorneyatlaw keith began with the factual summary it read the town of slone texas population forty thousand once cheered wildly when donte drumm roamed the field as a fearless linebacker but now it nervously awaits his execution donte drumm was born in marshall texas in the third child of roberta and riley drumm a fourth child arrived four years later not long after the family moved to slone where riley found a job with a drainage contractor the family joined the bethel african methodist church and are still active members donte was baptized in the church at the age of eight he attended the public schools in slone and by the age of twelve was being noticed as an athlete with good size and exceptional speed donte became a force on the football field and at the age of fourteen as a freshman was starting linebacker for the varsity at slone high school he was named allconference as a sophomore and junior and had verbally committed to play for north texas state before a severe ankle injury ended his career during the first quarter of the first game of his senior year surgery was successful but the damage was done the scholarship offer was withdrawn he did not finish high school because he was incarcerated his father riley died of heart disease in while donte was on death row when donte was fifteen years old he was arrested and charged with assault it was alleged that he and two black friends beat another black youth behind the gymnasium at the high school the case was handled through juvenile court donte eventually pleaded guilty and was given probation when he was sixteen he was arrested for simple possession of marijuana by then he was an allconference linebacker and wellknown in town the charges were later dismissed donte was nineteen years old when he was convicted in for the abduction rape and murder of a high school cheerleader named nicole yarber drumm and yarber were seniors at slone high school they were friends and had grown up together in slone though nicole or nikki as she was often called lived in the suburbs while donte lived in hazel park an older section of town that is primarily black middleclass slone is onethird black and while the schools are integrated the churches and civic clubs and neighborhoods are not nicole yarber was born in slone in the first and only child of reeva and cliff yarber who divorced when she was two years old reeva remarried and nicole was raised by her mother and stepfather wallis pike mr and mrs pike had two additional children aside from the divorce nicoles upbringing was typical and unremarkable she attended public elementary and middle schools and in enrolled as a freshman at slone high slone has only one high school aside from the usual church schools for kindergartners the town has no private schools nicole was a b student who seemed to frustrate her teachers with a noted lack of motivation she should have been an a student according to several summaries she was well liked popular very social with no record of bad behavior or trouble with the law she was an active member of the first baptist church of slone she enjoyed yoga waterskiing and country music she applied to two colleges baylor in waco and trinity in san antonio texas after the divorce her father cliff yarber left slone and moved to dallas where he made a fortune in strip malls as an absentee father he apparently tried to compensate through expensive gifts for her sixteenth birthday nicole received a bright red convertible bmw roadster undoubtedly the nicest car in the parking lot at slone high the gifts were a source of friction between the divorced parents the stepfather wallis pike ran a feed store and did well financially but he couldnt compete with cliff yarber in the year or so before her disappearance nicole dated a classmate by the name of joey gamble one of the more popular boys in school indeed in the tenth and eleventh grades nicole and joey were voted most popular and posed together for the school yearbook joey was one of three captains of the football team he later played briefly at a junior college he would become a key witness at the trial of donte drumm since her disappearance and since the subsequent trial there has been much speculation about the relationship between nicole yarber and donte drumm nothing definite has been learned or confirmed donte has always maintained that the two were nothing more than casual acquaintances just two kids whod grown up in the same town and were members of a graduating class of over five hundred he denied at trial under oath and he has denied ever since that he had a sexual relationship with nicole her friends have always believed this too skeptics however point out that donte would be foolish to admit an intimate relationship with a woman he was accused of murdering several of his friends allegedly said that the two had just begun an affair when she disappeared much speculation centers upon the actions of joey gamble gamble testified at trial that he saw a green ford van moving slowly and suspiciously through the parking lot where nicoles bmw was parked at the time she disappeared donte drumm often drove such a van one owned by his parents gambles testimony was attacked at trial and should have been discredited the theory is that gamble knew of nicoles affair with donte and as the odd man out he became so enraged that he helped the police frame their story against donte drumm three years after the trial a voice analysis expert hired by defense lawyers determined that the anonymous man who called detective kerber with the tip that donte was the killer was in fact joey gamble gamble vehemently denies this if it is true then gamble played a significant role in the arrest prosecution and conviction of donte drumm a voice jolted him from another world keith its dr herzlich dana said through the phones intercom keith said thanks and paused for a moment to clear his mind then he picked up the phone he began with the usual pleasantries but knowing the doctor was a busy man he quickly got down to business look dr herzlich i need a little favor and if its too sticky just say so we had a guest during the worship service yesterday a convict in the process of being paroled spending a few months at a halfway house and hes really a troubled soul he stopped by this morning just left actually and he claims to have some rather severe medical problems hes been seen at st francis whats the favor keith dr herzlich asked as if he were staring at his wristwatch if youre in a rush we can talk later no go ahead anyway he claims to have been diagnosed with a brain tumor a bad one glioblastoma says its fatal says hell be dead soon im wondering how much of this you can verify im not asking for confidential info you understand i know hes not your patient and i dont want anyone to violate procedures here thats not what im asking you know me better than that why do you doubt him why would anyone claim to have a brain tumor when he really doesnt hes a career criminal doctor a lifetime behind bars and all that probably not sure where the truth is and im not saying i doubt him he had two episodes of severe headaches in my office and they were painful to watch id just like to confirm what hes already said thats all a pause as if the doctor were looking around for eavesdroppers i cant pry too deep keith any idea who the doc is here no all right give me a name travis boyette got it give me a couple of hours thanks doctor keith hung up quickly and returned to texas he continued with the factual summary nicole disappeared on friday night december she had spent the evening with girlfriends at a cinema in the only mall in slone after the movie the girlsfour of themate pizza at a restaurant that was also in the mall entering the restaurant the girls chatted briefly with two boys one of whom was joey gamble over pizza the girls decided to meet at the home of ashley verica to watch latenight television as the four girls left the restaurant nicole excused herself to use the ladies room her three friends never saw her again she called her mother and promised to be home by midnight her curfew then she vanished an hour later her friends were concerned and were making calls two hours later her red bmw was found where shed left it in a parking lot at the mall it was locked there was no sign of a struggle no sign of anything wrong no sign of nicole her family and friends panicked and the search began the police immediately suspected foul play and organized a massive effort to find nicole thousands volunteered and through the days and weeks that followed the city and county were scoured as never before nothing was found surveillance cameras at the mall were too far away out of focus and of no benefit no one reported seeing nicole leave the mall and walk to her car cliff yarber offered a reward of for information and when this sum proved ineffective he raised it to the first break in the case came on december twelve days after her disappearance two brothers were fishing on a sandbar in the red river near a landing known as rush point when one of them stepped on a piece of plastic it was nicoles gym membership card they poked through the mud and sand and found another cardher student id issued by slone high one of the brothers recognized the name and they immediately drove to the police station in slone rush point is thirtyeight miles due north of the city limits the police investigators led by detective drew kerber made the decision to sit on the news about the gym membership and id cards they reasoned that the better strategy was to find the body first they conducted an exhaustive though futile search of the river for miles east and west of rush point the state police assisted with teams of divers nothing else was found authorities as far away as a hundred miles downriver were notified and asked to be on the alert while the search of the river was under way detective kerber received an anonymous tip implicating donte drumm he wasted little time two days later he and his partner detective jim morrissey approached donte as he was leaving a health club several hours later two other detectives approached a young man named torrey pickett a close friend of dontes pickett agreed to go to the police station and answer a few questions he knew nothing about the disappearance of nicole and was not concerned though he was nervous about going to the police station keith its the auditor line two dana announced through the intercom keith glanced at his watch amand shook his head the last voice he wanted to hear at the moment was that of the churchs auditor is the printer full of paper he asked i dont know she fired back ill check please load it up yes sir keith reluctantly hit line two and began a dull but not extended discussion of the churchs finances through october as he listened to the numbers he pecked away at his keyboard he printed the tenpage factual summary thirty pages of news articles and editorials a summary of the death penalty as practiced in texas dontes account of life on death row and when informed that the printer was out of paper he clicked on dontes photo gallery and looked at the faces donte as a child with parents two older brothers one younger sister donte as a small boy wearing a choir robe in church various poses of donte the linebacker a mug shot front page of the slone daily news donte being led in handcuffs into the courthouse more photos from the trial and the annual file photos from prison beginning in with a cocky glare at the camera and ending in with a thinfaced aging man of twentyseven when the auditor was done keith walked to the outer room and sat down across from his wife she was sorting through the copies hed printed scanning them as she went did you read this she asked waving a stack of papers read what there are hundreds of pages listen she said and began to read the body of nicole yarber has never been found and while this might thwart prosecutions in some jurisdictions it did not slow things in texas in fact texas is one of several states with a welldeveloped case law allowing prosecutions in murder cases where there is no definitive proof that a murder has indeed taken place a dead body is not always required no i did not get that far he said can you believe it im not sure what to believe the phone rang dana snatched it and abruptly informed the caller that the minister was unavailable when she hung up she said okay pastor whats the plan there is no plan the next step the only step i can think of right now is to have another talk with travis boyette if he admits he knows where the body is or was then ill press him to admit the murder and if he does what then i have no idea chapter the investigator trailed joey gamble for three days before he made contact gamble wasnt hiding nor was he hard to find he was an assistant manager at a mammoth auto parts discount warehouse in the houston suburb of mission bend his third job in the past four years he had one divorce under his belt and perhaps another on the way he and his second wife were not living together and had retreated to neutral corners where the lawyers were waiting there wasnt much to fight over at least not in assets there was one child a little boy with autism and neither parent truly wanted custody so they fought anyway the file on gamble was as old as the case itself and the investigator knew it by heart after high school the kid played one year of football at a junior college then dropped out he hung around slone for a few years working at various jobs and spending most of his spare time in the gym where he ate steroids and built himself into a hulking specimen he boasted of becoming a professional bodybuilder but eventually grew tired of the work he married a local girl divorced her moved to dallas and then drifted to houston according to the high school yearbook class of he planned to own a cattle ranch if the nfl thing didnt work out it did not nor did the ranch and joey was holding a clipboard and frowning at a display of windshield wipers when the investigator made his move the long aisle was empty it was almost noon a monday and the store was practically empty are you joey the investigator asked with a tight smile just under a thick mustache joey glanced down at the plastic name badge pinned above his shirt pocket thats me he tried to return the smile this was after all retail and the customer must be adored however this guy did not appear to be a customer my names fred pryor the right hand shot out like a boxing punch bound for the gut im a private investigator joey grabbed it almost in selfdefense and they shook hands for a few awkward seconds nice to meet you a pleasure joey said his radar at full alert mr pryor was about fifty years old thick in the chest with a round tough face topped with gray hair that required work each morning he wore a standard navy blazer tan polyester slacks that were straining at the waist and of course a pair of wellshined pointedtoe boots what kind of investigator joey asked im not a cop joey im a private investigator duly licensed by the state of texas you got a gun yep pryor flung open his blazer to reveal a millimeter glock strapped under his left armpit you wanna see the permit he asked no who are you working for donte drumms defense team the shoulders sagged a bit the eyes rolled the air escaped in one quick sigh of frustration as if to say not that again but pryor expected this and moved in quickly ill buy you lunch joey we cant talk here theres a mexican place around the corner meet me there give me thirty minutes okay thats all i ask you get lunch i get some face time then maybe youll never see me again the monday special was quesadillas all you can eat for the doctor told him to lose some weight but he craved mexican food especially the greasedup flashfried american version what do you want he asked pryor glanced around as if others were listening thirty minutes look joey im not a cop i have no authority no warrant no right to ask for anything but you know the history better than me pryor would later report to robbie flak that at that point the kid lost his edge stopped smiling and his eyes half closed in a look of submission and sadness it was as if he knew this day would eventually arrive at that moment pryor was certain they would catch a break joey glanced at his watch and said ill be there in twenty minutes order me one of their house margaritas you got it pryor thought that drinking at lunch could be problematic at least for joey but then the alcohol might help the house margarita was served in a clear bowlshaped pitcher of some sort and was enough of a beverage for several thirsty men as the minutes passed condensation formed on the glass and the ice began to melt pryor sipped iced tea with lemon and sent a message to flak meeting jg for lunch now later joey arrived on time and managed to squeeze his sizable frame into the booth he slid the glass over took the straw and inhaled an impressive quantity of the booze pryor made some small talk until the waiter took their orders and disappeared then he moved in closer and got to the point donte will be executed thursday did you know that joey nodded slowly affirmative i saw it in the paper plus i talked to my mother last night and she said the town is buzzing the mother was still in slone the father was working in oklahoma maybe separated an older brother was in slone a younger sister had moved to california were trying to stop the execution joey and we need your help whos we im working for robbie flak joey almost spit is that nut still around of course he is hell always be around hes represented donte from day one and im sure hell be in huntsville thursday night at the bitter end that is if we cant stop the execution the paper said the appeals have run out theres nothing left to do maybe but you never quit a mans life is at stake how can you quit another pull on the straw pryor hoped the guy was one of those passive drunks who take the booze and sort of melt into the furnishings as opposed to the hellraisers who knock back two drinks and try to clear out the bar joey smacked his lips and said i guess youre convinced hes innocent right i am always have been based on what based on the complete lack of physical evidence based on the fact that he had an alibi he was somewhere else based on the fact that his confession is as bogus as a threedollar bill based on the fact that hes passed at least four polygraph tests based on the fact that he has always denied any involvement and joey for purposes of this discussion based on the fact that your testimony at trial was completely unbelievable you didnt see a green van in the parking lot in the vicinity of nicoles car it was impossible you left the mall through the entrance to the cinema she was parked on the west side on the other side of the mall you fabricated the testimony to help the cops nail their suspect there was no eruption no anger he took it well much like a child caught redhanded with a stolen coin and unable to utter words keep going joey said you want to hear it im sure ive heard it before indeed you have you heard it at trial eight years ago mr flak explained it to the jury you were crazy about nicole but she wasnt crazy about you typical high school drama you dated off and on no sex a rather stormy relationship and at some point you suspected that she was seeing someone else turned out this was donte drumm which of course in slone and in a lot of other small towns could lead to real problems no one knew for sure but the gossip was out of control maybe she tried to break it off with him he denies this he denies everything then she disappeared and you saw the opportunity to nail the guy nail him you did you sent him to death row and now youre about to be responsible for killing him so im gettin all the blame here yes sir your testimony placed him at the scene of the crime or at least the jury thought so it was almost laughable because it was so inconsistent but the jury was anxious to believe you you didnt see a green van you lied you fabricated you also called detective kerber with the anonymous tip and the rest is history i did not call kerber of course you did we have the experts to prove it you didnt even try to disguise your voice according to our analysis you had been drinking but werent drunk there was a slight slur in a few of your words you want to see the report no it was never admitted in court thats because we didnt know about your phone call until after the trial and thats because the cops and prosecutors concealed it which should have led to a reversal which of course is pretty rare here in texas the waitress arrived with a platter of sizzling quesadillas all for joey pryor took his taco salad and asked for more tea after a few generous bites joey said so who killed her who knows theres no proof shes even dead they found her gym card and student id yeah but they didnt find her body she could be alive for all we know you dont believe that a gulp of the margarita to wash things down no i dont im sure shes dead right now it doesnt matter were racing against time here joey and we need your help what am i supposed to do recant recant recant sign an affidavit telling the truth tell us what you really saw that night which was nothing i saw a green van your friend didnt see a green van and he walked out of the mall with you you didnt mention anything to him in fact you didnt say anything to anybody for over two weeks then you heard the rumor that her gym card and student id had been found in the river thats when you put together your fiction joey thats when you decided to nail donte you were outraged because she would prefer a black guy to you you called kerber with the anonymous tip and all hell broke loose the cops were desperate and stupid and couldnt wait to pursue your fiction it worked perfectly they beat a confession out of him only took them fifteen hours and bingo its frontpage newsdonte drumm confesses then your memory works a miracle you suddenly remember that you saw a green van just like the drumms moving suspiciously around the mall that night what was it joey three weeks later when you finally told the cops about the van i saw a green van was it a ford joey or did you just decide it was a ford because thats what the drumms owned did you really see a black guy driving it or was that just your imagination to keep from responding joey stuffed half a quesadilla into his mouth and chewed slowly as he did so he watched the other diners unable or unwilling to make eye contact pryor took a bite then pressed on his thirty minutes would be gone soon enough look joey he said in a much softer tone we can argue the case for hours im not here to do that im here to talk about donte you guys were friends you grew up together you were teammates for what five years you spent hours together on the football field you won together you lost together hell you were cocaptains your senior year think of his family his mother and brothers and sister think of the town joey think how bad things will get if hes executed you gotta help us joey donte didnt kill anybody hes been railroaded from the beginning didnt realize i had this much power oh its a long shot appeals courts are not too impressed with witnesses who suddenly change their minds years after the trial and hours before the execution you give us the affidavit well run to court and scream as loud as possible but the odds are against us we gotta try though at this point well try anything joey stirred his drink with the straw then took a sip he rubbed his mouth with a paper napkin and said you know this is not the first time ive had this conversation mr flak called me years ago asked me to stop by his office this was long after the trial i think he was working on the appeals he begged me to change my story tell his version of the truth told him to go to hell i know ive been working on the case for a long time after demolishing half of the quesadillas joey suddenly lost interest in lunch he shoved the platter away and pulled the drink in front of him he stirred it slowly and watched the liquid spin around the glass things are a lot different now joey pryor said softly pressing its late in the fourth quarter the games almost over for donte the thick maroon fountain pen clipped inside pryors shirt pocket was in fact a microphone it was entirely visible and next to it was a real pen with ink and a ballpoint in case writing was required a tiny hidden wire ran from pryors shirt pocket to the left front pocket of his slacks where he kept his cell phone two hundred miles away robbie was listening he was in his office with the door locked alone on a speakerphone that also recorded everything you ever see him play football joey asked no pryor answered their voices were clear he was something he roamed the field like lawrence taylor fast fearless he could wreck an offense all by himself we won ten games when we were sophomores and juniors but we could never beat marshall why didnt the bigger schools recruit him pryor asked keep him talking robbie said to himself size he stopped growing in the tenth grade and he could never get his weight above thats not big enough for the longhorns you should see him now pryor said without missing a beat he weighs about gaunt and skinny shaves his head and hes locked up in a tiny cell twentythree hours a day i think hes lost his marbles he wrote me a couple of letters did you know that no robbie leaned closer to the speakerphone hed never heard this not long after he was sent away when i was still living in slone he wrote to me two maybe three letters long ones he went on about death row and how awful it isthe food the noise the heat the isolation and so on he swore he never touched nikki never got involved with her he swore he was nowhere near the mall when she disappeared he begged me to tell the truth to help him win his appeal and get out of prison i never wrote him back you still have the letters pryor asked joey shook his head no ive moved around so much the waitress appeared and removed the platter another margarita she asked but joey waved her off pryor leaned forward on his elbows until their faces were two feet apart he began you know joey ive worked on this case for years spent thousands of hours not only working but thinking trying to figure out what happened heres my theory you went nuts over nikki and why not she was cute as hell popular hot the kind of girl you want to put in your pocket and take home forever but she broke your heart and nothing is more painful for a seventeenyearold you were devastated crushed then she disappeared the entire town was shocked but you and those who loved her were especially horrified everyone wanted to find her everyone wanted to help how could she simply vanish who snatched her who could harm nikki maybe you believed donte was involved maybe not but you were a wreck emotionally and in that state you decided to get involved you called detective kerber with the anonymous tip and from there everything snowballed at that moment the investigation took a wrong turn and no one could stop it when you heard the news that hed confessed you figured youd done the right thing got the right guy then you decided that you wanted a little piece of the action you concocted the story about the green van and suddenly youre the star witness you became the hero to all those wonderful people who loved and adored nicole yarber you took the stand at the trial raised your right hand told something that was not the whole truth but it didnt matter you were there helping your beloved nikki donte was led away in shackles taken straight to death row maybe you understood that he would one day be executed maybe you didnt i suspect that way back then when you were still a teenager you could not appreciate the gravity of whats happening now he confessed yes and his confession is about as reliable as your testimony for many reasons people say things that arent true dont they joey there was a long gap in the conversation as both men considered what to say next in slone robbie waited patiently though he had never been known for his patience or quiet moments of selfreflection joey spoke next this affidavit what goes in it the truth you state under oath that your testimony at trial was not accurate and so on our office will prepare it we can have it done in less than an hour not so fast so i would say basically that i lied during the trial we can dress up the language but thats the gist of it wed also like to settle the matter about the anonymous tip and the affidavit would be filed in court and end up in the newspapers sure the press is following the case any lastminute motions and appeals will be reported so my mother will read in the newspaper that im now saying i lied at trial ill be admitting that im a liar that right yes but whats more important here joey your reputation or dontes life but you said its a long shot right so chances are ill admit to being a liar and he still gets the needle who wins that one he damn sure doesnt i dont think so look i gotta get back to work come on joey thanks for lunch nice meetin you and with that he slid out of the booth and hurried out of the restaurant pryor took a deep breath and stared at the table in disbelief they were talking about the affidavit then the conversation ended he slowly pulled out his cell phone and talked to his boss did you get all that yep every word robbie said anything we can use no nothing not even close really i didnt think so sorry robbie i thought at one point he was ready to snap you did all you could fred nice job hes got your card right yes call him after work say hello just remind him youre there and ready to talk ill try to meet him for a drink something tells me he tends to overindulge maybe i can get him drunk and hell say something just make sure its being recorded will do chapter on the third floor of st francis hospital mrs aurelia lindmar was recovering from gallbladder surgery and doing well keith spent twenty minutes with her ate two pieces of cheap stale chocolate mailed in by a niece and managed to make a graceful departure when a nurse popped in with a syringe on the fourth floor he huddled in the hallway with the soontobe widow of mr charles cooper a stalwart member of st marks whose bad heart was finally giving out there were three other patients keith needed to see but their conditions were stable and they would live until tomorrow when he would have more time on the second floor he tracked down dr herzlich who was eating a cold sandwich from a machine and reading a dense text as he sat alone in a small cafeteria have you had lunch kyle herzlich asked politely as he offered a chair to his minister keith sat down looked at the puny sandwichwhite bread with a thin slice of some brutally processed meat in the middleand said thanks i had a late breakfast fine look keith ive managed to snoop a bit got as far as i can go actually you do understand these things of course i do and i did not intend for you to pry into private matters never cant do it but ive asked around and well there are ways of gleaning some of the facts your man has been here at least twice in the past month lots of tests and the tumor thing checks out not a pretty prognosis thanks doctor keith was not surprised to learn that travis boyette was telling the truth at least about his brain tumor cant say any more than that the doctor managed to eat read and talk at the same time sure no problem whats his crime you dont want to know keith thought a nasty one career boy long record whys he hanging around st marks were open to the public doctor were supposed to serve all gods people even those with criminal records i suppose anything to worry about no hes harmless just hide the women and girls and perhaps the little boys too keith thanked him again and excused himself see you sunday the doctor said his eyes glued to a medical report anchor house was a square boxlike building of red brick and painted windows the type of structure that could be used for anything and probably had been since it was hastily constructed forty years earlier whoever built it had been pressed for time and saw no need for involving the architects at on monday evening keith entered from the sidewalk off seventeenth street and stopped at a makeshift front desk where an excon was monitoring things yes sir he said without a trace of warmth i need to see travis boyette keith said the monitor looked to his left to a large open room where a dozen or so men were sitting in various stages of relaxation and gazing at a very loud large television enthralled with wheel of fortune then he looked to his right to another large open room where a dozen or so men were either reading battered paperbacks or playing checkers and chess boyette was in a wicker rocker in a corner partially hidden behind a newspaper over there the man said nodding sign here keith signed in and walked to the corner when boyette saw him approach he grabbed his cane and scrambled to his feet didnt expect you he said obviously surprised i was in the neighborhood got a few minutes to talk the other men were taking casual note of keith the checkers and chess went on without interruption sure boyette said glancing around lets go to the mess hall keith followed him watching the left leg as it paused slightly with each step causing the shuffle the cane jabbed the floor as they clicked along how awful would it be keith asked himself to live each minute with a gradefour tumor between your ears growing and growing until your skull seems ready to crack as miserable a person as he was keith couldnt help but feel sorry for him a dead man the mess hall was a small room with four long folding tables and a wide opening at the far end that gave way to the kitchen the cleanup crew was making a racket back there slinging pots and pans and laughing rap music came from a radio it was the perfect cover for a hushed conversation we can talk here boyette said nodding at a table crumbs of food were scattered about the thick smell of cooking oil hung in the air they sat down across from each other since they had nothing in common but the weather keith decided not to waste time would you like some coffee boyette asked politely no thanks smart move worst coffee in kansas worse than prison travis after you left this morning i went online found the web site for donte drumm and spent the rest of the day lost in that world its fascinating and heartbreaking there are serious doubts about his guilt serious boyette said with a laugh there should be serious doubts the boy had nothing to do with what happened to nikki what happened to nikki a startled look like a deer in headlights silence boyette wrapped his hands around his head and massaged his scalp his shoulders began to shake the tic came and went and came back again keith watched him and could almost feel the agony the rap music thumped mindlessly from the kitchen keith slowly reached into his coat pocket and removed a folded sheet of paper he unfolded it and slid it across the table recognize this girl he asked it was a copy of a blackandwhite photo printed from the web site a photo of nicole yarber posing in her cheerleader outfit holding a pompom smiling with all the innocence of a sweet seventeenyearold at first boyette did not react he looked at nikki as if hed never seen her before he stared at her for a long time then the tears came without warning no gasps no sobs no apologies just a flood of moisture that ran down his cheeks and dripped off his chin he made no effort to wipe his face he looked at keith and the two men stared at each other as the tears continued the photo was getting wet boyette grunted cleared his throat and said i really want to die keith came back from the kitchen with two cups of black coffee in paper cups along with some paper towels boyette took one wiped his face and chin and said thanks keith resumed his seat and said what happened to nikki boyette seemed to count to ten before saying ive still got her keith thought he was prepared for every possible answer but in fact he was not could she be alive no hed spent the past six years in prison how could he keep her locked up somewhere hes crazy where is she keith asked firmly buried where missouri look travis these oneword answers will keep us here forever you came to my office this morning for one reason and that was to finally confess but you couldnt muster the courage so here i am lets hear it why do you care thats pretty obvious isnt it an innocent man is about to be executed for something you did maybe theres time to save him i doubt it did you kill nicole yarber is this confidential pastor do you want it to be yes why why not confess then make a full admission then try to help donte drumm thats what you should do travis your days are numbered according to what you said this morning confidential or not keith took a breath then made the mistake of taking a sip of coffee travis was right if you want it to be confidential travis then it is a smile a tic he glanced around though they had yet to be noticed by anyone else he began to nod i did it pastor i dont know why i never know why you grabbed her in the parking lot the tumor expanded the headaches hit like lightning he grabbed his head again and weathered the storm his jaws clenched in a determined effort to keep going i grabbed her took her away i had a gun she didnt fight much we left town i kept her a few days we had sex we you didnt have sex you raped her yes over and over then i did it and buried her you killed her yes how strangled her with her belt its still there around her neck and you buried her yes boyette looked at the photo and keith could almost see a smile where south of joplin where i grew up lots of hills valleys hollows logging trails deadend roads shell never be found they never got close a long pause as the sickening reality settled in of course there was a chance he was lying but keith could not force himself to believe that what could he possibly gain by lying especially at this stage in his miserable life the kitchen lights went out and the radio was turned off three burly black men made their exit and walked through the mess hall they nodded and spoke politely to keith but only glanced at travis they closed the door behind themselves keith took the copy of the photo and turned it over he uncapped his pen and wrote something on it how about a little background travis he said sure i have nothing else to do what were you doing in slone texas working for a company called r s mcguire and sons out of fort smith construction they had a contract to build a warehouse for monsanto just west of slone i hired on as a laborer just a grunt crappy work but its all i could find they paid me less than minimum wage in cash off the books same as the mexicans sixty hours a week flat rate no insurance no skill no nothing it wont be worth your time to check with the company because i was never officially employed i was renting a room in an old motel west of town called the rebel motor inn its probably still there check it out forty bucks a week the job lasted five or six months one friday night i saw the lights found the field behind the high school bought a ticket and sat with the crowd didnt know a soul they were watching football me i was watching the cheerleaders always loved the cheerleaders cute little butts short skirts dark tights on underneath they bounce and flip and throw each other around and you see so much of them they want you to see thats when i fell in love with nicole she was there for me showing it all i knew from the first moment that she was the one the next one right the next one every other friday id go to the games i never sat in the same place twice never wore the same clothes used different caps you learn these things when youre tracking someone she became my whole world and i could feel the urges getting stronger and stronger i knew what was about to happen but i couldnt stop it i can never stop it never he took a sip of coffee and grimaced did you see donte drumm play keith asked maybe i dont remember i never watched the games didnt notice anything but nicole then suddenly no more nicole the season was over i got desperate she drove this hot little red bmw the only one in town so she was not too hard to find if you knew where to look she liked the usual hangouts i saw her car parked at the mall that night figured she was at the movies i waited and waited im very patient when i have to be when the parking space next to her car became vacant i backed into it what were you driving an old chevrolet pickup stole it in arkansas stole the tags in texas i backed into the parking space so my door was next to hers when she walked into the trap i jumped her i had a gun and a roll of duct tape and thats all i ever needed not a sound he rattled off the details with an unaffected detachment as if describing a scene from a movie this is what happened this is how i did it dont expect me to make sense of it the tears were long gone it was a bad weekend for nikki i almost felt sorry for her i dont really want those details keith said interrupting how long did you stay in slone after you killed her a few weeks i guess through christmas into january i was reading the local paper watching the latenight news the town was in a frenzy over the girl saw her mom cry on television real sad every day there was another search party with a television news crew chasing after it fools nikki was two hundred miles away sleeping with the angels he actually chuckled at the memory surely you dont think this is funny sorry pastor how did you hear about the arrest of donte drumm there was a little greasy spoon near the motel and i liked to go there for coffee early in the morning i heard em talking said a football player had confessed a black boy i bought a newspaper sat in my truck read the story and thought what a bunch of idiots i was stunned couldnt believe it there was a mug shot of drumm nicelooking kid and i remember staring at his face and thinking that he mustve had a screw loose why else would he confess to my crime kinda pissed me off the boy had to be crazy then the next day his lawyer came out strong in the paper yelling about how the confession was bogus how the cops tricked the kid overwhelmed him broke him down wouldnt let him out of the room for fifteen hours that made sense to me ive never met a cop i could trust the town almost blew up the whites wanted to string him up on main street the blacks felt pretty strongly the boy was getting railroaded things were tense lots of fights at the high school then i got fired and moved on why were you fired stupid stayed too long in a bar one night the cops busted me for drunk driving then they realized the truck and tags were stolen i spent a week in jail in slone yep check it out january charged with grand larceny drunk driving and whatever else they could throw at me was drumm in the same jail never saw him but there was a lot of talk rumor was theyd moved him to another county for safety reasons i couldnt help but laugh the cops had the real killer they just didnt know it keith made notes but had trouble believing what he was actually writing he asked howd you get out they assigned me a lawyer he got my bond lowered i bailed out skipped town and never went back i drifted here and there and then got arrested in wichita do you remember the lawyers name you still factchecking pastor yes you think im lying no but it doesnt hurt to check the facts no i dont remember his name ive had a lot of lawyers in my life never paid em a dime the arrest in wichita was for attempted rape right sort of attempted sexual battery plus kidnapping there was no sex didnt make it that far the girl knew karate things didnt go the way i planned she kicked me in the balls and i puked for two days i believe your sentence was ten years you served six now youre here nice job pastor youve done your homework did you keep up with the drumm case oh i thought about it off and on for a few years i figured the lawyers and courts would eventually realize they had the wrong boy i mean hell even in texas they have higher courts to review cases and such surely somebody along the way would wake up and see the obvious over time i guess i forgot about it had my own problems when youre in max security you dont spend a lot of time worrying about other people what about nikki you spend time thinking about her boyette did not respond and as the seconds limped along it became obvious that he would not answer the question keith kept scribbling making notes to himself about what to do next nothing was certain do you have any sympathy for her family i was raped when i was eight years old i dont recall a single word of sympathy from anyone in fact no one raised a hand to stop it it went on youve seen my record pastor ive had several victims i couldnt stop not sure i can stop now obviously sympathy is not something i waste time with keith shook his head with a look of disgust dont get me wrong pastor i have a lot of regrets i wish i hadnt done all those terrible things ive wished a million times that i could be normal my whole life ive wanted to stop hurting people to somehow straighten up stay out of prison get a job and all that i didnt choose to be like this keith deliberately folded the sheet of paper and tucked it into his coat pocket he screwed the cap onto his pen he folded his arms across his chest and stared at boyette i guess youre willing to sit by and let things run their course down in texas no im troubled by it im just not sure what to do what if they found the body you tell me where shes buried and ill try to contact the right people down there you sure you want to get involved no but i cant ignore it either boyette bent forward and began pawing at his head again its impossible for anybody else to find her he said his voice breaking up a moment passed and the pain eased im not sure i could now its been so long its been nine years not that long i went back to see her a few times after she died keith showed him both palms and said i dont want to hear it suppose i call drumms lawyer and tell him about the body i wont give your name but at least someone down there knows the truth then what i dont know im not a lawyer maybe i can convince someone im willing to try the only person who can possibly find her is me and i cant leave the state of kansas hell i cant leave this county if i do theyll bust me for parole violations and send me back to prison pastor i aint going back to prison what difference does it make travis youll be dead in a few months according to your own words boyette became very calm and still and began tapping his fingertips together he stared at keith with hard dry unblinking eyes he spoke softly but firmly pastor i cant admit to a murder why not you have at least four felony convictions all related to sexual assault youve spent most of your adult life in prison you have an inoperable brain tumor you actually committed the murder why not have the courage to admit it and save an innocent mans life my mother is still alive where does she live joplin missouri and her name you gonna give her a call pastor no i wont bother her whats her name susan boyette and she lived on trotter street right howd you your mother died three years ago travis howd you google took about ten minutes whats google an internet search company what else are you lying about how many lies have you told me today travis if im lying then why are you here i dont know thats an excellent question you tell a good story and you have a bad record but you cant prove anything boyette shrugged as if he didnt care but his cheeks turned red and his eyes narrowed i dont have to prove anything im not the accused for a change her gym card and student id were found on a sandbar in the red river how does that fit into your story her phone was in her purse as soon as i got her the damned thing started ringing and wouldnt stop finally i got mad grabbed the purse and threw it off the bridge i kept the girl though i needed her she reminds me of your wife very cute shut up travis keith said instinctively before he could stop himself he took a deep breath and patiently said lets keep my wife out of this sorry pastor boyette removed a thin chain from around his neck you want proof pastor take a look at this a gold class ring with a blue stone was attached to the chain boyette unsnapped the chain and handed the ring to keith it was narrow and small obviously worn by a female thats any on one side boyette said with a smile alicia nicole yarber on the other side you have shs dear old slone high keith squeezed the ring between his thumb and his forefinger and stared at it in disbelief show that to her mother and watch her weep boyette said the only other proof i have pastor is nicole herself and the more i think about her the more im convinced that we should just leave her alone keith placed the ring on the table and boyette took it he suddenly kicked his chair back grabbed his cane and stood i dont like being called a liar pastor go home and have fun with your wife liar rapist murderer and youre also a coward travis why dont you do something good for once in your life and quick before its too late just leave me alone boyette opened the door then slammed it behind him chapter the prosecutions theory of guilt had been based in part on the desperate hope that one day someone somewhere would find nicoles body it couldnt stay submerged forever could it the red river would eventually give it up and a fisherman or a boat captain or maybe a kid wading in the backwater would discover it and call for help after the remains were identified the puzzles final piece would fit perfectly all loose ends would be tied up no more questions no more doubts the police and prosecutors could quietly smugly close the book the conviction without the body was not that difficult to obtain the prosecution attacked donte drumm from all angles and while it pushed relentlessly for a trial it also banked heavily on the appearance of a corpse but nine years had passed and the river had not cooperated the hopes and prayers the dreams in some cases had vanished long ago and while this caused doubts in the minds of some observers it did nothing to dampen the convictions of those responsible for dontes death sentence after years of rigid tunnel vision and with so much at stake they were certain beyond all doubt that they had nailed her killer they had invested far too much to question their own theories and actions the district attorney was a man named paul koffee a tough career prosecutor whod been elected and reelected without serious opposition for over twenty years he was an exmarine who enjoyed a fight and usually won his high conviction rate was splashed across his web site and during elections trumpeted in gaudy advertisements sent by direct mail sympathy for the accused was rarely shown and like the routines of most smalltown district attorneys the grind of chasing meth addicts and car thieves was broken only by a sensational murder andor rape much to his wellguarded frustration koffee had prosecuted only two capital murders in his career a paltry record in texas nicole yarbers was the first and the most notorious three years later in koffee had won an easier death verdict in a case involving a botched drug deal that left bodies all over a country road and two was all he would get because of a scandal koffee was leaving office hed promised the public that he would not seek reelection in two years his wife of twentytwo years had left him in a rather swift and noisy exit the drumm execution would be a final moment of glory his sidekick was drew kerber who after his exemplary work in the drumm case had been promoted to chief detective slone pd a position he still proudly held kerber was pushing fortysix ten years younger than the prosecutor and though they often worked closely together they ran in different social circles kerber was a cop koffee was a lawyer the lines were clear in slone as in most small southern towns at various times each had promised donte drumm that he would be there when he got the needle kerber did so first during the brutal interrogation that produced the confession kerber when he wasnt jabbing the kid in the chest and calling him every name in the book promised him over and over that he would get the needle and that he detective kerber would be there to witness it for koffee the conversation had been much briefer during a break in the trial while robbie flak was not around koffee had arranged a quick and secret meeting with donte drumm under a stairwell just outside the courtroom he offered a dealplead guilty and take life no parole otherwise youll get death donte declined and again said he was innocent at which koffee cursed him and assured him he would watch him die moments later koffee denied the encounter when flak verbally assaulted him the two men had lived with the yarber case for nine years and for various reasons they had often seen the need to go see reeva it was not always a pleasant visit not always something they looked forward to but she was such an important part of the case that she could never be neglected reeva pike was nicoles mother a stout boisterous woman who had embraced victimhood with an enthusiasm that often bordered on the ridiculous her involvement in the case was long colorful and often contentious now that the story was entering its final act many in slone wondered what she would do with herself when it was over reeva had badgered kerber and the police for two weeks as they frantically searched for nicole she had wailed for the cameras and publicly berated all elected officials from her city alderman to the governor because they had not found her daughter after the arrest and alleged confession of donte drumm she made herself readily available for lengthy interviews in which she showed no patience with the presumption of innocence and demanded the death penalty and the sooner the better for many years she had taught the ladies bible class at the first baptist church and armed with scripture could practically preach on the subject of gods approval of statesponsored retribution she repeatedly referred to donte as that boy which riled up the blacks in slone she had other names for him too with monster and coldblooded killer being two favorites during the trial she sat with her husband wallis and their two children in the front row directly behind the prosecution with other relatives and friends wedged closely around them two armed deputies were always close by separating reeva and her clan from the family and supporters of donte drumm tense words were exchanged during recesses violence could have erupted at any moment when the jury announced its death sentence reeva jumped to her feet and said praise be to god the judge called her down immediately and threatened to remove her as donte was led away in handcuffs she could not restrain herself she screamed you murdered my baby ill be there when you take your last breath on the first anniversary of nicoles disappearance and presumably her death reeva organized an elaborate vigil at rush point on the red river near the sandbar where the gym card and student id were found someone built a white cross and stuck it in the ground flowers and large photos of nikki were packed around it their preacher led a memorial service and thanked god for the just and true verdict that had just been handed down by the jury candles were burned hymns were sung prayers were offered the vigil became an annual event on that date and reeva was always there often with a news crew in tow she joined a victims group and was soon attending conferences and giving speeches she compiled a long list of complaints with the judicial system the primary one being that of the endless painful delays and she became adept at pleasing a crowd with her new theories she wrote vicious letters to robbie flak and even tried writing to donte drumm reeva created a web site wemissyounikkicom and loaded it with a thousand photos of the girl she blogged incessantly about her daughter and the case often pecking away throughout the night twice robbie flak threatened to sue her for libelous material she published but he knew it was wiser to leave her alone she hounded nikkis friends to post their favorite memories and stories and held grudges against the kids who lost interest her behavior was often bizarre periodically she took long drives downriver in search of her daughter she was often seen standing on bridges gazing at the water lost in another world the red river bisects shreveport louisiana miles south and east of slone reeva became fixated on shreveport she found a hotel downtown with a view of the river and this became her refuge she spent many nights and days there roaming the city loitering around shopping malls cinemas and any of the other places where teenagers liked to gather she knew it was irrational she knew it was inconceivable that nikki could have survived and was alive and hiding from her nonetheless she kept driving to shreveport and watching the faces she couldnt quit she had to do something several times reeva dashed off to other states where teenage girls went missing she was the expert with wisdom to share you can survive this was her motto her effort to soothe and comfort the families though many back home wondered how well she was surviving now as the final countdown was under way she was in a frenzy with the details of the execution the reporters were back and she had plenty to say after nine long and bitter years justice was finally at hand early monday evening paul koffee and drew kerber decided it was time to go see reeva she met them at the front door with a smile even quick hugs they never knew which reeva they would find she could be charming and she could be frightening but with dontes death so close she was gracious and vibrant they walked through the comfortable suburban splitlevel to a large room behind the garage an addon that had become reevas war room over the years half was an office with filing cabinets the other half a shrine to her daughter there were large framed color blowups portraits done posthumously by admirers trophies ribbons plaques and an award from the eighthgrade science fair most of nikkis life could be traced through the displays wallis her second husband and nicoles stepfather was not at home he had been seen less and less over the years and it was rumored that he simply couldnt take much more of his wifes constant mourning and griping she served them iced tea as they sat around a coffee table after a few pleasantries the conversation moved to the execution you have five slots in the witness room koffee said who gets them wallis and i of course chad and marie are undecided but will probably be there she threw out the names of nicoles half brother and half sister as if they couldnt decide to go to the game or not the last place will probably be brother ronnie he doesnt want to watch an execution but he feels the need to be there for us brother ronnie was the current pastor of the first baptist church hed been in slone for about three years had obviously never met nicole but was convinced of drumms guilt and afraid to cross reeva they talked for a few minutes about the protocol on death row the rules regarding witnesses the timeline and so on reeva could we talk about tomorrow koffee asked of course we can are you still doing the fordyce thing yes hes in town now and well film at ten in the morning right here why do you ask im not sure its such a good idea koffee said and kerber nodded his agreement oh really and why not hes such an inflammatory character reeva we are very concerned about the aftershocks thursday night you know how upset the blacks are we are expecting trouble reeva kerber added if the blacks start trouble then arrest them she said its exactly the kind of situation fordyce loves to pounce on hes an agitator reeva he wants to start trouble so he can get in the middle of it helps his ratings its all about ratings kerber added well well arent we nervous she chided sean fordyce was a new yorkbased talkshow host whod found a niche on cable sensationalizing murder cases his slant was unapologetically from the right side of the street always in support of the latest execution or gun rights or the rounding up of illegal immigrants a group he loved to attack because they were much easier targets than others with dark skin it was hardly original programming but fordyce struck gold when he began filming the families of victims as they prepared to watch the executions he became famous when his tech crew managed to successfully hide a tiny camera in the frame of a pair of eyeglasses worn by the father of a young boy who was murdered in alabama for the first time the world saw an execution and sean fordyce owned the footage he played it and played it and with each showing commented on how simple it was how peaceful and painless and much too easy for such a violent killer he was indicted in alabama sued by the dead mans family and threatened with death and censure but he survived it the charges didnt stickthey couldnt nail down a specific crime the lawsuit was thrown out three years after the stunt he was not only standing but standing at the top of the cable garbage heap now he was in slone preparing for another episode rumor was that hed paid reeva for the exclusive please reconsider reeva koffee said no paul the answer is no im doing it for nicole for my family and for the other victims out there the world needs to see what this monster has done to us whats the benefit koffee said both he and kerber had ignored phone calls from fordyces production team maybe the laws can be changed but the laws are working here reeva sure its taken longer than we wanted but in the scheme of things nine years is not bad oh my god paul i cant believe you just said that you havent lived our nightmare for the past nine years no i havent and i dont pretend to understand what youve been through but the nightmare wont end thursday night and it certainly would not not if reeva had anything to do with it you have no idea paul i cant believe this the answer is no no no no im doing the interview and the show will run the world will see what its like they had not expected to be successful so they were not surprised when reeva pike made up her mind the conversation was over they shifted gears so be it koffee said do you and wallis feel safe she smiled and almost chuckled of course paul we got a houseful of guns and the neighbors are on high alert every car that comes down this street is watched through rifle scopes we are not expecting trouble there were phone calls at the station today kerber said the usual anonymous stuff vague threats about this and that if the boy is executed im sure you guys can deal with it she said with no concern whatsoever after waging such a relentless war of her own reeva had forgotten how to be afraid i think we should have a patrol car parked outside for the rest of the week kerber said do as you wish it doesnt matter to me if the blacks start trouble they wont do it over here dont they normally burn their own buildings first both men shrugged theyd had no experience with riots slone had an unremarkable history with race relations what little they knew had been learned from the television news yes it did seem as if the riots were confined to the ghettos they talked about this for a few minutes then it was time to leave they hugged again at the front door and promised to see each other after the execution what a great moment it would be the end of the ordeal justice at last robbie flak parked at the curb in front of the drumm home and braced himself for another meeting how many times have you been here his passenger asked i dont know dozens and dozens he opened the door climbed out and she did the same her name was martha handler she was an investigative journalist a freelancer who worked for no one but was paid occasionally by the big magazines she had first visited slone two years earlier when the paul koffee scandal broke and after that had developed a fascination with the drumm case she and robbie had spent hours together professionally and things might have degenerated from there but for the fact that robbie was committed to his current livein a woman twenty years his junior martha no longer believed in commitment and gave mixed signals as to whether the door was open or not there was sexual tension between the two as if they were both fighting the urge to say yes so far they had been successful at first she claimed to be writing a book about the drumm case then it was a lengthy article for vanity fair then it was one for the new yorker then it was a screenplay for a movie to be produced by one of her exhusbands in la in robbies opinion she was a passable writer with a brilliant recall of the facts but a disaster with organization and planning whatever the final product he had complete veto power and if her project ever earned a dime he and the drumm family would get a share after two years with her he was not counting on any payoff he liked her though she was wickedly funny irreverent a total zealot to the cause and she had developed a fierce hatred for almost every person shed met in texas plus she could guzzle bourbon and play poker far past midnight the small living room was crowded roberta drumm sat on the piano bench her usual position two of her brothers stood by the door to the kitchen her son cedric dontes oldest brother was on the sofa holding a toddler who was asleep her daughter andrea dontes younger sister had one chair her preacher reverend canty had another robbie and martha sat close to each other in flimsy shaky chairs brought in from the kitchen martha had been there many times and had even cooked for roberta when she had the flu after the usual hellos and hugs and instant coffee robbie began talking nothing happened today which is not good news first thing tomorrow the parole board will issue its decision they dont meet they just circulate the case and everybody votes we dont expect a recommendation for clemency that rarely happens we expect a denial which we will then appeal to the governors office and ask for a reprieve the governor has the right to grant one thirtyday reprieve its unlikely well get one but we have to pray for a miracle robbie flak was not a man of prayer but in the staunch bible belt of east texas he could certainly talk the talk and he was in a room full of people who prayed around the clock martha handler being the exception on the positive side we made contact today with joey gamble found him outside of houston a place called mission bend our investigator had lunch with him confronted him with the truth impressed upon him the urgency of the situation and so on he is following the case and knows whats at stake we invited him to sign an affidavit recanting the lies he told at trial and he declined however we wont give up he was not decisive he seemed to waver to be troubled by whats happening to donte what if he signs the affidavit and tells the truth cedric asked well we suddenly have some ammunition a bullet or two something to take to court and make some noise the problem though is that when liars start recanting their testimony everybody gets real suspicious especially judges hearing appeals when does the lying stop is he lying now or was he lying then its a long shot frankly but right now everything is a long shot robbie had always been blunt especially when dealing with the families of his criminal clients and at this stage in dontes case it made little sense to raise hopes roberta sat stoically with her hands wedged under her legs she was fiftysix years old but looked much older since the death of her husband riley five years earlier she had stopped coloring her hair and stopped eating she was gray and gaunt and said little but then she never had said much riley had been the big talker the boaster the bruiser with roberta in the role as the fixer who eased behind her husband and patched up the rifts he created in the past few days she had slowly accepted reality and seemed overwhelmed by it neither she nor riley nor any member of the family had ever questioned dontes innocence he had once tried to maim ballcarriers and quarterbacks and he could adequately defend himself when necessary on the playground or in the streets but donte was really a pushover a sensitive kid who would never harm an innocent person martha and i are going to polunsky tomorrow to see donte robbie was saying i can take any mail you might have for him i have a meeting with the mayor at am tomorrow reverend canty announced ill be joined by several other pastors we intend to convey our concerns about what might happen in slone if donte is executed itll be ugly said an uncle you got that right cedric added folks on this side are fired up the execution is still set for pm on thursday right asked andrea yes robbie said well when will you know for sure that itll be carried out she asked these things usually go down to the wire primarily because the lawyers fight to the last minute andrea looked uneasily at cedric then said well ill just tell you robbie a lot of people on this side of town plan to get outta here when it happens theres gonna be trouble and i understand why but once it starts things might get out of control the whole town better look out cedric said thats what well tell the mayor canty said hed better do something all he can do is react robbie said he has nothing to do with the execution cant he call the governor sure but dont assume the mayor is against the execution if he got through to the governor hed probably lobby against a reprieve the mayor is a good old texas boy he loves the death penalty no one in the room was fond of the mayor or the governor for that matter robbie moved the discussion away from the prospect of violence there were important details to be discussed according to the rules from the department of corrections the last family visit will take place at am on thursday morning at the polunsky unit before donte is transferred to huntsville robbie continued i know youll be anxious to see him and hes desperate to see you but dont be surprised when you get there it will be just like a regular visit hell be on one side of a sheet of plexiglas youll have to stay on the other you talk by phone its ridiculous but then this is texas no hugs no kisses andrea said no they have their rules roberta began crying quiet sniffles with big tears i cant hug my baby she said one of her brothers handed her a tissue and patted her shoulder after a minute or so she pulled herself together and said im sorry dont be sorry roberta robbie said youre the mother and your son is about to be executed for something he didnt do you have the right to cry me id be bawling and screaming and shooting at people still might do it andrea asked what about the execution itself whos supposed to be there the witness room is divided by a wall to separate the victims family from the inmates family all witnesses stand there are no seats they get five slots you get five slots the rest are given to the lawyers prison officials members of the press and a few others ill be there roberta i know you plan to be a witness but donte is adamant that he doesnt want you there your name is on his list but he doesnt want you to watch im sorry robbie she said wiping her nose weve had this discussion i was there when he was born and ill be there when he dies he may not know it but hell need me i will be a witness robbie wasnt about to argue he promised to return the following evening chapter long after the boys were asleep keith and dana schroeder were in the kitchen of their modest churchowned parsonage in central topeka they sat directly across from each other each with a laptop notepads and decaf coffee the table was littered with materials found on the internet and printed in the church office dinner had been quick macaroni and cheese because the boys had homework and the parents were preoccupied checking online sources dana had been unable to confirm boyettes claim that he had been arrested and jailed in slone in january the towns old court records were not available the bar directory listed lawyers in slone she picked ten at random called them said she was with the parole office in kansas and was checking the background of a mr travis boyette did you ever represent a man by that name no then sorry to disturb you she did not have the time to call every lawyer and it seemed futile anyway she planned to call the city court clerks office first thing tuesday morning after holding nicoles class ring keith had little doubt that boyette was telling the truth what if the ring had been stolen before she disappeared dana asked and fenced at a pawnshop what if it seemed unlikely boyette would purchase such a ring from a pawnshop didnt it back and forth they went for hours each questioning every idea the other had much of the material scattered around the table came from two web sites wemissyounikkicom and freedontedrummcom dontes web site was maintained by the law offices of mr robbie flak and was far more extensive active and professionally done nikkis web site was run by her mother neither made the slightest effort at neutrality from dontes under the tab for case history keith scrolled down to the heart of the prosecutions case the confession the narrative began by explaining that it was based on two very different accounts of what happened the interrogation which took place over a period of fifteen hours and twelve minutes proceeded with few interruptions donte was allowed to use the restroom three times and was twice escorted down the hall to another room for polygraph exams otherwise he never left the room which had the inhouse nickname the choir room sooner or later the cops liked to say the suspects start singing the first version was based on the official police report this consisted of notes taken throughout the interrogation by detective jim morrissey during one threehour stretch while morrissey took a nap on a cot in the locker room the notes were taken by a detective nick needham the notes were typed into a neat fourteenpage report which detectives kerber morrissey and needham swore to be the truth and nothing but not a single word in the report suggests the use of threats lies promises trickery intimidation physical abuse or violations of constitutional rights indeed all of the above were denied repeatedly in court by the detectives the second version contrasted sharply with the first the day after his arrest while donte was alone in a jail cell charged with kidnapping aggravated rape and capital murder and while he was slowly recuperating from the psychological trauma of the interrogation he recanted his confession he explained to his lawyer robbie flak what had happened under flaks direction donte began writing his account of the interrogation when it was finished two days later it was typed by one of mr flaks legal secretaries dontes version was fortythree pages long thus a summary of the two accounts with some analysis thrown in the confession on december eighteen days after the disappearance of nicole yarber detectives drew kerber and jim morrissey of the slone police department drove to the south side health club looking for donte the club is frequented by the more serious athletes in the area donte worked out there almost every afternoon after school he lifted weights and was rehabbing his ankle he was in superb physical condition and was planning to enroll at sam houston state university next summer then try out for the football team as a walkon at approximately pm as donte was leaving the club alone he was approached by kerber and morrissey who introduced themselves in a friendly manner and asked donte if he would talk to them about nicole yarber donte agreed and kerber suggested they meet at the police station where they could relax and be more comfortable donte was nervous about this but he also wanted to cooperate fully he knew nicolehed helped search for herbut knew nothing about her disappearance and thought that the meeting at the station would take just a few minutes he drove himself in the familys wellused green ford van to the police station and parked in a visitors slot as he walked into the station he had no idea that he was taking his last steps as a free man he was eighteen years old had never been in serious trouble and had never been subjected to a prolonged police interrogation he was checked in at the front desk his cell phone wallet and car keys were taken and put in a locked drawer for security reasons the detectives led him to an interrogation room in the basement of the building other officers were around one a black policeman in uniform recognized donte and said something about football once inside the interrogation room morrissey offered him something to drink donte declined there was a small rectangular table in the center of the room donte sat on one side both detectives on the other the room was well lit with no windows in one corner a tripod held a video camera but it was not directed at donte as far as he could tell nor did it appear to be turned on morrissey produced a sheet of paper and explained that donte needed to understand his miranda rights donte asked if he was a witness or a suspect the detective explained their procedures required that all persons interrogated be informed of their rights no big deal just a formality donte began to feel uncomfortable he read every word on the paper and since he had nothing to hide signed his name thus waiving his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney it was a fateful tragic decision innocent people are much likelier to waive their rights during an interrogation they know they are innocent and they want to cooperate with the police to prove their innocence guilty suspects are more inclined not to cooperate seasoned criminals laugh at the police and clam up morrissey took notes beginning with the time the suspect entered the room pm kerber did most of the talking the discussion began with a long summary of the football season the wins the losses what went wrong in the playoffs a coaching change that was the hot rumor kerber seemed truly interested in his future and hoped his ankle healed so he could play in college donte expressed confidence that this would happen kerber seemed especially interested in dontes current weightlifting program and asked specific questions about how much he could benchpress curl squat and deadlift there were a lot of questions about him and his family his academic progress his work experience his brief runin with the law on that marijuana thing when he was sixteen and after what seemed like an hour they finally got around to nicole the tone changed the smiles were gone the questions became more pointed how long had he known her how many classes together mutual friends whom did he date who were his girlfriends whom did she date did he ever date nicole no did he ever try to date her no did he want to date her he wanted to date a lot of girls white girls sure he wanted to but he didnt never dated a white girl no rumor has it that you and nicole were seeing each other trying to keep it quiet nope never met her privately never touched her but you admit you wanted to date her i said i wanted to date a lot of girls white and black even a couple of hispanic so you love all girls a lot of them yes but not all kerber asked if donte had participated in any of the searches for nicole yes donte and the entire senior class had spent hours looking for her they talked about joey gamble and some of the other boys nicole had dated through high school kerber repeatedly asked if donte dated her or was seeing her on the sly his questions were more like accusations and donte began to worry roberta drumm served dinner each night at and if for some reason donte wasnt there he was expected to call at pm donte asked the detectives if he could leave just a few more questions kerber said donte asked if he could call his mother no cell phones were not permitted inside the police station after two hours in the room kerber finally dropped a bomb he informed donte that they had a witness willing to testify that nicole had confided to her close friends that she was seeing donte and there was a lot of sex involved but she had to keep it quiet her parents would never approve her rich father in dallas would cut off his support and disinherit her her church would be scornful and so on there was no such witness but police are permitted to lie at will during an interrogation donte strongly denied any relationship with nicole and kerber went on with his tale this witness had told them that nicole was becoming increasingly worried about the affair she wanted to end it but that he donte refused to leave her alone she thought she was being stalked she thought donte had become obsessed with her donte vehemently denied all of this he demanded to know the identity of this witness but kerber said it was all confidential your witness is lying donte said over and over as with all interrogations the detectives knew the direction their questions were headed donte did not abruptly kerber changed subjects and grilled donte about the green ford van and how often he drove it and where and so on it had been in the family for years and it was shared by the drumm children kerber asked how often donte drove it to school to the gym to the mall and to several other places frequented by high school students did donte drive it to the mall on the night of december a friday the night nicole disappeared no on the night nicole disappeared donte was at home with his younger sister his parents were in dallas at a weekend church convention donte was babysitting they ate frozen pizza and watched television in the den something his mother did not usually allow yes the green van was parked in the driveway his parents had taken the familys buick to dallas neighbors testified that the green van was where he said it was no one saw it leave during the night his sister testified that he was with her throughout the night that he did not leave kerber informed the suspect that they had a witness who saw a green ford van in the mall parking lot around the time nicole disappeared donte said there was probably more than one such van in slone he began asking the detectives if he was a suspect do you think i took nicole he asked over and over when it became evident that they did he grew extremely agitated he was also frightened at the thought of being suspected around pm roberta drumm was concerned donte rarely missed dinner and he usually kept his cell phone in his pocket her calls to him were going straight to voice mail she began calling his friends none of whom knew his whereabouts kerber asked donte straightout if he had killed nicole and disposed of her body donte angrily denied this denied any involvement whatsoever kerber said he didnt believe donte the exchanges between the two became tense and the language deteriorated accusations denials accusations denials at pm kerber kicked back his chair and stormed out of the room morrissey put down his pen and apologized for kerbers behavior he said the guy was under a lot of stress because he was the lead detective and everybody wanted to know what happened to nicole there was a chance she was still alive plus kerber was a hothead who could be overbearing it was the classic goodcop badcop routine and donte knew exactly what was going on but since morrissey was being polite donte chatted with him they did not discuss the case donte asked for a soft drink and something to eat and morrissey went to get it donte had a good friend by the name of torrey pickett they had played football together since the seventh grade but torrey had some legal problems the summer before his junior year he was caught in a crackselling sting and sent away he did not finish high school and was currently working at a grocery store in slone the police knew that torrey clocked out each weeknight at when the store closed two uniformed officers were waiting they asked him if he would voluntarily come down to the station and answer some questions about the nicole yarber case he hesitated and this made the police suspicious they told him that his buddy donte was already down there and needed his help torrey decided to go see for himself he rode in the backseat of a police car at the station torrey was placed in a room two doors down from donte the room had a large window with oneway glass so that officers could look in but the suspect could not see them it was also wired so that the interrogation could be heard on a speaker in the hall detective needham worked alone and asked the usual generic noninvasive questions torrey quickly waived his miranda rights needham soon got to the topic of girls and who was dating whom and who was fooling around when they were not supposed to be torrey claimed he barely knew nicole hadnt seen her in years he scoffed at the idea that his pal donte was seeing the girl after thirty minutes of questioning needham left the room torrey sat at a table and waited meanwhile in the choir room donte was getting another jolt kerber informed him they had a witness who was willing to testify that donte and torrey pickett grabbed the girl raped her in the back of the green van then tossed her body off a bridge over the red river donte actually laughed at this lunacy and his laughter rankled detective kerber donte explained that he was laughing not about a dead girl but at the fantasy that kerber was putting together if kerber really had a witness then he kerber was foolish for believing the lying idiot the two men called each other liars among other things a bad situation became even uglier suddenly needham opened the door and informed kerber and morrissey that they had torrey pickett in custody this news was so exciting that kerber jumped to his feet and left the room again moments later he was back he resumed the same line of questioning and accused donte of the murder when donte denied everything kerber accused him of lying he claimed to know for a fact that donte and torrey pickett raped and killed the girl and if donte wanted to prove his innocence then they should start with a polygraph a liedetector test it was foolproof clear evidence admissible in court and so on donte was immediately suspicious of the test but at the same time thought it might be a good idea a quick way to end this foolishness he knew he was innocent he knew he could pass the test and in doing so he could get kerber off his back before things got worse he agreed to an exam under the stress of police questioning innocent people are far likelier to agree to a polygraph they have nothing to hide and theyre desperate to prove it guilty suspects rarely consent to the exams and for obvious reasons donte was led to another room and introduced to a detective ferguson whod been at home asleep an hour earlier when detective needham called ferguson was the departments polygraph expert and he insisted that kerber morrissey and needham leave the room ferguson was extremely polite softspoken even apologetic for putting donte through the process he explained everything ran through the paperwork rigged up the machine and began asking donte about his involvement in the nicole yarber matter this went on for about an hour when ferguson finished he explained that it would be a few minutes before he could digest the results donte was taken back to the choir room the results clearly showed that donte was telling the truth however the law as decided by the us supreme court permits the police to engage in a wide range of deceptive practices during interrogations they can lie at will when kerber returned to the choir room he was holding the graph paper from the test he threw it at donte hitting him in the face and called him a lyin son of a bitch now they had proof that he was lying they had clear evidence that he snatched his exlover raped her killed her in a fit of rage and threw her off a bridge kerber picked up the graph paper shook it in dontes face and promised him that when the jury saw the results of the test they would find him guilty and give him death youre looking at the needle kerber said over and over another lie polygraphs are so famously unreliable that their results are never admitted in court donte was stunned he felt faint he was bewildered and struggled to find words kerber relaxed and took his seat across the table he said that in many cases involving horrible crimes especially those committed by good decent folksnoncriminalsthe killer subconsciously erases the act from his memory he just blocks it out this is quite common and he detective kerber because of his extensive training and vast experience had seen this many times he suspected that donte was quite fond of nicole maybe even in love and did not plan to harm her things got out of control she was dead before he realized it then he was in shock at what hed done and the guilt was crushing so he tried to block it out donte continued to deny everything he was exhausted and laid his head on the table kerber slapped the table violently startling his suspect he again accused donte of the crime said they had the witnesses and the proof and that he would be dead within five years texas prosecutors know how to streamline the system so that the executions are not delayed kerber asked donte to just imagine his mother sitting in the witness room waving at him for the last time crying her eyes out as they strapped him down and adjusted the chemicals youre a dead man he said more than once but there was an option if donte would come clean tell them what happened make a full confession then he kerber would guarantee that the state would not seek the death penalty donte would get life with no parole which was no piece of cake but at least he could write letters to his mom and see her twice a month such threats of death and promises of leniency are unconstitutional and the police know it both kerber and morrissey denied using these tactics not surprisingly morrisseys notes make no reference to threats or promises nor do they accurately record the time and sequence of events donte did not have access to a pen and paper and after five hours of interrogation lost track of time around midnight detective needham opened the door and announced picketts talking kerber smiled at morrissey then left in another dramatic exit pickett was alone in his locked room fuming because hed been forgotten he had not seen or spoken to anyone in over an hour riley drumm found his green van parked at the city jail hed been driving the streets and was relieved to find the van he was also concerned about his son and what kind of trouble he was in the slone city jail is next door and attached to the police department riley went to the jail first and after some confusion was told that his son was not behind bars he had not been processed there were sixtytwo prisoners back there none by the name of donte drumm the jailer a younger white officer recognized dontes name and was as helpful as possible he suggested that mr drumm check next door with the police department this he did and it too proved confusing and frustrating it was am and the front door was locked riley called his wife with an update then he pondered how to get inside the building after a few minutes a patrol car parked nearby and two uniformed officers emerged they spoke to riley drumm who explained why he was there he followed them inside and took a seat in the lobby the two officers left in search of his son half an hour passed before they reappeared and said that donte was being questioned about what why the officers did not know riley began waiting at least the boy was safe the first crack occurred when kerber produced a color eightbyten photo of nicole weary alone frightened uncertain and overwhelmed donte took one look at her pretty face and began crying kerber and morrissey exchanged confident smiles donte wept for several minutes then asked to use the restroom they escorted him down the hall stopping at the window so he could see torrey pickett sitting at a table holding a pen writing on a legal pad donte stared in disbelief even shook his head and mumbled something to himself torrey wrote a onepage summary in which he denied knowing anything about nicole yarbers disappearance the summary was somehow misplaced by the slone police department and has never been seen back in the choir room kerber informed donte that his pal torrey had signed a statement in which he swore under oath that donte was seeing nicole that he was crazy about her but she was worried about the consequences and trying to break up donte was desperate and stalking the girl torrey was afraid he might hurt her as kerber delivered this latest series of lies he read from a sheet of paper as if it were torreys statement donte closed his eyes shook his head and tried to understand what was happening but his thoughts were much slower now his reaction time deadened by fatigue and fear he asked if he could leave and kerber yelled at him the detective cursed him and said no he could not leave because he was their prime suspect he was their man they had the proof donte asked if he needed a lawyer and kerber said of course not a lawyer cant change the facts a lawyer cant bring back nicole a lawyer cant save your life donte but we can morrisseys notes make no reference to the discussion about lawyers at am torrey pickett was allowed to leave detective needham led him through a side door so he would not bump into mr drumm in the lobby the detectives in the basement had been warned that the defendants father was in the building and wanted to see him this was denied under oath at several hearings morrissey began to fade and was replaced by needham for the next three hours while morrissey napped needham took notes kerber showed no signs of slowing down as he hammered away at the suspect he seemed to energize himself he was about to break the suspect solve the case and become the hero he offered donte another crack at the polygraph this one to be limited solely to the question of his whereabouts on friday december at approximately pm dontes first reaction was to say no to distrust the machine but such wisdom was overridden by the desire to get out of the room just get away from kerber anything to get the psycho out of his face detective ferguson hooked him up to the machine again and asked a few questions the polygraph made its noises its graph paper slowly rolled out donte stared at it without a clue but something told him the results would not be good again the results proved he was telling the truth he was at home that friday babysitting and he never left but the truth was not important while he was away kerber moved his chair to a corner as far from the door as possible when donte returned he took his place and kerber pulled his chair close so that their knees were practically touching he began cursing donte again telling him he had not only flunked the second polygraph but severely flunked it for the first time he touched donte by jabbing his right index finger into his chest donte slapped his hand away and was ready to fight when needham stepped forward with a taser the detective seemed anxious to give it a try but did not both cops cursed and threatened donte the jabbing continued along with the nonstop accusations and threats donte realized he would not be allowed to leave until he gave the cops what they wanted and maybe they were right after all they seemed so certain about what happened they were convinced beyond any doubt that he was involved his own friend was saying that he and nicole were involved in a relationship and the polygraphswhat would the jury think when they learned that he had lied donte was doubting himself and his own memory what if he had blacked out and erased the terrible deed and he really didnt want to die not then not five or ten years down the road at am riley drumm left the police station and went home he tried to sleep but could not roberta made coffee and they worried and waited for sunrise as if things would clear up then kerber and needham took a break at am when they were alone in the hallway kerber said hes ready a few minutes later needham opened the door quietly and peeked in donte was lying on the floor sobbing they took him a doughnut and a soft drink and resumed the interrogation a revelation slowly came over donte since he could not leave until he gave them their story and since he would at that moment confess to killing his own mother why not play along nicole would turn up soon enough dead or alive and this would solve the mystery the police would look like fools for verbally beating a confession out of him some farmer or hunter would stumble over her remains and these clowns would be exposed donte would be vindicated freed and everyone would feel sorry for him twelve hours after the interrogation began he looked at kerber and said give me a few minutes and ill tell you everything after the break kerber helped him fill in the blanks he had sneaked out of the house after his sister was asleep he was desperate to see nicole because she was pushing him away trying to break off their affair he knew nicole was at the movies with friends he drove there alone in the green ford van he confronted her in the parking lot near her car she agreed to get in they drove around slone then into the countryside he wanted sex she said no they were finished he tried to force himself on her and she fought back he forced her into sex but it wasnt enjoyable she scratched him even drew blood the attack turned ugly he flew into a rage began to choke her and he couldnt stop didnt stop until it was too late then he panicked he had to do something with her he yelled at her back in the rear of the van but she never responded he drove north toward oklahoma hed lost track of time then realized that dawn was approaching he had to get home he had to get rid of her body on the route bridge over the red river at approximately on the morning of december he stopped the van it was still dark she was still very dead he tossed her over and waited until he heard the sickening splash below he cried all the way back to slone for three hours kerber coached him prodded him corrected him cursed him reminded him to tell the truth the details had to be perfect kerber kept saying at am the video camera was finally turned on a wipedout stonefaced donte drumm sat at the table with a fresh soft drink and doughnut in front of him visible so that their hospitality could be shown the video ran for seventeen minutes and would send him to death row donte was charged with abduction aggravated rape and capital murder he was taken to a cell where he promptly fell asleep at am the chief of police along with the district attorney mr paul koffee held a press conference to announce the nicole yarber case had been solved sadly one of slones former football heroes donte drumm had confessed to the murder other witnesses verified his involvement sympathies to her family the confession was attacked immediately donte recanted and his attorney robbie flak went public with a scathing condemnation of the police and their tactics months later the defense lawyers filed motions to suppress the confession and the suppression hearing lasted for a week kerber morrissey and needham testified at length and their testimony was hotly challenged by the defense they steadfastly denied using threats promises or intimidation they specifically denied using the death penalty as a means to frighten donte into cooperating they denied verbally abusing the suspect or pushing him to the point of exhaustion and collapse they denied that donte had ever mentioned a lawyer or that he wanted to terminate the interrogation and go home they denied any knowledge of his fathers presence at the station and his desire to see his son they denied the fact that their own polygraph tests showed clear evidence of truthfulness but instead testified that the results were inconclusive in their opinions they denied any trickery with the alleged statement of torrey pickett pickett testified on dontes behalf and denied telling the police anything about an affair between donte and nicole the trial judge expressed grave concerns about the confession but not grave enough to exclude it from the trial she refused to suppress it and it was later shown to the jury donte watched it as if he were watching a different person no one has ever seriously questioned the fact that it guaranteed his conviction the confession was attacked again on appeal but the texas court of criminal appeals unanimously affirmed the conviction and death sentence when keith was finished he left the table and went to the bathroom he had the feeling that he had just been interrogated it was well after midnight sleep would be impossible chapter by on tuesday morning the flak law firm was bustling with a frantic nervous energy one might expect from a group of people fighting both the clock and some very long odds to save a mans life tension was palpable there were no smiles none of the usual smartass remarks from people who worked together each day with the absolute freedom of saying anything to anyone at any time most of those present had been around six years earlier when lamar billups got the needle at huntsville and the finality of his death had been a shock and billups had been a nasty character his favorite pastime had been beating up people in bar fights preferably with pool cue sticks and broken bottles and the state finally got fed up with him on his deathbed his last words were see you in hell and away he went he was guilty and never made a serious claim otherwise his murder had been in a small town sixty miles away hardly noticed by the citizens of slone he had no family no one for the firm to be acquainted with robbie disliked him immensely but clung rigidly to the belief that the state had no right to kill him the state of texas versus donte drumm was a far different matter now they were fighting for an innocent man and his family was their family the long table in the main conference room was the center of the storm fred pryor who was still in houston was on the speakerphone giving a quick update on his efforts to flip joey gamble the two had spoken by phone late monday night and gamble was even less cooperative he kept asking about perjury and how serious a crime it is pryor said his voice at full volume koffees threatening him robbie said as if he knew it to be true did you ask him if hes talking to the district attorney no but i thought about it pryor replied i didnt because i figured he would not divulge that koffee knows he lied at trial and hes told the kid that well make a lastminute run at him robbie said hes threatened him with a prosecution for perjury if he changes his story now wanna bet on that fred no sounds about right tell joey the statute of limitations has run on perjury koffee cant touch him you got it the speakerphone was switched off a platter of pastries hit the table and attracted a crowd robbies two associates both women were reviewing a request for a reprieve from the governor martha handler sat at one end of the table lost in the world of trial transcripts aaron rey with his jacket off and both pistols visible and strapped to his shirt sipped coffee from a paper cup as he scanned the morning newspaper bonnie a paralegal worked at a laptop lets assume gamble comes through robbie said to his senior associate a prim lady of undetermined age robbie had sued her first plastic surgeon twenty years earlier when a facelift produced a result that was less than desirable but she had not given up on the corrective work she had simply changed surgeons her name was samantha thomas or sammie and when she wasnt working on robbies cases she was suing doctors for malpractice and employers for age and race discrimination get the petition ready just in case he said im almost finished with it sammie said the receptionist fanta a tall slender black woman who had starred in basketball at slone high and would have graduated under different circumstances with both nicole yarber and donte drumm entered the room with a handful of phone messages a reporter from the washington post called and wants to talk she said to robbie who immediately focused on her legs is it someone we know never seen the name before then ignore a reporter from the houston chronicle left a message at last night its not spinney is it it is tell him to go to hell i dont use that language then ignore greta has called three times is she still in germany yes she cant afford a plane ticket she wants to know if she and donte can get married through the internet and what did you tell her i said no its not possible did you explain that donte has become one of the most eligible bachelors in the world that hes had at least five marriage proposals in the past week all from europe all kinds of women young old fat skinny the only trait they share is that they are ugly and stupid did you explain that donte is rather particular about whom he marries and so hes taking his time i didnt talk to her she left a voice mail good ignore the last one is from a minister from a lutheran church in topeka kansas called ten minutes ago said he might have information about who killed nicole but is not sure what to do about it great another nut how many of those did we have last week ive lost count ignore its amazing how many fruitcakes show up at the last minute she placed the messages amid the pile of debris in front of robbie and left the room robbie watched every step of her exit but did not gawk as usual martha handler said i dont mind calling the fruitcakes youre just looking for material robbie shot back its a waste of valuable time morning news carlos the paralegal said loudly and reached for the remote control he aimed it at a widescreen television hanging in a corner and the chatter stopped the reporter was standing in front of the chester county courthouse as if something dramatic might happen there at any minute he gushed city officials are mum on their plans to deal with potential unrest here in slone in the wake of the scheduled execution of donte drumm drumm as you know was convicted in of the aggravated rape and murder of nicole yarber and pending a lastminute stay or reprieve will be executed at the prison in huntsville at thursday evening drumm has maintained his innocence and many here in slone do not believe he is guilty from the beginning the case has had racial overtones and to say the town is divided is quite an understatement im here with police chief joe radford the camera pulled back to reveal the rotund figure of the chief in uniform chief what can we expect if the execution is carried out well i guess we can expect justice to be served do you anticipate trouble not at all folks have got to understand that the judicial system works and that the verdict of the jury must be carried out so you dont foresee any problems thursday night no but well be out in full force well be ready thanks for your time the camera zoomed in cutting out the chief organizers are planning a protest tomorrow at noon right here in front of the courthouse sources confirmed that a permit for a rally has been issued by city hall more on that later the reporter signed off and the paralegal pushed the mute button no comment from robbie and everybody went back to work the texas board of pardons and paroles has seven members all appointed by the governor an inmate desiring clemency must petition the board for relief a petition may be as simple as a onepage request or as thorough as a voluminous filing with exhibits affidavits and letters from around the world the one filed by robbie flak on behalf of donte drumm was one of the most exhaustive in the boards history clemency is rarely granted if denied an appeal can be made to the governor who cannot grant clemency on his own initiative but is allowed to issue one thirtyday reprieve on those rare occasions when the board grants clemency the governor has the right to overrule it and the state proceeds with the execution for a condemned prisoner facing death the board usually makes its decision two days before the execution the board doesnt actually meet to take a vote but instead circulates a ballot by fax death by fax as it is known for donte drumm news of his death by fax came at on tuesday morning robbie read the decision aloud to his team no one was remotely surprised they had lost so many rounds by now that a victory was not something they expected so lets ask the governor for a reprieve robbie said with a smile im sure hell be happy to hear from us again of the truckload of motions and petitions and requests that his firm had filed in the last month and would continue to churn out until his client was dead a request for a reprieve from the governor of texas was undoubtedly the biggest waste of paper twice in the past year the governor had ignored clemency approvals from his parole board and allowed the executions he loved the death penalty especially when seeking votes one of his campaigns featured the slogan tough texas justice and included his promise to empty death row and he was not talking about early parole lets go see donte robbie announced the drive from slone to the polunsky unit near livingston texas was a hard threehour grind on twolane roads robbie had made it a hundred times a few years earlier when he had three clients on death rowdonte lamar billups and a man named cole taylorhe grew weary of speeding tickets and rural drivers and near misses because he was on the phone he bought a van a long heavy one with plenty of room and he took it to a highend custom shop in fort worth where they installed phones televisions and every gadget on the market along with plush carpet fine leather captains chairs that both swiveled and reclined a sofa in the rear if robbie needed a nap and a bar in case he became thirsty aaron rey was named the designated driver bonnie the other paralegal usually sat in the front passengers seat ready to jump when mr flak barked the trips became much more productive as robbie worked the phone and laptop or read briefs on the way to polunsky and back traveling comfortably in the portable office his chair was directly behind the drivers next to him was martha handler up front with aaron was bonnie they left slone at am and were soon winding through the hills of east texas the fifth member of the team was a new one her name was dr kristina hinze or kristi as she was called around the flak office where no one was presumptuous enough to wear a title and most first names were shortened she was the latest in a series of experts robbie had burned cash on in his efforts to save donte she was a clinical psychiatrist whod studied prisoners and prison conditions and shed written a book that argued among other things solitary confinement is one of the worst forms of torture for she was expected to meet with donte evaluate him then prepare quickly a report in which she would describe his deteriorated mental condition and declare that he had been driven crazy by eight years of solitary and such confinement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in the us supreme court stopped the execution of insane people robbies final thrust would be to portray donte as a psychotic schizoid who understood nothing the argument was a long shot kristi hinze was only thirtytwo years old not far removed from the classroom with a resume that included no experience in court robbie was not concerned he only hoped she got the chance to testify in a hearing on mental competency months down the road she had the rear sofa papers spread everywhere hard at work like everyone else when robbie finished a phone call martha handler said can we talk this had become her standard opening when she had questions sure he said she clicked on one of her many tape recorders and slid it in front of him on the subject of money you were appointed by the judge to represent donte who qualified as an indigent defendant but yep texas has no public defender system to speak of he interrupted after months together martha had learned that she should never expect to finish a sentence he went on so the local judges appoint their buddies or drag in some poor schmuck when the case is so bad no one wants it me i went to the judge and volunteered she was happy to give it to me no other lawyer in town would get near it but the drumms are not exactly poor they both sure but heres how it works only a rich person can afford to pay a lawyer for a capital defense and there are no rich people on death row i couldve squeezed five or ten thousand bucks out of the family made em mortgage their house again something like that but why bother the fine folks of chester county would pay this is one of the great ironies of the death penalty the people want the death penaltysomething like percent in this stateyet they have no idea how much theyre paying for it how much have they paid she asked deftly inserting the question before he could start talking again oh i dont know a lot bonnie how much have we been paid so far with no hesitation and hardly a glance over her shoulder bonnie said almost robbie went on barely skipping a beat that includes attorneys fees at the rate of an hour plus expenses primarily for investigators and then a nice chunk for expert witnesses thats a lot of money martha said it is and it isnt when a law firm is working for an hour its losing serious money ill never do it again i cant afford it neither can the taxpayers but at least i know im losing my ass they do not ask the average joe on main street in slone how much he and his fellow citizens have paid to prosecute donte drumm and you know what hell say how am i supposed to hell say he doesnt have a clue have you heard about the tooley boys in west texas its a famous case im sorry i mustve missed these two brothers the tooleys a couple of idiots somewhere out in west texas what county bonnie mingo mingo county very rural a great story listen these two thugs are robbing convenience stores and gas stations very sophisticated stuff one night something goes wrong and a young female clerk gets shot sawedoff shotgun really nasty they catch the tooley brothers because the boys forgot about all of the video cameras the town is outraged the police are strutting the prosecutor is promising swift justice everybody wants a quick trial and quick execution theres not much crime in mingo county and no jury there has ever sent a man to death row now there are many ways to feel neglected in texas but living in a community thats been left out of the execution business is downright embarrassing what do the kinfolks in houston think these mingo people see their opportunity they want blood the boys refuse to pleabargain because the prosecutor insists on death why plead to death so they try them together quick convictions and finally death on appeal the court finds all manner of error the prosecutor really butchered the case the convictions are thrown out the case is sent back for separate trials two trials not one are you taking notes no im searching for some relevance here its a great story thats all that matters a year or so passes the boys are tried separately two new guilty verdicts two more trips to death row the appeals court sees more problems i mean glaring problems the prosecutor was a moron reversals sent back for two new trials the third time one jury convicts the gunman of murder and he gets life the other jury convicts the one who didnt fire the gun of murder and he gets death go figure its texas so one brother is serving life the other went to death row where he committed suicide a few months later somehow he got a razor and slashed himself and your point is heres the point from start to finish the case cost mingo county million they were forced to raise property taxes several times and this led to an uprising there were drastic budget cuts in schools road maintenance and health services they closed their only library the county was near bankruptcy for years and all of it could have been prevented if the prosecutor had allowed the boys to plead guilty and take life without parole ive heard that the death penalty is not that popular in mingo county now i was more interested in from soup to nuts it takes about two million bucks to legally kill a man in texas compare that with the it costs per year to keep one on death row ive heard this before martha said and indeed she had robbie never shied away from his soapbox especially when the subject was the death penalty one of his many favorites but what the hell we have plenty of money in texas can we talk about donte drumms case oh why not the defense fund you established a few years back a certified nonprofit governed by all relevant code sections set forth by the internal revenue service administered jointly by my office and andrea bolton younger sister of donte drumm receipts so far total how much bonnie ninetyfive thousand dollars ninetyfive thousand dollars and how much is on hand zero thats what i figured would you like a breakdown of where the money went maybe where did it go litigation expenses law firm expenses expert witnesses a few bucks to the family to travel back and forth to see donte not exactly a highpowered nonprofit all moneys have been raised through the internet frankly we havent had the time or manpower to pursue fundraising who are the donors mostly brits and europeans the average donation is something like twenty bucks eighteen fifty bonnie said its very hard to raise money for a convicted murderer regardless of his story how much are you out of pocket martha asked there was no rapid response bonnie finally stumped gave a slight shrug from the front seat i dont know robbie said if i had to guess it would be at least maybe a hundred maybe i shouldve spent more phones were buzzing throughout the van sammie at the office had a question for the boss kristi hinze was talking to another psychiatrist aaron was listening to someone as he drove the party began early with sweet potato biscuits straight from reevas oven she loved to cook them and eat them and when sean fordyce admitted hed never eaten one she feigned disbelief by the time he arrived with his hairdresser makeup girl appointment secretary and publicist all hustling around him the home of reeva and wallis pike was crammed with neighbors and friends the thick smell of fried country ham wafted out the front door two long trucks were backed into the driveway and even the crew members were chomping on biscuits fordyce an irish ass from long island was slightly irritated by the crowd but put on his game face and signed autographs he was the star these were his fans they bought his books watched his show and gave him his ratings he posed for a few photographs ate a biscuit with ham and seemed to like it he was pudgy with a doughy face not exactly the traditional looks of a star but that didnt matter anymore he wore dark suits and funky eyeglasses that made him appear far more intelligent than he acted the set was in reevas room the large addition stuck to the rear of the house like a cancerous growth reeva and wallis were situated on a sofa with color blowups of nicole as the backdrop wallis wore a tie and looked as if hed just been ordered out of his bedroom which in fact he had reeva was heavily made up her hair freshly colored and permed and she wore her finest black dress fordyce sat in a chair close to them he was tended to by his handlers who sprayed his hair and powdered his forehead the crew fussed with the lighting sound checks were done monitors were adjusted the neighbors were packed in tight behind the cameras with stern instructions not to make a sound the producer said quiet were rolling closeup on fordyce as he welcomed his audience to another episode he explained where he was whom he was interviewing and the basis of the crime the confession and the conviction if all goes as expected he said gravely mr drumm will be executed the day after tomorrow he introduced the mother and the stepfather and of course passed along his condolences for this tragedy he thanked them for opening their home so that the world through his cameras could witness the suffering he began with nicole tell us about her he almost pleaded wallis made no effort to speak something he would do throughout the interview this was reevas show she was excited and overstimulated and after just a few words began crying but she had cried in public for so long that she could now chatter away while the tears flowed she went on and on about her daughter do you miss her fordyce asked one of his patented inane questions designed only to elicit more emotion reeva gave it to him he handed her the white handkerchief from his coat pocket linen the man oozed compassion he finally got around to the execution which was the thrust of his program do you still plan to be there he asked certain of the answer oh yes she said and wallis managed to nod why what will it mean to you it means so much she said the thought of revenge dried the tears this animal took my daughters life he deserves to die and i want to be there to stare him in the eyes when he takes his last breath do you think hell look at you i doubt it hes a coward any human who could do what he did to my precious little girl i doubt hell be man enough to look at me what about his last words do you want an apology yes but im not expecting one he has never taken responsibility for what he did he confessed yes but then he changed his mind and hes denied it ever since i expect hell deny it when they strap him down and he says goodbye anticipate for us reeva tell us how you think youll feel when hes pronounced dead just the thought made her smile but she quickly caught herself relief sadness i dont know itll be the closing of another chapter in a long sad story but it wont be the end wallis frowned slightly upon learning this whats the final chapter here reeva when you lose a child sean especially one taken in such a violent way there is no end there is no end he repeated somberly then turned to the camera and with every effort at great drama said again there is no end they took a quick break moved some cameras and added more spray to fordyces hair and when they rolled again he managed to get a few grunts from wallis stuff that wouldnt last ten seconds in editing the filming was over in less than an hour fordyce made a quick exithe was also working on an execution in florida he made sure everyone knew there was a jet waiting to take him there one of his camera crews would hang around slone for the next two days hoping for violence fordyce would be in huntsville on thursday night looking for drama praying the execution would not be put off his favorite part of his show was the postexecution interview when he got the victims family fresh from the prison they were usually emotional wrecks and he knew that reeva would light up the screen chapter it took dana almost two hours of persistent calling and cajoling to find the right deputy clerk willing to dig through the right record logs to determine that yes in fact one travis boyette was arrested for drunk driving in slone texas on january after he was jailed more serious charges were added he had posted bond then skipped town the charges were dismissed and the file was closed when mr boyette was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison in kansas the clerk explained the procedure in slone was to dispose of cases that would not or could not be pursued there were no outstanding warrants on him at least not in slone and chester county keith whod been unable to sleep and brewed the first pot of coffee at am called mr flaks office the first time at am he was not entirely certain what he would say to the lawyer if he got him on the phone but he and dana had decided they could not sit by and do nothing when he was stiffarmed by flaks receptionist he called another lawyer matthew burns was an assistant prosecutor and an active member of st marks he and keith were the same age and had coached their sons tball teams together luckily burns was not in trial tuesday morning but was still quite busy in court with first appearances and other routine matters keith found the right courtroom one of several in the courthouse and from a seat in the back row watched the flow of justice after an hour he was fidgeting and ready to leave though he wasnt sure where to go burns finished another appearance before the judge stuffed his paperwork into his briefcase and headed for the door he nodded at keith who followed they found a quiet place in the bustling corridors a wellused wooden bench near a stairwell you look like hell burns began pleasantly thanks im not sure thats a nice way to greet your minister i couldnt sleep last night matthew not one minute did you look at the web site yes for about ten minutes at the office id never heard of drumm but then these cases tend to run together now theyre pretty routine down there drumms innocent matthew keith said with a certainty that surprised his friend well thats what the web site says but hes not the first killer who claimed to be innocent the two had rarely talked about the law or any issue related to the death penalty keith assumed that as a prosecutor matthew supported it the killer is here in topeka matthew he was in church sunday morning probably in a pew not far from you and your family you have my attention hes just been paroled spending ninety days at the halfway house and hes dying of a brain tumor he stopped by the office yesterday for counseling he has a long history of sexual assaults ive talked to him twice and hes admitted in confidence of course he raped and killed the girl he knows where the body is buried he doesnt want drumm to be executed but he doesnt want to come forward either hes a mess matthew a real sick psycho wholl be dead himself in a few months matthew exhaled and shook his head as if hed been slapped may i ask why youre in the middle of this i dont know i just am i know the truth the question is how does one go about stopping an execution good god keith yes ive talked to him too and im still waiting on his guidance but until it comes i need some from you ive called the defense lawyers office in texas but that went nowhere dont you have to keep these matters in confidence yes and i will but what if the murderer decides to come clean to tell the truth to try to save this man from being executed what then how do we go about it we not so fast buddy help me here matthew i dont understand the law ive read the web site until im crosseyed and the more i read the more confused i become how do you convict a man of murder when there is no dead body how do you believe a confession that was so obviously coerced by the police why are jailhouse snitches allowed to testify in return for lighter sentences how can a black defendant get an allwhite jury how can the jurors be so blind where are the appellate courts i have a long list of questions and i cant answer all of them keith seems though that the only important one is the firsthow do you stop the execution im asking you pal youre the lawyer okay okay let me think for a minute you need some coffee dont you yes ive only had a gallon they walked down a flight of stairs to a small canteen where they found a table in a corner keith bought the coffee and when he sat down matthew said you gotta have the body if your man can produce the body then drumms lawyers could probably get a stay from the courts if not the governor might delay the execution im not sure how the mechanics work down there every state is different without the body though your man will sound like just another quack that shows up looking for attention keep in mind keith that there will be the usual lastminute filings these deathpenalty lawyers know how to play the system and a lot of executions get delayed you may have more time than you think texas is pretty efficient good point two years ago drumm came within a week of execution something clicked in a federal court filing dont ask me what i read it last night and im still confused anyway according to the web site a lastminute miracle is unlikely now drumms had his miracle his luck has run out finding the body is crucial thats the only clear proof that your man is telling the truth do you know where it is if you do dont tell me just tell me if you know no hes told me the state the nearby town the general location but hes also said that he hid it so well he may have trouble finding it is it in texas missouri matthew shook his head he took a long drink and said what if this guy is just another lying con keith i see a dozen a day they lie about everything they lie out of habit they lie when the truth would be of far greater help to themselves they lie on the witness stand and they lie to their own lawyers and the longer they stay in prison the more they lie he has her class ring matthew wears it on a cheap little chain around his neck he stalked the girl he was obsessed with her he showed me the ring i held it and inspected it youre sure its real if you saw it you would say its real another long drink matthew glanced at his watch you gotta go five minutes is this guy willing to go to texas and proclaim the truth i dont know he says that if he leaves this jurisdiction he violates his parole hes not lying about that but if hes dying why does he really care i asked him that his answer was vague plus the guy has no money no way to get down there he has zero credibility no one will give him the time of day why did you call the lawyer because im desperate matthew i believe this guy and i believe drumms innocent maybe drumms lawyer will know what to do i dont know there was a gap in the conversation matthew nodded and spoke to two other lawyers at the next table he glanced at his watch again one last question keith said just a hypothetical one what if i convinced this guy to hustle down to texas as soon as possible and start telling his story you just said he cant get there yes but what if i take him no hell no keith youd be aiding in the violation of his parole agreement absolutely not how serious is that im not sure but it could get you embarrassed maybe even defrocked for all you know i doubt if you would serve time but it would be painful enough how is he supposed to get down there i thought you said he hasnt decided to go but if he does take it one step at a time keith the third glance at his watch look i gotta run lets meet somewhere for a quick lunch and finish this conversation good idea theres a deli down the street at the corner of seventh its called eppies we can get a booth in the back and have a quiet chat i know the place see you at noon the same excon with the permanent scowl was working the front desk at anchor house he was quite busy with a crossword and did not appreciate the interruption boyette was not there he said curtly keith pressed gently is he at work hes at the hospital took him in last night what happened fits and seizures is all i know dudes really messed up in more ways than one which hospital i didnt drive the ambulance and with that he returned to his crossword and the conversation was over keith found his patient on the third floor of st francis hospital in a semiprivate room next to the window a flimsy curtain separated the two beds as a minister making his rounds and a familiar face at that keith told the nurse that mr boyette had visited his church and needed to see him nothing more was needed boyette was awake and had an iv tube taped to his left hand he smiled when he saw keith and offered a limp right hand for a quick shake thanks for coming pastor he said with a weak scratchy voice how do you feel travis five seconds passed he raised his left hand slightly and said some pretty good drugs i feel better what happened keith asked though he thought he knew boyette looked at the window though he could see nothing but a gray sky ten seconds passed after you left pastor i got real upset the headaches hit hard and wouldnt go away then i blacked out and they brought me here said i was shaking and jerking im sorry travis most of its your fault pastor you did it you got me all stressedout im very sorry but please remember that you came to see me travis you wanted my help you told me about donte drumm and nicole yarber two people id never heard of you said what you said i didnt initiate our contact true he closed his eyes his breathing was heavy and labored there was a long pause keith leaned over and almost in a whisper said are you there travis yes then listen to me i have a plan you want to hear it sure first we make a video of you telling your story you admit what you did to nicole you explain that donte had nothing to do with her abduction and death you tell everything travis and you tell where shes buried give as much detail as possible so that with some luck they might be able to find her we do the video now here in the hospital and once i have it ill zip it down to texas to dontes lawyers to the prosecutor the judge the police the appeals courts the governor and every newspaper and television station down there so they will know everybody will know ill do this electronically so theyll have it in a matter of minutes then for the second part of my plan you give me the ring ill photograph it and send the pictures to all the folks i just mentioned also by internet ill send the ring by overnight delivery to dontes lawyers and theyll have the physical evidence what about it travis you can tell your story and never leave this hospital bed the eyes never opened are you there travis a grunt uhhuh itll work travis we cant waste any more time it is a waste of time what is there to lose just the life of an innocent man you called me a liar last night thats because you lied did you find my arrest record in slone we did so i wasnt lying not about that and youre not lying about donte drumm thank you im going to sleep now come on travis itll take less than fifteen minutes to make the video i can even do it now with my cell phone if you want youre hurting my head again pastor i feel a seizure you need to leave now and please dont come back keith stood straight and took a deep breath to make sure things were clear boyette repeated himself but much louder you need to leave pastor and please dont come back in the rear of eppies the two settled over large bowls of beef stew matthew pulled some notes out of a pocket and spoke with a mouthful theres no code section directly on point but you would probably be charged with obstruction of justice dont even think about taking that guy to texas i just talked to our man he is our man i didnt realize id been drafted hes in the hospital had seizures last night the tumor is quickly killing him hes lost his desire to help the cause hes a creep a psychopath probably crazy before the tumor took over his brain why did he come to church probably to get out of the halfway house for a few hours no i shouldnt say that ive seen real emotion from this guy real guilt and a fleeting desire to do whats right dana found one of his former parole officers in arkansas the officer talked a little and said that our man was a member of some white supremacist gang in prison donte drumm of course is black and so im questioning how much sympathy is really there youre not eating matthew said as he took a bite im not hungry i have another idea you are not going to texas they would probably shoot you down there okay okay heres the idea what if you call the lawyer for donte drumm i couldnt get past the receptionist im just a humble servant of the lord but youre a lawyer a prosecutor and you speak their language and what might i say to him you could say that you have reason to believe that the real killer is here in topeka matthew chewed a mouthful and waited he said is that all just like that this lawyer gets a weird phone call from me i say what i say which isnt much and thats supposed to give the lawyer new ammunition to file in court and stop the execution am i right here keith i know you can be more persuasive than that try this scenario this creep is your typical pathological liar whos about to diepoor guy and he decides to go out with a bang decides to get one last shot of revenge at a system thats beaten him up he learns of this case in texas does his research realizes that the body has never been found and presto hes got his story he finds the web site and becomes fluent in the facts and now hes toying with you can you imagine the attention this guy would get but his health wont cooperate leave it alone keith hes probably a fake how would he hear about the case its been in the newspapers how would he find the web site you ever hear of google he does not have access to computers hes been at lansing for the past six years prisoners do not have access to the internet you should know that can you imagine what would happen if they did access plus all that idle time no software in the world would be safe he does not have access to a computer at the halfway house this guy is fortyfour years old matthew and has spent most of his adult life in prison hes probably terrified of computers what about drumms confession that doesnt bother you of course it does but according to his web site keith come on that web site is run by his lawyers talk about slanted its so onesided it loses credibility what about the ring its a high school ring one of a billion not exactly difficult to produce or replicate keiths shoulders sagged and slumped and he was suddenly very tired he lacked the energy to keep arguing you need some sleep my friend matthew said and you need to forget this case maybe youre right i think i am and if the execution happens thursday dont beat yourself up the odds are heavy that they have the right guy spoken like a true prosecutor who just happens to be a friend chapter on october two weeks after he was convicted donte drumm arrived on death row at the ellis unit at the prison in huntsville a town of thirtyfive thousand about ninety miles north of downtown houston he was processed and issued the standard wardrobe of two sets of white shirts and pants two white jumpsuits four pairs of boxers two white tshirts one pair of rubber shower shoes one thin blanket and one small pillow he was also given a toothbrush a tube of toothpaste a plastic comb and one roll of toilet paper he was assigned to a small cell with one concrete bunk and a stainless steel toilet and sink he became one of male inmates on death row there were twentytwo condemned women housed at another prison near gatesville texas because he had no record of bad behavior in prison he was classified as a level i as such he was allowed a few extra privileges he could work up to four hours a day in the garment factory on death row he could spend his exercise time in a yard with a few other inmates he could shower once a day alone without supervision he could participate in religious services craft workshops and educational programs he could receive a maximum of a month from the outside he could purchase a television a radio writing supplies and some food from the commissary and he was allowed visitors twice a week those who violated the rules were demoted to level ii where the privileges were curtailed the bad boys were reduced to level iii where all goodies were taken away though he had been in a county jail for almost a year the shock of death row was overwhelming the noise was relentlessloud radios and televisions the constant banter of the other inmates the shouts from the guards the whistling and gurgling from the old plumbing pipes and the banging of the cell doors being opened and closed in one letter to his mother he wrote the racket never stops never i try to ignore it and for an hour or so i can but then someone will scream or start singing badly and a guard will yell and everybody will laugh this goes on at all hours the radios and televisions are turned off at ten at night and thats when the loudmouths start their foolishness living like an animal in a cage is bad enough but the noise is driving me crazy but he soon learned that he could endure the confinement and the rituals he wasnt sure though if he could live without his family and friends he missed his brothers and sister and father but the thought of being permanently separated from his mother was enough to make him weep he cried for hours always with his face down in the dark and very quietly death row is a nightmare for serial killers and ax murderers for an innocent man its a life of mental torture that the human spirit is not equipped to survive his sentence of death took on a new meaning on november when desmond jennings was executed for killing two people during a bad drug deal the following day john lamb was executed for the murder of a traveling salesman the day after lamb had been paroled from prison the next day november jose gutierrez was executed for an armed robbery and murder he committed with his brother the brother had been executed five years earlier jennings had been on death row for four years lamb sixteen gutierrez ten a guard told donte that the average stay on death row before execution was ten years which he said proudly was the shortest in the nation once again texas was number one but dont worry the guard said its the longest ten years of your life and of course the last ha ha three weeks later on december david long was executed for the hatchet slayings of three women in a dallas suburb during his trial long told the jury he would kill again if not given the death penalty the jury obliged on december james beathard was executed for another triple homicide five days later robert atworth was executed after only three years on death row the following day sammie felder was executed after a twentythreeyear wait after felders death donte wrote a letter to robbie flak in which he said hey man these dudes are serious around here seven killings in four weeks sammie was number since they got the green light a few years back hes also number for this year and theyve got scheduled for next year you got to do something man living conditions went from bad to worse administrators within the texas department of criminal justice tdcj were in the process of moving death row from huntsville to the polunsky unit near the town of livingston forty miles away though no official reason was given the move came after an unsuccessful escape attempt by five condemned prisoners four were captured within the prison the fifth one was found floating in a river cause of death unknown not long thereafter the decision was made to tighten security and move the men to polunsky after four months in huntsville donte was shackled and put on a bus with twenty others at the new place he was assigned to a cell that measured six feet by ten feet there were no windows the door was solid metal with a small square opening so the guards could look in below it was a narrow slot for a food tray the cell was enclosed no bars to look through no way to see another human it was a cramped bunker of concrete and steel the people who ran the prison decided that a twentythreehouraday lockup was the proper way to control the prisoners and prevent escape and violence virtually all forms of inmate contact were eliminated no work programs religious services group recreation nothing that would allow human interaction televisions were banned for one hour each day donte was led to a day room a small enclosed indoor space not much larger than his cell there alone and watched by a guard he was supposed to enjoy whatever recreation he could fabricate in his mind twice a week weather permitting he was taken outside to a small semigrassy area known as the dog kennel for an hour he could look at the sky remarkably he soon found himself longing for the nonstop noise he had so despised at huntsville after a month in polunsky in a letter to robbie flak he wrote for twentythree hours a day im locked in this closet the only time i speak to another person is when the guards bring food or what they call food around here so all i see is guards not the kinds of people id choose im surrounded by murderers real murderers and id rather talk to them than talk to the guards everything in here is designed to make life as bad as possible take mealtime they feed us breakfast at three in the morning why nobody knows and nobody asks they wake us up to feed us crap that most dogs would run from lunch is at three in the afternoon supper is at ten at night cold eggs and white bread for breakfast sometimes applesauce and pancakes peanut butter sandwiches for lunch sometimes baloney bad baloney rubber chicken and instant mashed potatoes for supper some judge somewhere said that were entitled to twentytwo hundred calories a dayim sure you know thisand if they figure theyre a little short they just pile on some more white bread its always stale yesterday for lunch i got five slices of white bread cold pork and beans and a chunk of moldy cheddar cheese can we sue over the food probably already been done but i can take the food i can take the searches at all hours i think i can handle anything robbie but im not sure about the solitary confinement please do something he became even more depressed and despondent and was sleeping twelve hours a day to fight boredom he replayed every football game of his high school career he pretended to be a radio announcer calling the action adding the color always with the great donte drumm as the star he rattled off the names of his teammates everyone but joey gamble and gave fictitious names to his opponents twelve games for his sophomore season thirteen for his junior and whereas marshall had beaten slone both years in the playoffs donte would have none of it in prison the slone warriors won those games and advanced until they slaughtered odessa permian in the championship game in cowboys stadium in front of seventyfive thousand fans donte was the most valuable player mr texas football for both years something that had never been done before after the games after hed signed off his broadcasts donte wrote letters his goal each day was to write at least five he read his bible for hours and memorized verses of scripture when robbie filed another thick brief in another court donte read every word and to prove it he wrote long grateful letters to his lawyer but after a year in isolation he began to fear that he was losing his memory the scores of his old games slipped away names of teammates were forgotten he couldnt rattle off the twentyseven books of the new testament he was lethargic and couldnt shake his depression his mind was disintegrating he was sleeping sixteen hours a day and eating half the food they brought him on march two events almost pushed him over the edge the first was a letter from his mother it was three pages long in the handwriting that he treasured and after he read the first page he quit he could not finish reading a letter he wanted to and he knew that he should but his eyes would not focus and his mind would not process her words two hours later he received the news that the texas court of criminal appeals had affirmed his conviction he wept for a long time then stretched out on his bunk and stared at the ceiling in a semicatatonic fog he didnt move for hours he refused lunch in the last game of his junior year in the playoffs against marshall his left hand had been stepped on by a threehundredpound offensive tackle three fingers were crushed and broken the pain was instant and so intense that he almost passed out a trainer taped the fingers together and on the next series donte was back in the game for almost the entire second half he played like a wild man the pain made him crazy between plays he stood stoically and watched the offensive huddle never once shaking his hand never touching it in no way acknowledging the pain that made his eyes water from somewhere he found the iron will and the incredible toughness to finish the game though hed forgotten that score too he vowed to reach down again reach into the depths of his gut and the subconscious layers of a brain that was failing him and find the will to stop his slide into insanity he managed to pull himself off the bed he fell to the floor and did twenty pushups then he did situps until his abdomen ached he ran in place until he could no longer lift his feet squats leg lifts more pushups and situps when he was covered in sweat he sat down and made a schedule at five each morning he would begin a precise series of exercises and work nonstop for sixty minutes at am he would write two letters at am he would memorize a new verse of scripture and so on his goal was a thousand pushups and situps a day he would write ten letters and not just to his family and close friends he would find some new pen pals he would read at least one book a day he would cut his sleep in half he would begin a journal these goals were printed neatly labeled the routine and stuck to the wall beside his metal mirror donte found the enthusiasm to stick to his regimen he attacked it each morning after a month he was doing twelve hundred pushups and situps a day and the hard muscles felt good the exercise brought the blood back to his brain the reading and writing opened new worlds a young girl in new zealand wrote him a letter and he shot one right back her name was millie she was fifteen years old and her parents approved the correspondence but they monitored his letters when she sent a small photo of herself donte fell in love he was soon doing two thousand pushups and situps spurred on by the dream of one day meeting millie his journal was filled with graphic erotic scenes of the couple as they traveled the world she wrote him once a month and for every letter she mailed she got at least three in return roberta drumm made the decision not to tell donte his father was dying of heart disease and when during one of her many routine visits she told him his father was dead dontes fragile world began to crack again the knowledge that his father had died before he could walk out of prison fully exonerated proved too much he allowed himself to break his rigid routine he skipped a day then a second he couldnt stop crying and trembling then millie dropped him her letters arrived around the fifteenth of each month every month for over two years plus cards for his birthday and christmas for a reason donte would never know they stopped he sent her letter after letter and received nothing in return he accused the prison guards of tampering with his mail and even convinced robbie to make some threats gradually though he accepted the fact that she was gone he fell into a dark and long depression with no interest in the routine he began a hunger strike didnt eat for ten days but gave it up when no one seemed to care he went weeks with no exercise no reading no journal entries and letters only to his mother and robbie before long hed forgotten the old football scores again and could only recall a few of the more famous scripture verses he would stare at the ceiling for hours mumbling over and over jesus im losing my mind the visitors room at polunsky is a large open area with plenty of tables and chairs and vending machines along the walls in the center there is a long row of booths all divided by glass the inmates sit on one side their visitors on the other and all conversations are by phone behind the inmates guards are always looming watching to one side there are three booths used for attorney visits they too are divided by glass and all consultations are by phone in the early years donte was thrilled at the sight of robbie flak sitting at the narrow counter on the other side of the glass robbie was his lawyer his friend his fierce defender and robbie was the man who would right this incredible wrong robbie was fighting hard and loud and threatening hellfire for those who were mistreating his client so many of the condemned had bad lawyers on the outside or no lawyers at all their appeals had run the system was finished with them no one out there was advocating on their behalf but donte had mr robbie flak and he knew at some moment in each day his lawyer was thinking about him and scheming a new way to get him out but after eight years on death row donte had lost hope he had not lost faith in robbie hed simply realized that the texas systems were much more powerful than one lawyer absent a miracle this wrong would run its course robbie had explained that they would file motions until the very end but he was also realistic they spoke through the phone each happy to see the other robbie brought greetings from the entire drumm family hed visited their home the night before and gave all the details donte listened with a smile but said little his conversational skills had deteriorated along with everything else physically he was a skinny stooped aging man of twentyseven mentally he was a mess he could not keep up with time never knew if it was night or day often skipped meals showers and his daily hour of recreation he refused to say a word to the guards and often had trouble following their most basic commands they were somewhat sympathetic because they knew he was not a threat he sometimes slept eighteen to twenty hours a day and when he wasnt asleep he was unable to do anything he had not exercised in years he never read and managed to write a letter or two each week but only to his family and robbie the letters were short often incoherent and filled with misspelled words and glaring grammatical errors the writing was so sloppy that it was disheartening a letter from donte was not a pleasant envelope to open dr kristi hinze had read and analyzed hundreds of letters hed written during his eight years on death row she had already formed the opinion that the solitary confinement had driven him far from reality he was depressed lethargic delusional paranoid schizophrenic and suicidal he was hearing voices those of his late father and his high school football coach in laymans terms his brain had shut down he was insane after a few minutes of summarizing where they were with the lastminute appeals and covering the events scheduled for the next two days robbie introduced dr hinze she took the seat and the phone and said hello robbie stood close behind her with a legal pad and pen for over an hour she asked questions about his daily routine his habits dreams thoughts desires and feelings about death he surprised her by saying that men had been executed while he had been on death row robbie confirmed the number to be accurate but there were no more surprises no more specifics she quizzed him at length about the reasons he was there and why he was to be executed he did not know did not understand why they were doing this to him yes he was certain that he was about to be executed just look at the other one hour was enough for dr hinze she handed the phone back to robbie who sat down and began talking about the details for thursday he told donte that his mother was determined to watch the execution and this upset him he began crying and finally put the phone down to wipe his face he refused to pick it up and when he stopped crying he locked his arms across his chest and stared at the floor finally he stood and walked to the door behind him the rest of the team waited outside in the van a guard nearby casually watching them when robbie and dr hinze returned to the van aaron waved at the guard and drove away they stopped at a pizza place on the edge of town and had a quick lunch they had just settled back in the van and were leaving livingston when the phone rang it was fred pryor joey gamble had called and wanted to meet for a drink after work chapter in a normal week reverend schroeder would spend most of tuesday afternoon locked in his office with the phones on hold as he searched for his next sermons topic he looked at current events thought about the needs of his flock prayed a lot and if nothing happened would go to the files and look at old sermons when the idea finally hit he would write a quick outline and then begin the full text at that point the pressure was off and he could practice and rehearse until sunday few things felt worse though than waking up on wednesday morning with no idea what he would say on sunday but with travis boyette on his mind he could concentrate on nothing else he took a long nap after lunch tuesday and felt thickheaded almost groggy when it was over dana had left the office to tend to the children and keith puttered around the church unable to do anything productive he finally left he thought about driving to the hospital and checking on boyette in hopes that perhaps the tumor had shifted and the man had changed his mind but that was unlikely while dana cooked dinner and the boys were busy with homework keith found solitude in the garage his latest project was to organize it paint it and then plan to keep it shipshape forever he usually enjoyed the mindless cleaning but boyette managed to ruin even that after half an hour he gave up and took his laptop to their bedroom and locked the door the drumm web site was like a magnet a thick juicy novel with so much he had not yet read t he k offee g rale s candal the prosecution of donte drumm was led by paul koffee the district attorney for slone and chester county the presiding judge at dontes trial was vivian grale both koffee and grale were elected officials at the time of the trial koffee had been in office for thirteen years grale had been on the bench for five koffee was married to his wife sara and they had and still have three children grale was married to her husband frank and they had and still have two children the koffees are now divorced as are the grales the only significant motion filed by the defense that was granted by judge grale was a request to change the venue of the trial given its sensational nature and extensive coverage in the media a fair trial was impossible in slone attorneys for donte wanted to move it far away and they suggested either amarillo or lubbock each about five hundred miles from slone judge grale granted the requestexperts agree that she really had no choice to have the trial in slone would have been to create certain reversible errorand she decided to hold it in paris texas the courthouse in paris is exactly fortynine miles from the courthouse in slone after the conviction attorneys for donte argued vehemently on appeal that trying the case in paris was no different from trying it in slone indeed during the jury selection process over half of the prospective jurors admitted they had heard something about the case other than the change of venue judge grale showed no patience with the defense her most crucial ruling was to allow dontes coerced confession without it the prosecution had no case no evidence nothing the confession was their case but other rulings were almost as damaging the police and prosecutors used a favorite tactic when they produced a jailhouse snitch by the name of ricky stone stone was in jail on drug charges and agreed to cooperate with detective kerber and the slone police he was placed in a cell with donte drumm for four days then removed donte never saw him again until the trial stone testified that donte talked openly about the rape and murder of nicole and said that he went crazy after she broke up with him they had been dating secretly for several months they were in love but she became frightened and worried that her wealthy father would cut off the money if he knew she was seeing a black guy stone testified that he had been promised nothing by the prosecutor in return for his testimony two months after donte was convicted stone pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and walked out of jail stone had an extensive criminal record and zero credibility he was a classic jailhouse snitch fabricating testimony in return for a lighter sentence judge grale allowed him to testify stone later recanted and said hed been pressured by detective kerber and paul koffee to lie judge grale also permitted testimony that had been discredited for many years in many jurisdictions during the search for nicole the police used bloodhounds to sniff around for clues the dogs were given a scent from nicoles car and some articles in it and turned loose the trails led nowhere that is until donte was arrested the police then allowed the bloodhounds to sniff through the green ford van owned by the drumm family according to the dogs handler the dogs became excited agitated and showed every sign of picking up nicoles scent in the van this unreliable testimony was first played out in a pretrial hearing attorneys for donte were incredulous and demanded to know how they were supposed to crossexamine a bloodhound attorney robbie flak was so outraged that he called one of the dogs a bloodhound named yogi a stupid son of a bitch judge grale held him in contempt and fined him remarkably the dogs principal handler was still allowed to testify at trial and stated to the jury that after thirty years of experience with bloodhounds he was absolutely certain that yogi had picked up nicoles scent in the green van he was eviscerated on crossexamination by robbie flak who at one point demanded to have the dog brought to the courtroom sworn in and put in the witness chair judge grale exhibited animosity toward the defense lawyers especially robbie flak she was much more agreeable with paul koffee and with good reason six years after the trial it became known that the judge and the prosecutor were involved in a longrunning illicit romance the affair came to light when a disgruntled exsecretary in mr koffees office filed a claim for sexual harassment and produced emails phone records and even phone recordings that revealed her exbosss involvement with judge grale lawsuits followed as did divorces judge grale resigned from the bench in disgrace and left slone while her divorce was pending paul koffee was reelected without opposition in but only after promising to quit when the term was over attorneys for donte sought relief because of the obvious conflict of interest between the judge and the prosecutor the texas court of criminal appeals said that while the affair was unfortunate and could possibly give the appearance of impropriety it did not violate the defendants right to a fair trial relief in the federal courts was just as elusive in paul koffee filed a defamation suit against robbie flak for statements flak made in an interview about koffees intimate involvement with his trial judge flak countersued koffee for a myriad of offenses the litigation is still pending hours later when the lights were off and the house was quiet keith and dana stared at the ceiling and debated whether they should go look for the sleeping pills both were exhausted but sleep seemed impossible they were tired of reading about the case discussing it tired of worrying about a young black man on death row whom they had never heard of until the day before and they were especially frustrated with the newest person in their lives one travis boyette keith was certain he was telling the truth dana was leaning that way but was still skeptical because of his disgusting criminal record they were tired of arguing about it if boyette was telling the truth could they be the only people in the world who knew for certain that texas was about to execute the wrong man if so what could they do how could they do anything if boyette refused to admit the truth and if he changed his mind and decided to admit the truth what were they supposed to do about it slone was four hundred miles away and they didnt know anyone there why should they theyd never heard of the place until yesterday the questions raged through the night and the answers were nowhere to be found they decided to watch the digital clock until midnight and if still awake go find the pills at pm the phone rang and startled them dana hit a light switch the caller id read st fran hospital its him she said keith picked up the receiver and said hello sorry to call so late pastor boyette said in a low strained voice its okay travis we were not asleep hows your cute little wife fine look travis im sure youre calling for a reason yes sorry pastor i really want to see the girl again you know what i mean keith held the receiver so dana could squeeze in with her left ear he did not want to repeat everything afterward im not sure what you mean travis he said the girl nicole my little nikki im not long for this world pastor im still in the hospital an iv in my arm all kinds of dope in my blood and the doctors are telling me that it wont be long im halfdead now pastor and i dont like the thought of kicking the bucket without one last visit with nikki shes been dead for nine years no shit i was there remember it was awful what i did to her was just awful and ive apologized before several times facetoface but i gotta go again tell her just once more how sorry i am about what happened you know what i mean pastor no travis i have no idea what you mean shes still there okay shes where i left her you said you probably couldnt find her now there was a long pause as travis seemed to recall this i know where she is he said great travis then go find her go dig her up and look at her bones and tell her youre sorry then what youll feel better about yourself meanwhile an innocent man gets the needle for your crime i have an idea travis after you tell nicole youre sorry one last time why dont you go to slone and stop by the cemetery find dontes grave and tell him youre sorry too dana turned and frowned at her husband travis took another pause and then said i dont want that boy to die pastor thats really hard to believe travis youve kept quiet for nine years while hes been accused and persecuted youve wasted yesterday and today and if you keep flipflopping the time will run out and hell be dead i cant stop it you can try you can go to slone and tell the authorities where the body is buried you can admit the truth show them the ring make plenty of noise im sure the reporters and cameras would love you who knows maybe a judge or the governor will take notice i dont have a lot of experience in these matters travis but it seems to me that they might find it difficult to execute donte drumm when youre on television claiming you killed nicole and you acted alone i dont have a car rent one i havent had a drivers license in ten years take a bus i dont have the money for a bus ticket pastor ill loan you the money no ill give you the money for a oneway bus ticket to slone what if i have a seizure on the bus or black out hell they might kick me off in podunk oklahoma youre playing games travis you gotta take me reverend just me and you if youll drive me down there ill tell the truth about what really happened ill take them to the body we can stop the execution but you gotta go with me why me aint nobody else around right now pastor i have a better idea tomorrow morning lets go downtown to the prosecutors office i have a friend there you tell him the story maybe we can convince him to call the prosecutor in slone as well as the police chief and defense lawyer and i dont know maybe even a judge somewhere theyll listen to him a lot quicker than theyll listen to a lutheran minister who knows nothing about the criminal justice system we can video your statement send it immediately to the authorities in texas send it to the newspapers too how about it travis you wont violate parole i wont get in trouble by helping you dana was nodding her approval five seconds ten seconds finally travis said maybe itll work pastor maybe we can stop the execution but theres no way theyre finding her i have to be there for that lets concentrate on stopping it theyre discharging me tomorrow morning at nine ill be there travis the prosecutors office is not far away five seconds ten seconds i like it pastor lets do it at am dana found the bottle of overthecounter sleeping aids but an hour later they were still awake the trip to texas occupied them they had discussed it briefly once before but were so afraid of it they had not pursued the conversation the idea was ludicrouskeith in slone with a serial sex offender of dubious credibility trying to get someone to listen to a bizarre tale while the town counted down the final hours of donte drumm the unlikely pair would be ridiculed maybe even shot and upon his return to kansas the reverend keith schroeder could find himself accused of a crime for which there would be no defense his job and career could hang in the balance all because of a lowlife like travis boyette chapter wednesday morning six hours after leaving his office just after midnight robbie was back in the conference room preparing for another frantic day the night had not gone well the drinking session with fred pryor and joey gamble produced nothing except an admission by gamble that mr koffee had indeed called and reminded him of the penalties for perjury robbie had listened to the entire session pryor who over the years had become masterful with his recording devices had used the same pen mike and passed along their conversation through a cell phone the sound quality was remarkable robbie had enjoyed a few drinks along with them in his office with martha handler sipping bourbon and carlos the paralegal drinking beer and monitoring the speakerphone they all had enjoyed their booze for almost two hours joey and fred in a fake saloon somewhere outside of houston and the flak law firm hard at work at the office in the old train station after two hours though joey had had enougheven beersand said he was tired of being pressured he could not accept the reality that a lastminute affidavit signed by him would repudiate his testimony at trial he did not want to call himself a liar though he stopped short of admitting hed lied donte should not have confessed he said several times as if uttering a false confession were grounds enough for a death sentence but pryor would shadow him throughout wednesday and thursday if necessary he believed there was still a slight chance one that increased as the hours went by at am the firm gathered in the conference room for the daily briefing all were present all blearyeyed and fatigued and ready for the final push dr kristi hinze had worked through the night and finished her report she summarized it briefly while everyone ate pastries and gulped coffee the report was fortyfive pages long more than the court would want to read but maybe enough to get someones attention her findings surprised no one at least no one within the flak law firm she described her examination of donte drumm she had reviewed his medical and psychological history while in prison she had read letters he had written over the eight years hed been on death row he was schizophrenic psychotic delusional and depressed and did not understand what was happening to him she went on to condemn solitary confinement as a means of incarceration and again labeled it as a cruel form of torture robbie instructed sammie thomas to file their petition for relief with dr hinzes report attached in full to the firms cocounsel in austin throughout the appellate process all eight years of it robbies firm had been assisted by the texas capital defender group commonly referred to as the defender group a nonprofit that represented about percent of the inmates on death row the defender group did nothing but capital appeals and did so with great expertise and diligence sammie would send the petition and report electronically and at am the defender group would file hard copies with the court of criminal appeals with an execution looming the court was on alert and prepared to quickly address the lastminute filings if they were denied which they usually were robbie and the defender group could then run to federal court and fight their way up the mountain hoping for a miracle at some point he discussed these strategies and made certain everyone knew what was to be done carlos would be in charge of the drumm family the following day though he would remain in slone he was to make sure they arrived at polunsky on time for their final visit robbie would be there to make the final walk with his client and to witness the execution sammie thomas and the other associate would remain at the office and coordinate the filings with the defender group bonnie the paralegal would stay in touch with the offices of the governor and the attorney general the request for a reprieve had been filed with the governors office and its denial was being awaited the kristi hinze petition was ready to go unless and until joey gamble had a change of heart there was no new evidence to make a fuss about as the meeting dragged on it became evident that there was little of substance left to do the conversation waned the frenzy was beginning to subside everyone was suddenly tired the waiting had begun when vivian grale was elected to the bench in her campaign had been about high moral standards putting the laws of god first putting criminals in prison for even longer periods of time and of course more efficient use of the death chamber down at huntsville she won by thirty votes she defeated a wise and experienced judge by the name of elias henry and she did so by cherrypicking several criminal cases in which judge henry had dared to show compassion for the accused she splashed these around in ads that made him look like a coddler of pedophiles after her affair with paul koffee was exposed after her divorce and after she resigned and left slone in disgrace the voters repented and returned to judge henry he was reelected without opposition he was now eightyone years old and in declining health there were rumors that he might not be able to finish his term judge henry had been a close friend of robbies father who died in because of this friendship he was one of the few judges in east texas whose blood pressure did not spike when robbie flak walked into the courtroom elias henry was about the only judge robbie trusted at judge henrys invitation robbie agreed to meet in his chambers at am wednesday morning the purpose of the meeting was not discussed on the phone this case bothers me a great deal judge henry said after a few pleasantries were out of the way they were alone in an old office that had changed little in the forty years robbie had visited it the courtroom was next door and empty as well it should they both had unopened bottles of water in front of them on a worktable the judge as always wore a dark suit with an orange tie he was having a good day his eyes fierce and intense there were no smiles ive read the transcript robbie he said i started last week and ive read it all and most of the appellate briefs as well taking a view from the bench i cant believe judge grale allowed that confession into evidence it was coerced and blatantly unconstitutional it was judge and it is i wont defend her but she had little choice there was no other credible evidence if she tossed the confession then koffee had nowhere to go no conviction no defendant no suspect no dead body donte would have walked out of jail which would have been frontpage news as you well know judge grale had to face the voters and judges dont get reelected in east texas if they keep the law above politics tell me about it once he knew the confession would go to the jury koffee was able to piece together other evidence he stomped and strutted and convinced the jury that donte was the killer he pointed fingers at him and then he cried at the very mention of nicoles name quite a performance whats the old saying judge if you dont have the facts yelland he did a lot of yelling the jury was more than willing to believe him he won you fought like hell robbie shouldve fought harder and youre convinced hes innocent no doubt in your mind why are we having this discussion judge it seems rather moot at this point because im going to call the governor and ask for a reprieve maybe hell listen i dont know i wasnt the trial judge i was as we know retired at the time but i have a cousin in texarkana who gave the governor a ton of money its a long shot but whats there to lose whats wrong with delaying things another thirty days nothing youre having doubts about his guilt judge serious doubts i would not have admitted the confession i would have thrown the snitch in jail for lying i would have excluded that clown with his bloodhounds and the boy whats his name joey gamble right the white boyfriend his testimony would probably go to the jury but it was too inconsistent to carry weight you said it best in one of your briefs robbie this conviction is based on a bogus confession a dog named yogi a lying snitch who later recanted and a jilted lover bent on revenge we cant convict people with garbage such as this judge grale was biasedi guess we know why paul koffee was blinded by his own tunnel vision and the fear he might be wrong its a terrible case robbie thank you judge ive lived it for nine years and its dangerous i met with two black lawyers yesterday good guys you know them theyre angry with the system but theyre also afraid of the backlash they expect trouble if drumm is executed thats what i hear what can be done robbie is there a way to stop this im not a deathpenalty lawyer and i dont know where your appeals are right now the tank is almost empty judge were filing an insanity petition now and your chances slim donte has no record of mental illness until now were alleging that eight years on death row have driven him insane as you know the appeals courts usually frown on theories that are hatched at the last minute is the boy crazy he has severe problems but i suspect he knows whats happening so youre not optimistic im a criminal defense lawyer judge optimism is not in my dna judge henry finally unscrewed the cap off the plastic bottle of water and took a sip his eyes never left robbie very well ill call the governor he said as if his phone call would save the day it would not the governor was getting lots of calls right now robbie and his team were generating plenty thanks judge but dont expect much this governor has never stopped an execution in fact he wants to speed them up he has his eye on a senate seat and he counts votes before he chooses what to eat for breakfast hes a twofaced cutthroat dirtdumb chickenshit slimy little bastard with a bright future in politics so you didnt vote for him i did not but please give him a call i will im meeting with paul koffee in half an hour to discuss this with him i dont want him to be surprised ill also chat with the fellow over at the newspaper i want to be on record in opposition to this execution thanks judge but why now we couldve had this conversation a year ago or five its awfully late to get involved a year ago few people were thinking about donte drumm there was no execution looming there was a chance he would find relief in a federal court maybe a reversal a new trial i dont know robbie maybe i shouldve been more involved but this is not my case i was busy with my own matters i understand judge they shook hands and offered their farewells robbie took the back stairs so he wouldnt bump into some lawyer or clerk who wanted to chat as he hurried along the empty corridor he tried to think of another elected official in slone or in chester county who had voiced support for donte drumm one came to mind the only black city councilman in slone for nine years he had fought a long and lonely battle and he was about to lose a phone call from the cousin of a big donor would never be enough to stop an execution in texas the machinery was welloiled and efficient it was in motion and there was no way to stop it on the front lawn of the courthouse city workers were assembling a makeshift podium a few policemen loitered about chatting nervously as they watched the first church bus unload a dozen or so black folks got off and made their way across the lawn and past the war memorials they found their spot unfolded chairs and began to wait the rally or protest or whatever it was to be called was scheduled for noon robbie had been asked to speak but declined he couldnt think of anything to say that would not be inflammatory and he did not want to be accused of inciting the crowd there would be enough troublemakers according to carlos who was charged with monitoring the web site the comments and the blogs the traffic was increasing dramatically protests were being planned for thursday in austin huntsville and slone and on the campuses of at least two of the black universities in texas give em hell robbie thought as he drove away chapter keith arrived early at the hospital and made his rounds st marks lutheran currently had half a dozen members in various stages of treatment or recuperation he said hello to all six shared a quick word of comfort held their hands in prayer then was off to get mr boyette for what promised to be an eventful day eventful in unexpected ways mr boyette was already gone according to a nurse when they checked on him at am they found his bed empty and neatly made up his hospital gown folded next to his pillow and the iv wrapped carefully around the portable stand next to his bed an hour later someone from anchor house called with the message that travis boyette was back home and wanted his doctor to know all was well keith drove to anchor house but boyette was not there according to a supervisor he was not scheduled to work on wednesdays no one had any idea where he was or when he might return as keith was driving to st marks he told himself not to worry not to panic boyette would show then he called himself an idiot for placing even the remotest bit of confidence in a confessed murderer a serial rapist and a compulsive liar because he habitually tried to see the good in every person he knew and met he realized as he began to panic that he had been much too gentle with boyette he had tried too hard to be understanding even compassionate hell the man had murdered a seventeenyearold girl just to satisfy his lust and was now seemingly content to watch another man die for the crime god only knew how many other women hed raped keith was angry when he entered the church office charlotte junger back from the flu greeted him with a cheery good morning pastor and keith was barely civil im locked in my office okay no calls unless its a man named travis boyette yes sir he closed his door ripped off his coat and called dana with the latest news hes loose on the streets she asked well yes hes in the process of getting paroled hes served his time and hes about to be a free man i guess you could say hes loose thank god for the tumor i cant believe you said that sorry i cant either whats the plan theres nothing to do but wait maybe hell show up keep me posted keith called matthew burns in the prosecutors office and told him there was a delay matthew had first been cool to the idea of meeting boyette and videoing his statement but he came around he had agreed to make a call or two to texas after he heard boyettes story if in fact he believed what he heard he was disappointed to hear the man was missing keith checked the drumm web site for an update something hed done almost every waking hour since monday morning he went to the filing cabinets and pulled out folders with old sermons he called dana again but she was having coffee with the girls at exactly am he called the law office of robbie flak the young lady who answered the phone explained that mr flak was unavailable keith said he understood this and said that hed called yesterday tuesday left his phone numbers but had not heard from anyone i have information about the murder of nicole yarber he said what type of information she asked i need to speak to mr flak keith said firmly i will give him the message she said just as firmly please im not some wacko this is very important yes sir thank you he decided to violate the vow of confidentiality there were two possible consequences first boyette could sue him for damages but keith was no longer worried about this the brain tumor would take care of any future litigation and if for some reason boyette survived he would be required to prove that keiths breach of confidence had caused him damages though keith knew little about the law he found it difficult to believe that a judge or jury anywhere would have sympathy for such a miserable person the second consequence was that of a possible disciplinary action by the church but in light of the facts and especially in light of the liberal leanings of the synod he could not imagine anything more than a slap on the wrist screw it he said to himself im talking he typed an email for robbie flak he described himself leaving all possible phone numbers and addresses along the way he described his encounter with an unnamed parolee who once lived in slone and did so at the time nicole disappeared this parolee has a lengthy criminal record a violent one and was once arrested and jailed in slone keith had verified this the man confessed to the rape and murder of nicole yarber and gave plenty of details her body was buried deep in the hills south of joplin missouri where this parolee grew up the only person who can find the body is the parolee himself please call keith schroeder an hour later keith left his office and drove back to anchor house no one had seen boyette he drove downtown and had another quick lunch with matthew burns after some debate and a bit of cajoling matthew pulled out his cell phone and called flaks office keith heard him say yes hello my name is matthew burns and i am a prosecutor in topeka kansas i would like to speak to mr robbie flak mr flak was unavailable i have some information about the donte drumm case specifically the identity of the real killer mr flak was still unavailable matthew then gave his phone numbers cell and office and invited the receptionist to visit the web site for the city of topeka office of the city attorney to verify his legitimacy she said she would do this im not some nut okay please have mr flak call me as soon as possible thank you they finished lunch and agreed to alert each other if a call came from texas driving back to the office keith was relieved to have a friend an attorney at that willing to lend a hand by noon the streets of downtown slone had been blocked and barricaded and routine traffic had been diverted elsewhere dozens of church buses and vans were doubleparked around the courthouse but the police were not writing tickets their orders were to maintain a presence keep the peace and by all means do nothing to provoke anyone emotions were high the situation was tense most of the merchants closed their shops and most of the white folks disappeared the crowd all black continued to grow hundreds of students from slone high school skipped out and arrived in packs already rowdy and anxious to be heard factory workers brought their lunch boxes and ate while they milled around the courthouse lawn reporters took photos and scribbled notes camera crews from slone and tyler bunched together near the podium on the front steps of the courthouse at pm mr oscar betts president of the local naacp chapter stepped to the microphones thanked everyone for coming and quickly got down to business he proclaimed the innocence of donte drumm and said his execution was nothing more than a legal lynching he blistered the police in a scathing condemnation calling them racist and determined to kill an innocent man he ridiculed a judicial system that would allow an allwhite jury to pass judgment on an innocent black man unable to resist he asked the crowd how you supposed to get a fair trial when the prosecutor is sleeping with the judge and the appeals courts said it was okay only in texas he described the death penalty as a disgracean outdated tool of revenge that does not deter crime is not used fairly and has been abandoned by all civilized countries almost every sentence was followed with applause and shouting as the crowd grew louder he called on the court system to stop the madness he mocked the texas board of pardons and paroles he called the governor a coward for not stopping the execution he warned of unrest in slone and east texas and perhaps even the entire nation if the state went forward with the execution of an innocent black man betts did a masterful job of raising emotions and tensions when he finally wound down he changed course and asked the crowd to behave to stay off the streets tonight and tomorrow night we gain nothing by violence he pleaded when he finished he introduced the reverend johnny canty pastor of the bethel african methodist church where the drumm family had worshipped for over twenty years reverend canty began with a message from the family they were thankful for the support they remained strong in their faith and were praying for a miracle roberta drumm was doing as well as could be expected her plans were to travel to death row tomorrow and be there until the end reverend canty then asked for quiet and began a long eloquent prayer that started with a plea for compassion for the family of nicole yarber a family that had endured the nightmare of the death of an innocent child just like the drumm family he thanked the almighty for the gift of life and the promise of eternity for all people he thanked god for his laws the most basic and most important being the ten commandments which included the prohibition thou shalt not kill he prayed for those other christians out there who take the same bible and twist it and use it as a weapon to kill others forgive them father for they know not what they do canty had worked on his prayer for a long time and he delivered it slowly with perfect timing and without notes the crowd hummed and swayed and offered hearty amens as he plodded along no end in sight it was far more a speech than a prayer and canty savored the moment after praying for justice he prayed for peace not the peace that avoids violence but the peace yet to be found in a society in which young black men are incarcerated in record numbers in which they are executed far more often than those of other races in which crimes committed by blacks are deemed more grievous than the same crimes committed by whites he prayed for mercy for forgiveness for strength like most ministers canty went on too long and was losing his audience when he suddenly found it again he began praying for donte our persecuted brother a young man snatched from his family nine years ago and thrown into a hellhole from which no man escaped alive nine years without his family and friends nine years locked away like a caged animal nine years serving the time for a crime committed by someone else from the window of a small law library on the third floor judge elias henry watched and listened the crowd was under control as the reverend prayed yet it was the restlessness that frightened the judge slone had known little racial discord over the decades and the judge took most of the credit for this but only when talking to himself fifty years earlier when hed been a young lawyer struggling to pay his bills hed taken a parttime job reporting and writing editorials for the slone daily news then a prosperous weekly that was read by all now it was a struggling daily with a lower readership in the early s the newspaper was one of the few in east texas that recognized the fact that a sizable portion of the population was black elias henry wrote occasional stories about black sports teams and black history and though this was not well received it was not openly condemned his editorials though managed to rile up the whites he explained in laymans terms the true meaning of brown v board of education and criticized the segregated schools in slone and chester county the newspaper through the growing influence of elias and the declining health of its owner took bold stands in favor of voting rights for blacks as well as fair pay and fair housing his arguments were persuasive his reasoning was sound and most of those who read his opinions realized he was far smarter than they were he bought the paper in and owned it for ten years he also became a skilled lawyer and politician and a leader in the community a lot of white folks disagreed with elias but few challenged him publicly when the schools were finally desegregated at the end of a federal gun barrel white resistance in slone had been softened after years of crafty manipulation by elias henry after he was elected judge he sold the paper and assumed a loftier position from there he quietly but firmly controlled a judicial system that was known to be tough on those who were violent strict on those who needed guidance and compassionate to those who needed another chance his defeat by vivian grale led to a nervous breakdown the conviction of donte drumm would not have happened on his watch he would have known about the arrest not long after it occurred he would have examined the confession and the circumstances surrounding it and he would have called in paul koffee for an unofficial meeting just the two of them with the door locked to inform the da that his case was rotten the confession was hopelessly unconstitutional it would not get to the jury keep looking koffee because you have yet to find your killer judge henry looked at the throng packed tightly around the front of the courthouse not a white face anywhere except for the reporters it was an angry black crowd the whites were hiding and not sympathetic his town was split something he thought he would never see god help us he mumbled to himself the next speaker was palomar reed a senior at the high school and vice president of the student body he began with the obligatory condemnation of the death sentence and launched into a windy and technical diatribe against capital punishment with heavy emphasis on the texas version of it the crowd stayed with him though he lacked the drama of the more experienced speakers palomar though soon proved to have an incredible knack for the dramatic looking at a sheet of paper he began calling the names of the black players on the slone high school football team one by one they hurried to the podium and formed a line along the top step each wore the royal blue home jersey of the slone warriors when all twentyeight were packed shoulder to shoulder palomar made a shocking announcement these players stand here united with their brother donte drumm a slone warrior an african warrior if the people of this city county and state succeed in their illegal and unconstitutional efforts to kill donte drumm tomorrow night these warriors will not play in fridays game against longview the crowd exhaled in one massive cheer that rattled the windows of the courthouse palomar looked at the players and on cue all twentyeight reached for their shirttails and quickly yanked off the jerseys they threw them at their feet under the jerseys each player wore an identical white tshirt with the unmistakable image of dontes face under it in bold lettering was the word innocent the players puffed their chests and pumped their fists and the crowd drowned them in adoration we will boycott classes tomorrow palomar yelled into the microphone and friday too and there will be no football game on friday night the rally was being broadcast live on the local channel and most of the white folks in slone were glued to their televisions in banks and schools and homes and offices the same muted utterances were heard they cant do that can they of course they can how do you stop them theyve gone too far no weve gone too far so you think hes innocent im not sure no ones sure thats the problem theres just too much doubt he confessed they never found the body why cant they just stop things for a few days you know a reprieve or something like that why wait till after football season id prefer not to have a riot if they riot then theyll be prosecuted dont bet on it this place is going to explode kick em off the team who do they think they are calling the game off we got forty white boys who can play damn right we do coach oughtta kick em off the team and they oughtta arrest em if they skip school brilliant thatll throw gas on the fire at the high school the football coach watched the protest in the principals office the coach was white the principal black they stared at the television and said nothing at the police department three blocks down main street from the courthouse chief of police joe radford watched the television with his assistant chief the department had four dozen uniformed officers on the payroll and at that moment thirty were watching nervously from the fringes of the rally will the execution take place the assistant chief asked far as i know radford answered i talked to paul koffee an hour ago and he thinks its a go we might need some help naw theyll throw a few rocks but itll blow over paul koffee watched the show alone at his desk with a sandwich and chips his office was two blocks behind the courthouse and he could hear the crowd when it roared for him such demonstrations were necessary evils in a country that valued the bill of rights folks could gather lawfully with permission of course and express their feelings the same laws that protected this right also governed the orderly flow of justice his job was to prosecute criminals and put the guilty ones away and when a crime was grave enough the laws of his state directed him to extract revenge and seek the death penalty this he had done in the drumm case he had no regrets no doubts not the slightest uneasiness about his decisions his tactics at trial or the guilt of drumm his work had been ratified by seasoned appellate judges on numerous occasions dozens of these learned jurists had reviewed every word of the drumm trial and affirmed his conviction koffee was at peace with himself he regretted his involvement with judge vivian grale and the pain and embarrassment it had caused but he had never doubted that her rulings were right he missed her their romance had cracked under the strain of all the negative attention it created she ran away and refused any contact his career as a prosecutor would soon be over and he hated to admit that he would leave office under a cloud the drumm execution though would be his highwater mark his vindication a shining moment that the people of slone or at least the white ones would appreciate tomorrow would be his finest day the flak law firm watched the rally on the widescreen television in the main conference room and when it was finally over robbie retreated to his office with half a sandwich and a diet cola the receptionist had carefully arranged a dozen phone message slips on the center of his desk the ones from topeka caught his attention something rang a bell ignoring the food he picked up the phone and punched in the number for a cell phone of the reverend keith schroeder keith schroeder please he said when someone answered hello speaking this is robbie flak attorney in slone texas i have your message and i think i saw an email a few hours ago yes thank you mr flak its robbie okay robbie its keith on this end fine keith wheres the body in missouri i have no time to waste keith and something tells me this call is a complete waste of time maybe it is but give me five minutes talk fast keith ran through the factshis encounters with an unnamed parolee his search into his background the mans criminal record his dire medical condition everything he could cram into five uninterrupted minutes obviously youre not worried about breaching confidentiality here robbie said im troubled by it but the stakes are too high and i havent told you his name where is he now he spent last night in a hospital checked himself out this morning and i havent heard from him since hed due back at the halfway house at pm sharp ill be there to see him and he has four felony convictions for sex offenses at least pastor this man has zero credibility i cant do anything with this theres nothing here you gotta understand keith that these executions always attract the nutcases we had two fruitcakes show up last week one claimed to know where nicole is living now shes a stripper by the way and the other claimed to have killed her in a satanic ritual location of the body unknown the first wanted some money the second wanted out of prison in arizona the courts despise these lastminute fantasies he says the body is buried in the hills south of joplin missouri thats where he grew up how soon can he find the body i cant answer that come on keith give me something i can use he has her class ring ive seen it held it and examined it shs with her initials any blue stone size about six this is good keith i like it but where is the ring right now i assume its around his neck and you dont know where he is uh correct at this moment i dont know where he is who is matthew burns a friend of mine a prosecutor look keith i appreciate your concern youve called twice emailed once got one of your friends to call thank you very much im a very busy man right now so please leave me alone robbie picked up his sandwich as he put down the phone chapter gill newton had been the governor of texas for five years and though polls showed an enviable level of approval among the electorate the polls were dwarfed by his own estimation of his popularity he was from laredo far down in south texas where hed been raised on a ranch that had been owned by his grandfather whod once been a sheriff gill had scratched his way through college and law school and when no firm would hire him he became an assistant prosecutor in el paso at the age of twentynine he was elected district attorney in the first of many successful campaigns he had never lost one by the age of forty hed sent five men to death row as governor hed watched two of them die explaining that it was his duty since hed prosecuted them though records were sketchy it was widely believed that newton was the only sitting governor of texas to witness an execution this was certainly true for the modern era in interviews he claimed that watching the men die had given him a sense of closure i remember the victims he said i kept thinking about the victims these were horrible crimes newton seldom passed on a chance to be interviewed brash loud vulgar in private he was wildly popular because of his antigovernment rhetoric his unwavering beliefs his outrageous comments that he never apologized for and his love of texas and its history of fierce independence the vast majority of voters also shared his fondness for the death penalty with his second and final term secured newton was already gazing across the borders of texas and contemplating a larger stage something bigger he was needed late wednesday afternoon he met with his two closest advisers two old friends from law school who had helped with every major decision and most of the minor ones as well wayne wallcott was the lawyer or chief counsel as his letterhead proclaimed and barry ringfield was the mouthpiece or director of communications on a routine day in austin the three met in the governors office at precisely pm they took off their coats dismissed the secretaries locked the door and at pm poured the bourbon then they got down to business this drumm thing could get messy tomorrow barry was saying blacks are pissed and they got demonstrations scheduled all over the state tomorrow where the governor asked well here for starters on the south lawn of the capitol rumor has it that the right reverend jeremiah mays is flying in on his fancy jet to get the natives good and agitated i love it the governor said the request for a reprieve has been filed and is on record wayne said looking at some paperwork he took a sip the bourbon knob creek was poured each time into a heavy crystal waterford glass with the states seal on it definitely more interest in this one barry said lots of calls letters emails whos calling newton asked the usual chorus the pope president of france two members of the dutch parliament prime minister of kenya jimmy carter amnesty international that loudmouth from california who runs the black caucus in washington lots of folks anybody important not really the circuit judge in chester county elias henry has called twice and sent an email hes in favor of a reprieve says he has grave doubts about the jurys verdict most of the noise from slone though is gung ho in favor of the execution they think the boys guilty the mayor called and expressed some concerns about trouble in slone tomorrow night says he might be calling for help the national guard newton asked i suppose so i love it all three took a sip the governor looked at barry who was not only his mouthpiece but also his most trusted and most devious adviser you got a plan barry always had a plan sure but its a work in progress i like the demonstration tomorrow hopefully with reverend jeremiah stoking the fires big crowd tons of africans a real tense situation and you take the podium stare down the crowd talk about the orderly flow of justice in this state the usual spiel then right out there on the steps with cameras rolling and the crowd booing and hissing and maybe throwing rocks at you right then and there you deny the request for a reprieve the crowd erupts you make your escape itll take some balls but its priceless wow newton said wayne actually laughed barry continued three hours later they nuke him but the front page will be taking on the mob of angry blacks for the record you got percent of the black vote governor percent a pause a sip but he wasnt finished i like the national guard angle too later in the afternoon but before the execution hold a quick press conference and announce that youre sending in the guard to quell the uprising in slone the numbers in chester county you got percent gill they love you there you protect them by sending in the guard but is the guard necessary wayne asked if we overreact then it could backfire its fluid lets monitor the situation and decide later lets do that the governor said and the decision was made any chance of some court issuing a lastminute stay wayne tossed some papers on the governors desk and said i doubt it drumms lawyers filed an appeal this morning claiming the boys gone crazy and doesnt appreciate the gravity of whats coming its bullshit i talked to baker at the ags office an hour ago and they see nothing in the pipeline its all green lights should be fun the governor said at reevas suggestion or insistence the wednesday night prayer meeting at the first baptist church was canceled this had happened only three times in the history of the church once for an ice storm once for a tornado and once for a power outage brother ronnie could not bring himself to use the word canceled so the prayer meeting was simply reclassified as a prayer vigil and was moved to another location the weather cooperated the sky was clear and the temperature was almost seventy degrees they met at sunset under a reserved pavilion at rush point state park on the edge of the red river as close to nicole as they could possibly get the pavilion was on a small bluff with the river below and about a hundred yards away was the sandbar that came and went with the level of water her gym card and student id had been found there in the minds of those who loved her this had long been the spot of nicoles final resting place during her many visits to rush point reeva had always alerted whatever media she could arouse in slone as the years passed though the local reporters lost interest she often visited alone sometimes with wallis trailing along behind always on her daughters birthday and usually on december the day she disappeared but this vigil was far different there was something to celebrate fordycehitting hard was represented by a twoman crew with a small camera the same one that had been following reeva and a weary wallis for two days now there were two tv news crews and half a dozen print reporters the presence of so much attention inspired the worshippers and brother ronnie was pleased with such a large turnout forty miles from home they sang a few hymns as the sunlight faded then lit small candles and passed them around reeva sat in the front row and sobbed nonstop brother ronnie could not resist the opportunity to preach and his flock was in no hurry to leave he dwelled on justice and relied on an avalanche of scripture to support gods commands for us to live as lawabiding citizens there were prayers by deacons and testimonials from friends of nicoles and even wallis after an elbow in the ribs managed to stand and offer a few words brother ronnie finished things up with a lengthy plea for compassion and mercy and strength he asked god to walk the final mile with reeva and wallis and their family as they went through the ordeal of the execution they left the pavilion and moved in a solemn procession to the makeshift shrine closer to the rivers edge they laid flowers at the foot of a white cross some knelt and prayed again everybody had a good cry at pm on wednesday keith walked through the front door of anchor house with every intention of corralling travis boyette and having a serious confrontation the execution was exactly twentyfour hours away and keith was determined to do whatever he could to stop it the task seemed utterly impossible but at least he would try an associate minister was handling the wednesday night supper at st marks boyette was playing games or maybe he was dead during the day he had not checked in with his parole officer and had not been seen again at anchor house he was required to do none of these but the fact that he seemed to have vanished was troubling he was however required to check in for the night at and could not leave until the following morning unless he had permission he was not there at pm keith waited an hour but there was no sign of boyette an excon named rudy was manning the front desk he mumbled to keith youd better go find his ass i wouldnt know where to start keith said he left his cell phone number with rudy and started with the hospitals he slowly drove from one to the other killing time waiting for a call from rudy watching the streets for any sign of a fortyish white weirdo limping along with a cane none of the downtown hospitals had admitted a travis boyette he was not loitering around the bus station and he was not sharing a drink with the winos down by the river at pm keith returned to anchor house and sat in a chair at the front desk he aint here rudy said what happens next keith said if he comes in later tonight theyll cuss him but let it slide unless hes drunk or drugged and then it hits the fan theyll give you one screwup but if he stays out all night theyll probably revoke him and send him back to the pen these guys are pretty serious whats boyette up to its hard to say he has trouble with the truth i heard that i got your number if he shows ill give you a call thanks keith hung around for half an hour then drove home dana heated up lasagna and they ate on tv trays in the den the boys were already asleep the television was on mute they said little travis boyette had consumed their lives for the better part of three days and they were tired of the man after dark it became apparent that no one wanted to leave the train station there was little legal work to be done and nothing of any consequence could be thrown together at that hour to help donte drumm the texas court of criminal appeals had not ruled on the insanity claim fred pryor was still loitering on the outskirts of houston hoping for another drink or two with joey gamble but that looked doubtful this could well be the last night in the life of donte drumm and his legal team needed the comfort of each other carlos was sent to get pizza and beer and when he returned the long table in the conference room was used for dinner when ollie arrived later a poker game materialized ollie tufton was one of a handful of black lawyers in slone and a close friend of robbies he was shaped like a bowling ball and claimed to weigh four hundred pounds though it was not clear why he wished to take credit for this he was loud and hilarious and had huge appetitesfood whiskey poker and sadly cocaine robbie had rescued him from near disbarment on two occasions he made an occasional buck with car wrecks but the money always disappeared when ollie was in the room most of the noise came from him he assumed control of the poker game appointed carlos as dealer established the rules and told his latest dirty jokes all while sipping a beer and finishing off the cold pizza the players were martha handler who usually won bonnie the other paralegal kristi hinze who was still afraid of the game and even more terrified of ollie and a parttime investigatorrunner named ben shoots shoots had a pistol in his jacket hanging on the wall robbie had two shotguns in his office loaded aaron rey was always armed and he moved quietly around the train station watching the windows and the parking lot the firm had received several threatening calls during the day and they were on full alert robbie took a beer to his office left his door wide open and called dede his livein partner she was at yoga blissfully unconcerned about the pending execution they had been together for three years and robbie was almost convinced they had a chance she showed almost no interest in whatever he did at the office and this was beneficial his journey to find true love was littered with women who could not accept the fact that life with robbie was heavily tilted in robbies favor the current girl went her own way and they met in bed she was twenty years younger and robbie was still smitten he called a reporter in austin but said nothing quotable he called judge elias henry and thanked him for calling the governor they wished each other well both knowing that the next twentyfour hours would be remembered for a long time the clock on the wall seemed stuck at ten minutes after nine robbie would always remember that it was pm when aaron rey walked into his office and said the first baptist church is burning the battle of slone had begun chapter if keith had fallen asleep he wasnt aware of it for the past three days he had slept so little and at such odd hours that his routines and rhythms were out of sync when the phone rang he could have sworn he was wideawake dana though heard it first and had to nudge her husband he finally grabbed it after the fourth or fifth ring hello he said in a daze while dana flipped on a lamp it was they had gone to bed less than an hour earlier hey pastor its me travis the voice said hello travis keith said and dana scrambled for a bathrobe where are you here topeka at a diner somewhere downtown not far from anchor house his voice was slow his tongue thick keiths second or third thought was that boyette had been drinking why are you not at anchor house it doesnt matter look pastor im really hungry nothing since this morning and im sitting here with just a cup of coffee because i dont have any money im starving pastor any ideas have you been drinking travis couple of beers im okay you spent money on beer but not on food i didnt call to fight with you pastor can you help me get something to eat sure travis but you need to get back to anchor house theyre waiting for you i talked to rudy and he says theyll write you up but nothing serious lets get something to eat then ill take you where you belong i aint going back there pastor forget it i want to go to texas okay i mean now i really want to go ill tell everybody the truth tell them where the body is everything we gotta save that boy we who else pastor we know the truth if you and me get down there we can stop this execution you want me to take you to texas right now keith asked staring into the eyes of his wife she began shaking her head theres no one else pastor i got a brother in illinois but we dont talk i suppose i could call my parole officer but i doubt if hed have any interest in hauling ass down to texas i know a few of the dudes around the halfway house but they dont have cars when you spend your life in prison pastor you dont have a lot of friends on the outside where are you travis i told you im in a diner hungry which one blue moon you know it yes you order something to eat ill be there in fifteen minutes thank you pastor keith hung up the phone and sat on the edge of the bed next to his wife neither spoke for a few minutes neither wanted to fight is he drunk she finally asked i dont think so hes had a few but seems sober i dont know what are you doing keith im buying dinner or breakfast or whatever it is ill wait for him to change his mind again if hes serious then i have no choice but to drive him to texas you do have a choice keith youre not being forced to take this pervert to texas what about that young man on death row dana think about donte drumms mother right now this will be her last day to see her son boyettes pulling your leg keith hes a liar maybe and maybe not but look at whats at stake here at stake your job could be at stake your reputation career everything could be at stake we have three little boys to think about im not going to jeopardize my career dana or my family i might get a slap on the wrist but thats all i know what im doing are you sure no he quickly shed his pajamas and put on a pair of jeans sneakers a shirt and a red cardinals baseball cap she watched him dress without another word he kissed her on the forehead and left the house boyette was inspecting an impressive platter of food when keith took the chair across from him the diner was halffull with several tables occupied by uniformed policemen all eating pie average weight at least keith ordered coffee and caught the irony of an unconvicted murderer and parole violator having a hearty meal thirty feet from a small squad of cops where have you been all day keith asked the tic a large bite of scrambled eggs as he chewed he said i really dont remember we wasted an entire day travis our plan was to do the video send it to the authorities and the press in texas and hope for a miracle you ruined that plan by disappearing the days done pastor leave it alone you taking me to texas or not so youre jumping parole the tic a sip of coffee his hand shaking everything from his voice to his fingers to his eyes seemed to be engaged in a steady tremor parole is the least of my worries right now pastor dying occupies most of my time and that boy in texas concerns me ive tried to forget him but i cant and the girl i need to see her before i die why i need to say im sorry i hurt a lot of people pastor but i only killed one he glanced at the policemen then kept going his voice a bit lower and i dont know why she was my favorite i wanted to keep her forever and when i realized i couldnt well i got it travis lets talk logistics here slone texas is miles away straight shot as the crow flies but its more like by car with a lot of twolane roads its midnight if we left in the next hour or so and drove like maniacs we might be there by noon thats six hours before the execution any idea what we do when we get there boyette chewed on a piece of sausage and pondered the question completely untouched by any sense of urgency keith noticed that he took very small bites chewed them a long time laid down his fork and took a sip of either coffee or water he did not seem to be overly hungry food was not important after more coffee boyette said i was thinking that we go to the local television station and i go on the air tell my story take responsibility tell the idiots down there that they got the wrong guy for the murder and theyll stop it just like that i dont know pastor ive never done this before you whats your plan at this point finding the body is more important than your confession frankly travis given your lengthy record and the disgusting nature of your crimes your credibility will be challenged ive done some research since i met you on monday morning and ive run across some anecdotes about the nutcases who pop up around executions and make all sorts of claims you calling me a nutcase no im not but im sure theyll call you a lot of names in slone texas they wont believe you do you believe me pastor i do would you like some eggs and bacon youre paying for it no thanks the tic another glance at the cops he pointed both index fingers at both temples and massaged them in tiny circles grimacing as if he might scream the pain finally passed keith looked at his watch boyette began shaking his head slightly and said itll take longer to find the body pastor cant be done today since keith had no experience in such matters he simply shrugged and said nothing either we go to texas or i walk back to the halfway house and get yelled at its your choice pastor im not sure why im supposed to make the decision its very simple you have the car the gas the drivers license i have nothing but the truth the car was a subaru fourwheel drive miles on the odometer and at least miles since the last oil change dana used it to haul the boys all over topeka and it showed the wear and tear of such a life on the streets their other car was a honda accord with a sticky oil light and a bad set of rear tires sorry for the dirty car keith said almost embarrassed as they crawled in and closed the doors boyette said nothing at first he placed his cane between his legs seat belts are mandatory now keith said as he buckled up boyette did not move there was a moment of silence in which keith realized that the journey had begun the man was in his car along for a ride that would consume hours maybe days and neither knew where this little journey might take them slowly boyette strapped himself in as the car began to move their elbows were inches apart keith got the first whiff of stale beer and said so travis whats your history with booze boyette was breathing deeply as if soothed by the security of the car and its locked doors typically he waited at least five seconds before responding never thought of it as a history im not a big drinker im fortyfour years old pastor and ive spent just over twentythree of those years locked away in various facilities none of which had saloons lounges juke joints strip clubs allnight drivethrus cant get a drink in prison youve been drinking today i had a few bucks went to a bar in a hotel and had some beers they had a television in the bar i saw a report on the drumm execution in texas had a picture of the boy it hit me hard pastor i gotta tell you i was feeling pretty mellow you know kinda sentimental anyway and when i saw that boys face i almost got choked up i drank some more watched the clock get closer and closer to pm i made the decision to skip parole go to texas do whats right keith was holding his cell phone i need to call my wife how is she fine thanks for asking shes so cute you need to forget about her keith mumbled a few awkward phrases into the phone and then slapped it shut he drove quickly through the deserted streets of central topeka so travis were planning on this long drive down to texas where you face the authorities and tell the truth and try to stop this execution and im assuming at some point very soon youll be expected to lead the authorities to nicoles body all this of course will lead to your arrest and being thrown in jail in texas theyll charge you with all sorts of crimes and youll never get out is that the plan travis are we on the same page the tic the pause yes pastor were on the same page it doesnt matter ill be dead before they can get me properly indicted by the grand jury i didnt want to say that you dont have to we know it but i prefer that nobody in texas knows about my tumor its only fitting that they get the satisfaction of prosecuting me i deserve it im at peace pastor at peace with whom myself after i see nicole again and tell her im sorry then ill be ready for anything including death keith drove on in silence he was facing a marathon trip with this guy virtually shoulder to shoulder for the next ten maybe twelve hours and he hoped he wouldnt be as crazy as boyette by the time they arrived in slone he parked in the driveway behind the accord and said travis im assuming you have no money no clothes nothing this seemed painfully obvious travis chuckled raised his hands and said here i am pastor with all my worldly assets thats what i thought wait here ill be back in five minutes keith left the engine running and hurried into his house dana was in the kitchen throwing together sandwiches and chips and fruit and anything else she could find where is he she demanded as soon as keith walked through the door in the car hes not coming in keith you cant be serious about this what are the choices dana hed made his decision as unsettling as it was he was prepared for a nasty fight with his wife and he was willing to take the risks that his journey might entail we cant sit here and do nothing when we know the real killer hes out there in the car she wrapped a sandwich and stuffed it into a small box keith took a folded grocery bag from the pantry and went into their bedroom for his new pal travis he found an old pair of khakis a couple of tshirts socks underwear and a packers sweatshirt that no one had ever worn he changed shirts put on his clerical collar and a navy sport coat and then packed a few things of his own in a gym bag minutes later he was back in the kitchen where dana was leaning against the sink arms locked defiantly across her chest this is a huge mistake she announced maybe so i didnt volunteer for this boyette chose us us okay he chose me he has no other means of getting to texas or so he says i believe him she rolled her eyes keith glanced at the clock on the microwave he was anxious to take off but he also realized that his wife was entitled to a few parting shots how can you believe anything he says she demanded weve had this conversation dana what if you get arrested down there for what trying to stop an execution i doubt thats a crime even in texas youre helping a man jump parole right right in kansas they cant arrest me for it in texas but youre not sure look dana im not going to get arrested in texas i promise i might get shot but not arrested are you trying to be funny no no ones laughing come on dana look at the big picture i think boyette killed this girl in i think he hid her body and knows where it is and i think theres a chance for a miracle if we can get down there i think youre crazy maybe but id rather take a chance look at the risk keith he had inched closer and now put his hands on her shoulders she was rigid her arms still crossed look dana ive never taken a chance in my life i know this is your big moment isnt it no this is not about me once we get there im staying in the shadows keeping a low profile dodging bullets whatever ill be in the background its the travis boyette show im just his driver driver youre a minister with a family and ill be back by saturday ill preach on sunday and well have a picnic that afternoon i promise her shoulders sagged and her arms fell to her sides he squeezed her fiercely and then kissed her please try to understand he said she nodded gamely and said okay i love you i love you please be careful robbies midnight wakeup call came at hed been in bed with dede for less than an hour when the phone erupted dede whod gone to sleep without the aid of alcohol jumped first and said hello then she handed the phone to her mate who was fogged in and trying to open his eyes who is it he growled wake up robbie its fred got some interesting stuff here robbie managed to rouse himself at least to the next level what is it fred dede was already flipping to the other side robbie smiled at her fine rear end under the satin sheets fred said had another drink with joey took him to a strip club second night in a row you know not sure my liver can take much more of this project im sure his cannot anyway got the boy drunk as a pissant and he finally admitted everything said he lied about seeing the green van lied about the black person driving the damned thing lied about everything admitted he was the one who called kerber with the fake tip about donte and the girl it was beautiful he was crying and carrying on just a big blubbering fat boy knocking back beers and talking trash to the strippers said he and donte were once good buddies back in the ninth and tenth grades when they were football stars said he always thought the prosecutors and judges would figure things out cant believe its come down to this hes always thought the execution would never happen thought donte would one day get out of prison now hes finally convinced that theyre gonna kill him so hes all tore up about it thinks its his fault i assured him that it is the blood will be on his hands i really beat him up it was wonderful robbie was in the kitchen looking for water this is great fred he said it is and its not he refuses to sign an affidavit what wont do it we left the strip club and went to a coffeehouse i begged him to sign an affidavit but its like talking to a tree why not his momma robbie his momma and his family he cant stomach the idea of admitting that hes a liar hes got a lot of friends in slone and so on i did everything i could possibly do but the boy is not willing to sign on robbie downed a glass of tap water and wiped his mouth with a sleeve did you tape it of course ive listened to the tape once about to go through it again theres a lot of background noiseyou ever been to a strip club dont ask really loud music a lotta rap shit and stuff like that but his voice is there you can understand what hes saying well need to enhance it theres no time for that okay whats the plan how long is your drive well at this lovely time of the day theres no traffic i can be in slone in five hours then get your ass on the road you got it boss an hour later robbie was in bed flat on his back the dark ceiling doing strange things to his thought process dede was purring like a kitten dead to the world he listened to her breathe heavily and wondered how she could be so untroubled by all of his troubles he envied her when she awoke hours later her first priority would be an hour of hot yoga with a few of her dreadful friends he would be at the office screaming at the telephone and so it had all come down to this a drunk joey gamble confessing his sins and baring his soul in a strip club to a man with a concealed mike that produced a scratchy audio that no court in the civilized world would take heed of the fragile life of donte drumm would depend on the eleventhhour recantation by a witness with no credibility part two the punishment chapter lost in the frenzy of the departure was the issue of money when he paid six bucks for boyettes feast at the blue moon diner keith realized he was low on cash then he forgot about it he remembered it again after they were on the road and needed gas they stopped at a truck stop on interstate at am it was thursday november as keith pumped gas he was aware of the fact that donte drumm would be strapped to the gurney in huntsville in about seventeen hours he was even more aware that the man who should be suffering through his final hours was instead sitting peacefully only a few feet away snug inside the car his pale slick head reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights they were just south of topeka texas was a million miles away he paid with a credit card and counted in cash in his left front pocket he cursed himself for not raiding the slush fund he and dana kept in a kitchen cabinet the cigar box usually held around in cash an hour south of topeka the speed limit increased to seventy miles per hour and keith and the old subaru inched upward to seventyfive boyette so far had been quiet seemingly content to sit crouched with his hands on his knees and stare at nothing through the rightside window keith preferred to ignore him he preferred the silence sitting next to a stranger for twelve straight hours was a chore under normal circumstances rubbing shoulders with one as violent and weird as boyette would make for a tense tedious trip just as keith settled into a quiet comfortable zone he was suddenly hit with a wave of drowsiness his eyelids snapped shut only to be reopened when he jerked his head his vision was blurred foggy the subaru edged toward the right shoulder then he moved back to the left he pinched his cheeks he blinked his eyes as wildly as possible if hed been alone he would have slapped himself travis did not notice how about some music keith said anything to jolt his brain travis just nodded his approval anything in particular its your car yes it was his favorite station was classic rock he cranked up the volume and was soon thumping the steering wheel and tapping his left foot and mouthing the words the noise cleared his brain but he was still stunned by how quickly he had almost collapsed only eleven hours to go he thought of charles lindbergh and his solo flight to paris thirtythree and a half straight hours with no sleep the night before he took off from new york lindbergh later wrote that he was awake for sixty straight hours keiths brother was a pilot and loved to tell stories he thought about his brother his sister and his parents and when he began to nod off he said how many brothers and sisters do you have travis talk to me travis anything to keep me awake you cant help with the driving because you have no license you have no insurance youre not touching this wheel so come on travis help me out here before we crash i dont know travis said after the obligatory period of contemplation the answer did more to lift the fog than anything by springsteen or dylan what do you mean you dont know a slight tic travis had now shifted his gaze from the side window to the windshield well he said then paused not long after i was born my father left my mother never saw him again my mother took up with a man named darrell and since he was the first man i ever remembered i just figured darrell was my father my mother told me he was my father i called him dad i had an older brother and he called him dad darrell was okay never beat me or anything but he had a brother who abused me when they took me to court the first timei think i was twelvei realized that darrell was not my real father that really hurt i was crushed then darrell disappeared the response like many of boyettes raised more mysteries than it solved it also served to kick keiths brain into high gear he was suddenly wideawake and he was determined to unravel this psycho what else was there to do for the next half day they were in his car he could ask anything he wanted so you have one brother theres more my father the real one ran off to florida and took up with another woman they had a houseful of kids so i guess i have outside brothers and sisters and there was always this rumor that my mother had given birth to a child before she married my father you ask how many pick a number pastor how many are you in contact with i wouldnt call it contact but ive written some letters to my brother hes in illinois in prison what a surprise why is he in prison same reason everybody else is in prison drugs and booze he needed cash for his habit so he broke into a house wrong one ended up beating a man does he write back sometimes hell never get out was he abused no he was older and my uncle left him alone far as i know we never talked about it this was darrells brother yes so he wasnt really your uncle i thought he was why are you asking so many questions pastor im trying to pass the time travis and im trying to stay awake since i met you monday morning i have slept very little im exhausted and we have a long way to go i dont like all these questions well what exactly do you think youre about to hear in texas we show up you claim to be the real murderer and then you announce that you really dont like questions come on travis several miles passed without a word travis stared to his right at nothing but the darkness and lightly tapped his cane with his fingertips he had shown no signs of severe headaches for at least an hour keith glanced at the speedometer and realized he was doing eighty ten over enough for a ticket anywhere in kansas he slowed down and to keep his mind going played out the scene in which a state trooper pulled him over checked his id checked boyettes then called for backup a fleeing felon a wayward lutheran minister aiding the fleeing felon blue lights all over the road handcuffs a night in jail maybe in the same cell with his friend a man who wouldnt be the least bit bothered by another night behind bars what would keith tell his boys he began to nod again there was a phone call he had to make and there was no good time to make it the call was guaranteed to engage his mind at such a level that sleep would be forgotten momentarily he removed his cell phone from his pocket and speeddialed matthew burns it was almost am evidently matthew was a sound sleeper it took eight rings to rouse him this better be good he growled good morning matthew sleep well fine father why the hell are you calling me watch your language son look im on the road headed for texas traveling with a man named travis boyette a nice gentleman who visited our church last sunday you may have seen him walks with a cane anyway travis here has a confession to make to the authorities in texas a small town called slone and were dashing off to stop an execution matthews voice cleared quickly have you lost your mind keith youve got that guy in the car oh yes left topeka about an hour ago the reason im calling matt is to ask for your help ill give you some help keith free advice turn that damned car around and get back here thanks matt but look in a few hours ill need you to make a couple of phone calls to slone texas what does dana say about this fine fine ill need you to call the police the prosecutor and maybe a defense lawyer ill be calling them too matt but since youre a prosecutor they might listen to you are you still in kansas yes i dont cross the state line keith please well that might make it rather difficult to get to texas dont you think dont cross the state line get some sleep ill call you back around six and well start working the phones okay keith closed his phone punched voice mail and waited ten seconds later it buzzed matthew was calling back they were through emporia and bearing down on wichita nothing prompted the narrative perhaps boyette was getting sleepy himself or maybe he was just bored but the more he talked the more keith realized he was listening to the twisted autobiography of a dying man one who knew no sense could be made of his life but wanted to try anyway darrells brother we called him uncle chett would take me fishing that was what he told my parents never caught the first fish never wet the first hook wed go to his little house out in the country had a pond out back and thats where all the fish were supposed to be never made it that far hed give me a cigarette let me taste his beer at first i didnt know what he was doing had no idea i was just a kid eight years old i was too scared to move to fight back i remember how bad it hurt he had all sorts of kiddie porn magazines and movies sick stuff he was generous enough to share with me you cram all that garbage into the head of a little boy and before long he sort of accepts it i thought well maybe this is what kids do maybe this is what adults do to kids it looked legitimate and normal he wasnt mean to me in fact he bought me ice cream and pizzaanything i wanted after each fishing trip he would drive me home and right before wed get to my house he would get real serious sort of mean and threatening he would tell me that it was important for me to keep our little secret some things are private he kept a gun in his truck a shiny pistol later he would show me how to use it but at first he would take it out and place it on the seat then explain that he loved his secrets and if they were ever revealed then he would be forced to hurt someone even me if i told anyone he would be forced to kill me and then kill whomever i told and that included darrell and my mother it was very effective i never told anyone we kept fishing i think my mother knew but she had her own problems primarily with the bottle she was drunk most of the time didnt sober up until much later until it was too late for me when i was about ten or so my uncle gave me some pot and we started smoking together then some pills it wasnt all bad i thought i was pretty cool a young punk smoking cigarettes and pot drinking beer watching porn the other part was never pleasant but it didnt last long we were living in springfield at the time and one day my mother told me we had to move my dad her husband whatever the hell he was had found a job near joplin missouri where i was born we packed in a hurry loaded everything into a uhaul and fled in the middle of the night im sure there was some unpaid rent involved probably a lot more than thatbills lawsuits arrest warrants indictments who knows anyway i woke up the next morning in a doublewide trailer a nice one uncle chett got left behind im sure it broke his heart he finally found us and showed up a month or so later asked me if i wanted to go fishing i said no he had no place to take me so he just hung around the house couldnt take his eyes off me they were drinking the adults and before long they got into a fight over money uncle chett left cussing never saw him again but the damage was done if i saw him now id take a baseball bat and splatter his brains across forty acres i was one screwedup little boy and i guess ive never gotten over it can i smoke no then can we pull over for a minute so i can smoke sure a few miles down the road they pulled in to a rest stop and took a break keiths phone buzzed again another missed call from matthew burns boyette wandered away last seen drifting into some woods behind the restrooms a cloud of smoke trailing him keith was walking across the parking lot back and forth back and forth trying to pump the blood with one eye on his passenger when boyette was out of sight gone in the darkness keith wondered if he was gone for good he was already tired of the trip and if there was an escape at this point who would care keith would drive back home wonderfully alone in the car and face the music with his wife and get an earful from matthew with some luck no one would ever know about the aborted mission boyette would do what hed always donedrift here and there until he either died or got himself arrested again but what if he hurt someone would keith share criminal responsibility minutes passed with no movement from the woods a dozen wheelers were parked together at one end of the parking lot their generators humming as their drivers slept keith leaned on his car and waited hed lost his nerve and he wanted to go home he wanted boyette to stay in the woods to go deeper until there was no turning back to simply disappear then he thought of donte drumm a puff of smoke wafted from the trees his passenger had not escaped miles passed without a word boyette seemed content to forget his past though minutes earlier hed been gushing details at the first hint of numbness keith plowed ahead you were in joplin uncle chett had come and gone the tic five ten seconds then yes uh we were living in a trailer out from town a poor section we were always in the poor section but i remember being proud because we had a nice trailer a rental but i didnt know it then next to the trailer park there was a little road asphalt that ran for miles into the hills south of joplin in newton county there were creeks and dells and dirt roads it was a kids paradise wed ride our bikes for hours along the trails and no one could ever find us sometimes wed steal beer and booze out of the trailer or even out of a store and dash off into the hills for a little party one time a kid named damian had a bag of pot hed stolen from his big brother and we got so stoned we couldnt stay on our bikes and this is where nicole is buried keith counted to eleven before boyette said i suppose shes somewhere in there not sure i can remember to tell you the truth i was pretty drunk pastor ive tried to remember even tried to draw a map the other day but itll be difficult if we get that far why did you bury her there didnt want anybody to find her it worked how do you know it worked how do you know her body hasnt been found you buried her nine years ago youve been in prison for the past six years away from the news pastor i assure you she has not been found keith felt assured he believed boyette and the fact that he believed so much from this hardened criminal was frustrating he was wideawake as they approached wichita boyette had retreated into his sad little shell he rubbed his temples occasionally you went to court when you were twelve years old keith asked the tic something like that yes i was twelve i remember the judge making some comment about me being too young to launch a new career as a criminal little did he know what was the crime we broke into a store and loaded up all the stuff we could carry beer cigarettes candy lunch meat chips had a regular feast in the woods got drunk no problem until somebody looked at the video it was my first offense so i got probation my codefendant was eddie stuart he was fourteen and it was not his first offense they sent him to reform school and i never saw him again it was a rough neighborhood and there was no shortage of bad boys we were either making trouble or getting into trouble darrell yelled at me but he came and went my mother tried her best but couldnt stop drinking my brother got sent away when he was fifteen me i was thirteen you ever been inside a reform school pastor no didnt think so these are the kids nobody wants most are not bad kids not when they first get there they just didnt have a chance my first stop was a place near st louis and like all reform schools it was nothing but a penitentiary for kids i got the top bunk in a long room crowded with kids from the streets of st louis the violence was brutal there were never enough guards or supervisors we went to class but the education was a joke you had to join a gang to survive someone looked at my file and saw where id been sexually abused so i was an easy target for the guards after two years of hell i was released now pastor whats a fifteenyearold kid supposed to do when hes back on the streets after two years of torture he actually looked at keith as if he expected an answer keith kept his eyes straight ahead and shrugged the juvenile justice system does nothing but cultivate career criminals society wants to lock us up and throw away the key but society is too stupid to realize that well eventually get out and when we get out it aint pretty take me id like to think i wasnt a hopeless case when i went in at thirteen but give me two years of nothing but violence hate beatings abuse then societys got a problem when i walk out at fifteen prisons are hate factories pastor and society wants more and more of them it aint working are you blaming someone else for what happened to nicole boyette exhaled and looked away it was a heavy question and he sagged under its weight finally he said you miss the whole point pastor what i did was wrong but i couldnt stop myself why couldnt i stop myself because of what i am i wasnt born this way i became a man with a lot of problems not because of my dna but because of what society demanded lock em up punish the hell out of them and if you make a few monsters along the way too bad what about the other percent and who might those be half of all inmates paroled from prison stay out of trouble and are never arrested again boyette didnt appreciate this statistic he reshifted his weight and fixated on the rightside mirror he withdrew into his shell and stopped talking when they were south of wichita he fell asleep the cell phone rang again at am it was matthew burns where are you keith he demanded get some sleep matthew sorry i bothered you im having trouble sleeping where are you about thirty miles from the oklahoma state line still got your buddy oh yes hes sleeping now me i just nap on and off ive talked to dana shes upset keith im worried too we think youre losing your mind probably so im touched relax matthew im doing whats right and ill survive whatever happens right now my thoughts are with donte drumm dont cross the state line i heard you the first time good i just wanted to be on record as warning you more than once im writing it down okay now keith listen to me we have no idea what might happen once you get to slone and your buddy there starts running his mouth im assuming hell attract cameras like roadkill attracts buzzards stay out of the picture keith keep your head low dont talk to any reporters one of two things will definitely happen number one the execution will take place as scheduled if so then youve done your best and itll be time to scramble back home boyette has the option of staying there or catching a ride back doesnt really matter to you just get back home theres a decent chance no one will know about your little adventure in texas the second scenario is that the execution will be stayed if so youve won but dont celebrate while the authorities grab boyette you sneak out of town and get back home either way you gotta stay out of sight am i clear i think so heres the question where do we go when we get to slone the prosecutor the police the press the defense attorney robbie flak hes the only one who might listen the police and the prosecutor have no reason to listen to boyette they have their man theyre just waiting for the execution flak is the only one who might believe you and he certainly appears capable of making a lot of noise if boyette tells a good story then flak will take care of the press thats what i thought im planning on calling flak at six i doubt if hes sleeping much lets talk before we start making calls you got it and keith i still think youre crazy i dont doubt it matthew he put the phone in his pocket and a few minutes later the subaru left kansas and entered oklahoma keith was driving eighty miles an hour he was also wearing his clerical collar and hed convinced himself that any decent trooper wouldnt ask too many questions of a man of god whose crime was nothing more than speeding chapter the drumm family spent the night in a budget motel on the outskirts of livingston less than four miles by car from the allan b polunsky correctional facility where donte had been locked up for over seven years the motel did a modest trade with the families of inmates including the rather bizarre cult of death row wives from abroad at any given time around twenty condemned men were married to european women they could never actually touch the weddings were not officially sanctioned by the state but the couples nonetheless considered themselves married and carried on to the fullest extent possible the wives corresponded with each other and often traveled together to texas to see their men they stayed at the same motel four had eaten at a table near the drumms late the night before they were usually noticeable with their thick accents and suggestive clothing they liked to be noticed back home they were minor celebrities donte had rebuffed all offers of matrimony during his final days he turned down book deals requests for interviews marriage proposals and the chance to make an appearance on fordycehitting hard he had refused to meet with both the prison chaplain and his own minister the reverend johnny canty donte had given up on religion he wanted no part of the same god so fervently worshipped by the devout christians who were hellbent on killing him roberta drumm awoke in the darkness of room she had slept so little in the past month that her fatigue now kept her awake the doctor had given her some pills but they had backfired and made her edgy the room was warm and she pulled back the sheets her daughter andrea was in the other twin bed only a few feet away and seemed to be sleeping her sons cedric and marvin were next door the rules of the prison allowed them to visit with donte from am until noon on this his final day after their last farewell he would be transported to the death chamber at the prison in huntsville eight in the morning was hours away the schedule was fixed all movements dictated by a system famous for its efficiency at that afternoon the family would report to a prison office in huntsville and then take a short ride in a van to the death chamber where they would be herded into a cramped witness room just seconds before the drugs were administered they would see him on the gurney tubes already in his arms listen to his final words wait ten minutes or so for the official declaration of death then leave quickly from there they would drive to a local funeral home to retrieve the body and take it home could it be a dream a nightmare was she really there awake in the darkness contemplating her sons final hours of course she was she had lived the nightmare for nine years now ever since the day shed been told that donte had not only been arrested but also confessed the nightmare was a book as thick as her bible every chapter another tragedy every page filled with sorrow and disbelief andrea rolled from one side to another the cheap bed squeaking and rattling then she was still and breathing heavily for roberta one horror had been replaced by the next the numbing shock of seeing her boy in jail for the first time in an orange jumpsuit eyes wild and scared the ache in her stomach as she thought about him in jail locked away from his family and surrounded by criminals the hope of a fair trial only to suffer the shock of realizing it was anything but fair her loud and unrestrained sobbing when the death sentence was announced the last image of her son being led from the courtroom by thick deputies so smug in their work the endless appeals and fading hopes the countless visits to death row where she watched a strong healthy young man slowly deteriorate she lost friends along the way and she really didnt care some were skeptical of the claims of innocence some grew weary of all the talk about her son but she was consumed and had little else to say how could anyone else know what a mother was going through and the nightmare would never end not today when texas finally executed him not next week when she buried him not at some point in the future when the truth was finally known if ever the horrors add up and there were many days when roberta drumm doubted she had the strength to get out of bed she was so tired of pretending to be strong are you wake momma andrea asked softly you know i am honey did you sleep any no i dont think so andrea kicked off the sheets and stretched her legs the room was very dark with no light filtering in from the outside its four thirty momma i cant see my watch glows in the dark andrea was the only one of the drumm kids with a college degree she taught kindergarten in a town near slone she had a husband and she wanted to be at home in her bed far away from livingston texas she closed her eyes in an effort to fall asleep but only seconds passed before she was staring at the ceiling momma i gotta tell you something what is it honey ive never told anyone this and i never will its a burden ive carried a long long time and i want you to know it before they take donte im listening there was a time after the trial after theyd sent him away that i began to doubt his story i think i was looking for a reason to doubt him what they said sort of made sense i could see donte fooling around with that girl afraid of getting caught and i could see her trying to break up and him not wanting to maybe he sneaked out of the house that night when i was asleep and when i heard his confession in court i have to admit it made me uneasy they never found her body and if he threw her in the river then maybe thats why theyll never find her i was trying to make sense out of everything that had happened i wanted to believe that the system is not totally broken and so i convinced myself that he was probably guilty that they probably got the right man i kept writing to him kept coming over here to see him and all but i was convinced he was guilty for a while it made me feel better in some strange way this went on for months maybe a year what changed your mind robbie you remember that time we went to austin to hear the case on direct appeal indeed i do it was a year or so after the trial i was there honey we were sitting in that big courtroom looking at those nine judges all white all looking so important in their black robes and hard frowns their airs and across the room was nicoles family and her bigmouthed mother and robbie got up to argue for us he was so good he went through the trial and pointed out how weak the evidence was he mocked the prosecutor and the judge he was afraid of nothing he attacked the confession and he brought up for the first time the fact that the police had not told him about the anonymous phone caller who said it was donte that shocked me how could the police and the prosecutor withhold evidence didnt bother the court though i remember watching robbie argue so passionately and it dawned on me that he the lawyer the white guy from the rich part of town had no doubt whatsoever that my brother was innocent and i believed him right then and there i felt so ashamed for doubting donte its okay honey please dont tell anyone never you can trust your mother you know they sat up and moved to the edges of their beds holding hands foreheads touching andrea said you wanna cry or you wanna pray we can pray later but we cant cry later right lets have us a good cry the predawn traffic picked up as they approached oklahoma city boyettes forehead was pressed against the passengers window his mouth open in a pathetic drool his nap was entering its second hour and keith was happy with the solitude hed stopped back near the state line for a cup of carryout coffee a dreadful machine brew that he would normally pour into a ditch but what it lacked in flavor it more than made up for in caffeine and keith was buzzing right along his head spinning his speedometer exactly eight miles per hour over the limit boyette had requested a beer at the last stop keith declined and bought him a bottle of water he found a bluegrass station out of edmond and listened to it at low volume at he called dana but she had little to say south of oklahoma city boyette jerked from his slumber and said guess i dozed off you did indeed pastor these pills i take really work on the bladder can we do a quick pit stop sure keith said what else could he say he kept one eye on the clock they would leave the expressway somewhere north of denton texas and head east on twolane roads keith had no idea how long that would take his best guess was arriving in slone between noon and pm the pit stops of course were not helping their progress they stopped in norman and bought more coffee and water boyette managed to blaze through two cigarettes sucking and blowing rapidly as if it might be his last smoke while keith quickly refueled fifteen minutes later they were back on i racing south through the flat country of oklahoma as a man of god keith felt compelled to at least explore the subject of faith he began somewhat tentatively youve talked about your childhood travis and we dont need to go back there just curious though if you were ever exposed to a church or to a preacher when you were a kid the tic was back so was the contemplation no he said and for a moment that seemed to be all then i never knew my mother to go to church she didnt have much of a family i think they were ashamed of her so they kept away darrell certainly didnt do the church thing uncle chett needed a good dose of religion but im sure hes in hell right now keith saw an opening so you believe in hell i suppose i believe we all go somewhere after we die and i cant imagine you and me going to the same place can you pastor i mean look ive spent most of my life in prison and trust me theres a species of mankind thats subhuman these people were born mean theyre vicious soulless crazy men who cannot be helped when they die they gotta go to some bad place the irony was almost comical a confessed murderer and serial rapist condemning violent men was there a bible in the house keith asked trying to stay away from the subject of heinous crimes never saw one never saw much in the way of books i was raised on porn pastor fed to me by uncle chett and kept under darrells bed thats the extent of my childhood reading do you believe in god look pastor im not talking about god and jesus and salvation and all that i heard it all the time in prison lots of guys get really turned on when theyre locked away and start thumping the bible i guess some are serious but it also sounds good at the parole hearings i just never bought into it are you prepared for death travis a pause look pastor im fortyfour years old and my life has been one massive train wreck im tired of living in prison im tired of living with the guilt of what ive done im tired of hearing the pitiful voices of the people i hurt im tired of a lot of shit pastor okay sorry for the language im tired of being some degenerate who lives on the edges of society im just so sick of it all im proud of my tumor okay hard to believe but when its not cracking my skull i kinda like the damned thing it tells me whats ahead my days are numbered and that doesnt bother me i wont hurt anybody else no one will miss me pastor if i didnt have the tumor id get a bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka and float away forever still might do that so much for a penetrating discussion on the subject of faith ten miles passed before keith said what would you like to talk about travis nothing i just want to sit here and look at the road and think about nothing sounds good to me you hungry no thanks robbie left the house at am and drove a circuitous route to the office he kept his window down so he could smell the smoke the fire had long since been extinguished but the odor of freshly charred wood hung like a thick cloud over slone there was no wind downtown anxious cops were blocking streets and diverting traffic away from the first baptist church robbie got just a glimpse of its smoking ruins illuminated by the flashing lights of fire and rescue vehicles he took the backstreets and when he parked at the old train station and got out of his car the smell was still pungent and fresh all of slone would be awakened and greeted with the ominous vapor of a suspicious fire and the obvious question would be will there be more his staff drifted in all sleep deprived and anxious to see if the day would take a dramatic turn away from the direction it was headed they gathered in the main conference room around the long table still cluttered with the debris of the night before carlos gathered empty pizza boxes and beer bottles while samantha thomas served coffee and bagels robbie trying to appear upbeat replayed for the gang his conversation with fred pryor about the surreptitious recording from the strip club pryor himself had not yet arrived the phone started ringing no one wanted to answer it the receptionist was not in yet somebody punch do not disturb robbie barked and the phone stopped ringing aaron rey walked from room to room looking out the windows the television was on but muted bonnie entered the conference room and said robbie i just checked the phone messages for the past six hours nothing important just a couple of death threats and a couple of rednecks happy the big day is finally here no call from the governor robbie asked not yet what a surprise im sure he lost sleep like the rest of us keith would eventually frame the speeding ticket and because of it he would always know exactly what he was doing at am on thursday november the location wasnt clear because there was no town in sight just a long empty stretch of i somewhere north of ardmore oklahoma the trooper was hiding in some trees in the median and as soon as keith saw him and glanced at his speedometer he knew he was in trouble he hit his brakes slowed considerably and waited a few seconds when the blue lights appeared boyette said oh shit watch your language keith was braking hard and hurrying to the shoulder my language is the least of your problems whatre you gonna tell him that im sorry what if he asks what were doing were driving down the highway maybe a bit too fast but were okay i think ill tell him im jumping parole and youre my getaway driver knock it off travis the truth was that travis looked exactly like the sort of character who would be jumping parole right out of central casting keith stopped the car turned off the ignition straightened his clerical collar and made sure it was as visible as possible and said dont say a word travis let me do the talking as they waited for a very deliberate and purposeful state trooper keith managed to amuse himself by admitting that he was sitting beside the road engaged in not one but two criminal activities and that for some inconceivable reason hed chosen as his partner in crime a serial rapist and murderer he glanced at travis and said can you cover up that tattoo it was on the left side of his neck a swirling creation that only a deviant might understand and wear with pride what if he likes tattoos travis said without making a move for his shirt collar the trooper approached carefully with a long flashlight and when things appeared safe he said gruffly good morning morning keith said glancing up he handed over his license registration and insurance card you a priest it was more of an accusation keith doubted there were many catholics in southern oklahoma im a lutheran minister he said with a warm smile the perfect picture of peace and civility lutheran the trooper grunted as if that might be worse than a catholic yes sir he shined his light on the license well reverend schroeder you were doing eightyfive miles an hour yes sir sorry about that limit out here is seventyfive whats the hurry no real hurry just wasnt paying attention where you headed keith wanted to fire back why sir is that any of your business but he quickly said dallas got a boy in dallas the trooper said as if that fact were somehow relevant he walked back to his car got inside slammed the door and began his paperwork his blue lights sparkled through the fading darkness when the adrenaline settled down and keith got bored with the waiting he decided to make use of the time he called matthew burns who appeared to be holding his cell phone keith explained where he was and what was happening to him at the moment and had trouble convincing matthew that it was nothing but a routine speeding ticket they managed to work through matthews overreaction and agreed to start calling robbie flaks office immediately the trooper eventually returned keith signed his ticket retrieved his documents apologized again and after twentyeight minutes they were back on the road boyettes presence was never acknowledged chapter at one point in his blurred past donte knew the precise number of days hed spent in cell number f death row at the polunsky unit most inmates kept such a tally but hed lost count for the same reason hed lost interest in reading writing exercising eating brushing his teeth shaving showering trying to communicate with other inmates and obeying the guards he could sleep and dream and use the toilet when necessary beyond that he was unable or unwilling to try much else this is the big day donte the guard said when he slid the breakfast tray into the cell pancakes and applesauce again how you doin okay donte mumbled they spoke through a narrow slit in the metal door the guard was mouse a tiny black guy one of the nicer ones mouse moved on leaving donte to stare at the food he did not touch it an hour later mouse was back come on donte you gotta eat not hungry how bout your last meal you thought about that you gotta place your order in a few hours whats good donte asked im not sure anythings good as a last meal but they tell me most of the guys eat like a horse steak potatoes catfish shrimp pizza anything you want how bout cold noodles and boiled leather same as any other day whatever you want donte mouse leaned a few inches closer lowered his voice and said donte ill be thinking about you you hear thanks mouse ill miss you donte youre a good guy donte was amused at the thought that someone on death row would miss him he did not respond and mouse moved on donte sat on the edge of his bunk for a long time and stared at a cardboard box theyd delivered yesterday in it hed neatly packed his possessionsa dozen paperbacks none of which hed read in years two writing tablets envelopes a dictionary a bible a calendar a zippered bag in which he kept his money two tins of sardines and a package of stale saltines from the canteen and a radio that picked up only a christian station from livingston and a country one from huntsville he took a writing tablet and a pencil and began to calculate it took some time but he finally arrived at a total he believed to be fairly accurate seven years seven months and three days in cell number f days before that hed spent about four months at the old death row at ellis hed been arrested on december and hed been locked up since almost nine years behind bars it was an eternity but not an impressive number four doors down oliver tyree age sixtyfour was in his thirtyfirst year on death row with no execution date on the calendar there were several twentyyear veterans it was changing though the newer arrivals faced a different set of rules there were tougher deadlines for their appeals for those convicted after the average wait before execution was ten years shortest in the nation during his early years in f donte waited and waited for news from the courts they moved at a snails pace it seemed then it was all over no more petitions to file no more judges and justices for robbie to attack looking back now the appeals seemed to have flown by he stretched out on his bed and tried to sleep you count the days and watch the years go by you tell yourself and you believe it that youd rather just die youd rather stare death boldly in the face and say youre ready because whatever is waiting on the other side has to be better than growing old in a sixbyten cage with no one to talk to you consider yourself halfdead at best please take the other half youve watched dozens leave and not return and you accept the fact that one day theyll come for you youre nothing but a rat in their lab a disposable body to be used as proof that their experiment is working an eye for an eye each killing must be avenged you kill enough and youre convinced that killing is good you count the days and then there are none left you ask yourself on your last morning if you are really ready you search for courage but the bravery is fading when its over no one really wants to die it was a big day for reeva too and to show the world she was suffering she invited fordycehitting hard back into her home for breakfast in her most stylish pantsuit she cooked bacon and eggs and sat around the table with wallis and their two children chad and marie both in their late teens none of the four needed a heavy breakfast they shouldve skipped the meal completely but the cameras were rolling and as the family ate they prattled on about the fire that destroyed their beloved church a fire that was still smoldering they were stunned angry they were certain it was arson but managed to restrain themselves and not make allegations against anyoneon camera off camera they just knew the fire had been started by black thugs reeva had been a member of the church for over forty years she had married both husbands there chad marie and nicole had been baptized there wallis was a deacon it was a tragedy gradually they got around to more important matters they all agreed that it was a sad day a sad occasion sad but so necessary for almost nine years they had waited for this day for justice to finally arrive for their family and yes for all of slone as well sean fordyce was still tied up with a complicated execution in florida but he had made his plans wellknown he would arrive by private jet at the huntsville airport later in the afternoon for a quick interview with reeva before she witnessed the execution of course he would be there when it was over without the host the breakfast footage went on and on off camera an assistant producer prompted the family with such gems as do you think lethal injection is too humane reeva certainly did wallis just grunted chad chewed his bacon marie a chatterbox like her mother said between bites that drumm should suffer intense physical pain as he was dying just like nicole do you think executions should be made public mixed reactions around the table the condemned man is allowed a last statement if you could speak to him what would you say reeva chewing burst into tears and covered her eyes why oh why she wailed why did you take my baby sean will love this the assistant producer whispered to the cameraman both were suppressing smiles reeva pulled herself together and the family plowed through breakfast at one point she barked at her husband whod said almost nothing wallis what are you thinking wallis shrugged as if he hadnt been thinking at all coincidentally brother ronnie dropped by just as the meal was wrapping up hed been up all night watching his church burn and he needed sleep but reeva and her family also needed him they quizzed him about the fire he appeared sufficiently burdened they moved to the rear of the home to reevas room where they sat and huddled around a coffee table they held hands and brother ronnie led them in prayer with an effort at drama and with the camera two feet from his head he pleaded for strength and courage for the family to endure what was ahead on this difficult day he thanked the lord for justice he prayed for their church and its members he did not mention donte drumm or his family after a dozen trips to voice mail a real person finally answered flak law firm she said quickly robbie flak please keith said as he perked up boyette turned and

desk near the front door and hurried through the train station rounding up the team robbie was in his office with fred pryor robbie you need to hear this she said and her face and voice left no room for discussion they met in the conference room where they gathered around a speakerphone robbie pushed a button and said this is robbie flak mr flak this is keith schroeder we spoke yesterday

about travis robbie said there was no movement and little breathing around the table hes fortyfour years old born in joplin missouri a career criminal registered sex offender in at least four states keith glanced at boyette who was looking through the passenger window as if he were somewhere else his last stop was a prison in lansing kansas and hes now on parole he was living in slone at the time of nicole yarbers disappearance staying at the rebel motor inn im sure you know where it is he was arrested for drunk driving in slone in january there is a copy of his arrest carlos and bonnie were hammering keys on their laptops racing through the internet digging for anything on keith schroeder travis boyette the arrest in slone keith continued in fact he was in jail in slone while donte drumm was under arrest boyette posted bond got out then skipped town he drifted to kansas tried to rape another woman got caught and is just finishing his sentence tense looks were exchanged around the table everyone took a breath why is he talking now robbie asked leaning down closer to the speakerphone hes dying keith said bluntly no need to softpedal things at this point he has a brain tumor a glioblastoma grade four inoperable he says that the doctors have told him he has less than a year to live he says he wants to do the right thing while he was in prison he lost track of the drumm case said he figured the authorities in texas would one day figure out that they had the wrong man this guys in the car with you yes can he hear this conversation keith was driving with his left hand and holding his cell phone with his right no he said when did you meet this guy keith monday do you believe him if he is in fact a serial rapist and career criminal then hed rather lie than tell the truth how do you know he has a brain tumor i checked that out its true keith glanced at boyette who was still staring at nothing through the passenger window i think its all true what does he want so far nothing where are you right now interstate not far from the texas line how does this work robbie is there a chance of stopping the execution theres a chance robbie said as he looked into the eyes of samantha thomas she shrugged nodded a weak maybe robbie rubbed both hands and said okay keith heres what we have to do we have to meet boyette and ask him a lot of questions and if that goes well then well prepare an affidavit for him to sign and file it with a petition we have time but not much carlos handed samantha a photo of boyette hed just printed out from a web site for the kansas department of corrections she pointed at his face and whispered get him on the phone robbie nodded and said keith id like to talk to boyette can you put him on keith lowered his cell phone and said travis this is the lawyer he wants to talk to you i dont think so boyette said why not were driving to texas to talk to the man here he is nope ill talk when we get there boyettes voice was clear on the speakerphone robbie and the rest were relieved to know that keith actually had someone else in the car with him maybe he wasnt some nut playing games at the eleventh hour robbie pressed on if we can talk to him now we can start to work on his affidavit thatll save some time and we dont have much of it keith relayed this to boyette whose reaction was startling his upper body pitched forward violently as he grabbed his head with both hands he tried to suppress a scream but a very loud aghhhhh escaped followed by deep guttural lurches that made the man sound as if he were dying in horrendous pain what was that robbie asked keith was driving talking on the phone and suddenly distracted by another seizure ill call you back he said and put the phone down im throwing up boyette said reaching for the door handle keith hit the brakes and steered the subaru onto the shoulder an wheeler behind him swerved and sounded the horn they finally came to a stop and boyette clutched his seat belt when he was free he leaned through the cracked door and began vomiting keith got out walked to the rear bumper and decided not to watch boyette puked for a long time and when he finally finished keith handed him a bottle of water i need to lie down boyette said and crawled into the backseat dont move the car he directed im still sick keith walked a few feet away and called his wife after another noisy bout of gagging and throwing up boyette seemed to settle down he returned to the rear seat with the rightside door open his feet hanging out we need to move along travis slone is not getting any closer just a minute okay im not ready to move he was rubbing his temples and his slick skull seemed ready to crack keith watched him for a minute but felt uncomfortable gawking at such agony he stepped around the vomit and leaned on the hood of the car his phone buzzed it was robbie what happened he asked robbie was seated now still at the conference table with most of the crew still there carlos was already working on an affidavit bonnie had found boyettes arrest record in slone and was trying to determine which lawyer had represented him kristi hinze arrived around and soon realized she was missing the excitement martha handler typed furiously another episode in her evolving story about the execution aaron rey and fred pryor roamed around the train station sipping cup after cup of coffee and nervously watching all doors and windows thankfully the sun was now up and they didnt really expect trouble not at the office anyway he has these seizures keith said as an wheeler roared by its wind blowing his hair i guess its the tumor but when they hit theyre pretty frightening hes been throwing up for the past twenty minutes is the car moving keith no well take off in a minute the minutes are getting by us keith you understand this right donte will be executed at six oclock tonight i got that if youll recall i tried to talk to you yesterday and you told me to get lost robbie took a deep breath as he collected the stares from around the table can he hear you right now no hes lying in the backseat rubbing his head afraid to move me im sitting on the hood dodging wheelers tell us why you believe this guy well lets see where do i start he knows a lot about the crime he was in slone when it happened hes obviously capable of such violence hes dying theres no proof against donte drumm other than the confession and boyette has her senior class ring on a chain around his neck thats the best i can do robbie and ill admit theres a slight chance this is all a big lie but youre helping him jump parole youre committing a crime dont remind me okay i just talked to my wife and she happened to mention that how soon can you get here i dont know three hours maybe weve stopped twice for coffee because i havent slept in three nights i bought myself a speeding ticket one written by the slowest trooper in oklahoma now boyette is puking his guts out and id rather him do that in a ditch and not in my car i dont know robbie were trying hurry up chapter with the sun up and the town anxiously coming to life the slone police were on high alert with holsters unfastened radios squawking patrol cars darting up and down the streets and every officer looking for the next hint of trouble it was expected at the high school and for good measure the chief sent half a dozen men there early on thursday morning when the students arrived for class they saw police cars parked near the main entrance an ominous sign all of slone knew that the black players had boycotted practice on wednesday and had vowed not to play friday there could be no greater insult to a community that loved its football the fans so ardent and loyal only a week earlier now felt betrayed feelings were strong emotions were raw all over slone on the white side of town the bitterness was caused by football and now the burning of a church on the black side it was all about the execution as with most violent and sudden conflicts the precise manner in which the riot began would never be known in the endless retelling of it two things became obvious the black students blamed the white students and the whites blamed the blacks the question of time was a bit clearer just seconds after the first bell at several things happened at once smoke bombs were lit in the boys restrooms on the first and second floors cherry bombs were rolled down the main hallway exploding like howitzers under the metal lockers a string of firecrackers went off near the central stairwell and panic swept the school most of the black students walked out of class and mingled in the halls a brawl erupted in a junior homeroom class when a black hothead and a white hothead exchanged insults and started swinging others were quick to take sides and join in the teacher ran from the room screaming for help one fight sparked a dozen more before long students were rushing out of the building running for safety some were yelling fire fire though no flames had been seen the police called for backups and fire trucks firecrackers were popping all over the first and second floors the smoke grew thicker and thicker as the chaos spread near the entryway to the gymnasium some black kids were ransacking the trophy cases when they were seen by a gang of whites another fight broke out one that spilled into a parking lot next to the gym the principal stayed in his office and barked nonstop into the pa system his warnings were ignored and only added to the confusion at he announced that school had been canceled for that day and the next the police with reinforcements eventually settled things down and evacuated slone high school there were no fires only smoke and the acrid smell of cheap explosives there was some broken glass clogged toilets upended lockers and stolen backpacks and a soft drink machine was vandalized three studentstwo whites and one blackwere taken to the hospital and treated for cuts there were a lot of cuts and bruises that went unreported typical of such a melee with so many taking part it was not possible to determine who was causing trouble and who was trying to flee so no arrests were made at the time many of the older boys black and white went home to get their guns roberta andrea cedric and marvin were cleared through the security desk at polunskys front building and led by a supervisor to the visitors room a process and a walk they had endured many times in the past seven years and though they had always hated the prison and everything about it they realized that it would soon be a part of their past if it meant nothing else polunsky was where donte lived that would change in a matter of hours there are two private rooms used by attorneys in the visiting area they are slightly wider than the other booths used by visitors and they are fully enclosed so no guard or prison official or other inmate or lawyer can eavesdrop on his final day a condemned man is allowed to see his family and friends in one of the attorneys rooms the plexiglas is still there and all conversations are through black phones on each side of it no touching the visitors room is a loud and busy place on weekends but on weekdays there is little traffic wednesdays are set aside as media days and a man with a date is typically interviewed by a couple of reporters from the town where the murder took place donte had declined all requests for interviews when the family entered the visiting area at am the only other person there was a female guard named ruth they knew her well she was a thoughtful soul who liked donte ruth welcomed them and said how sorry she was donte was already in the attorneys booth when roberta and cedric entered a guard could be seen through the window of a door behind him as always he placed the palm of his left hand flat on the plexiglas and roberta did the same from the other side though the touch was never completed it was a long warm embrace in their minds donte had not touched his mother since the last day of his trial in october when a guard allowed them a quick hug as he was being led from the courtroom he held the phone with his right hand and said with a smile hi momma thanks for coming i love you their hands were still together pressed against the glass roberta said and i love you right back donte how are you today the same ive already had my shower and a shave everybodys real nice to me got fresh clothes on a new pair of boxers this is a lovely place they get real nice around here right before they kill you you look great donte and so do you momma youre as beautiful as always during one of her first visits roberta had wept and had been unable to stop herself afterward donte wrote to her and explained how upsetting it was to see her so distraught in the solitude of his cell he wept for hours but he couldnt bear to watch his mother do the same he wanted her to visit him whenever possible but the tears did more harm than good there had been no more tears not from roberta andrea cedric marvin or any other relative or friend roberta made this very clear with each visit if you cant control yourself get out of the room i talked to robbie this morning she said he has one or two more plans for the final appeals plus the governor has not ruled on your request for a reprieve so theres still hope donte theres no hope momma so dont kid yourself we cant give up donte why not theres nothing we can do when texas wants to kill somebody theyre gonna do it killed one last week got another planned later this month its an assembly line around here cant nobody stop it you might get lucky and get a stay every now and then happened to me two years ago but sooner or later your time is up they dont care about guilt or innocence momma all they care about is showing the world how tough they are texas dont fool around dont mess with texas ever heard that softly she said i dont want you to be angry donte im sorry momma im gonna die angry i cant help it some of these guys go peacefully singing hymns quoting scripture begging for forgiveness dude last week said father unto you i commend my spirit some dont say a word just close their eyes and wait for the poison a few go out kicking todd willingham died three years ago always claimed to be innocent they said he started a house fire that burned up his three little girls yet he was in the house and got burned too he was a fighter he cussed em in his final statement dont do that donte i dont know what ill do momma maybe nothing maybe ill just lie there with my eyes closed and start counting and when i get to a hundred ill just float away but momma youre not gonna be there weve had this conversation donte well now were having it again i dont want you to witness this i dont want to either believe me but ill be there im gonna talk to robbie ive already talked to him donte he knows how i feel donte slowly withdrew his left hand from the glass and roberta did the same she placed the phone on the counter and removed a sheet of paper from her pocket no purses were allowed past the front desk she unfolded the paper picked up the phone and said donte this is a list of the folks whove called or stopped by to ask about you i promised them i would pass along their thoughts he nodded and tried to smile roberta went through the namesneighbors old friends from down the street classmates beloved church members and a few distant relatives donte listened without a word but seemed to drift away roberta went on and on and with each name she added a brief commentary about the person or an anecdote andrea was next the touching ritual was followed she described the burning of the baptist church the tension in slone the fears that things would get worse donte seemed to like thatthe thought of his people fighting back the family had learned years earlier that it was important to arrive at the visitors room with a pocketful of coins vending machines lined the walls and the guards delivered the food and drinks to the inmates during the visits donte had lost serious weight in prison but he craved a certain cinnamon bun coated with thick frosting while roberta and andrea handled the first round of the visit marvin bought two of the buns with a soft drink and ruth took them to donte the junk food helped his mood cedric was reading a newspaper not far from the attorneys room when the warden popped in for a friendly hello he wanted to make sure all was well everything in his prison running smooth anything i can do to help he asked as if he were running for office he was trying hard to appear compassionate cedric stood up thought for a second and then got angry are you kidding me youre about to put my brother to death for something he didnt do and you pop in here with some happy horseshit about wanting to help were just doing our jobs sir ruth was walking over no youre not unless your job allows you to kill innocent people you wanna help stop the damned execution marvin stepped between them and said lets be cool here the warden backed away and said something to ruth they had a serious conversation as the warden walked to the door he soon left the texas court of criminal appeals tcca has sole jurisdiction over capital murder cases and is the court of last resort in texas before an inmate hits the federal circuit it has nine members all elected all required to run statewide in it still clung to the archaic rule that all pleadings petitions appeals documents and such had to be filed as hard copies nothing online black ink on white paper and tons of it each filing had to include twelve copies one for each justice and one for the clerk one for the secretary and one for the official file it was a bizarre and cumbersome procedure the federal court for the western district of texas housed a few blocks from the tcca adopted electronic filing in the mids by the turn of the century paper filings were rapidly becoming obsolete as technology marched on in law both in courts and in offices the electronic file became far more popular than the paper file at am on thursday the flak firm and the defender group lawyers were notified that the insanity claim was denied by the tcca the court did not believe donte was mentally ill this was expected minutes after this denial was received the identical petition was filed electronically in the federal court for the eastern district of texas in tyler at am a defender group lawyer named cicely avis walked into the clerks office at the tcca with the latest filing by the lawyers for donte drumm it was a claim of actual innocence based on the secretly recorded statements by joey gamble cicely routinely showed up with similar filings and she and the clerk knew each other well what else is coming the clerk asked as he processed the petition im sure there will be something cicely said usually is the clerk finished his paperwork handed a marked copy back to cicely and wished her a good day because of the obvious urgency of the matter the clerk hand delivered a copy of the petition to the offices of all nine justices three happened to be in austin the other six were scattered around the state the chief justice was a man by the name of milton prudlowe a longtime member of the court who lived in lubbock most of the year but kept a small apartment in austin prudlowe and his law clerk read the petition and paid particular attention to the eightpage transcript of the recording of joey gamble spilling his guts in a houston strip club the night before while it was entertaining it was far from sworn testimony and there was little doubt he would deny making the statements if confronted with them no consent had been given to the recording everything about it was tinged with sleaze the young man was obviously drinking heavily and if his statements could be delivered and if he had indeed lied at trial what would it prove almost nothing in prudlowes opinion donte drumm had confessed plain and simple the drumm case had never bothered milton prudlowe seven years earlier he and his colleagues had first considered the direct appeal of donte drumm they remembered it well not because of the confession but because of the absence of a dead body his conviction was affirmed though and in a unanimous opinion texas law had long been settled on the issue of a murder trial without clear evidence of murder some of the usual elements were just not necessary prudlowe and his law clerk agreed that this latest claim had no merit the clerk then polled the clerks of the other justices and within an hour a preliminary denial was being circulated boyette was in the backseat where hed been for almost two hours hed taken a pill and evidently it was working splendidly he didnt move didnt make a sound but did appear to be breathing the last time keith checked to stay awake and to get his blood boiling keith had called dana twice they had words neither retreated neither apologized for saying too much after each conversation keith found himself wideawake fuming he called matthew burns who was at the office in downtown topeka and anxious to help there was little he could do when the subaru drifted onto the right shoulder of a twolane road somewhere close to sherman texas keith was suddenly awakened and mad he stopped at the nearest convenience store and bought a tall cup of strong coffee he stirred in three packs of sugar and walked around the store five times back in the car boyette had not moved keith gulped the hot coffee and sped away his cell phone rang and he snatched it from the passengers seat it was robbie flak where are you he asked i dont know highway headed west outside of sherman whats taking so long im doing the best i can what are the chances of me talking to boyette now by phone slim right now hes passed out in the backseat still very sick and he said he was not talking until he got there i cant do anything keith until i talk to this guy okay i have to know how much he is willing to say is he going to admit that he killed nicole yarber can you answer this well robbie its like this we left topeka in the middle of the night were driving like crazy to get to your office and the sole purpose according to boyette when we left topeka was for him to come clean admit to the rape and murder and try to save donte drumm thats what he said but with this guy nothing is predictable he may be in a coma right now for all i know should you check his pulse no he doesnt like to be touched just hurry damn it watch your language please im a minister and i dont appreciate that language sorry please hurry chapter the march had been whispered about since monday but its details had not been finalized when the week began the execution was days away and there was a fervent hope in the black community that a judge somewhere would wake up and stop it but the days had passed and the higher powers were still asleep now the hour was near and the blacks in slone especially the younger ones were not about to sit idly by the closing of the high school had energized them and left them free to look for a way to make noise around am a crowd began to gather at washington park at the corner of tenth street and martin luther king boulevard aided by cell phones and the internet the crowd multiplied and before long a thousand blacks were milling about restless certain that something was about to happen but not sure exactly what two police cars arrived and parked down the street safely away from the crowd trey glover was slone high schools starting tailback and he drove an suv with tinted windows oversize tires glistening chrome wheel covers and an audio system that could break glass he parked it on the street opened all four doors and began playing white mans justice an angry rap song by t p slik the song electrified the crowd others streamed in most of them high school students but the gathering was also attracting the unemployed some housewives and a few retirees a drum ensemble materialized when four members of the marching warriors arrived with two bass drums and two snares a chant began free donte drumm and it echoed through the neighborhood in the distance away from the park someone lit a round of firecrackers and for a split second everyone thought it couldve been gunfire smoke bombs were set off and as the minutes passed the tension grew the brick was not thrown from washington park it came from behind the police cars from behind a wooden fence next to a house owned by mr ernie shylock who was sitting on the porch watching the excitement he claimed no knowledge of who threw it it crashed into the rear window of a police car jolted the two cops into a near panic and caused a roaring wave of approval from the crowd the police ran around for a few seconds guns drawn ready to shoot anything that moved with mr shylock being the first possible target he raised his hands and yelled dont shoot i didnt do it one cop sprinted behind the house as if he might chase down the assailant but after forty yards he was winded and gave up within minutes reinforcements arrived and the sight of more police cars fired up the crowd the march finally began when the drummers stepped onto martin luther king boulevard and headed north in the general direction of downtown they were followed by trey glover in his suv windows down rap at full volume behind him were the others a long line of protesters many holding posters that demanded justice a stop to the killing and freedom for donte children on bikes joined the fun blacks sitting idly on porches got up and began walking with the crowd the parade grew in size as it inched along seemingly without a destination no one had bothered with a permit as required by slone ordinance the rally the day before in front of the courthouse had been legally conducted but not this march the police though played it cool let em protest let em yell itll be over tonight hopefully blocking the parade route or trying to disperse the crowd or even arresting a few would incite them and only make matters worse so the police held back some following at a distance while others circled ahead clearing the way diverting traffic a black officer on a motorcycle pulled alongside the suv and yelled where you going trey trey apparently the unofficial leader of the event replied were going back to the courthouse keep it peaceful and there wont be trouble ill try trey said with a shrug he and the officer both knew that trouble could erupt at any moment the parade turned onto phillips street and inched along a loosely organized assemblage of concerned citizens enthralled by their freedom of expression and who were also enjoying the attention the drummers repeated their precise impressive routines the rap shook the ground with its deadening lyrics the students shook and gyrated with the beat while chanting a variety of battle cries the mood was at once festive and angry the kids were quite proud of their ballooning numbers yet they wanted to do more ahead of them the police blocked off main street and spread the word among the downtown merchants that a march was headed their way the call was recorded at am the mount sinai church of god in christ was burning not far from washington park a white van with a logo and phone numbers had been parked behind the church according to the caller and two white men in uniforms like plumbers or electricians had hurried from the church into the van and left minutes later there was smoke sirens erupted as the first responders answered the call fire trucks rumbled from two of the three stations in slone at the corner of phillips and main the march came to a halt the drummers were still the rap was turned down they watched the fire trucks go racing by headed into their part of town the same black officer on the motorcycle stopped at the suv and informed trey that one of their churches was now burning lets disband this little march trey the officer said i dont think so then theres gonna be trouble theres already trouble trey said yall need to break up before this thing gets outta hand no you need to get outta the way ten miles west of slone there was a country store and deli called the trading post it was owned by a large loud garrulous man named jesse hicks a second cousin of reevas jesses father had opened the trading post fifty years earlier and jesse had never worked anywhere else the post as it was known was a gathering place for gossip and lunch and it had even hosted a few campaign barbecues for politicians on thursday there was more traffic than usual more folks stopping by to hear the latest on the execution jesse kept a photo of his favorite niece nicole yarber on the wall behind the counter next to the cigarettes and he would discuss her case with anyone who would listen technically she was a third cousin but he called her a niece since shed become something of a celebrity for jesse pm on thursday november could not arrive soon enough the store was in the front part of the building the small eating area in the rear and around an ancient potbellied stove there were half a dozen rocking chairs all occupied as lunch drew near jesse was working the cash register selling gas and beer and talking nonstop to his small crowd with the riot at the high school only a few hours old and the first baptist church still smoldering and of course the looming execution the gossip was hot and the men chatted away excitedly a man called shorty walked in and announced the africans are marchin downtown again one of em threw a brick through the window of a police car this on top of all the other stories led to a near overload of news that had to be discussed and analyzed and put in perspective and quickly shorty had the floor for a few minutes but was soon overshadowed by jesse who always dominated the conversations various opinions were put forth on what the police should be doing and no one argued that the police were handling things properly for years jesse had boasted that he would witness the execution of donte drumm couldnt wait to watch it would in fact pull the switch himself if given the chance he had said many times that his dear reeva was insistent that he be there on account of his fondness for and closeness to nicole his beloved niece every man rocking away had seen jesse get choked up and wipe his eyes when talking about nicole but now a lastminute bureaucratic snafu was keeping jesse away from huntsville there were so many journalists and prison officials and other big shots wanting to watch that jesse got bumped it was the hottest ticket in town and jesse though on the approved list had somehow been left out a man named rusty walked in and announced another church is on fire one of those black pentecostal ones where in slone near washington park the thought of a retaliatory church burning was at first inconceivable even jesse was stunned but the more they talked about it and analyzed it the more they liked it why not tit for tat an eye for an eye if they want war well give em a war there was a general agreement that slone was a powder keg and they were in for a long night this was disturbing but also stimulating every man sitting around the stove had at least two guns in his truck and more in the house two strangers entered the trading post one a man of the cloth with a collar and navy jacket the other man a slickheaded cripple who shuffled along with a cane the minister walked to a display case and took out two bottles of water the other man went to the restroom keith set the two bottles on the counter and said good morning to jesse behind him the experts in the rockers were all talking at once and keith understood none of it you from around here jesse asked as he rung up the water no just passing through keith said his speech was crisp precise no accent at all yankee you a preacher yes im a lutheran minister keith said as he caught a nose full of onion rings being removed from hot grease a hunger pain hit and buckled his knees he was starving and exhausted but there was no time for food boyette was shuffling over keith handed him a bottle said thanks to jesse and turned for the door boyette nodded at jesse who said you boys have a good day and with that jesse spoke to the man who murdered his niece in the parking lot an audi stopped abruptly next to the subaru and two menaaron rey and fred pryorcrawled out quick introductions were made aaron and fred looked closely at boyette sizing him up asking themselves if the guy was real robbie would want to know as soon as they got back in the car and called him aaron said were about fifteen minutes from the office and well have to detour around downtown theres a lot going on just stick close okay lets go keith said anxious to finish this interminable drive they drove away the subaru tailgating the audi boyette seemed calm even detached the cane was resting between his legs he thumped its handle with his fingers in much the same way hed been doing for the past ten hours when they passed the sign indicating the municipal boundaries of slone boyette said i never thought id see this place again recognize it the tic the pause not really ive seen a lot of these places pastor small hick towns everywhere after a while they tend to blur together anything special about slone nicole i killed her and she was the only one you killed i didnt say that pastor so there are others didnt say that either lets talk about something else and what would you like to talk about travis howd you meet your wife ive told you before travis leave her out of it youre much too concerned with my wife shes so cute on the conference table robbie pushed a button for the speakerphone and said talk to me fred we met them theyre behind us now and they appear to be a genuine minister and one seriously weird sidekick describe boyette white male you wouldnt call him handsome five ten shaved scalp with a bad tattoo on the left side of his neck several more covering his arms has the look of a sick puppy whos spent his life locked away green shifty eyes that dont blink i wanted to wash my hand after shaking his weak handshake a dishrag robbie took a deep breath and then said so theyre here they are indeed well be there in a matter of minutes hurry up he turned off the speakerphone and looked at his team scattered around the table all watching him it might be somewhat intimidating for boyette to walk in here and have ten people staring at him robbie said lets pretend like its business as usual ill take him to my office and ask the first questions their file on boyette was getting thicker they had found records of his convictions in four states and a few details of his incarcerations and they had located the lawyer in slone whod represented him briefly after his arrest there the lawyer vaguely remembered him and had sent over his file they had an affidavit from the owner of the rebel motor inn one inez gaffney who had no recollection of boyette but did find his name in an old ledger from they had the building records from the monsanto warehouse where boyette allegedly worked in the late fall of that year carlos tidied up the conference table and they waited when keith parked at the train station and opened his door he heard sirens in the distance he smelled smoke he sensed trouble the first baptist church burned last night aaron said as they walked up the steps to the old loading platform now theres a fire at a black church over there he nodded to his left as if keith was supposed to know his way around town theyre burning churches he asked yep boyette struggled up the steps leaning on his cane and then they stepped into the lobby fanta pretended to be busy with a word processor barely looking up wheres robbie fred pryor asked and she nodded toward the back robbie met them in the conference room awkward introductions were made boyette was reluctant to speak or to shake hands abruptly he said to robbie i remember you i saw you on television after the boy was arrested you were upset almost yelling at the camera thats me where were you i was here mr flak watching it all couldnt believe they had arrested the wrong guy thats right the wrong guy for someone as highstrung and quicktempered as robbie flak it was difficult to remain calm he wanted to slap boyette and grab his cane and beat him senseless and curse him for a long list of transgressions he wanted to kill him with his bare hands instead he pretended to be cool detached harsh words would not help donte they left the conference room and walked into robbies office aaron and fred pryor stayed outside ready for whatever came next robbie directed keith and boyette to a small table in the corner and all three sat down would you like some coffee or something to drink he asked almost pleasantly he stared at boyette who stared back without flinching or blinking keith cleared his throat and said look robbie i hate to ask for favors but we havent eaten in a long time were starving robbie picked up the phone rang carlos and ordered a tray of deli sandwiches and water no sense beating around the bush mr boyette lets hear what you have to say the tic the pause boyette shifted and squirmed suddenly unable to make eye contact well the first thing i want to know is if theres any reward money on the table keith dropped his head and said oh my god youre not serious are you robbie asked i suppose everything is serious right now mr flak boyette said wouldnt you agree this is the first mention of reward money keith said completely exasperated i have needs boyette said i dont have a dime and no prospects of finding one just curious thats all thats all robbie repeated the execution is less than six hours away and our chances of stopping it are very slim texas is about to execute an innocent man and im sitting here with the real killer who suddenly wants to get paid for what hes done who says im the real killer you keith blurted you told me you killed her and you know where the body is buried because you buried it stop playing games travis if i recall correctly her father put up a bunch of dough when they were trying to find her something like that right mr flak that was nine years ago if you think youre in line for the reward money youre badly mistaken robbies words were measured but an explosion was imminent why do you want money keith asked according to your own words youll be dead in a few months the tumor remember thanks for reminding me pastor robbie glared at boyette with unrestrained hatred the truth was that robbie at that moment would sign over every asset he could find in exchange for a nice thick affidavit that told the truth and might save his client there was a long stretch of silence as the three contemplated what to do next boyette grimaced and then began rubbing his slick head he placed both palms on both temples and pressed as hard as possible as if pressure from the outside world would relieve the pressure from within are you having a seizure keith asked but there was no response he has these seizures keith said to robbie as if an explanation would help matters caffeine helps robbie jumped to his feet and left the room outside his office he told aaron and pryor the son of a bitch wants money he walked to the kitchen grabbed a pot of stale coffee found two paper cups and returned to his office he poured a cup for boyette who was bent double at the waist elbows on knees cradling his head and moaning heres some coffee silence finally boyette said im going to be sick i need to lie down take the sofa robbie said pointing to it across the room boyette struggled to his feet and with keiths help made it to the sofa where he wrapped his arms around his head and pulled his knees to his chest can you turn off the lights boyette said ill be okay in a minute we dont have time for this robbie said ready to scream please just a minute boyette said pathetically as his body vibrated and he gasped for air keith and robbie left the office and stepped into the conference room a crowd soon gathered and robbie introduced keith to the rest of the gang the food arrived and they ate quickly chapter they came for donte at noon not a minute before not a minute after everything precise and well rehearsed there was a knock on the metal door behind him three loud raps he was talking to cedric but when he knew it was time he asked for his mother roberta was standing behind cedric with andrea and marvin at her sides all four squeezed into the small room all four crying now with no effort to hold back the tears they had watched the clock for four hours and there was nothing left to say cedric exchanged places with roberta who took the phone and placed her palm on the plexiglas donte did the same from the other side his three siblings embraced behind his mother all four huddled together touching with andrea in the middle and on the verge of collapse i love you momma donte said and im so sorry this is happening i love you too baby and you dont have to say youre sorry you did nothing wrong donte wiped his cheeks with a sleeve i always wished i couldve gotten outta here before daddy died i wanted him to see me as a free man i wanted him to know that i did nothing wrong he knew that donte your daddy never doubted you when he died he knew you were innocent she wiped her face with a tissue ive never doubted you either baby i know i guess ill be seeing daddy pretty soon roberta nodded but could not respond the door behind him opened and a large male guard appeared donte hung up the phone stood and placed both palms flat on the plexiglas his family did the same one final embrace and then he was gone with his hands cuffed again donte was led from the visitors wing through a series of clicking metal doors out of the building over a lawn crisscrossed with sidewalks and into a wing where he was taken back to his cell for the last time everything now was for the last time and as donte sat on his bunk and stared at his box of assets he almost convinced himself that it would be a relief to get away his family was given a few minutes to collect themselves as ruth was leading them out of the room she gave them a hug she said she was sorry and they thanked her for her kindness just as they were walking through a metal door she said you folks headed to huntsville yes of course they were might want to get on over there rumor is there might be trouble on the roads they nodded but were not sure how to respond they walked through security at the front building got their drivers licenses and purses and walked out of polunsky for the last time the trouble on the roads mentioned by ruth was a clandestine facebook conspiracy inspired by two black students at sam houston state university in huntsville the code name was detour and the plan was so simple and so brilliant that it attracted dozens of volunteers in soon after donte arrived on death row the inmates were moved from huntsville to polunsky the inmates were moved the death chamber was not for seven years and two hundred executions it had been necessary to haul the condemned men from polunsky to huntsville elaborate movements were planned and used but after a few dozen transfers with no ambushes no heroic efforts to rescue the condemned without a hitch of any kind the authorities realized that no one was watching no one really cared the elaborate plans were discarded and the same route was used with every transfer they left the prison at pm turned left on turned left again on a fourlane road with plenty of traffic and an hour later the trip was over inmates were placed in the rear of an unmarked passenger van surrounded by enough muscle and weaponry to protect the president and escorted for good measure by an identical van filled with another squad of bored guards hoping for a little excitement the last execution had been on september when michael richard was injected ten students all members of operation detour used five vehicles and plenty of cell phones to track the movements of the two white vans from polunsky to huntsville the students were not detected no one suspected them no one was looking for them by early november their plan was complete and their operatives were itching for trouble at pm a guard a black one sympathetic to donte tipped off a member of detour the two white vans were being loaded the transfer had begun at pm the vans left the prison for a service road near the maximum security unit they turned onto route and headed for livingston there was little traffic two miles from the prison the traffic increased became heavy then stopped completely ahead of the vans a car had stalled in the right lane oddly one had stalled in the left lane and another on the shoulder the three cars blocked any passage their drivers were out checking under their hoods then behind the three cars there were three more all stalled in a neat line across the road the vans did not move and seemed to be in no hurry behind them in the right lane another car came to a stop its driver a young black woman popped the hood got out feigned exasperation because her nissan had quit on her a volkswagen beetle pulled beside her in the left lane suffered a mechanical failure on cue and the hood went up more vehicles materialized from nowhere and bunched together behind the first wave thoroughly blocking the road its shoulders and all exits and entrances to it within five minutes a traffic jam of at least twenty vehicles had occurred the white vans were surrounded by disabled cars and suvs all with their hoods up the drivers loitering about talking laughing chatting on cell phones several of the male students went from car to car disabling each by pulling the wires to the distributor caps the state and local police arrived in minutes dozens of marked cars with sirens screaming they were followed by a brigade of tow trucks all of which had been rounded up in livingston on short notice operation detour had briefed its volunteers well each driver was adamant that his or her car had quit and under texas law this was not a crime citations would certainly be written for blocking traffic but detour had found a lawyer who would fight those in court officers did not have the right to take keys and check the engines for themselves and if they tried the engines were dead the students had been told to resist searches of their vehicles to peacefully resist any attempts at being arrested to threaten legal action in the face of an arrest and if arrested consider it an honor a badge of courage in the fight against injustice detour had other lawyers who would handle their cases the students relished the thought of being locked up an act of defiance in their minds something they could talk about for years as the police cars and wreckers parked haphazardly near the traffic jam and as the first troopers were approaching the students the second phase of the plan fell beautifully into place another wave of students in cars turned onto route from livingston and were soon approaching the melee they parked three abreast and three deep behind the tow trucks all hoods popped open more roadside breakdowns since the tow truck drivers were expected to react with anger and maybe violence to being penned in the second wave of drivers remained in their cars with the windows up and doors locked most cars were full of students and many were healthy young men who could take care of themselves they wouldnt mind a fight they were angry to begin with a tow truck driver approached the first car parked behind him realized it was full of blacks and began swearing and making threats a state trooper yelled at him and told him to shut up the trooper was sergeant inman and he took charge of a truly unique situation one that included so far eight police cars seven tow trucks at least thirty disabled vehicles and two prison vans one of which was transporting a man to his death to make matters worse the locals who routinely used route were backing up unaware they had chosen the wrong time to get from one place to another the road was hopelessly clogged inman was a cool professional and he knew something the students didnt as he walked through the jam headed for the vans he nodded politely at the students smiled asked if they were having a nice day at the vans security details for donte unloaded thick men in blue swatstyle uniforms with automatic weapons most of the students made their way close to the vans one seemed to lead the pack inman approached him extended a hand and politely said im sergeant inman may i ask your name quincy mooney he reluctantly shook inmans hand mr mooney im sorry about your car breaking down dont mention it inman looked around smiled at the other students all these folks friends of yours ive never seen em before inman smiled look mr mooney we need to get these cars off the road traffic is backing up everything is blocked guess we need to call some mechanics no were just gonna tow em quincy unless of course yall would like to save a hundred bucks and drive away if you chose to do so then we wouldnt be forced to write a bunch of tickets thats another hundred bucks a car so its against the law for your car to break down no sir its not but you and i both know why youre here the judge will know too i know why im here why are you here im doing my job quincy traffic control and keeping the peace inman nodded his head and said come with me quincy followed him to the first van its double side doors were open inman looked inside then invited quincy to do the same the van was empty they walked to the second van both looked inside it too was empty the security guards were snickering the whirling thumpthump of a helicopter could be heard wheres donte drumm quincy asked stunned he aint here is he inman asked with a smirk quincy stared at the darkened windows of the empty van they walked back to the front of the first one inman looked to the sky in the direction of polunsky everyone waited and waited and seconds later a helicopter roared directly over them inman pointed at it and said there goes donte quincys jaw dropped his shoulders slumped word spread through the students and there were looks of shock and disbelief a perfect operation had been compromised donte drumm would arrive at the death chamber ahead of schedule too much internet chatter inman said heres the deal quincy you guys have fifteen minutes to clear this road and get outta here in fifteen minutes we start writing tickets and towing and just so you know there wont be any arrests so dont provoke us got it quincy walked away thoroughly defeated boyette after a sandwich and three cups of coffee was feeling better he was at the table lights on shades opened robbie and keith were staring at him and no one was smiling evidently the issue of money had been put aside by boyette at least for the moment so if i tell you what happened with nicole what happens to me he asked looking at robbie nothing at least nothing for a long time the cops and prosecutors have their man if hes killed tonight then theyll never consider pursuing someone else if donte gets a stay im not sure what theyll do but itll be a long time before they admit that anybody but donte killed nicole they have far too much invested in their wrongful conviction so i wont be arrested today or tomorrow or the next day i cant speak for these clowns mr boyette i dont know what theyll do as a general rule the cops here are stupid and detective kerber is a moron but to arrest you is to admit they were wrong about donte and thats not going to happen if you walked into the police station right now swore on a bible and gave them every detail of the abduction rape and murder they would dismiss you outright as a lunatic theyll have no desire to believe you mr boyette your admission destroys them the tic the pause robbie leaned forward and glared at him times up mr boyette i want to hear it tell me the truth did you kill the girl yes just like ive told keith here i grabbed her raped her for two days then choked her and hid the body where is the body finding the body will stop the execution i guarantee it where is it in the hills south of joplin missouri deep in the hills joplin missouri is at least five hours from here more than that nicole and i drove there so she was alive when you left texas the tic the pause finally yes i killed her in missouri raped her from here to there is it possible to call the authorities in joplin and tell them how to find the body boyette managed to laugh at such foolishness you think im stupid why would i bury her where someone could find her im not even sure i can find her after all these years robbie anticipated this and didnt miss a beat then we need to take your statement by video and quickly okay im ready they walked to the conference room where carlos was waiting with a camera and a court reporter boyette was directed to a chair facing the camera the court reporter sat to his right robbie to his left carlos worked the camera the other members of the firm suddenly materializedrobbie wanted them as witnessesand they stood with keith ten feet away boyette looked at them and was suddenly nervous he felt like a man facing his own wellattended execution the court reporter asked him to raise his right hand and swear to tell the truth he did and then robbie began the questioning name place of birth address employment current status as a parolee and criminal record he asked if boyette was giving his statement voluntarily nothing had been promised was he living in slone in december why how long robbies questions were gentle but efficient boyette looked squarely at the camera no flinching or blinking and seemed to warm to the task oddly the tic went away tell us about nicole boyette thought for a second and then launched into his narrative the football games the fascination with nicole the obsession the stalking and finally the abduction outside the mall not a single witness anywhere on the floor of his truck he put a gun to her head and threatened to kill her if she made a sound then he bound her wrists and ankles with duct tape he taped her mouth he drove somewhere into the country he was not sure where and after he raped her the first time he almost dumped her in a ditch injured but not dead but wanted to rape her again they left slone the cell phone in her handbag kept ringing and ringing so he finally stopped at a bridge over the red river he took her cash credit card and drivers license then threw the handbag off the bridge they drifted through southeastern oklahoma just before sunrise near fort smith he saw a cheap motel hed stayed in before alone he paid cash for a room and with a gun to her head got her inside without being seen he taped her wrists ankles and mouth again and told her to go to sleep he slept a few hours not sure if she did they spent a long day at the motel he convinced her that if she would cooperate give him what he wanted then he would release her but he already knew the truth after dark they moved on headed north at daybreak on sunday they were south of joplin in a heavily wooded remote area she begged him but he killed her anyway it wasnt easy she fought hard scratched him drew blood he stuffed her body in a large toolbox and buried it no one would ever find her he drove back to slone and got drunk robbie was taking notes the court reporter pressed the keys of her stenotype machine no one else moved no one seemed to breathe boyette went silent his story complete his detached narration and his command of details were chilling martha handler would later write watching boyettes eyes and face as he talked about his crimes left no doubt that we were in the presence of a ruthless killer the story that we will never know and perhaps prefer not to know is the suffering this poor girl endured throughout the ordeal robbie calm but also anxious to finish the testimony pressed on approximately what time on sunday did you kill her the sun was barely up i waited until i could see things see where i was and find the best place to hide her and this was sunday december if you say so yes so sunrise would be around am that sounds about right and you returned to slone and went where i went to my room at the rebel motor inn after id bought a case of beer with the cash i took from nicole you got drunk at the rebel motor inn yes how long did you live in slone after the murder i dont know maybe a month and a half i was arrested here in january you got the records after i got outta jail i took off after you killed her when did you hear that donte drumm had been arrested dont know exactly i saw it on television i saw you yelling at the cameras what did you think when he was arrested boyette shook his head and said i thought what a bunch of idiots that kid had nothing to do with it they got the wrong guy it was a perfect place to end robbie said thats all carlos reached for the camera robbie asked the court reporter how long before we have a transcript ten minutes good hurry robbie huddled with the rest of his firm at the conference table and everyone talked at once boyette was forgotten for a moment though fred pryor kept an eye on him boyette asked for water and pryor handed him a bottle keith stepped outside to call dana and matthew burns and to get some fresh air but the air wasnt refreshing it was heavy with smoke and tension there was a loud thud followed by a shriek as boyette fell out of his chair and hit the floor he grabbed his head pulled his knees to his chest and began shaking as the seizure consumed him fred pryor and aaron rey knelt over him uncertain what to do robbie and the others crowded around staring in horror at a fit so violent that the ancient wooden floor seemed to shake they actually felt sorry for the man keith heard the commotion and joined the crowd he needs a doctor sammie thomas said he has meds doesnt he keith robbie asked in a hushed tone yes have you seen this before boyette was still thrashing about groaning pitifully surely the man was dying fred pryor was patting him softly on the arm yes keith said about four hours ago somewhere in oklahoma he vomited forever and then passed out should we take him to the hospital i mean look keith could he be dying right now i dont know im not a doctor what else do you need from him we must have his signature on his affidavit signed under oath robbie stepped back and motioned for keith to join him they spoke softly robbie continued and then theres the matter of finding the body even with his affidavit theres no guarantee the court will stop the execution the governor will not either way we have to find the body and soon keith said lets put him on the sofa in your office turn off the lights ill give him a pill maybe hes not dying good idea it was pm chapter dontes first helicopter ride was intended to be his last courtesy of the texas department of public safety he was moving through the air at ninety miles per hour three thousand feet above the rolling hills and he could see nothing below he was wedged between two guards thick young men scowling out the windows as if operation detour might have a surfacetoair missile or two in its arsenal up front were the two pilots grimfaced boys thrilled with the excitement of their mission the rocky noisy ride made donte nauseous so he closed his eyes leaned his head back against hard plastic and tried to think of something pleasant he could not he practiced his last statement mouthing the words though with the racket in the helicopter he could have barked them out and no one would have noticed he thought of other inmatessome friends some enemies almost all guilty but a few who claimed innocenceand how they faced their deaths the ride lasted twenty minutes and when the helicopter landed at the old rodeo grounds inside huntsville prison a small army awaited the prisoner donte laden with chains and shackles was practically carried by his guards to a van minutes later the van pulled into an alley lined with chainlink fencing covered by a thick windscreen and topped with glistening razor wire donte was escorted from the van through a gate along a short sidewalk to a small flat redbrick building where texas does its killing inside he squinted and tried to focus on his new surroundings there were eight cells to his right each emptying onto a short hallway on a table there were several bibles including one in spanish a dozen guards milled about some chatting about the weather as if the weather were important at that moment donte was positioned in front of a camera and photographed the handcuffs were removed and a technician informed him they would now fingerprint him why donte asked routine came the response he took a finger and rolled it on the ink pad i dont understand why you need to fingerprint a man before you kill him the technician did not respond i get it donte said you wanna make sure you got the right man right the technician rolled another finger well you got the wrong man this time i can assure you of that when the fingerprinting was over he was led to the holding cell one of the eight the other seven were not used donte sat on the edge of the bunk he noticed how shiny the floors were how clean the sheets were how pleasant the temperature on the other side of the bars in the hallway were several prison officials one stepped to the bars and said donte im ben jeter the warden here at huntsville donte nodded but did not stand he stared at the floor our chaplain is tommy powell hes here and hell stay here all afternoon without looking up donte said dont need a chaplain its your call now listen to me because i want to tell you how things happen around here i think i know what happens well ill tell you anyway after a round of speeches each more strident than the one before the rally lost some steam a large mob of blacks packed around the front of the courthouse and even spilled onto main street which had been closed when no one else took up the bullhorn the drum corps came to life and the crowd followed the music down main street heading west chanting waving banners singing we shall overcome trey glover assumed his role as parade master and maneuvered his suv in front of the drummers the rap blasted the downtown shops and cafes where the owners clerks and customers stood in the windows and doors why were the blacks so upset the boy confessed he killed nicole he said he did it an eye for an eye there was no trouble but the town seemed ready to erupt when trey and the drummers came to sisk avenue they turned right not left a left turn would have routed the march to the south the general direction of where it started a turn to the right meant they were headed into the white section still no one had thrown anything no threats had been made a few police cars followed well behind while others shadowed the march from parallel streets two blocks north of main and they were in the older residential section the noise brought people to their porches and what they saw sent them back inside to their gun cabinets they also went to their phones to call the mayor and the police chief surely this was disturbing the peace what are these folks so upset about the boy confessed do something civitan park was a complex of youth baseball and softball fields on sisk five blocks north of main and trey glover decided they had walked far enough the drums were put aside and the march came to an end it was now a gathering a volatile mix of youth anger and a sense of having nothing better to do for the afternoon and evening a police captain estimated the crowd at twelve hundred almost all under the age of thirty most of the older blacks had fallen aside and returned home cell phones confirmed details and cars full of more young blacks headed for civitan park across town another crowd of angry blacks watched as the fire crews saved what was left of the mount sinai church of god in christ because of the quick call and the quick response the damage was not as extensive as that inflicted on the first baptist church but the sanctuary was fairly gutted the flames had been extinguished but the smoke still poured from the windows with no wind it too lingered over the town and added another layer of tension reevas departure for huntsville was properly recorded she invited some family and friends over for another gutwrenching performance and everybody had a good cry for the cameras sean fordyce was on a jet at that moment zipping in from florida and they would hook up in huntsville for the preexecution interview with wallis her other two children and brother ronnie there were five in her party and for a threehour drive that might be uncomfortable so reeva had prevailed upon her pastor to borrow one of the church vans and even suggested that he do the driving brother ronnie was exhausted and emotionally spent as well but he was in no position to argue with reeva not at that moment not on the most important day of her life they loaded up and pulled away brother ronnie behind the wheel of a tenpassenger van with first baptist church of slone texas painted boldly on both sides everyone waved at the friends and wellwishers everyone waved at the camera reeva was crying before they reached the outskirts of town after fifteen minutes in the quiet darkness of robbies office boyette rallied he stayed on the sofa his mind numb from pain his feet and hands still wobbly when keith peeked through the door boyette said im here pastor still alive keith walked closer and asked how you doing travis much better pastor can i get something for you some coffee it seems to help ease the pain keith left and closed the door he found robbie and reported that boyette was still alive at the moment the court reporter was transcribing boyettes statement sammie thomas and both paralegals carlos and bonnie were frantically putting together a filing that was already known as the boyette petition judge elias henry walked into the office past the receptionist and into the conference room over here robbie said and led the judge into a small library he closed the door picked up a remote and said you gotta see this what is it judge henry asked as he fell into a chair just wait he pointed the remote at a screen on a wall and boyette appeared this is the man who killed nicole yarber we just taped this the video ran for fourteen minutes they watched it without a word where is he judge henry asked when the screen went dark in my office on the sofa he has a malignant brain tumor or so he says and hes dying he walked into the office of a lutheran minister in topeka kansas monday morning and spilled his guts he played some games but the minister finally got him in a car they arrived in slone a couple of hours ago the minister drove him here yep hang on robbie opened the door and called keith over he introduced him to judge henry this is the man robbie said patting keith on the back have a seat judge henry is our circuit court judge if he had presided over the trial of donte drumm we wouldnt be here right now a pleasure to meet you keith said sounds like youre having quite an adventure keith laughed and said i dont know where i am or what im doing then youve come to the right law firm judge henry said they shared a laugh a quick one and then all humor vanished what do you think robbie asked judge henry the judge scratched his cheek thought hard for a moment and then said the question is what will the court of appeals think you can never tell they hate these lastminute surprise witnesses who pop up and begin changing facts that are ten years old plus a man whos made a career out of aggravated rape is not likely to be taken seriously id give you a slight chance of getting a stay thats a lot more than we had two hours ago robbie said when do you file its almost two oclock within the hour heres my question do we tell the press about mr boyette im sending the video to the court and to the governor i can also give it to the local tv station or i can send it to every station in texas or better yet i can arrange a press conference here or at the courthouse and let the world listen as boyette tells his story to what benefit maybe i want the world to know that texas is about to execute the wrong man heres the killer listen to him but the world cannot stop the execution only the courts or the governor can do that id be careful here robbie theres smoke in the air now and if people see boyette on television claiming responsibility this place could blow up its blowing up anyway you want a race war if they kill donte yes i wouldnt mind a race war a small one come on robbie youre playing with dynamite here think strategically not emotionally and keep in mind that this guy could be lying this would not be the first execution where a fraud claimed responsibility the press cant resist it the nut gets on television everybody looks stupid robbie was pacing four steps one way four steps the other he was fidgety frantic but still thinking clearly he had great admiration for judge henry and robbie was smart enough to know he needed advice at that moment the room was quiet on the other side of the door the voices were tense the phones were ringing judge henry said i assume its not possible to search for the body robbie shook his head and deferred to keith who said not now two days ago tuesday i think it was im not surei feel as though ive lived with this guy for a yearbut anyway tuesday i suggested the best way to stop the execution was to find the body he said that it would be difficult he buried her nine years ago in a secluded area that is heavily wooded he also said that hes gone back to visit her several timesim not sure what that meant and i really didnt want to pursue it then i lost contact with him i searched and searched and i was determined to somehow corral him and insist that we notify the authorities here and in missouri if that is in fact where nicole is buried but he would not agree then we lost contact again hes a strange guy very strange he called me around midnight last night i was already in bed sound asleep and he said he wanted to come here to tell his story to stop the execution i felt as though i had no choice ive never done anything like this before i can promise you that i know its wrong to help a convict violate his parole but so be it anyway we left topeka around this morning and again i suggested that we notify the authorities and at least begin the search for the body he wanted no part of that it would not have worked keith robbie said the authorities here are useless they would laugh at you they have their man the case is solved almost closed i guess nobody in missouri would lift a finger because there is no active investigation you cant just call a sheriff and suggest that he and his boys go out in the woods and start digging somewhere down by the creek it doesnt work that way then who looks for the body keith asked i guess we do im going home robbie my wife is barking at me my lawyer friend thinks im crazy i think im crazy ive done my best boyettes all yours im sick of the guy relax keith i need you right now for what just hang around okay boyette trusts you besides when was the last time you had frontrow seats at a race riot not funny sit on the video robbie judge henry said show it to the court and to the governor but dont make it public i can control the video but i cannot control mr boyette if he wants to talk to the press i cant stop him god knows hes not my client by thursday afternoon every church in slone black and white was being guarded by preachers deacons and sunday school teachers all men all heavily armed and visible they sat on the front steps and chatted anxiously shotguns across their knees they sat under shade trees near the streets waving at the passing cars many of which honked in solidarity they patrolled the rear doors and back property smoking chewing watching for any movement there would be no more church burnings in slone the cotton gin had been abandoned two decades earlier when a newer one replaced it east of town it was an eyesore a badly decaying old building and under normal circumstances a good fire would have been welcomed the call was recorded at a teenager driving by saw heavy smoke and called on her cell phone the beleaguered firemen rushed to the old gin and by the time they arrived the flames were roaring through the roof since it was an empty abandoned building and not a great loss anyway they took their time the black smoke boiled into the sky the mayor could see it from his secondstory office near the courthouse and after consulting with the chief of police he called the governors office the situation in slone was not likely to improve the citizens were in danger they needed the national guard chapter the petition was finished just before pm and with boyettes affidavit included it ran for thirty pages boyette swore in writing that he was telling the truth and sammie thomas emailed the petition to the defender groups office in austin the staff there was waiting it was printed copied twelve times and handed off to cicely avis who sprinted from the office hopped in her car and raced across town to the offices of the texas court of criminal appeals the petition was filed at whats this the clerk asked holding a disc its a video of a confession by the real murderer cicely replied interesting i assume you want the judges to see this fairly soon right now please ill get it done they chatted for a second and cicely left the office the clerk immediately delivered the petition to the offices of the nine judges in the chief justices office he spoke to the law clerk and said you might want to watch the video first some guy just confessed to the murder and where is this guy asked the clerk hes in donte drumms lawyers office in slone according to the defender group lawyer so robbie flaks found him a new witness looks like it as cicely avis left the tcca offices she detoured two blocks and drove past the state capitol the rally for donte was drawing a nice crowd on the south lawn police were everywhere a permit had been issued and the first amendment appeared to be working the crowd almost all black was streaming in the permit was valid for three hours from pm to pm the moment of execution but it was obvious things were behind schedulein austin but certainly not in huntsville the governor was in a meeting an important one one that had nothing to do with donte drumm at the video was received by an assistant who handled the requests for reprieves and she watched all fourteen minutes of it before she could decide what to do next while she found boyette somewhat believable and chilling she was skeptical because of his background and the timing of his sudden desire to come clean she went to find wayne wallcott the governors lawyer and close friend and described the video wallcott listened closely then shut the door of his office and told her to sit down who has seen this video he asked only me the assistant answered it was emailed from mr flaks office with a pass code i watched it immediately and here i am and its a full confession oh yes with lots of details and you believe this guy i didnt say that i said he seems to know what hes talking about hes a serial rapist and he was in slone when the girl disappeared its a full confession does he mention drumm why dont you just watch the video i didnt ask for any suggestions did i wallcott snapped just answer my questions sorry the assistant took a breath she was suddenly nervous and uneasy wallcott was listening but he was also scheming he mentioned drumm only to say that hes never met him and he had nothing to do with the crime hes obviously lying im not bothering the governor with this and i want you to keep the video to yourself i dont have the time to look at it neither does the governor you understand she did not but she nodded anyway wallcott narrowed his eyes and frowned you do understand dont you he asked gravely this video stays in your computer yes sir as soon as she left wallcott practically jogged to the office of barry ringfield the governors chief spokesman and closest friend the office suite was crawling with staff and interns so they took a stroll down the hall after a few minutes of discussing their options they agreed that the governor would not see the video if boyette was lying then the video would be irrelevant and the right man was executed but if boyette was telling the truth which they strongly doubted and the wrong man was executed the fallout could be messy the only way to protect governor gill newton was for one of them or perhaps the assistant to take the fall by admitting they sat on or maybe even lost the video gill newton had never granted a reprieve in a death case and with the thrilling attention being stirred up by the drumm case he was not about to back down now even if he watched the video and even if he believed boyette he would not retreat wayne and barry walked to the governors office they were expected there promptly at pm two hours before the execution and they would not tell the governor about the video at pm the flak law firm gathered once again around the main conference table all were present and accounted for including keith who though fighting the worst fatigue of his life was finding it hard to believe he had somehow acquired a ticket to this circus he and judge henry sat away from the table against a wall aaron rey and fred pryor read newspapers on the other side of the room travis boyette was still alive still resting in the dark on robbies sofa it was past time for robbie to leave for huntsville and the strain was showing but he couldnt leave yet the boyette petition had energized the team and given them hope robbie worked from a checklist yellow legal pad as always sammie thomas and bonnie would track the boyette petition before the court of appeals and also continue to press the governors office on the reprieve gill newton had yet to grant or deny and he usually waited until the last moment he loved the drama and attention carlos would track the insanity petition which was still with the fifth circuit in new orleans if denied there they would appeal to the us supreme court fred pryor would remain at the office and tend to boyette no one knew what to do with boyette but he didnt appear to be leaving as always aaron rey would accompany robbie to huntsville martha handler would also go to observe and record robbie barked orders answered questions refereed conflicts and then suddenly looked at the reverend and asked keith can you go with us to huntsville for a few seconds the reverend couldnt speak why robbie he managed to ask donte might need you keiths mouth fell open and no words came out the room was quiet all eyes on keith robbie pressed on he was raised in a church keith but he now takes a dim view of religion his jury had five baptists two pentecostals one church of christ and i guess the others were lost over the past few years hes come to believe that white christians are the reason hes on death row he wants no part of their god and i dont expect him to change his views anytime soon still at the very end he might appreciate someone to pray with what keith wanted was a nice bed in a clean motel and twelve hours of sleep but as a man of god he couldnt say no he nodded slowly and said sure good well leave in five minutes keith closed his eyes and rubbed his temples and said to himself lord what am i doing here help me fred pryor suddenly jumped from his chair he held his cell phone at arms length as if it were whitehot and said loudly oh boy its joey gamble he wants to sign the affidavit and recant his testimony is he on the phone robbie said no its a text message should i call him of course robbie snapped pryor stepped to the center of the table and pressed the keys on the speakerphone no one moved as the phone rang and rang finally a timid hello joey fred pryor here in slone just got your message what the hells going on uh i wanna help mr pryor im really upset by all this you think youre upset what about donte hes got two and a half hours to live and now you finally wake up and want to help im so confused joey said robbie leaned forward and took charge joey this is robbie flak remember of course where are you mission bend in my apartment are you willing to sign an affidavit admitting that you lied at dontes trial with no hesitation joey said yes robbie closed his eyes and dropped his head around the table there were silent fist pumps quick prayers of thanks and a lot of tired smiles all right heres the plan theres a lawyer in houston by the name of agnes tanner her office is downtown on clay street do you know the city i guess can you find an office downtown i dont know im not sure i should drive are you drunk not drunk but ive been drinking robbie instinctively glanced at his watch not yet pm and the boy was already thick tongued joey call a cab ill reimburse you later its crucial that you get to tanners office as quickly as possible well email an affidavit you sign it and well get it filed in austin can you do this joey ill try its the least you can do joey right now donte is in the holding cell in huntsville thirty feet from the little room where they kill people and your lies helped put him there im so sorry his voice cracked the office is at clay street you got that joey i think so get there joey the paperwork will be waiting for you every minute is crucial joey do you understand okay okay call us back in ten minutes you got it after the call ended robbie barked orders and everyone scrambled as he headed for the door he said lets go keith they jumped in the van with martha handler racing to keep up with them and aaron rey sped away robbie called agnes tanner in houston and urgently confirmed the details keith leaned forward and looked at aaron in the rearview mirror someone said its a threehour drive to huntsville it is aaron replied but were not driving the slone municipal airport was two miles east of town it had one runway west to east four small hangars the usual collection of old cessnas in a row on the deck and a square metal building for the terminal they parked ran through the tiny lobby area nodded at a deckhand behind the desk and stepped onto the tarmac where a shiny twinengine king air was waiting it was owned by a wealthy lawyer friend of robbies who was an avid pilot he got them on board locked the door made them fasten their seat belts then strapped himself in and began flipping switches keith had not talked to his wife in several hours and things were happening so fast he wasnt sure where to begin dana answered during the first beep as if shed been staring at her cell phone the engines started and the cabin was suddenly loud and shaking where are you she asked in an airplane leaving slone flying to huntsville to meet donte drumm i can barely hear you whose airplane a friend of robbie flaks look dana i cant hear you either ill call you when we land in huntsville please be careful keith love you keith was facing the front of the plane his knees almost touching martha handlers he watched the pilot run through the checklist as they taxied away to the runway robbie martha and aaron were all on the phone and keith wondered how they could carry on a conversation amid the racket at the end of the runway the king air did a and pointed west the pilot revved the engines the plane shook harder and harder as if it might explode then the pilot yelled hold on and released the brakes they jerked forward and all four passengers closed their eyes within seconds they were in the air the landing gear folded with a thud but keith had no idea what he was hearing in the blur of the moment he realized that he had never before flown in a small airplane nor had he ever been to texas chauffeured a serial rapist and murderer listened to his chilling confession witnessed the chaos of a law firm trying to save an innocent man gone four days with virtually no sleep picked up a speeding ticket in oklahoma or said yes to an invitation to pray with a man minutes before his death they flew over slone at two thousand feet and climbing the old cotton gin was still burning thick smoke boiling into a cloud keith closed his eyes again and tried to convince himself that he was where he was and doing what he was doing he was not convinced he prayed and asked god to take his hand and guide him now because he had no idea what to do he thanked god for this rather unusual situation and acknowledged that only divine intervention could be responsible for it at five thousand feet his chin hit his chest the fatigue finally taking its toll the bourbon was usually knob creek but on special occasions the really fine stuff was pulled out of the drawer a shot each of pappy van winkles and all three smacked their lips they were starting a bit early but the governor said he needed a stiff one barry and wayne had never said no they had their coats off sleeves rolled up ties loosened busy men with a lot on their minds they stood near a credenza in a corner sipping watching the rally on a small television if they had opened a window they could have heard the noise one longwinded speaker after another delivered scathing attacks on the death penalty racism and the texas judicial system the term judicial lynching was used freely so far every speaker had demanded that the governor stop the execution capitol security estimated the crowd at ten thousand behind the governors back barry and wayne exchanged nervous glances if the crowd could see the video a riot would break out should they tell him no maybe later gill we need to make a decision about the national guard barry said whats happening in slone as of thirty minutes ago theyve burned two churches one white and one black now an abandoned building is on fire they canceled classes this morning at the high school after fights broke out the blacks are marching and roaming the streets looking for trouble one brick was thrown through the rear window of a police car but so far theres been no other violence the mayor is scared and thinks the town could blow up after the execution whos available the unit in tyler is getting ready and can be deployed within an hour six hundred guardsmen that should be enough do it and issue a press release barry darted from the office wayne took another sip and with hesitation said gill should we at least have the conversation about a thirtyday stay let things cool off a bit hell no we cant back down just because the blacks are upset if we show weakness now then theyll get louder next time if we wait thirty days then theyll just start this crap again im not blinking you know me better than that okay okay just wanted to mention it dont mention it again you got it here he is the governor said and took a step closer to the television the crowd roared as the reverend jeremiah mays took the podium mays was currently the loudest black radical roaming the country and was quite adept at somehow wedging himself into every conflict or episode where race was an issue he raised his hands called for quiet and launched into a flowery prayer in which he beseeched the almighty to look down upon the poor misguided souls running the state of texas to open their eyes to grant them wisdom to touch their hearts so that this grave injustice could be stopped he asked for the hand of god for a miracle for the rescue of their brother donte drumm when barry returned he refilled the shot glasses his hands visibly shaking the governor said enough of this nonsense and hit the mute button gentlemen he said i want to watch it one more time they had watched it together several times and with each viewing all lingering doubts were erased they walked to the other side of the office to another television and barry picked up the remote donte drumm december he was facing the camera a can of coke and an uneaten doughnut on the table in front of him no one else could be seen he was subdued tired and frightened he spoke slowly in a monotone his eyes never looking directly into the camera off camera detective drew kerber said youve been read your miranda rights correct yes and youre giving this statement of your own free will no threats no promises of any kind right thats right okay tell us what happened on friday night december nineteen days ago donte leaned forward on his elbows and looked as though he might pass out he picked a spot on the table stared at it spoke to it well me and nicole had been sneaking around having sex having a good time how long had this been going on three or four months i liked her she liked me things were getting serious and she got scared because she was afraid people would find out we started to fight some she wanted to break it off i didnt want to i think i was in love with her then she wouldnt see me anymore and this drove me crazy all i could think about was her she was so fine i wanted her more than anything in the world i was obsessed i was crazy couldnt stand to think that somebody else might have her so that friday night i went looking for her i knew where she liked to hang out i saw her car at the mall over on the east side of the mall excuse me donte but i believe you said earlier that her car was parked on the west side of the mall thats right the west side so i waited and waited and you were driving a green ford van owned by your parents thats right and i guess it was around ten oclock friday night and kerber said excuse me donte but you said earlier that it was closer to eleven thats right eleven go ahead you were in the green van looking for nicole and you saw her car thats right i was really wanting to see her and so we were driving around looking for her car and excuse me donte but you said we were driving around you said earlier yeah me and torrey pickett were but you said earlier that you were alone that you had dropped torrey off at his mothers house thats right sorry about that at his mothers house right and so i was by myself at the mall and i saw her car and i parked and waited when she came out she was alone we talked for a minute and she agreed to get in the van we used the van a few times on dates when we were sneaking around and so i drove and we talked we both got upset she was determined to break up and i was determined to stay together we talked about running away together to get out of texas go to california where nobody would bother us you know but she wouldnt listen to me she started crying and that made me start crying we parked behind shiloh church out on travis road one of our places and i said i wanted to have sex one last time at first she seemed okay with it and we started making out then she pulled away said stop it said no said she wanted to get back because her friends would be looking for her but i couldnt stop she started pushing me away and i got mad real mad just all of a sudden i hated her because she was pushing me away because i couldnt have her if i was white then i could have her but because im not then im not good enough you know we started fighting and at some point she realized that i was not going to stop she didnt resist but she didnt give in either when it was over she got mad real mad she slapped me and said id raped her and then something just happened i snapped or something i dont know but i just went crazy she was still under me and i uh well i hit her and i hit her again and i couldnt believe i was hitting that beautiful face but if i couldnt have her then nobody else could either i just went into a rage like some kinda wild man and before i realized what i was doing my hands were around her neck i just shook her and shook her and then she was still everything was very still when i came to my senses i just looked at her and at some point i realized she wasnt breathing donte took the first sip and only sip from the coke can i started driving around i had no idea where to go i kept waiting for her to wake up but she didnt id call back there but she wouldnt answer i guess i panicked i didnt know what time it was i drove north and when i realized the sun was coming up i panicked again i saw a sign for the red river i was on route and excuse me donte but you said earlier it was route thats right i drove onto the bridge it was still dark no other car lights anywhere not a sound and i got her out of the back of the van and tossed her into the river when i heard her splash it made me sick i remember crying all the way back home the governor stepped forward and punched the off button boys thats all i need to see lets go all three straightened their ties buttoned their cuffs put on their jackets and walked out of the office in the hallway they were met with a security detail one beefed up for the occasion they took the stairs down to the street level and walked quickly to the capitol they waited unseen by the crowd until the reverend jeremiah mays finished his incendiary remarks the crowd roared when he signed off vowing revenge when their governor suddenly appeared at the podium the mood changed remarkably for a moment those present were confused but when they heard the words im gill newton governor of the great state of texas they drowned him out in an avalanche of boos he yelled back thank you for coming here and expressing your first amendment right to assemble god bless america even louder boos our country is great because we love democracy the greatest system in the world loud boos for democracy youve assembled here today because you believe donte drumm is innocent well im here to tell you he is not he was convicted in a fair trial he had a good lawyer he confessed to the crime the boos and whistles and angry shouts were now continuous and newton was forced to yell into the microphone his case has been reviewed by dozens of judges sitting on five different courts state and federal and every ruling against him has been unanimous when the roar became too loud to continue newton stood and smirked at the crowd a man with power facing those with none he nodded acknowledging their hatred of him when the noise subsided slightly he leaned closer to the microphone and with as much drama as he could muster and knowing full well that what he was about to say would play on every evening and late newscast in texas said i refuse to grant a reprieve to donte drumm he is a monster he is a guilty man the crowd roared again and pressed forward the governor waved and saluted for the cameras and stepped away he was swarmed by his security team and whisked away to safety barry and wayne followed neither able to suppress a smile their man had just pulled off another beautiful stunt one that would no doubt win every election from then on chapter the last meal the last walk the last statement donte had never understood the significance of these final details why the fascination with what a man consumed just before he died it wasnt as though the food gave comfort or strengthened the body or postponed the inevitable the food along with the organs would soon be flushed out and incinerated what good did it do after feeding a man gruel for decades why pamper him with something he might enjoy just before you kill him he could vaguely recall the early days on death row and his horror of what he was supposed to eat hed been raised by a woman who appreciated and enjoyed the kitchen and though roberta relied too heavily on grease and flour she also grew her own vegetables and was careful with processed ingredients she loved to use herbs spices and peppers and her chickens and meats were highly seasoned the first meat donte was served on death row was allegedly a slice of pork and completely devoid of taste he lost his appetite the first week and never regained it now at the end he was expected to order a feast and be thankful for this one last favor as silly as it was virtually all condemned men gave thought to the final meal they had so little else to think about donte had decided days earlier that he wanted to be served nothing that even remotely resembled dishes his mother once prepared so he ordered a pepperoni pizza and a glass of root beer it arrived at pm rolled into the holding cell on a small tray by two guards donte said nothing as they left hed been napping off and on throughout the afternoon waiting on his pizza waiting on his lawyer waiting on a miracle though by pm hed given up in the hallway just beyond the bars his audience watched without a word a guard a prison official and the chaplain whod tried twice to talk to him twice donte had rejected the offers of spiritual counseling he wasnt sure why they watched him so closely but presumed it was to prevent a suicide how he might go about killing himself wasnt clear not in this holding cell if donte could have committed suicide he would have done so months earlier and now he wished he had he would already be gone and his mother could not watch him die for a palate neutralized by tasteless white bread bland applesauce and an endless stream of mystery meats the pizza was surprisingly delicious he ate it slowly ben jeter stepped to the bars and asked hows the pizza donte donte did not look at the warden its fine he said softly need anything he shook his head no i need a lot of things pal not a damned one of which you can provide and if you could you wouldnt just leave me alone i think your lawyers on the way donte nodded and picked up another slice at the fifth circuit court of appeals in new orleans denied relief under dontes claim of mental illness the flak law firm immediately filed in the us supreme court a petition for a writ of certiorari or cert as its known a request that the court hear the appeal and consider the merits of the petition if cert was granted the execution would be stopped and time would pass while the dust settled and briefs were filed if cert was denied the claim would be dead and so would the claimant in all likelihood there was no other place to appeal at the supreme court building in washington the death clerk received the cert petition electronically and distributed it to the offices of the nine justices there was no word on the boyette petition pending before the texas court of criminal appeals when the king air landed in huntsville robbie called the office and was informed of the adverse ruling in the fifth circuit joey gamble had not yet found his way to the law office of agnes tanner in houston the governor had denied a reprieve in spectacular fashion there were currently no new fires in slone but the national guard was on the way a depressing phone call but then robbie had expected little else he aaron martha and keith jumped into a minivan driven by an investigator robbie had used before and they raced off the prison was fifteen minutes away keith called dana and tried to explain what was happening in his life but the explanation got complicated and others were listening she was beyond bewildered and certain that he was doing something stupid he promised to call back in a few moments aaron called the office and talked to fred pryor boyette was up and moving about but slowly he was complaining because he had not talked to any reporters he expected to tell his side of the story to everyone and it seemed as if no one wanted to hear him robbie was frantically trying to reach joey gamble with no luck martha handler took her usual pages of notes at chief justice milton prudlowe convened the texas court of criminal appeals by teleconference to consider the boyette petition in the case of donte drumm the court had not been impressed with boyette the general feeling was that he was a publicity seeker with serious credibility issues after a brief discussion he called the roll the vote was unanimous not a single judge voted to grant relief to donte drumm the clerk of the court emailed the decision to the attorney generals office the lawyers fighting dontes appeals to wayne wallcott the governors lawyer and to the law office of robbie flak the van was almost at the prison when robbie got the call from carlos though hed been reminding himself throughout the afternoon that relief was unlikely he still took it hard sons of bitches he snapped didnt believe boyette denied denied denied all nine of them sons of bitches what happens next keith asked we run to the us supreme court let em see boyette pray for a miracle were running out of options did they give a reason martha asked nope they dont have to the problem is that we want desperately to believe boyette and they the chosen nine have no interest in believing him believing boyette would upset the system excuse me i gotta call agnes tanner gambles probably in a strip club getting plastered while a lap dancer works him over there were no strippers no stops or detours just a couple of wrong turns joey walked into the law office of agnes tanner at and she was waiting at the door ms tanner was a hardnosed divorce lawyer who when bored occasionally volunteered for a capital murder defense she knew robbie well though they had not spoken in over a year she was holding the affidavit and after a tense nice to meet you led joey to a small meeting room she wanted to ask him where he had been why it took so long whether he was drunk if he realized they were out of time and why he lied nine years ago and had sat on his fat ass ever since she wanted to grill him for an hour but there was no time plus he was moody and unpredictable according to robbie you can read this or ill tell you what it says she said waving the affidavit joey sat in a chair buried his face in his hands and said just tell me it gives your name address all that crap it says you testified at the trial of donte drumm on such and such date in october that you gave crucial testimony on behalf of the prosecution and in your testimony you told the jury that on the night of nicoles disappearance at about the same time you saw a green ford van driving suspiciously through the parking lot where her car was parked and that the driver appeared to be a black male and that the van was very similar to the one owned by donte drumm there are a lot more details but we dont have time for details are you with me joey yes his eyes were covered and he appeared to be crying you now recant that testimony and swear that it was not true youre saying that you lied at trial got that joey he nodded his head in the affirmative and it goes on to say that you made the anonymous phone call to detective drew kerber in which you informed him that donte drumm was the killer again lots of details but ill spare you i think you understand all this joey dont you he uncovered his face wiped tears and said ive lived with this for a long time then fix it joey she slapped the affidavit on the table and thrust a pen at him page five bottom right quickly he signed the affidavit and after it was notarized it was scanned and emailed to the defender group office in austin agnes tanner waited for a confirmation but it bounced back she called a lawyer at the defender groupit had not been received there had been some problems with their internet server agnes sent it again and again it was not received she barked at a clerk who began faxing the five pages joey suddenly neglected left the office without being noticed he at least expected someone to say thanks the prison in huntsville is called the walls unit its the oldest prison in texas built the old way with tall thick brick walls thus the name its storied history includes the incarcerations of oncefamous outlaws and gunslingers its death chamber has been used to execute more men and women than any other state the walls unit is proud of its history a block of the oldest cells has been preserved and presents a step back in time tours can be arranged robbie had been there twice before always hurried and burdened and disinterested in the history of the walls unit when he and keith walked in the front door they were met by ben jeter who managed a smile hello mr flak he said hello warden robbie said grimly grabbing his wallet this is dontes spiritual adviser the reverend keith schroeder the warden shook hands cautiously wasnt aware that drumm had a spiritual adviser well he does now okay give me some id they handed jeter their drivers licenses and he gave them to a guard behind a counter follow me he said jeter had been the warden at walls unit for eleven years and every execution belonged to him it was a duty he assumed but didnt ask for it was just part of the job he was noted for his detachment and professionalism all movements were precise all details followed without variation texas was so efficient in its death work that other states sent over prison officials for consultation ben jeter could show them precisely how it should be done he had asked men and women if they had any last words fifteen minutes later he declared them all dead what about the appeals he asked one step ahead of robbie two ahead of keith who was still in a daze they were zipping down a hallway its walls lined with fading black and whites of former wardens and dead governors doesnt look good robbie said couple of balls in the air but nothing much so you think well go at six i dont know robbie said unwilling to offer much go at six keith said to himself as if they were catching a flight or waiting for a kickoff they stopped at a door and jeter waved a card it opened and they stepped outside walked twenty feet then entered the death house keiths heart was pounding and he was so dizzy he needed to sit down inside he saw bars rows of bars in a dimly lit block of cells there were guards in the way two men in bad suits the warden all looking at the holding cell donte your lawyer is here jeter announced as if he were delivering a gift donte rose to his feet and smiled metal clanged the door slid open and donte took a step robbie grabbed him clutched him whispered something in his ear donte squeezed his lawyer the first real human contact in almost a decade both were crying when they separated next to the holding cell was the visiting cell a space identical except for a wall of glass behind the bars that allowed privacy as the lawyer met with his client for the last time the rules allowed one hour of visitation most condemned men saved a few minutes for the last prayer with the prison chaplain the rules stated that the hour of visitation ran from pm to pm leaving the inmate all alone at the end warden jeter though a stickler for the rules knew when to bend them he also knew that donte drumm had been a model prisoner unlike many and that meant a lot in his business jeter tapped his watch and said its mr flak you have sixty minutes thank you donte entered the visiting cell and sat on the edge of the bed robbie followed him and sat on a stool a guard closed the glass door then rolled the bars in place they were alone knees touching robbie put a hand on dontes shoulder and worked to keep his composure he had agonized over whether he should bring up boyette on the one hand donte had probably accepted the inevitable and with an hour to go was ready for whatever stood beyond he certainly seemed to be at peace why upset him with a wild new story on the other hand donte might appreciate knowing that the truth would finally be known his name would be cleared even though posthumously the truth though was far from certain and robbie decided not to mention boyette thanks for coming robbie donte said in a whisper i promised id be here until the end im sorry i couldnt stop this donte im truly sorry come on robbie you did the best you could youre still fighting arent you oh yes we have some lastminute appeals still out there so theres a chance how much of a chance robbie a chance joey gamble has admitted he lied at trial he got drunk last night in a strip club and admitted everything we secretly recorded it and filed a petition this morning the court turned us down then around this afternoon joey contacted us and said he wants to admit everything dontes only reaction was to slowly shake his head in disbelief were trying to file another petition one that includes his sworn affidavit and it gives us a chance they were hunched over their heads almost touching speaking in whispers there was so much to say and so little robbie was bitter at the system angry to the point of violence burdened by his lack of success in defending donte but most of all he was at that moment just sad for donte the brief stay in the holding cell was confusing ahead not thirty feet away was a door that led to death a door he preferred not to open behind him was death row and the maddening existence of isolation in a cell he preferred to never see again he thought he was ready for the door but he was not nor did he wish to ever see polunsky again dont beat yourself up robbie ill be all right keith with permission stepped outside and tried to breathe it had snowed monday morning in topeka now it felt like eighty degrees in texas he leaned against a fence and stared at the razor wire above him he called dana and told her where he was what he was doing what he was thinking she seemed as astonished as he was with the drumm matter out of the way chief justice milton prudlowe left his office and hurried to the rolling creek country club in westcentral austin he had a pm tennis match with a major contributor to his last and next campaigns in traffic his cell phone rang the clerk of the court informed him that they had received a call from the defender group and that another petition was in the works what time do you have prudlowe demanded four fortynine i get so tired of this crap prudlowe said we close at five and everybody knows it yes sir the clerk said the clerk knew quite well that justice prudlowe despised the lastminute hail marys thrown by desperate defense lawyers the cases drag on for years with little activity then with hours to go the lawyers suddenly shift into high gear any idea what theyre filing prudlowe asked i think its the same thing they filed this morningan eyewitness is recanting theyre having trouble with their computers gee thats original we close at five and at five i want the door locked and not a minute after understand yes sir at cicely avis and two paralegals left the defender group offices with the petition and gambles affidavit all twelve copies as they sped through traffic cicely called the clerks office with the headsup that they were on the way the clerk informed her that the office would close at five the usual time five days a week but we have a petition that includes a sworn affidavit from the only eyewitness at trial she insisted i think weve already seen that one the clerk said you have not this has a sworn statement i just talked to the chief justice we close at five but well be a few minutes late we close at five travis boyette was sitting by a window in the conference room cane across his knees watching the chaos of frantic people yelling at each other fred pryor was close by also watching unable to make sense of what was happening boyette stood and approached the table can anybody tell me whats going on he asked yep were losing carlos snapped at him what about my statement is anybody listening to me the answer is no the court was not impressed they think im lying yes travis they think youre lying im sorry we believe you but we dont have a vote i want to talk to the reporters i think theyre busy chasing fires sammie thomas looked at her laptop scribbled down something and handed it to boyette this is the cell phone number of one of our local tv idiots she pointed to a table near the television that is a telephone feel free to do whatever you want mr boyette travis shuffled over to the phone punched the numbers and waited he was being watched by sammie carlos bonnie and fred pryor he held the receiver and stared at the floor then he flinched and said uh yes is this garrett okay look my name is travis boyette and im down at the law office of robbie flak i was involved in the murder of nicole yarber and id like to go on the air and make a confession pause the tic i want to confess to the murder of the girl donte drumm had nothing to do with it pause the tic yes i want to say that on the air and i have a lot more to say as well the others could almost hear the frantic thrill in garretts voice what a story boyette said okay and hung up he looked around the conference room and said theyll be here in ten minutes sammie said fred why dont you take him out front somewhere near the landing and find a good spot boyette said i can leave if i want to right i dont have to stay here youre a free man as far as im concerned sammie said do whatever you want i really dont care boyette and pryor left the conference room and waited outside the train station carlos took the call from cicely avis she explained that they arrived at the court at the doors were locked the offices closed she called the clerks cell phone the clerk said he was not there he was in fact driving home dontes final petition would not be filed according to club records chief justice milton prudlowe and his guest played tennis on court for an hour beginning at pm chapter paul koffees cabin was on a small lake ten miles south of slone hed owned it for years and used it as an escape a hiding place a fishing hole hed also used it as a love nest during his romp with judge vivian grale an unfortunate episode that led to an ugly divorce that almost led to the loss of the cabin his exwife got their home instead after lunch on thursday he left his office and drove to the cabin the town was in a meltdown it was beginning to feel dangerous the phone was ringing nonstop and no one in his office was even attempting to appear productive he escaped the frenzy and was soon in the peaceful countryside where he prepared for a party hed thrown together a week earlier he iced down the beer stocked the bar puttered around the cabin and waited for his guests they began arriving before pmmost had left work earlyand everyone needed a drink they gathered on a deck near the edge of the waterretired lawyers active lawyers two assistant prosecutors in koffees office an investigator and other assorted friends almost all of whom had some connection to the law drew kerber and another detective were there everyone wanted to talk to kerber the cop who broke the case without his skillful interrogation of donte drumm there would have been no conviction hed found the bloodhounds that picked up nicoles scent in the green ford van hed deftly manipulated a jailhouse snitch into obtaining yet another confession from their suspect good solid police work the drumm case was kerbers crowning moment and he intended to savor its final moments not to be outdone paul koffee commanded his share of attention he would retire in a few years and in his old age he would have something to brag about against a ferocious defense mounted by robbie flak and his team koffee and his boys had fought on fought for justice fought for nicole the fact that he had gotten his prized death verdict without a body was even more reason to gloat the booze loosened the tension they howled with laughter at the story of their beloved governor shouting down a black mob and calling drumm a monster things were a bit quieter when koffee described the petition filed hardly two hours ago in which some nut claimed to be the killer but have no fear he assured them the court of appeals had already denied relief only one other appeal was in play a bogus onehell theyre all bogusbut it was as good as dead in the supreme court koffee happily assured his guests that justice was on the verge of prevailing they swapped stories about the church burnings the cotton gin fire the growing mob in civitan park and the coming of the cavalry the national guard was expected by pm and there was no shortage of opinions about whether it was actually needed koffee was barbecuing chicken on a grill breasts and thighs coated with a thick sauce but the treat of the night he announced would be drumm sticks a chorus of laughter echoed across the lake huntsville is also the home of sam houston state university the school has an enrollment of sixteen thousand percent white percent black percent hispanic and percent other late thursday afternoon many of the black students were drifting toward the prison some eight blocks away in central huntsville operation detour may have failed in its attempt to block roads but it would not fail in its efforts to raise a little hell the streets closer to the prison were sealed off by texas state troopers and huntsville police the authorities were expecting trouble and security around walls unit was tight the black students gathered three blocks from the prison and began making noise when robbie stepped out of the death house to work the phone he heard in the distance the organized chanting of a thousand voices donte donte he could see nothing but the exterior walls of the death house and chainlink fencing but he could tell the crowd was close what difference did it make it was too late for protests and marches he listened for a second then called the office sammie thomas answered by blurting they wouldnt let us file the gamble petition they locked the doors at pm robbie and we got there seven minutes late they knew we were coming too his first impulse was to launch the phone against the nearest brick wall and watch it shatter into a thousand pieces but he was too stunned to move she went on the defender group called the clerk a few minutes before five they were actually in a car racing to file clerk said too bad said hed talked to prudlowe and the office closed at five are you there robbie yes no go on nothing left but the cert petitions before the supremes no word yet robbie was leaning on a chainlink fence trying to steady himself a tantrum would not help matters now he could throw things and curse and maybe file lawsuits tomorrow but he needed to think i dont expect any help from the supreme court do you he asked no not really well then its almost over yes robbie thats the feeling around here you know sammie all we needed was twentyfour hours if travis boyette and joey gamble had given us twentyfour hours we couldve stopped this damned thing and theres a very good chance donte would one day walk out of here twentyfour hours agreed and speaking of boyette hes outside waiting for a tv crew he called them not us though i did give him the number he wants to talk let him talk damn it as of now let him tell the world i dont care is carlos ready with the video blast i think so then turn him loose i want every big newspaper and television station in the state to get the video right now lets make as much noise as possible if were going down then lets go down in flames you got it boss robbie listened to the distant chants for a moment while staring at his phone who could he call was there anyone in the world who could help keith flinched when the metal bars closed behind him this was not his first prison visit but it was the first time hed been locked in a cell his breathing was labored and his colon was in knots but he had prayed for strength it was a very short prayer god please give me courage and wisdom then please get me out of here donte did not rise when keith entered the visitors cell but he did smile and offer a hand keith shook it a soft passive handshake im keith schroeder he said as he sat on the stool his back to the wall his shoes inches from dontes robbie said you were a good guy donte said he seemed to concentrate on keiths collar as if to confirm that he was in fact a minister keiths voice froze as he thought about what to say a grave how are you doing seemed ludicrous what do you say to a young man who will die in less than an hour whose death is certain and could be avoided you talk about death robbie tells me you didnt want to talk to the prison chaplain keith said he works for the system the system has persecuted me for nine years and it will soon get what it wants so i concede nothing to the system makes perfect sense keith thought donte was sitting straighter his arms folded across his chest as though he would welcome a good debate about religion faith god heaven hell or anything else keith wanted to discuss youre not from texas are you donte asked kansas the accent do you believe the state has the right to kill people no do you think jesus would approve of the killing of inmates for retribution of course not does thou shalt not kill apply to everybody or did moses forget the exemption for state governments the government is owned by the people the commandment applies to everyone donte smiled and relaxed a little okay you pass we can talk whats on your mind keith breathed a little easier pleased to have survived the entrance exam he half expected to meet a young man without all of his mental assets and he was wrong robbies noisy claim that donte had been driven insane by death row seemed misguided keith plunged ahead robbie tells me you were raised in a church baptized at an early age had a strong faith raised by parents who were devout christians all true i was close to god mr schroeder until god abandoned me please call me keith i read a story about a man who once sat right here in this cell his name was darrell clark young man from west texas midland i think hed killed some people in a drug war got convicted and sent to death row at the old unit at ellis while he was on death row someone gave him a bible and someone else shared a christian testimony clark became a christian and grew very close to the lord his appeals ran out and his execution date was set he embraced the end he looked forward to death because he knew the exact moment when he would enter the kingdom of heaven i cant think of another story quite like darrell clarks whats your point my point is youre about to die and you know when it will happen very few people know this soldiers in battle may feel like dead men but theres always a chance theyll survive i suppose some victims of horrible crimes know theyre at the end but they have such short notice you though have had this date for months now the hour is at hand and its not a bad time to make amends with god i know the legend of darrell clark his final words were father into your hands i commit my spirit luke verse the last words of jesus before he died on the cross according to luke anyway but youre missing something here keith clark killed three people execution style and after they convicted him he never made a serious claim of innocence he was guilty i am not clark deserved to be punished not to be killed but imprisoned for life me i am innocent true but death is death and in the end nothing else matters except your relationship with god so youre trying to convince me that i should go running back to god here at the last minute and just sort of forget the past nine years you blame god for the past nine years yes i do this is what happened to me keith i was eighteen years old a longtime christian still active in church but also doing some things that most kids do nothing bad but hell when you grow up in a house as strict as mine youre gonna rebel a little i was a good student the football thing was on hold but i wasnt running drugs and beating people i stayed off the streets i was looking forward to college then for some reason i guess ill never understand a bolt of lightning hits me square in the forehead im wearing handcuffs im in jail my picture is on the front page im declared guilty long before the trial my fate is determined by twelve white people half of them good solid baptists the prosecutor was a methodist the judge was presbyterian or at least their names were on church rolls somewhere they were also screwing each other but i guess we all have a weakness for flesh most of us anyway screwing each other yet pretending to give me a fair trial the jury was a bunch of rednecks i remember sitting in the courtroom looking at their faces as they condemned me to deathhard unforgiving christian facesand thinking to myself we dont worship the same god and we dont how can god allow his people to kill so often answer that please gods people are often wrong donte but god is never wrong you cant blame him the fight left him the weight of the moment returned donte leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and hung his head i was a faithful servant keith and look what i get robbie walked in from the outside and stood by the visitors cell keiths time was up would you pray with me donte why i prayed the first three years i was in prison and things just got worse i couldve prayed ten times a day and i would still be sitting right here talking to you all right mind if i pray go right ahead keith closed his eyes he found it hard to pray under the circumstancesdonte staring at him robbie anxiously waiting the clock ticking louder and louder he asked god to give donte strength and courage and have mercy on his soul amen when he finished he stood and patted donte on the shoulder still not believing that he would be dead in less than an hour donte said thanks for coming im honored to meet you donte they shook hands again then the metal clanged and the doors opened keith stepped out robbie stepped in the clock on the wall indeed the only clock that mattered gave the time as the looming execution of a man claiming innocence did nothing to arouse the national media the stories had become so commonplace however the titfortat angle of the church burnings on the eve of the execution woke up a few producers the melee at the high school added some fuel but the possibility of a race riotnow that was too good to be ignored toss in the drama of the national guard and by late afternoon slone was buzzing with brightly painted television vans from dallas and houston and other cities most providing direct feeds to network and cable stations when word spread that a man claiming to be the real killer wanted to confess on camera the train station became an instant magnet for the media with fred pryor directing things or at least attempting to keep some order travis boyette stood on the bottom step of the platform and looked at the reporters and the cameras microphones were thrust at him like bayonets fred stood at his right side actually shoving some of the reporters back quiet fred barked at them then he nodded at travis and said go ahead travis was as stiff as a deer in headlights but he swallowed hard and plunged in my name is travis boyette and i killed nicole yarber donte drumm had nothing to do with her murder i acted alone i abducted her raped her repeatedly then strangled her to death i disposed of her body and its not in the red river where is it its in missouri where i left it whyd you do it because i cant stop myself ive raped other women lots of them sometimes i got caught sometimes i didnt this startled the reporters and a few seconds elapsed before the next question so you are a convicted rapist oh yes i have four or five convictions are you from slone no but i was living here when i killed nicole did you know her dana schroeder had been parked in front of the television in the den for the past two hours glued to cnn waiting for more news from slone there had been two reports brief little snippets about the unrest and the national guard she had watched the governor make a fool of himself the story though was gathering momentum when she saw the face of travis boyette she said out loud there he is her husband was at death row consoling the man convicted of the killing and she was watching the one who had actually committed the crime joey gamble was in a bar the first one hed seen when he left the office of agnes tanner he was drunk but still aware of what was happening there were two televisions hanging from the ceiling at opposite ends of the bar one was on sportscenter the other on cnn when joey saw the story from slone he walked closer to the television he listened to boyette as he talked about killing nicole you son of a bitch joey mumbled and the bartender gave him a quizzical look but then he felt good about himself he had finally told the truth and now the real killer had come forward donte would be spared he ordered another beer judge elias henry was sitting with his wife in the den of their home not far from civitan park the doors were locked his hunting rifles were loaded and ready a police car drove by every ten minutes a helicopter watched from above the air was thick with the smell of smokesmoke from the fireworks party at the park and smoke from the destroyed buildings the mob could be heard its nonstop drumming and booming rap and screeching chants had only intensified throughout the afternoon judge and mrs henry had discussed leaving for the night they had a son in tyler an hour away and he had encouraged them to flee if only for a few hours but they decided to stay primarily because the neighbors were staying and there was strength in numbers the judge had chatted with the chief of police who somewhat nervously assured him that things were under control the television was on another breaking story from slone the judge grabbed the remote and turned up the volume then there was the man hed seen in the video not three hours earlier travis boyette was talking giving details staring at a bunch of microphones did you know the girl a reporter asked id never met her but i had followed her i knew who she was knew she was a cheerleader i picked her out how did you abduct her i found her car parked next to it waited until she came out of the mall i used a gun she didnt argue ive done this before have you been convicted in texas before no missouri kansas oklahoma arkansas you can check the records im telling the truth here and the truth is that i did the crime not donte drumm why are you coming forward now and not a year ago i should have but i figured the courts down here would finally realize they had the wrong guy i just got out of prison in kansas and a few days ago i saw in the paper where they were getting ready to execute drumm surprised me so here i am right now only the governor can stop the execution what would you say to him id say youre about to kill an innocent man you give me twentyfour hours and ill show you the body of nicole yarber just twentyfour hours mr governor judge henry scratched his chin with his knuckles and said a bad night just got worse barry and wayne were in the governors office watching boyette on cnn their governor was down the hall being interviewed for the fifth or sixth time since his courageous handling of the angry mob wed better go get him wayne said yep ill go you keep an eye on this five minutes later the governor was watching a rerun of boyette hes obviously a crackpot newton said after a few seconds wheres the bourbon three glasses were filled and the bourbon was sipped as they listened to boyette talk about the body how did you kill nicole strangled her with her belt black leather with a round silver buckle still around her neck boyette reached under his shirt and pulled out a ring he thrust it at the cameras this is nicoles ive worn it since the night i took her has her initials and everything how did you dispose of the body lets just say its underground how far from here i dont know five or six hours again if the governor would give us twentyfour hours we can find it thatll prove im right who is this guy the governor asked a serial rapist rap sheet a mile long its amazing how they always manage to pop up right before the execution newton said probably getting money from flak all three managed a nervous laugh the laughter at the lake was interrupted when a guest walked past a tv inside and saw what was happening the party quickly moved indoors and thirty people huddled around the small screen no one spoke no one seemed to breathe as boyette went on and on perfectly willing to answer any question with a blunt response yall ever hear of this guy paul asked one of the retired lawyers paul shook his head no hes at flaks office the train station robbies up to his old tricks not a smile not a grin not a forced chuckle when boyette produced her ring and freely displayed it for the cameras fear swept through the cabin and paul koffee found his way to a chair the breaking news was not heard by everyone at the prison reeva and her gang were gathered in a small office where they waited for the van ride to the death chamber not far away the family of donte waited too for the next hour the two groups of witnesses would be in close proximity to each other but carefully separated at the family of the victim was loaded in a white unmarked prison van and driven to the death house a ride that lasted less than ten minutes once there they were led through an unmarked door into a small square room twelve feet long and twelve feet wide there were no chairs no benches the walls were blank unmarked before them was a closed curtain and they had been told that on the other side of the curtain was the actual death chamber at the drumm family made the same trip and entered their witness room through another door the witness rooms were side by side a loud cough in one could be heard in the other they waited chapter at the us supreme court by a vote of refused to hear dontes insanity petition ten minutes later the court again denied cert on the boyette petition robbie took the calls outside the holding cell he closed his phone walked inside to warden jeter and whispered its over no more appeals jeter nodded grimly and said you got two minutes thanks robbie reentered the holding cell and broke the news to donte there was nothing else to do the fight was over donte closed his eyes and breathed deeply as the reality set in until that moment there had always been hope however distant however remote and unlikely then he swallowed hard managed a smile and inched closer to robbie their knees were touching their heads just inches apart say robbie you think theyll ever catch the dude who killed nicole again robbie wanted to tell him about boyette but that story was far from over the truth was anything but certain i dont know donte i cant predict why heres what you gotta do robbie if they never find the guy then folks will always believe it was me but if they find him then you gotta promise me youll clear my name will you promise me robbie i dont care how long it takes but you gotta clear my name ill do that donte i got this vision that one day my momma and my brothers and sister will stand beside my grave and celebrate because im an innocent man wont that be great robbie ill be there too donte throw a big party right there in the cemetery invite all my friends raise all sorts of hell let the world know that donte is innocent will you do that robbie you have my word thatll be great robbie slowly took both of dontes hands and squeezed them in his i gotta go big man i dont know what to say except that its been an honor being your lawyer i have believed you from the very beginning and i believe you even more today ive always known you are innocent and i hate the sons of bitches who are making this happen ill keep fighting donte i promise their foreheads touched donte said thank you robbie for everything ill be all right ill never forget you take care of my momma okay robbie you know i will they stood and embraced a long painful hug that neither wanted to end ben jeter was by the door waiting robbie finally left the holding cell and walked to the end of the short hallway where keith sat in a folding chair praying fervently robbie sat down beside him and began weeping ben jeter asked donte for the last time if he wanted to see the chaplain he did not the hallway began to fill with uniformed guards large healthy boys with stern faces and thick arms the beef had arrived just in case the inmate had second thoughts about going peacefully to the death chamber there was a flurry of activity and the place was filled with people jeter approached robbie and said lets go robbie slowly got to his feet and took a step before he stopped and looked down at keith come on keith he said keith looked up blankly not sure where he was certain that his little nightmare would end soon and hed wake up in bed with dana what robbie grabbed an arm and yanked hard come on its time to witness the execution but the warden gave his approval another hard pull youre the spiritual adviser to the condemned man thus you qualify as a witness i dont think so robbie no look ill just wait several of the guards were amused by the altercation keith was aware of their smirks but didnt care come on robbie said now dragging the minister do it for donte hell do it for me you live in kansas a deathpenalty state come watch a little democracy in action keith was moving and everything was a blur they walked by the columns of guards past the holding cell where donte eyes down was being handcuffed again to a narrow unmarked door keith had not noticed before it opened and closed behind them they were in a small boxlike room with dim lights robbie finally turned loose of him then walked over and hugged the drumm family no more appeals he said softly theres nothing left to do it would be the longest ten minutes in gill newtons lengthy career in public service from until pm he vacillated as never before on one side literally on one side of his office wayne pushed harder and harder for a thirtyday reprieve he argued that the execution could be delayed for thirty days and thirty days only while the dust settled and the claims of this boyette clown could be investigated if he was telling the truth and the body could be found then the governor would be a hero if he turned out to be a flake as they strongly suspected then drumm would live another thirty days and then get the needle there was no longterm harm politically the only permanent damage would occur if they ignored boyette executed drumm then found the body exactly where boyette took them that would be fatal and not just for drumm the mood was so tense that they were ignoring the bourbon on the other side barry argued that any form of retreat would be nothing but a show of weakness especially in light of the governors performance before the mob less than three hours earlier executions especially highprofile ones attract all sorts of attention seekers and this guy boyette was a perfect example he was obviously looking for the spotlight his fifteen minutes onstage and to allow him to derail a proper execution was wrong from a judicial point of view and even more so from a political one drumm confessed to the murder barry said over and over dont let some serial pervert cloud the truth it was a fair trial the appeals courts all of them had affirmed the conviction play it safe wayne countered just thirty days maybe well learn something new about the case but its been nine years barry retorted enough is enough are there any reporters outside newton asked sure barry said they have been hanging around all day line em up the final walk was a short one some thirty feet from the holding cell to the death chamber the entire pathway lined with guards some of whom watched from the corners of their eyes to see the dead mans face others stared at the floor as if they were sentries guarding a lonely gate one of three faces could be expected from the condemned man the most common was a hard frown with wide eyes a look of fear and disbelief the second most common was a passive surrender eyes halfopen as if the chemicals were already at work the third and least common was the angry look of a man whod kill every guard in sight if he had a gun donte drumm did not resist that rarely happens with a guard holding each elbow he marched on his face calm his eyes on the floor he refused to allow his captors to see the fear he felt nor did he wish to acknowledge them in any way for such a notorious room the texas death chamber is remarkably small a nearsquare box twelve feet long and wide with a low ceiling and a permanent metal bed in the center adorned in clean white sheets for each occasion the bed fills the room donte could not believe how cramped it was he sat on the edge of the bed and four guards quickly took over they swung his legs around stretched them out then methodically secured his body with five thick leather straps one around his chest midsection groin thighs and calves his arms were placed on extensions degrees from his body and secured with more leather straps as they prepped him he closed his eyes listened to and felt the urgent business about him there were grunts and a few words but these men knew their tasks this was the last stop on the systems assembly line and the workers were well experienced when all the straps were tightened the guards retreated a medical technician who smelled of antiseptic hovered and said im going to poke and find a vein left arm first then the right you understand be my guest donte said and opened his eyes the technician was rubbing his arm with alcohol to prevent infection how thoughtful behind him was a darkened window and below it was an opening from which two ominous tubes ran toward the bed the warden was to his right watching it all carefully very much in charge behind the warden were two identical windowsthe witness roomssealed off by curtains if hed been so inclined and were it not for all the damned leather straps donte couldve reached out and touched the nearest window the tubes were in place one in each arm though only one would be used the second one was a backup just in case at governor gill newton hurriedly stepped in front of three cameras outside of his office and without notes said my denial of a reprieve still stands donte drumm confessed to this atrocious crime and must pay the ultimate price he received a fair trial eight years ago by a jury of his peers and his case has been reviewed by five different courts dozens of judges and all have confirmed his conviction his claim of innocence is not believable nor is this lastminute sensational effort by his attorneys to produce a new killer the judicial system of texas cannot be hijacked by some criminal looking for attention and a desperate lawyer who will say anything god bless texas he refused to answer questions and returned to his office when the curtains were suddenly opened roberta drumm nearly collapsed at the sight of her youngest son strapped tightly to the bed with tubes running from both arms she gasped covered her mouth with both hands and had cedric and marvin not braced her she would have been on the floor the shock hit all of them they squeezed tighter together and robbie joined the huddle adding support keith was too stricken to move he stood a few feet away some strangers were behind him witnesses who had entered at some point keith wasnt sure when they inched forward straining for a view it was thursday the second one in november and at that moment the ladies bible class was meeting in the vestry of st marks lutheran for the continuation of their study of the gospel of luke to be followed by a pasta dinner in the kitchen keith dana and the boys were always invited to the dinner and usually attended he really missed his church and his family and he wasnt sure why he was having such thoughts as he stared at the very dark head of donte drumm it contrasted sharply with the white shirt he was wearing and the snowwhite sheets around him the leather straps were light brown roberta sobbed loudly and robbie was mumbling and the unknown witnesses behind him were pressing for a better view and keith wanted to scream he was tired of praying and his prayers werent working anyway keith asked himself if he would feel differently if donte was guilty he didnt think so guilt would certainly take away some of the sympathy for the kid but as he watched the preliminaries unfold he was struck by the coldness the ruthless efficiency the sanitized neatness of it it was similar to killing an old dog a lame horse or a laboratory rat who exactly gives us the right to kill if killing is wrong then why are we allowed to kill as keith stared at donte he knew the image would never go away and he knew that he would never be the same robbie stared at donte too at the right side of his face and thought of all the things he would have changed in every trial the lawyer makes a dozen snap decisions and robbie had relived them all he would have hired a different expert called different witnesses toned down his attitude toward the judge been nicer to the jury he would always blame himself though no one else did he had failed to save an innocent man and that burden was too heavy a big piece of his life was about to perish also and he doubted he would ever be the same next door reeva wept at the sight of her daughters killer flat on his back helpless hopeless waiting to take his last breath and go on to hell his deathquick and rather pleasantwas nothing compared to nicoles and reeva wanted more suffering and pain than she was about to witness wallis boosted her with an arm around her shoulder she was held by her two children nicoles biological father was not there and reeva would never let him forget it donte turned hard to his right and his mother finally came into focus he smiled gave a thumbsup then turned back and closed his eyes at warden jeter stepped to a table and picked up a phone a direct line to the attorney generals office in austin he was informed that all appeals were final there was no reason to stop the execution he replaced the receiver then picked up another one identical to the first it was a direct line to the governors office the message was the same green lights all around at he stepped to the bed and said mr drumm would you like to make a final statement donte said yes the warden reached toward the ceiling grabbed a small microphone and pulled it to within twelve inches of dontes face go ahead he said wires ran to a small speaker in each witness room donte cleared his throat stared at the microphone and said i love my mother and my father and im so sad my dad died before i could say goodbye the state of texas would not allow me to attend his funeral to cedric marvin and andrea i love yall and ill see you down the road im sorry ive put you through all this but it wasnt my fault to robbie i love you man youre the greatest to the family of nicole yarber im sorry about what happened to her she was a sweet girl and i hope someday they find the man who killed her then i guess you all will have to be here and do this again he paused closed his eyes then yelled i am an innocent man ive been persecuted for nine years by the state of texas for a crime i didnt do i never touched nicole yarber and i dont know who killed her he took a breath opened his eyes and went on to detective drew kerber paul koffee judge grale all those bigots on the jury all those blind mice on the appeals courts and to governor newton your day of judgment is coming when they find the real killer ill be there to haunt you he turned and looked at his mother goodbye momma love you after a few seconds of silence ben jeter pushed the microphone toward the ceiling he took a step backward and nodded at the faceless chemist who hid behind the black window to the left of the bed the injection beganthree different doses given in quick succession each of the three was lethal enough if used alone the first was sodium thiopental a powerful sedative donte closed his eyes never to reopen them two minutes later a dose of pancuronium bromide a muscle relaxer stopped his breathing third was a shot of potassium chloride that stopped his heart with all the leather strapping it was difficult to tell when dontes breathing stopped but stop it did at the medical technician appeared and prodded the corpse with a stethoscope he nodded at the warden who announced at that donte drumm was dead chapter the curtains closed the death chamber vanished reeva hugged wallis and wallis hugged reeva and they hugged their children the door to their witness room opened and a prison official hurried them through it two minutes after the announcement of death reeva and her family were back in the van whisked away with an amazing efficiency after they left the drumm family was escorted through a different door but along the same route robbie and keith were alone for a few seconds in the witness room robbies eyes were wet his face pale he was thoroughly defeated drained but at the same time looking for someone to fight are you glad you watched it he asked no i am not neither am i at the train station news of dontes death was received without a word they were too stunned to speak in the conference room they stared at the television heard the words but still couldnt believe that the miracle had somehow slipped away only three hours earlier they had been frantically working on the boyette petition and the gamble petition two eleventhhour gifts from above that seemed so hopeful but the tcca rejected boyette and literally slammed the door on gamble now donte was dead sammie thomas cried softly in one corner carlos and bonnie stared at the television as if the story might change to a happier ending travis boyette sat hunched over rubbing his head while fred pryor watched him they worried about robbie boyette suddenly stood and said i dont understand what happened those people didnt listen to me im telling the truth youre too late boyette carlos snapped nine years too late sammie said you sit on your ass for nine years perfectly willing to let someone else serve your time and then you pop in here with five hours to go and expect everyone to listen to you carlos was walking toward boyette pointing a finger all we needed was twentyfour hours boyette if you had shown up yesterday we couldve searched for the body we find the body theres no execution theres no execution because they got the wrong guy they got the wrong guy because theyre stupid but also because youre too much of a coward to come forward donte is dead boyette because of you boyettes face turned crimson and he reached for his cane fred pryor though was quicker he grabbed boyettes hand looked at carlos and said lets cool it everybody calm down sammies cell phone buzzed she glanced at it and said its robbie carlos turned away and boyette sat down with pryor close by sammie listened for a few minutes then laid down the phone she wiped a tear and said the press got it right for a change hes dead he said donte was strong to the bitter end proclaimed his innocence did so very convincingly robbies leaving the prison now theyll fly back and be here around he would like for us to wait she paused and wiped her face again the national guardsmen had just fanned out through the streets around civitan park in the white section and washington park in the black section when the news hit that donte had been executed the crowd in civitan park had grown steadily throughout the afternoon in both size and volume and it immediately pressed outward toward the guardsmen the soldiers were taunted cursed insulted a few rocks were thrown but the violence seething just under the surface was suppressed it was near dark and there was little doubt that nighttime would see the situation deteriorate in washington park the crowd was older and made up primarily of neighbors the younger rowdier ones headed across town where trouble was more likely homes were locked vigils commenced on front porches and weapons were at the ready the sentries stepped up their patrols at every church in slone ten miles to the south the mood was much merrier at the cabin huddled around the television fresh drinks in hand they grinned smugly when death was confirmed paul koffee toasted drew kerber then drew kerber toasted paul koffee glasses clinked together the discomforting hesitation they had felt with that boyette thing was quickly forgotten at least for the moment justice had finally prevailed warden jeter walked robbie and keith back to the front of the prison shook their hands said goodbye robbie thanked him for his thoughtfulness keith wasnt sure if he wanted to thank him or insult himhis lastsecond approval of keith as a witness had led to a horrific experiencebut he was gracious anyway as was his nature when they stepped through the front door they saw where the noise was coming from to the right three blocks away and on the other side of a wall of police and state troopers students were yelling and waving homemade banners and placards they were packed together in the middle of a street that had been cordoned off beyond them traffic was backed up a wave of cars had tried to reach the prison and when they were blocked their drivers simply got out and joined the crowd operation detour had planned to choke the prison with people and vehicles and the plan was working the goal of preventing the execution had not been reached but dontes supporters had at least been mobilized and they had been heard aaron rey was waiting on the sidewalk waving keith and robbie over weve found an escape route he said this place is ready to blow up they hurried to the minivan and took off the driver began darting through side streets dodging parked cars and angry students martha handler studied robbies face but he did not make eye contact can we talk she asked he shook his head no keith did the same both closed their eyes a huntsville funeral home had the contract one of its black hearses was inside the walls unit out of sight and when the last of the witnesses and officials left the death house it backed to the same gate where the vans had come and gone a collapsible gurney was pulled out extended and rolled inside to the death chamber where it was wedged tightly next to the bed where donte lay motionless and unrestrained the tubes had been removed and recoiled into the dark room where the chemist still unseen was filling out his paperwork on the count of three four guards lifted the corpse gently and placed it on the gurney where it was once again strapped but not as tightly this time a blanket owned by the funeral home was tucked over him and when all was in place the gurney was rolled back to the hearse twenty minutes after the pronouncement of death the body was leaving the walls unit through a different route to avoid the protesters and cameras at the funeral home the body was taken to a prep room mr hubert lamb and his son alvin owners of lamb amp son funeral home slone texas were waiting they would embalm the body at their place in slone on the same table where they had prepared riley drumm five years earlier but riley had been an old man of fiftyfive when he passed his body shrunken and decayed and his death had been anticipated it could be explained his sons could not as men who dealt in death constantly handling corpses the lambs figured they had seen it all but they were taken aback by the sight of donte lying peacefully on the gurney his face content his body undisturbed a young man of twentyseven they had known him since he was a boy they had cheered for him on the football field and like all of slone expected a long glorious career they had whispered and gossiped with the rest of the town when he was arrested they were stunned by the confession and quick to believe donte when he immediately recanted the slone police and detective kerber in particular were not trusted on their side of town the boy was tricked they beat a confession out of him just like in the old days they watched with frustration as he was tried and convicted by a white jury and after he was sent away they like the rest of the town half expected the girls body to show up or maybe even the girl herself with the help of two others they lifted donte from the gurney and gently placed him in a handsome oak casket selected by his mother on monday roberta had paid a small depositshe had burial insuranceand the lambs were quick to agree to a full refund if the casket became unnecessary they would have happily forgone the use of it they had prayed they would not be where they were at that momentcollecting the body then driving it home then preparing for a painful wake memorial and funeral the four men wrestled the casket into the lamb amp son hearse and at donte left huntsville and headed home the fordycehitting hard set was in a small ballroom in a cheap chain motel on the fringe of huntsville reeva and wallis were perched on directors chairs and made up for the cameras while sean fordyce stomped around in his usual manic mode hed just jetted in from an execution in florida barely made it to huntsville but so glad he did because the nicole yarber case had become one of his best ever in preliminary chitchat as the technicians worked frantically on the sound the lighting the makeup the script fordyce realized that reeva had not yet heard about the appearance of travis boyette she had been inside the prison preparing for the big event when the story broke instinctively he decided not to tell her he would save it for later the postexecution interview was the most dramatic segment of his show catch em just minutes after theyve watched the bastard die and they might say anything he snapped at a technician cursed a cameraman yelled that he was ready to go a final dusting of powder on his forehead then an instant change of demeanor as he looked at the camera smiled and became a man of great compassion with tape running he explained where he was gave the time the hour the gravity of the moment then he walked to reeva and said reeva its over tell us what you saw reeva a kleenex in each handshed gone through a box since lunchdabbed her eyes and said i saw him for the first time in eight years i saw the man who killed my baby i looked him in the eyes but he would not look at me her voice was strong no breakdown yet what did he say he said he was sorry and i appreciate that fordyce leaned in closer frowning did he say he was sorry for killing nicole something like that she said but wallis shook his head and glanced at his wife you disagree mr pike he said he was sorry for what happened not sorry for anything he did wallis grunted are you sure reeva fired back at her husband im sure thats not what i heard tell us about the execution the dying fordyce pleaded reeva still pissed at wallis shook her head and wiped her nose with a kleenex it was much too easy he just went to sleep when they opened the curtains he was already on the little bed in there all strapped down looking very much at peace he made his last statement then he closed his eyes we couldnt tell anything nothing no sign that the drugs had been administered nothing he just went to sleep and you were thinking about nicole and how horrible her death must have been oh god yes exactly my poor baby she suffered greatly just terrible her voice choked and the camera zoomed even closer did you want him to suffer fordyce asked prodding prompting she nodded vigorously her eyes closed fordyce asked wallis what changes now mr pike what does this mean for your family wallis thought for a second and while he was thinking reeva blurted it means a lot knowing hes dead knowing hes been punished i think ill sleep better at night did he claim to be innocent oh yes reeva said the tears gone for the moment same old stuff weve been hearing for years im an innocent man well now hes a dead man thats all i can say have you ever thought that he might be innocent that someone else might have killed nicole no not for a minute the monster confessed fordyce pulled back a little have you heard of a man named travis boyette a blank face who travis boyette at this afternoon he went on television in slone and claimed to be the killer nonsense heres the tape fordyce said pointing to a twentyinch screen off to the right on cue the video of travis boyette appeared the volume was high the rest of the set was perfectly still as he talked reeva watched closely frowning almost smirking then shaking her head no an idiot a fraud she knew who the killer was but when boyette pulled out the class ring shoved it at the cameras and said he had kept it for nine years reevas face turned pale her jaw dropped her shoulders slumped sean fordyce may have been a noisy proponent of the death penalty but like most cable screamers he never let ideology get in the way of a sensational story the possibility that the wrong man had just been executed would undoubtedly strike a blow against capital punishment but fordyce couldnt have cared less he was smack in the middle of the hours hottest storynumber two on cnns home pageand he planned to make the most of it and he saw nothing wrong with ambushing his own guest hed done it before and he would do it again if it produced great drama boyette vanished from the screen did you see the ring reeva fordyce boomed reeva looked as though shed seen a ghost then she collected herself and remembered that everything was being filmed yes she managed to say and is it nicoles oh theres no way to tell who is this guy and where did he come from hes a serial rapist with a rap sheet a mile long thats who he is well there who can believe him so you dont reeva of course not but the tears were gone as was the spunk reeva appeared confused disoriented and very tired as fordyce moved in for another question she said sean its been a long day were going home yes sure reeva just one more question now that youve seen an execution do you think they should be televised reeva yanked the mike off her jacket and bounced to her feet come on wallis im tired the interview was over reeva wallis and their two children walked out of the motel with brother ronnie behind them they piled into the church van and headed for slone at the airport keith called dana with the latest update on his little road trip he was freefalling now with no idea where he was going and not sure where hed been when he explained gently that he had just witnessed the execution she was speechless so was he the conversation was brief she asked if he was okay and he replied that he definitely was not the king air lifted off at and was soon in heavy clouds the plane dipped and lurched much like an old truck on a bumpy road moderate turbulence the pilot had called it as they boarded with the noise of the engines the sense of being tossed about and the mindbending blur of images from the past two hours keith found it easy to close his eyes and withdraw into his own little cocoon robbie was withdrawn too he sat forward elbows on knees chin in hand eyes closed deep in thought and painful memories martha handler wanted to talk to take notes to capture the moment fully but there was no one to interview aaron rey stared nervously out the window as if waiting for a wing to break off at five thousand feet the ride smoothed somewhat and the cabin noise died down robbie reclined in his seat and smiled at martha what were his last words she asked he loves his momma and hes an innocent man is that all thats enough theres a web site for the texas death row an official one and they post all of the last statements dontes will be up by noon tomorrow it was beautiful he called em by name the bad guyskerber koffee judge grale the governor beautiful just beautiful so he went down fighting he was not able to fight but he did not give an inch the car was an old buick owned by an old widow ms nadine snyderwine and it was parked beside her modest home on a concrete pad under a willow oak she drove it three times a week max and with her failing eyesight she knew her driving days were numbered ms snyderwine had never worked outside the home never met a lot of people and certainly never provoked anyone her car was chosen because it was accessible and more important because it was parked on a quiet dark street in a very white part of town the buick was unlocked not that a lock would have mattered the drivers door was opened a molotov cocktail was lit and tossed inside and the arsonists disappeared into the night without a trace a neighbor saw flames and the call was recorded at if there was a chance that the old buicks wiring shorted that the car somehow ignited on its own such thoughts were dashed when the second call came at another car was on fire a volvo wagon parked on a street halfway between the courthouse and civitan park fire trucks screamed back and forth across town with police escorts clearing the way the sirens were applauded by the mob at the park a mob that was growing larger as the night grew later but aside from underage drinking and possession of pot no crimes were being committed yet perhaps disturbing the peace but given the tension of the moment the police were not inclined to enter the park and break up the fun the crowd was in a belligerent mood fueled by the news of dontes death the statements of travis boyette the angry rap blasting from car stereos and some drugs and alcohol the police watched and pondered their options they huddled with the national guardsmen and plotted strategy the wrong move could provoke a response that was unpredictable primarily because the crowd had no real leader at that point and had no idea where the night would lead it every half hour or so some clown lit a string of firecrackers and for a split second the policemen and guardsmen froze and strained to tell if the noise was gunfire so far only firecrackers the third call was recorded at and it was the most ominous so far in fact when the police chief got the details he thought about leaving town himself at big louies honkytonk west of town the gravel parking lot was packed as usual for a thursday night the unofficial beginning of the weekend to kick things off louie offered a variety of drink specials all involving reduced prices and the bubbas responded with enthusiasm of the vehicles parked outside the cheap metal building virtually all were pickup trucks an even split between ford and chevrolet the arsonists picked one of each broke the windows tossed the cocktails and disappeared into the darkness a latecomer in a pickup thought he saw a coupla black boys running away crouching low very suspicious but he wasnt close and didnt see their faces in fact he wasnt even sure they were black when the bubbas stampeded outside and saw flames roaring out of both trucks they scrambled for their own a melee ensued a near demolition derby as they frantically tried to get away from the fires many of them left evidently no longer thirsty and anxious to get home lock the doors get the guns loaded every pickup at big louies had at least one gun under the seat or in the glove box many had hunting rifles in the window racks it was the wrong crowd to start a fight with you burn a mans pickup and hes ready for war chapter by eight oclock the drumsticks were gone too much booze had been consumed and most of koffees guests were anxious to get home and see how bad things were in town the television crews were darting around trying to keep up with the arsonists and the fires effectively ended the celebration by the lake drew kerber hung around stalling waiting for everyone to leave he opened another beer and said to paul koffee we need to talk they walked to the edge of the narrow dock as far away from the cabin as possible though no one else was there koffee also had a bottle of beer they leaned on the railing and looked at the water below them kerber spat sipped his beer and said this guy boyette does he worry you koffee appeared to look surprised or at least attempted to no but he obviously worries you a long slow pull on the beer and kerber said i grew up in denton and there were some boyettes in the neighborhood ted boyette was a good friend finished high school together then he joined the army and disappeared i heard he got into some trouble but i moved away ended up here and sort of forgot about him you know how it is with childhood friends you dont ever forget them but you dont ever see them either anyway in january and i remember the month because we had drumm locked up i was at the station and some of the other guys were laughing about a thug theyd caught in a stolen pickup they ran his record guys got three convictions for sexual assault a registered sex offender in three states and he was only in his midthirties the cops were wondering whats the record which pervert is registered in the most states someone asked his name someone else said t boyette i didnt say a word but i was curious as to whether it might be the kid from our neighborhood i checked his file saw his name was travis but i was still curious a couple of days later he was led into the courtroom for a quick appearance before the judge i didnt want him to see me because if it had been my old pal i didnt want to embarrass him the courtroom was busy it was easy to not be noticed but it wasnt him it was travis boyette the same guy who is in town right now i recognized him the second i saw him on televisionsame slick head same tattoo on the left side of his neck he was here paul in slone in jail at approximately the same time the girl disappeared koffee thought hard for a few seconds then said okay assume he was here that doesnt mean hes telling the truth about killing her what if he is telling the truth you cant be serious humor me paul what if what if boyette is telling the truth what if boyette really has the girls ring what if boyette takes them to the body what if paul help me here youre the lawyer im not believing this can we face charges for what how about murder are you drunk kerber ive had too much then sleep here dont drive why arent you in town with every other cop im a detective not a street cop and id like to keep my job paul hypothetically what happens if this boyette is telling the truth koffee drained his bottle then tossed it into the lake he lit a cigarette and blew a long trail of smoke nothing happens were immune i control the grand jury thus i control who gets prosecuted for what theres never been a case of a detective or a prosecutor facing charges for a bad conviction we are the system kerber we might get sued in a civil court but thats a long shot too plus were insured by the city so there stop worrying were teflon would i get fired no because that would harm you and the city in the civil suit but theyll probably offer you early retirement the city will take care of you so well be okay yes and please stop this will you kerber smiled breathed deeply and took another long drink just curious he said thats all im really not worried couldve fooled me they stared at the water for a while both lost in their thoughts but both thinking the same thing finally koffee said boyette was in jail here and out on parole from another state right right i think it was oklahoma maybe arkansas then how did he get away i dont remember everything but ill check the file in the morning seems as though he posted bond then disappeared i had nothing to do with the case and as soon as i realized it was a different boyette i forgot about him until today another gap in the conversation then koffee said just relax kerber you built a good case he got a fair trial and his guilt was affirmed by all the courts what else can we expect the system worked hell drew the boy confessed of course he did ive often wondered though what wouldve happened without the confession youre not worried about the confession are you oh no i played it by the book forget about it drew look its over really over its too late to secondguess anything we did the boy is on the way home in a box the slone airport was closed the pilot activated the landing lights by radio signal from his controls and the approach and touchdown were smooth they taxied to the small terminal and as soon as the props came to rest they hurried off the plane robbie thanked the pilot and promised to call him later the pilot passed along his condolences by the time they were in the van aaron had spoken with carlos and had a full report fires all over town he said theyre burning cars carlos says there are three television crews in the parking lot at the office they want to talk to you robbie and they want to see more of boyette why dont they burn the tv vans robbie asked are you gonna talk to them i dont know make em wait whats boyette doing watching television carlos says hes pissed off because no one listened to him and hes refusing to say anything else to the reporters if i attack him with a baseball bat will you please keep me from killing him no aaron said as they entered the city limits all four strained to see signs of the unrest aaron kept to the backstreets away from downtown and minutes later they arrived at the train station all the lights were on the parking lot was full and there were indeed three tv vans waiting by the time robbie got out the reporters were waiting for him he politely asked them where they were from and what they wanted one crew was from slone one from a station in dallas and one from tyler there were several newspaper reporters including one from houston robbie offered them a dealif he organized a small press conference outside on the platform and answered their questions would they then leave and not come back he reminded them that they were on his property and they could be asked to leave at any time they accepted his deal everything was pleasant what about travis boyette a reporter asked robbie said im not in charge of mr boyette i understand hes still inside and doesnt wish to say anything else ill speak with him see what he wants to do thank you mr flak ill be back in thirty minutes he said and climbed the steps keith aaron and martha followed emotions hit hard when they walked into the conference room and saw carlos bonnie sammie thomas kristi hinze fanta and fred pryor there were hugs and condolences and tears wheres boyette robbie asked fred pryor pointed to the closed door of a small office good keep him there lets gather around the conference table id like to describe what it was like while its fresh reverend schroeder might want to help because he was there he spent time with donte and watched him die keith was already in a chair against the wall drained fatigued and wiped out they looked at him in disbelief he nodded without a smile robbie took off his jacket and loosened his tie bonnie brought a tray of sandwiches and placed it in front of him aaron grabbed one as did martha keith waved them off hed lost his appetite when they were settled in robbie began by saying he was very brave but he expected a lastminute miracle i guess they all do like a thirdgrade teacher at story time robbie led them through the last hour of dontes life and when he finished they were all crying again rocks began flying some thrown by teenagers hiding behind groups of other teenagers and some thrown by persons unseen they landed on walter street where the police and the guardsmen maintained a casual line of defense the first injury was to a slone officer who took a rock in the teeth and went down hard much to the delight of the crowd the sight of a cop down inspired more rock throwing and civitan park was finally exploding a police sergeant made the decision to break up the crowd and with a bullhorn ordered everyone to disperse immediately or face arrest this provoked an angry response and the launching of more rocks and debris the crowd jeered at the police and soldiers spewing profanities and threats and showing no signs of obeying the order the police and soldiers with helmets and shields formed a wedge crossed the street and entered the park several students including trey glover the tailback and initial leader of the protest walked forward with their hands thrust out volunteering for arrest as trey was being handcuffed a rock bounced off the helmet of the officer arresting him the officer yelled and cursed then forgot about trey and began chasing the kid who threw the rock a few of the protesters scattered and ran through the streets but most fought on throwing whatever they could find the dugouts on one of the baseball fields were made of cinder block perfect for breaking into pieces and hurling at the men and women in uniform one student wrapped a string of firecrackers around a stick lit the fuse and tossed it into the wedge the explosions caused the cops and soldiers to break ranks and run for cover the mob roared from somewhere behind the wedge a molotov cocktail dropped from the sky and landed on the roof of an unmarked and unoccupied police car parked at the edge of walter street the flames spread quickly as the gasoline splashed over the vehicle this created another wave of delirious cheering and yelling from the crowd a tv van arrived as the action picked up the reporter a serious blonde who shouldve stuck to the weather scrambled out with a microphone and was met by an angry policeman who demanded that she get back in the van and get the hell out of there the van painted white with bold red and yellow lettering made an easy target and seconds after it slid to a stop it was being pelted with rocks and debris then a jagged piece of cinder block struck the reporter in the back of the head opening a wide gash and knocking her unconscious more cheers more obscenities lots of blood her cameraman dragged her to safety as the police called for an ambulance to add to the fun and frenzy smoke bombs were tossed at the police and soldiers and at that point the decision was made to respond with tear gas the first canisters were fired and panic swept through the crowd it began to break up with people running away fanning through the neighborhood on the streets around civitan park men were on their front porches listening to the chaos not far away watching for any sign of movement or trouble with the women and children safe inside they stood guard with their shotguns and rifles just waiting for a black face to appear when herman grist of benton street saw three young blacks walking down the middle of the street he fired two shotgun blasts into the air from his porch and yelled at the kids to get back to their part of town the kids began running away the blasts cut through the night a grave signal that vigilantes had entered the fray fortunately though grist did not fire again the crowd continued to disperse a few throwing rocks in retreat by pm the park had been secured and the police and soldiers walked through the debrisempty cans and bottles fastfood containers cigarette butts fireworks wrappers enough litter for a landfill the two dugouts were gone nothing left but metal benches the concession stand had been broken into but there was nothing to take in the wake of the tear gas several vehicles had been abandoned including trey glovers suv trey and a dozen others were already at the jail four had volunteered the rest had been caught several had been taken to the hospital because of the tear gas three policemen had been injured along with the reporter the acrid smell of the gas permeated the park a gray cloud from the smoke bombs hung not far above the ball fields the place resembled a battlefield without the casualties the breakup of the party meant that a thousand or so angry blacks were now moving around slone with no intention of going home and with no plans to do anything constructive the use of tear gas infuriated them they had been raised with the blackandwhite videos of the dogs in selma the fire hoses in birmingham and the tear gas in watts that epic struggle was a part of their heritage their dna a glorified chapter in their history and suddenly here they were on the streets protesting and fighting and being gassed just like their ancestors they had no intention of stopping the fight if the cops wanted to play dirty so be it the mayor harris rooney was monitoring the deteriorating condition of his little city from the police department which had become the command center he and the police chief joe radford had made the decision to scatter the crowd at civitan park and break things up and they both had agreed that tear gas should be used reports were now flooding in by radio and cell phone that the protesters were roaming in packs breaking windows yelling threats at passing motorists throwing rocks and debris all manner of hooligan behavior at he called the reverend johnny canty pastor of bethel african methodist church the two had met on tuesday when reverend canty had pleaded with the mayor to intervene with the governor and support a stay the mayor had declined he did not know the governor had no clout with him whatsoever and besides anyone begging for a reprieve was wasting his time with gill newton canty had warned mayor rooney of the potential for unrest if the execution of donte took place the mayor had been skeptical all skepticism had now been replaced by fear mrs canty answered the phone and explained that her husband was not home he was at the funeral home waiting for the drumm family to return she gave the mayor a cell phone number and reverend canty finally answered well good evening mayor he said softly in his rich preachers voice how are things tonight things are pretty exciting right now reverend how are you ive had better days were here at the funeral home waiting for the family to return with the body so im not doing too well right now what can i do for you you were right about the unrest reverend i didnt believe you and im sorry i should have listened and i didnt but things seem to be going from bad to worse weve had eight fires i think a dozen arrests half a dozen injuries and theres no reason to believe those numbers will not go up the crowd at civitan park has been dispersed but the crowd at washington park is growing by the minute i wouldnt be surprised if someone doesnt get killed very soon theres already been a killing mayor im waiting on the body im sorry whats the purpose of this call mayor you are a wellregarded leader in your community you are the drumms pastor i ask you to go to washington park and appeal for calm they will listen to you this violence and unrest serves no purpose i have one question for you mayor did your police use tear gas on those kids in civitan park i heard that rumor only minutes ago well yes it was considered necessary no it wasnt necessary and it was a monumental mistake by gassing our children the police made a bad situation worse dont expect me to go rushing in to repair your damage good night the line was dead robbie with aaron rey on one side and fred pryor on the other stood before the mikes and cameras and answered questions he explained that travis boyette was still in the building and did not wish to speak to anyone one reporter asked if he could go inside and interview boyette only if you want to get arrested and perhaps shot was robbies sharp reply stay away from the building they asked about dontes last meal visit statement and so on who were the witnesses any contact with the victims family useless questions in robbies opinion but then the whole world seemed worthless at that point after twenty minutes he thanked them they thanked him he asked them to leave and not come back in the event boyette changed his mind and wanted to talk robbie would give him a phone and a number keith watched the press conference from a dark spot on the platform outside the office but under its veranda he was on the phone with dana recounting the events of the day trying to stay awake when she suddenly said that robbie flak was on the screen she was watching the cable news and there he was live from slone texas im about fifty feet behind him in the shadows keith said voice lower he looks tired she said tired and maybe a bit crazy both the fatigue comes and goes but i suspect hes always a little crazy he looks like a wild man certified but theres a sweet man under the surface wheres boyette hes in a room inside the building with a television and some food he prefers not to come out and thats a good thing these people knew donte and loved him boyette has no friends around here a few minutes ago they showed the fires and talked to the mayor he seemed a bit jumpy are you safe keith sure i can hear sirens in the distance but nothing close please be careful dont worry im fine youre not fine youre a wreck i can tell get some sleep when are you coming home i plan to leave here in the morning what about boyette is he coming back we have not had that conversation chapter slone had three funeral homes two for the whites upper and lower and one for the blacks integration had been achieved in some important areas of lifeschools politics employment and commercial activity but in other areas integration would never occur because neither race really wanted it sunday worship was segregated by choice a few blacks attended the larger white churches in town and they were welcome even fewer whites could be found in black churches where they were treated like everyone else but the vast majority stuck with their own kind and bigotry had little to do with it it was more a matter of tradition and preference the whites preferred an orderly more subdued ritual on sunday morning opening prayer at am followed by some beautiful music then a nice crisp sermon out by noon and certainly no later than because by then they were starving in the black churches time was not as important the spirit flowed more freely and made for a more spontaneous style of worship the crack of noon was never heard lunch was often on the grounds whenever with no one in a hurry to leave and dying was so different there was never a hurry to bury a black person while the whites usually wanted it done within three days max the black funeral home was busier with more visitors longer wakes longer goodbyes lamb amp son had been providing dignified service in its part of town for decades when its hearse arrived a few minutes after pm there was a solemn crowd waiting on the lawn in front of the small chapel the mourners were silent with heads down faces somber they watched as hubert and alvin opened the rear door of the hearse then gave directions to the pallbearerseight friends of dontes most of whom had once played football for the slone warriors they carried the casket a few feet following hubert lamb then disappeared through a side door the funeral home was closed and would not open until the following morning when donte was properly prepared and ready to be viewed sirens wailed in the distance the air was thick tense heavy with smoke and fear those who were not making trouble were certainly expecting it a car pulled into the parking lot and parked next to the hearse roberta drumm with marvin cedric and andrea got out and moved slowly to the front entrance where they greeted their friends there were hugs and whispers and tears the family eventually went inside but the friends did not leave another car turned in and parked near the hearse it was robbie with aaron rey and they slipped past the crowd and entered through the side door in the front parlor robbie met the family they sat together and embraced and cried as if they had not seen each other in months only a few hours earlier they had watched donte die but that time and place were so distant now during the drive back from huntsville the drumm family had listened to the radio and talked on cell phones they quizzed robbie about this boyette character and robbie gave all the details he had they knew things were grim in slone and expected to get worse and roberta repeatedly said she wanted the violence to stop its not within your power robbie assured her its out of control hubert lamb entered the parlor and said roberta donte is ready she entered the prep room alone closed the door behind her and locked it her beautiful boy was lying on a narrow table one covered in white sheets for the moment he was dressed in the same clothes they had killed him incheap white shirt worn khakis bargain shoescourtesy of the state of texas she gently placed her hands on his cheeks and kissed him on the facethe forehead the lips the nose the chinshe kissed him and kissed him as her tears dropped like rain she had not touched him in eight years the last embrace a quick stolen hug as they led him out of the courtroom the day they sentenced him to die and as she wept now she remembered the unspeakable agony of watching him hauled away the leg chains rattling the fat deputies crowding around him as if he just might kill someone else the hard smug faces of the prosecutors the jurors and the judge proud of their work i love you momma he called over his shoulder then they shoved him through a door and he was gone his skin wasnt cold nor was it warm she touched the small scar under his chin a small consolation prize from a neighborhood rock fight hed lost when he was eight years old other rock fights followed he had been a tough kid made tougher by his older brother cedric who teased him constantly a tough kid but a sweet boy she touched the lobe of his right ear the tiny hole barely visible he bought an earring when he was fifteen a small fake diamond and wore it when he was out with his friends he hid it from his father though riley would have chastised him her beautiful boy lying there so peaceful and so healthy dead but not diseased dead but not injured dead but not maimed she examined his arms and could find no trace of the needle pricks used for the injections there was no evidence of the killing nothing external he seemed to be resting and waiting for the next drug to be administered one that would gently wake him and allow him to go home with his mother his legs were straight his arms were by his sides hubert lamb said the stiffening would begin soon so she had to get busy from her purse she removed a tissue to wipe her cheeks and a pair of scissors to cut away the prison garb she could have unbuttoned the shirt but instead she cut it down the front then along the sleeves removing it piece by piece and dropping the scraps on the floor tears still ran down her cheeks but she was humming now an old gospel song take my hand precious lord she paused to rub his flat stomach and his soft chest and shoulders and she marveled at how much hed shrunk in prison the fierce athlete was gone replaced by the broken prisoner he had died slowly in prison she unbuckled the cheap canvas belt and for good measure cut it in half and dropped it on the pile tomorrow when she was alone she planned to burn the prison scraps in her backyard in a private ceremony that only she would attend she unlaced the dreadful shoes removed them and pulled off the white cotton socks she touched the scars along his left ankle permanent reminders of the injury that ended his football career she cut the khakis carefully up the inseams and delicately through the crotch of her three boys cedric had been the dresser the clotheshorse who would work two parttime jobs so he could buy better labels donte preferred jeans and pullovers and looked good in anything anything but the jumpsuits they wore in prison she clipped away dropping the pieces of khaki onto the pile she paused occasionally to wipe her cheeks with the back of a hand but she had to hurry the body was stiffening she stepped to a sink and turned on the faucet the boxer shorts were white and oversized she snipped away like a seamstress and removed them the pile was complete he was naked leaving the world the same way he had entered it she poured liquid soap into the sink splashed the water adjusted the temperature then turned off the faucet she dipped a cloth and began bathing her son she rubbed his legs then dried them quickly with a small towel she washed his genitals and wondered how many grandchildren he would have fathered he loved the girls and they loved him she gently washed his chest and arms neck and face drying him as she went when the bath was finished she moved to the last and most difficult part of her preparation before the family left for huntsville cedric stopped by the funeral home with a new suit roberta had purchased and altered it was hanging on a wall along with a new white shirt and a handsome gold tie she assumed the shirt and coat would be the most difficult the pants and shoes the easiest to finesse and she was right his arms would not bend now and she carefully threaded the shirt over his right arm then gently maneuvered donte onto his left side she brought the shirt around laid him back down wiggled it over his left arm and quickly buttoned it she did the same with the coat a dark gray wool blend and when she wrapped it around him she paused for a second to kiss the side of his face his legs were stiff she methodically inched upward a pair of black cotton boxers size large and too big she should have bought mediums the pants took a while she tugged gently from side to side straining to lift donte at his midsection for a moment to complete the task when the pants were in place at the waist she tucked in the shirttail zipped the pants then fished a belt through the loops and buckled it his feet were stiff his ankles wouldnt bend and the socks were more of a challenge than she had expected the shoes were the black leather laceups donte had worn to church as a teenager the shoes had been taken from his closet one hed shared with marvin when they were boys donte had assumed full ownership when his brother got married and for nine years now it had remained virtually untouched roberta cleaned it dusted the clothing killed the insects arranged things just so hours earlier when she had removed the shoes she had stood in the closet door for a long time wondering what now for years after he was sent away she lived with the fervent belief that donte would one day be freed one glorious day their nightmare would end and he would come home he would sleep in his bed eat his mothers cooking nap on the sofa and need the things in his closet one day a judge or a lawyer or someone toiling in the impenetrable maze of the judicial system would discover the truth the phone call from heaven would arrive and they would celebrate but the appeals ran their course no miracles occurred the years dragged on and her hope and the hopes of many others slowly faded the shirts and jeans and sweaters and shoes in his closet would never be used again and she wondered what to do with them roberta told herself to worry about it later she laced his shoes adjusted his socks pulled down the cuffs of his pants now that he was dressed she could relax cedric had tied the necktie into a perfect knot and she looped it over dontes head and managed to fit it under his collar she tightened the knot and fiddled with the tie until it was perfect she adjusted here and there flattened a few wrinkles in the pants then she took a step back and admired her work what a handsome young man gray suit white shirt gold tie she had chosen well she leaned over and kissed him again get up donte and lets go to church youll find a wife there and have ten children hurry now theres so much youve missed please lets go show you off in your fine new outfit hurry now she was aware of the grislier aspects of death the embalming and fluids and such and she knew that in a few hours mr lamb and his son would be warming the body removing the clothes and going about their unspeakable tasks thats why she wanted these few precious moments with her son while he was still whole and intact tomorrow she would plan the funeral and tend to the other details she would be strong and brave now though she wanted to be alone with her child to grieve and ache and cry without restraint as any mother would part three the exoneration chapter before sunrise friday a short caravan of vehicles departed the town and traveled east the lead vehicle was robbies customized van with aaron rey at the wheel and carlos riding shotgun robbie sat in his favorite chair sipped coffee glanced through the newspapers and generally ignored martha handler who was gulping coffee and scribbling notes and trying to wake up behind them was the subaru with keith driving and boyette gripping his cane and staring into the darkness behind the subaru was a threequarterton pickup truck with fred pryor at the wheel his passengers were two private security guards who had worked off and on during the past few days to protect robbies law office and his home the truck was freds and it carried shovels flashlights and other equipment behind the truck was another van white and unmarked owned by the tv station in slone and driven by a news director named bryan day nicknamed hairspray day for obvious reasons with day was a cameraman called buck the four vehicles had gathered in the long driveway of robbies home at am and managed to weave through side streets and back roads for a stealthy and successful getaway the office had received enough phone calls and emails to convince robbie that certain people were curious about where he might be headed on friday hed slept five hours and it took a pill to achieve that he was beyond the point of exhaustion but there was so much left to do after leaving lamb amp son and briefly seeing the body he took his entourage home where dede managed to produce enough food to feed everyone keith and boyette slept on sofas in the basement while a maid washed and ironed their clothes everyone was exhausted but no one had trouble jumping out of bed carlos was on his cell phone listening more than talking and when the conversation was over he announced that was my man at the radio station forty or so arrests two dozen injuries but no fatalities which is a miracle they have sealed off most of downtown and things have settled down for the moment lots of fires too many to count fire trucks here from paris tyler other places at least three police cars have been hit with molotov cocktails which has become the weapon of choice they torched the press box at the football field and its still burning most of the fires are in empty buildings no homes yet rumor is that the governor is sending in more guardsmen nothing confirmed though and what happens if we find the body martha asked robbie shook his head and thought for a second then last night was childs play they had debated the various combinations and arrangements for the trip to make sure boyette didnt vanish robbie wanted him secured in his van under the watchful eye of aaron rey and fred pryor but he just couldnt stomach the thought of being confined in a small place for several hours with the creep keith was adamant that he was driving his subaru primarily because he was determined to be in topeka by late friday afternoon with or without boyette like robbie he had no desire to sit near boyette but since he had done it once he assured robbie that he could do it again fred pryor had suggested they toss boyette in the rear seat of the club cab of his truck and keep guns on him among robbies team there was a yearning for retribution and if boyette did indeed lead them to the body fred pryor and aaron rey could easily be convinced to take him somewhere behind the trees and put him out of his misery keith sensed this and they respected his presence there would be no violence the inclusion of bryan day had been complicated robbie trusted no reporter period however if they found what they were looking for it would need to be properly recorded and by someone outside his circle of course day had been eager to tag along but he had been forced to agree to a list of firm conditions that basically prevented him from reporting anything until so directed by robbie flak if he tried he and buck the cameraman would in all likelihood be either beaten or shot or both day and buck understood that the stakes were high and the rules would be followed because day was the stations news director he was able to slip away without leaving clues at the office can we talk martha asked they had been on the road for half an hour and there were hints of orange in the sky ahead of them no robbie said its been almost twelve hours since he died what are you thinking im fried martha my brain is not working there are no thoughts what did you think when you saw his body its a sick world when we kill people because we assume we have the right to kill them i thought he looked great this handsome young man lying there asleep no visible injuries no signs of a struggle put down like an old dog by bigots and idiots too lazy and too stupid to realize what theyre doing you know what im really thinking about martha tell me ill tell you im thinking about vermont cool summers no humidity no executions a civilized place a cabin on a lake i can learn to shovel snow if i sell everything and close my firm maybe i can net a million ill retire to vermont and write a book about what i have no idea no one believes that robbie youll never leave you might take some time off catch your breath but before long youll find another case and get mad and file a lawsuit or ten youll be doing that until youre eighty and theyll carry you out of the station on a stretcher ill never see eighty im fiftytwo now and i feel like a geezer youll be suing people when youre eighty i dont know i do i know where your heart is right now my heart is broken and im ready to quit a halfass lawyer couldve saved donte and what could this halfass lawyer have done differently robbie showed her both palms and said not now martha please in the car behind them the first words were spoken when boyette said did you really watch the execution keith took a sip of coffee and waited awhile yes i did it wasnt planned it just happened at the last second i didnt want to watch it do you wish you hadnt thats a very good question travis thank you on the one hand i wish i had not watched a man die especially a man who claimed to be innocent he is innocent or was i tried to pray with him but he refused he said he doesnt believe in god though he once did as a minister its very difficult to be with someone who is facing death and does not believe in god or christ or heaven ive stood at hospital beds and watched my members die and its always comforting to know that their souls are bound for a glorious hereafter not so with donte nor with me on the other hand i saw something in the death chamber that should be seen by everyone why hide what we are doing so you would watch another one i didnt say that travis it was a question keith could not answer he was struggling with his first execution he couldnt imagine the next one just hours earlier seconds before hed finally fallen asleep the image of donte strapped to the deathbed came into focus and keith ran through it again in slow motion he remembered staring at dontes chest as it lifted slightly then fell lifted then fell up and down barely noticeable and then it stopped he had just watched a man exhale for the final time keith knew the image would never go away the sky was lighter to the east they crossed into oklahoma boyette said i guess thats my last trip to texas keith could not think of a response the governors helicopter touched down at am since the media had received plenty of advance notice and were waiting anxiously there was considerable debate among the governor and barry and wayne about the details of the landing en route they finally settled on the parking lot next to the football field the media were informed and scrambled to slone high school for this latebreaking development the press box was badly damaged charred and smoldering firemen were still on the scene cleaning up when gill newton emerged from his chopper he was met by state police colonels from the guard and a few carefully selected and weary firefighters he shook their hands warmly as if they were marines returning from combat barry and wayne were quick to survey the surroundings and they organized the press conference so that the backdrop would be the football field and most important the burnedout press box the governor was wearing jeans cowboy boots no tie and a windbreakera real working man with a troubled face but an enthusiastic spirit he faced the cameras and reporters he condemned the violence and unrest he promised to protect the citizens of slone he announced he was calling in more guardsmen and would mobilize the entire texas national guard if need be he talked about justice texas style he engaged in a bit of racebaiting by calling on black leaders to rein in the hooligans he said nothing of the sort about white troublemakers he ranted and raved and when he was finished he ducked away from the microphones without taking questions neither he nor barry and wayne wanted to deal with the boyette matter for an hour he buzzed around slone in a patrol car stopping to drink coffee with soldiers and policemen and to chat with citizens and to survey with a grim and pained face the ruins of the first baptist church and all the while the cameras were rolling recording it all for the glory of the moment but also for future campaigns after five hours the caravan finally stopped at a country store north of neosho missouri twenty miles south of joplin after a restroom break and more coffee they headed north now with the subaru in the lead and the other vehicles close behind boyette was visibly nervous the tic more active his fingers thumping the cane were getting close to the turnoff he said its to the left they were on highway a busy twolane road in newton county they turned left at the bottom of a hill next to a gas station this looks right travis kept saying obviously anxious about where he was taking them they were on a county road with bridges over small creeks sharp curves steep hills most of the homes were trailers with an occasional square redbrick from the s this looks right boyette said and you lived around here travis yep right up here he nodded and when he did so he began rubbing his temples please keith thought not another seizure not at this moment they stopped at an intersection in the middle of a small settlement keep going straight boyette said past a shopping center with a grocery hair salon video rental the parking lot was gravel this looks right he said again keith had questions but he said little was nicole still alive travis when you drove through here or had you already taken her life what were you thinking travis when you drove through here nine years ago with that poor girl bound and gagged and bruised traumatized after a long weekend of sexual assault they turned to the left onto another road that was paved but narrower and drove a mile before they passed a dwelling old man deweese had a store up here travis said ill bet its gone now he was ninety years old when i was a kid they stopped at a stop sign in front of deweeses country market i robbed that place once travis said couldnt have been more than ten crawled through a window hated the old bastard keep going straight keith did as he was told and said nothing this was gravel last time i was here boyette said as if recalling a pleasant boyhood memory and when was that keith asked i dont know pastor my last visit to see nicole you sick puppy keith thought the road had sharp turns so sharp that at times keith thought they would loop back and meet themselves the two vans and the pickup stayed close behind look for a little creek with a wooden bridge boyette said this looks right a hundred yards past the bridge boyette said slow down now were going ten miles an hour travis travis was looking to their left where thick underbrush and weeds lined the road theres a gravel road here somewhere he said slower the caravan was almost bumpertobumper in the van robbie said come on travis you sick little weasel dont make liars out of us keith turned left onto a shaded gravel road with oaks and elms entangled above it the trail was narrow and dark like a tunnel this is it boyette said relieved for the moment this road sort of follows the creek for a while theres a camping area down here on the right or at least there was keith checked his odometer they went miles into the near darkness with the creek showing up occasionally there was no traffic no room for traffic and no sign of human life anywhere in the vicinity the camping area was just an open space with room for a few tents and cars and it appeared to have been forgotten the weeds were kneehigh two wooden picnic tables were broken and turned on their sides we camped here when i was a kid boyette said keith almost felt sorry for him he was trying to remember something pleasant and normal from his wretched childhood i think we should stop here boyette said ill explain the four vehicles stopped and everyone gathered in front of the subaru boyette used his cane as a pointer and said theres a dirt trail that goes up that hill you cant see the trail from here but its here or it used to be only the truck can get up there the other vehicles should stay here how far up there robbie asked i didnt check the odometer but id say a quarter of a mile and what will we find when we get there boyette robbie asked boyette leaned on his cane and studied the weeds at his feet thats where the grave is mr flak thats where youll find nicole tell us about the grave robbie pressed on shes buried in a metal box a large toolbox i took from the construction site where i worked the top of the box is two feet under the ground its been nine years so the ground is thick with vegetation it will be difficult to locate but i think i can get close this is all coming back to me now now that im here they discussed the logistics and decided that carlos martha handler day and buck and one of the security guards armed would stay at the campsite the rest would pile into freds pickup and assault the hill with a video camera one last thing boyette said years ago this property was known as roops mountain owned by the roop family pretty tough folks they took a dim view of trespassers and hunters and they were notorious for running off campers thats one reason i picked this place i knew there wouldnt be much traffic a pause as boyette grimaced and rubbed his temples anyway there were a lot of roops so i figure its still in the family if we bump into someone we better be prepared for trouble where do they live robbie asked somewhat nervously boyette waved his cane in another direction a good ways off i dont think they will hear or see us lets go robbie said what had begun on monday morning with a seemingly routine pastoral conference now came down to thiskeith was riding in the rear of a pickup truck bouncing up the side of roops mountain which was nothing more than a mediumsize hill dense with kudzu and poison ivy and thick woods facing a real chance of armed conflict with surly landowners no doubt high on meth in the final push to determine whether travis boyette was in fact telling the truth if they did not find nicoles remains boyette was a fraud keith was a fool and texas had just executed the right person in all likelihood if however they found the body then well keith could not comprehend what would happen next certainty had become a fuzzy concept but he was reasonably certain that he would be home sometime that night he couldnt begin to imagine what would happen in texas but he was sure he wouldnt be there he would watch it all on television from a safe distance he was fairly certain events down there would be sensational and probably historic boyette was in the front seat rubbing his head and straining to see something familiar he pointed to his righthe was sure the grave was to the right of the trailand said this might be familiar the area was a dense patch of weeds and saplings they stopped got out and grabbed two metal detectors for fifteen minutes they scoured the thick undergrowth looking for clues and waiting for the detectors to make their noise boyette limped along whacking weeds with his cane followed by keith and watched by everyone look for an old tire a tractor tire boyette said more than once but there was no tire and no noise from the detectors they retook their positions in the truck and moved slowly onward inching up the incline on a logging trail that gave no indication of having been used in decades strike one the trail disappeared and for twenty yards fred pryor inched the truck forward through vegetation flinching as it was scraped by branches and vines those in the rear of the truck ducked for cover as limbs whipped about just as fred was about to stop the trail appeared again vaguely and boyette said keep going then the trail split fred stopped as boyette studied the fork and shook his head he doesnt have a clue fred said to himself in the rear robbie looked at keith and shook his head over there boyette said motioning to his right and fred followed his direction the woods became thicker the trees younger and closer together like a bloodhound boyette raised his hand and pointed and fred pryor turned off the ignition the search party fanned out looking for an old tractor tire looking for anything a beer can aroused one of the metal detectors and for a few seconds the tension spiked a small airplane flew low overhead and everyone froze as if someone were watching robbie said boyette do you remember if the grave is under the trees or in an open area the question seemed reasonable boyette replied i think it was more out in the open but the trees have grown in nine years great robbie mumbled then continued stomping around crushing weeds gawking at the ground as if the perfect clue were just one step away after half an hour boyette said this is not it lets move on strike two keith crouched in the back of the truck and exchanged glances with robbie both seemed to say we shouldve known better but neither spoke no one spoke because there was absolutely nothing to say there were a thousand thoughts the road turned and when it straightened boyette pointed again this is it he said as he yanked open the door before the engine was turned off he launched himself into a clearing of weeds waisthigh as the others scrambled to follow keith took a few steps and tripped over something falling hard as he scrambled to his feet brushing off bugs and brush he realized what had tripped him the remains of a tractor tire virtually buried in vegetation heres a tire he announced and the others stopped moving boyette was only a few feet away get the metal detectors he said fred pryor had one and within seconds it was clicking and buzzing giving all indications of being highly agitated aaron rey produced two shovels the terrain was strewn with rocks but the soil was soft and moist after ten minutes of furious digging fred pryors shovel struck what clearly sounded like metal lets stop for a second robbie said both fred and aaron needed a break all right boyette robbie said tell us what we are about to find the tic the pause then its a metal box used for hydraulic tools heavy as hell almost ruined my back dragging the damned thing over here its orange in color with the name of the company r s mcguire and sons fort smith arkansas painted on the front it opens from the top and inside nothing but bones by now its been nine years he spoke with an air of authority as if this wasnt his first hidden grave site her clothing was wadded together and placed next to her head theres a belt around her neck should be intact his voice trailed off as if this were somehow painful for him there was a pause while the others glanced at each other then travis cleared his throat and continued in her clothing we should find her drivers license and a credit card i didnt want to get caught with them describe the belt robbie said the security guard handed robbie a video camera black two inches wide with a round silver buckle it is the murder weapon the digging continued as robbie captured it on video its about five feet long boyette said pointing indicating an outline for the box with its shape clear each shovelful of dirt revealed more it was indeed orange deeper the name r s mcguire and sons fort smith arkansas became visible thats enough robbie said and the digging stopped aaron rey and fred pryor were sweating and breathing heavily we wont be removing it the toolbox presented an obvious challenge one that had gradually become more and more evident the top lid was secured by a latch and the latch was secured by a combination lock the inexpensive kind found in every hardware store fred did not have the proper tools to cut the lock but there was little doubt that they would somehow snap it free after coming this far they would not be denied a look inside the six men huddled close together and gawked at the orange toolbox and the combination lock robbie said so travis whats the combination travis actually smiled as though finally he was about to be vindicated he lowered himself to the edge of the grave touched the box as if it were an altar then gently took the lock and shook dirt from it he turned the dial a few times to clear the code then slowly turned to the right to then back to the left to then to the right to and finally back to the left to he hesitated and lowered his head as if to hear something then he pulled sharply there was a soft click and the lock was open robbie was filming from five feet away keith couldnt suppress a grin in spite of where he was and what he was doing dont open it robbie said pryor hustled to the truck and returned with a package he passed out sanitary gloves and masks and when everyone had put them on robbie handed him the camera and told him to start filming he instructed aaron to step down and slowly open the lid he did so there was no corpse only bones the skeletal remains of someone nicole they assumed her hands and fingers were laced together below her ribs but her feet were near her knees as if boyette had been forced to fold her to fit her in the toolbox her skull was intact but a molar was missing shed had perfect teeth they knew that from the photographs around the skull there were strands of long blond hair between the skull and the shoulder there was a length of black leather the belt they assumed next to the skull in the corner of the box there appeared to be clothing keith closed his eyes and said a prayer robbie closed his eyes and cursed the world boyette stepped back and sat on the edge of the tractor tire in the weeds and began rubbing his head with fred filming robbie directed aaron to gently remove the roll of clothing the articles were intact though frayed along some of the edges and stained in places a blouse blue and yellow with some type of fringe and a large ugly hole made by either insects or decaying flesh a short white skirt badly stained brown sandals matching bra and panties dark blue and two plastic cards one her drivers license and one a mastercard nicoles things were placed neatly on the side of her grave boyette returned to the truck where he sat in the front seat and massaged his head for ten minutes robbie gave orders and made plans dozens of photographs were taken but nothing else was touched it was a crime scene now and the local authorities would take charge aaron and the security guard stayed behind while the others retreated down roops mountain chapter by am the parking lot at lamb amp son funeral home was full and cars lined both sides of the street the mourners dressed in their sunday best formed a line that began at the front door and ran three and four abreast through the small lawn down the street and around the corner they were sad and angry tired and anxious and uncertain about what was happening to them and their quiet town the sirens fireworks gunshots and urgent voices from the street had finally subsided not long before sunrise allowing a few hours of rest but no one expected the streets to return to normal on friday or over the weekend they had seen the eerie face of travis boyette on television and they had heard his poisonous confession they believed him because they had always believed donte so much more of the story had yet to be told and if boyette really had killed the girl then someone would pay a heavy price the slone police department had eight black officers and all eight volunteered for the assignment though most had not slept in hours they were determined to pay tribute they secured the street in front of the funeral home directed traffic and most important kept the reporters at bay there was a pack of them all neatly cordoned off and barricaded a block away when hubert lamb unlocked the front door he greeted the first wave of mourners and asked them to sign the register the crowd began to move slowly in no hurry it would take a week to bury donte and there would be plenty of time to pay proper respects he was on display in the main parlor his casket open and draped with flowers his senior class photo had been enlarged and sat on a tripod at the foot of his casketan eighteenyearold in a coat and tie a handsome face the portrait had been taken a month before he was arrested he was smiling still dreaming of playing football his eyes were full of expectation and ambition his family stood near the casket where they had been for the past hour touching him weeping trying to be strong for their guests at the campsite robbie described the scene to carlos and the others bryan day wanted to get to the grave immediately and record everything before the police arrived but robbie wasnt so sure they argued though both knew robbie would make the decision fred pryor was on his cell phone trying to locate the sheriff of newton county martha handler was talking to aaron on her cell phone and taking notes suddenly there was a shriek an anguished cry as boyette fell to the ground and began trembling violently keith knelt over him and the others gathered to watch helplessly quizzical looks were exchanged after a minute or so the seizure seemed to pass and the shaking and jerking subsided boyette clutched his head and whimpered in pain then he seemed to die his body went limp and was perfectly still keith waited then touched his shoulder and said hey travis can you hear me evidently travis could not there was no response keith stood and said he usually blacks out for a few minutes lets put him out of his misery robbie said one quick pop to the head theres a grave not far from here thats about to be empty come on robbie keith said the others seemed to like robbies idea they backed away and were soon occupied with other matters five minutes passed boyette had not moved keith knelt down and checked his pulse it was steady but faint a few minutes later keith said robbie i think this is serious hes unconscious im not a brain surgeon keith what do you want me to do he needs attention he needs a funeral keith why dont you take him back to kansas and bury him keith stood and walked a few steps to where robbie was standing he said thats a little harsh dont you think im sorry keith theres a lot happening right now in case you havent noticed boyettes health is not one of my priorities we cant just let him die out here why not hes practically dead anyway right boyette grunted then shook from head to toe as if an aftershock were rumbling through then he was still again keith swallowed hard and said he needs a doctor great go find one minutes dragged by and boyette was not responsive the others didnt care and keith almost persuaded himself to get in his car and leave alone but he could not bring himself to ignore a dying man the security guard helped keith load boyette into the rear seat of the subaru fred pryor walked from the direction of the creek and said that was the sheriff i finally got him finally convinced him that were for real and that weve found a dead body in his jurisdiction hes on his way as keith was opening his car door robbie approached him and said call me when you get to a hospital and keep an eye on boyette im sure the authorities here will want to talk to him theres no open investigation at this point but that could change quickly especially if boyette admits he killed the girl in this state his pulse is almost gone the security guard reported from the rear seat im not planning on standing guard robbie keith said im done im outta here ill drop him off at a hospital god knows where and then hustle back to kansas you have our cell numbers just keep us posted as soon as the sheriff sees the grave im sure hell send someone to see boyette the two shook hands not sure if they would see each other again death binds people in odd ways and they felt as though they had known each other for years as the subaru disappeared into the woods robbie checked his watch it had taken about six hours to drive from slone and find the body if travis boyette had not delayed donte drumm would be alive and on his way to a quick exoneration he spat on the ground and quietly wished boyette a slow and painful death during the fortyfiveminute drive from the campsite complete with at least four stops to ask for directions boyette had not moved and had not uttered a sound he still appeared to be dead at the emergency room entrance keith told a doctor about boyettes tumor but little else the doctor was curious as to why a minister from kansas was traveling through joplin with a gravely ill man who was neither a relative nor a member of his congregation keith assured him it was a very long story one he would happily tell when they had the time both knew they would never have the time and the story would never be told they placed boyette on a stretcher with his cane and rolled him down the hall for examination keith watched him disappear behind swinging doors and found a seat in the waiting area he called dana to check in his wife had received his updates with a growing sense of disbelief one shocker after another and she seemed to be numb to anything new fine keith yes keith sure keith please come home keith he called robbie and told him where they were at that moment boyette was alive and being examined robbie was still waiting for the sheriff to arrive at the site he was anxious to hand over the crime scene to the professionals though he knew that would take time keith called matthew burns and when matthew answered keith began with a happy well good morning matt im now in missouri where an hour ago we opened the grave and saw the remains of nicole yarber top that for a friday morning so what else is new what did she look like all bones positive id though boyette is telling the truth they executed the wrong man its unbelievable matt when are you coming home ill be there for dinner danas freaking out so i wont be long we need to meet first thing in the morning ive watched the coverage nonstop and there hasnt been a word about you maybe youve slid under the radar we gotta talk wheres boyette in a hospital in joplin dying i think im with him leave him keith maybe hell die let someone else worry about him just get in your car and haul ass thats my plan ill hang around here until i hear something then im on the road kansas is just minutes away an hour passed robbie called keith with the news that the sheriff had arrived and roops mountain was now crawling with police two state policemen were on their way to the hospital to secure mr boyette keith agreed to wait for them then he was leaving thanks keith for everything robbie said it wasnt enough no but what you did took courage you tried thats all you could do lets keep in touch the state troopers weshler and giles were both sergeants and after terse introductions they asked keith if he would fill in some gaps sure why not what else was there to do in an er waiting room it was almost pm and they bought sandwiches from a machine and found a table giles took notes and weshler handled most of the questions keith began with monday morning and hit the high points of this rather unusual week as he told his story they seemed to doubt him at times they had not been following the drumm case but when boyette went public with his claim of guilt and mentioned the body being buried near joplin phones started ringing they tuned in and they had seen boyettes face and performance several times now that a body had been found they were smack in the middle of a growing story a doctor interrupted them he explained that boyette was stable and resting his vital signs were near normal they had xrayed his head and confirmed the presence of an eggsize tumor the hospital needed to contact a family member and keith tried to describe what little he knew about boyettes relatives theres a brother in prison in illinois thats all i know keith said well the doctor said scratching his jaw how long do you want us to keep him how long should he be kept overnight but beyond that im not sure what we can do for him he doesnt belong to me doc keith said im just driving him around and this is part of the very long story both giles and weshler nodded keith suggested the doctor contact the doctors at st francis hospital in topeka and perhaps the little group could devise a plan for dealing with travis boyette where is he now weshler asked hes in a small ward on the third floor the doctor said could we see him not now he needs to rest then could we station ourselves outside the ward giles said we anticipate this man being charged with murder and we have orders to secure him hes not going anywhere weshler bristled at this and the doctor sensed the futility of arguing follow me he said as they began to walk away keith said hey fellas im free to go right weshler looked at giles and giles studied weshler then both looked at the doctor weshler said sure why not hes all yours keith said already backing away he left through the er entrance and jogged to his car in a nearby parking garage he found in his dwindling cash reserves paid the attendant and gunned the subaru onto the street free at last he said to himself it was exhilarating to glance over at the empty seat and know that he with luck would never again be near travis boyette weshler and giles were given folding chairs and took their positions in the hallway by the door to ward they called their supervisor and reported on boyettes status they found some magazines and began killing time through the door there were six beds each separated by flimsy curtains all occupied by people suffering from serious afflictions at the far end there was a large window that overlooked a vacant lot and next to the window was a door the janitors used on occasion the doctor returned spoke to the troopers then stepped inside for a quick check on boyette when he pulled the curtain by bed he froze in disbelief the ivs were dangling the bed was neatly made with a black walking cane across it boyette was gone chapter robbie flak and his little team stood by and watched the circus for two hours not long after the sheriff arrived and saw that there was indeed a grave site roops mountain attracted every cop within fifty miles local deputies state troopers the county coroner investigators from the missouri state highway patrol and finally a crime scene expert radios squawked men yelled a helicopter hovered overhead when the news arrived that boyette had vanished cops cursed his name as if they had known him forever robbie called keiths cell phone and passed along the news keith explained what had happened at the hospital he could not imagine boyette being physically able to go far they agreed that he would be caught and soon by pm robbie was tired of the scene he had told his story and answered a thousand questions from the investigators there was nothing left to do they had found nicole yarber and they were ready to return to slone and face a multitude of issues bryan day had enough footage for a miniseries but would be forced to sit on it for a few hours robbie informed the sheriff that they were leaving the caravan minus the subaru worked its way through the traffic until it was back on the highway and headed south carlos emailed dozens of photographs to the office as well as the video a presentation was being put together can we talk martha handler asked after a few minutes on the road no robbie answered you talked to the police whats next they will keep the remains in the toolbox and move it all to a satellite crime lab in joplin they will do what they do and well see what will they look for well first they will attempt to identify the body using dental records that should be easy probably take a few hours we may hear something tonight they have her dental records i gave them a set before dontes trial the prosecution dumped several boxes of discovery on us a week before we picked the jury not surprisingly the prosecution screwed up and in one file there was a set of xrays of nicoles teeth several sets were floating around during the initial days of the search and koffee had one he inadvertently gave it to us it was no big deal because her dental records were not an issue at trial as we know there was no dead body a year later i sent the file back to koffee but i made a copy for myself who knows what youll need one day did he know you kept a copy i dont remember but i doubt it its no big deal theres no violation of privacy here of course not whose privacy nicoles martha scribbled notes as her tape recorder ran on robbie closed his eyes and tried not to frown what else will they look for she asked robbie frowned but did not open his eyes cause of death in a strangulation case is impossible after nine years theyll look for dna evidence maybe in dried blood or hair nothing elsesemen skin saliva earwax sweatnone of it holds up after this long in a decomposing corpse does dna matter i mean we know who killed her we do but i would love to have the dna proof if we get it then this will be the first case in us history in which we know by dna evidence that the wrong man has been executed there are a dozen or so cases where we strongly suspect the state killed the wrong guy but none with clear biological proof would you like a drink i need a drink no a drink carlos sure ill take a beer aaron driving boss just joking robbie pulled two beers out of the fridge and handed one to carlos after a long drink from the bottle he closed his eyes again what are you thinking martha asked boyette travis boyette we came so close and if he had just given us twentyfour hours we could have saved donte now we just deal with the aftermath what happens to boyette theyll indict him for murder here in missouri if he lives long enough theyll prosecute him will he be prosecuted in texas of course not they will never ever admit they killed the wrong guy koffee kerber judge vivian grale the jurors the appellate judges the governornone of those responsible for this travesty will ever admit fault watch em run watch em point fingers maybe they wont deny their mistakes but they damned sure wont admit them i suspect they will just keep quiet hunker down ride out the storm can they another pull on the bottle robbie smiled at the beer and licked his lips no cop has ever been indicted for a wrongful conviction kerber should go to jail koffee should too they are directly responsible for dontes conviction but koffee controls the grand jury hes in charge of the system so criminal prosecutions are unlikely unless of course i can convince the justice department to investigate i will certainly try and we still have the civil courts lawsuits oh yes lots of them ill sue everybody cant wait thought you were moving to vermont i may have to put that on hold im not quite finished here the slone municipal school board met in an emergency session at friday afternoon the only item on the agenda was the game longview was scheduled to arrive at pm for a pm kickoff the school officials and coaches in longview were worried about the safety of their players and fans and with good reason the unrest in slone was now routinely being referred to as a race riot a sensational description that was as inaccurate as it was catchy there had been a constant flow of threatening phone calls to the slone police department and the school if they tried to play the game there would be trouble and lots of it the chief of police joe radford pleaded with the board to cancel the game or somehow postpone it a crowd of five thousand people almost all of whom would be white would provide too enticing a target for those wanting trouble and just as troubling was the prospect of all the empty and unprotected homes of the fans during the game the football coach admitted he really didnt want to play either the kids were too distracted not to mention the fact that his best players the twentyeight black ones were boycotting his star tailback trey glover was still in jail both teams had six wins and two losses and were eligible for the state playoffs the coach knew he had no chance with an allwhite team but a forfeit was a loss and this perplexed him and everybody else in the room the principal described the burnedout press box the tension of the past two days the canceled classes and the phone threats his office had received throughout the day he was exhausted and jumpy and practically begged the board to cancel a honcho from the national guard reluctantly attended the meeting he thought it was possible to secure the stadium area and play the game without incident but he shared the chiefs concerns about what might happen in the rest of the town for the three hours when pressed he admitted that the safest route was to cancel the board members squirmed and fretted and passed notes while they routinely grappled with budgets and curriculum and discipline and dozens of important issues they had never been faced with something as momentous as canceling a high school football game they stood for election every four years and the prospect of alienating the voters weighed heavily if they voted to cancel and slone was forced to forfeit they would be seen as caving in to the boycotters and troublemakers if they voted to play and people got hurt in an ugly incident their opponents would lay blame on them a compromise was suggested seized upon and quickly gained momentum a flurry of phone calls were made and the compromise became a reality the game would not be played that night in slone rather it would be played the following day at an undisclosed site in a nearby town longview agreed their coach knew of the boycott and smelled blood the location of the neutral site would be kept secret until two hours before kickoff both teams would drive about an hour play the game without spectators and the show would go on the compromise pleased everyone but the head coach he gamely gritted his teeth and predicted a win what else could he do throughout the morning and into the afternoon the train station had been a magnet for reporters it was the last place boyette had been seen and he was in demand his chilling confession had been on the nonstop cable loop for almost a full day now but his past had caught up with him his colorful criminal record was in play his credibility in serious question experts of all stripes were on the air proffering opinions about his background his profile his motives one windbag flat out called him a liar and went on and on about how these creeps want their fifteen minutes of fame and enjoy tormenting the families of victims a former texas prosecutor opined as to the fairness of the drumm trial and appeals and assured those listening that all was well with the system boyette was obviously a nut job as the saga wore on it lost some of its shock value boyette wasnt around anymore to add details or to defend himself and neither was robbie flak the reporters knew that flaks car was not at the office where was he inside the station sammie thomas bonnie and fanta adopted a siege mentality and tried to work it was impossible the phones rang and rang and every hour or so one of the ruder reporters would almost make it to the front door before being accosted by one of the security guards with time the mob began to understand that boyette wasnt there and neither was robbie out of boredom the reporters left and drove around slone looking for a fire or a fight to get to the bottom of things they interviewed guardsmen as they walked the streets and they filmed and refilmed the burnedout churches and buildings they talked to angry young blacks outside of pool halls and honkytonks and they stuck microphones into pickup trucks for priceless comments from white vigilantes bored again they returned to the train station and waited on some word from boyette where the hell was he by late afternoon a crowd was beginning to assemble in washington park news of this development spread through the media and off they went their presence attracted more young blacks and soon the rap was booming and fireworks were popping it was friday nightpayday beer day the start of the weekend time to blow off some steam the tension was rising some forty hours after leaving the parsonage with an unwanted passenger keith returned to it alone when he turned off the ignition he sat in the car for a moment to get his bearings dana was waiting at the kitchen door with a hug and a kiss and a very pleasant you look tired im fine he said just need a good nights sleep where are the boys the boys were at the table eating ravioli they jumped at their father as if hed been gone for a month clay the oldest was dressed in his soccer uniform ready for a game after a long hug the family sat down and finished dinner in the bedroom keith dressed after a quick shower as dana sat on the bed and watched him she was saying not a word from anyone around here ive talked to matthew a few times were watching the news and spending hours online your name has not been mentioned anywhere a thousand photos but no sign of you the church thinks you were called away on some emergency so no suspicions there we might get lucky whats the latest from slone not much they postponed the football game tonight and that was reported as urgently as a major plane crash no news from missouri not a word itll blow up soon enough i cant imagine the shock waves when they announce they have found the body of nicole yarber the town will explode when will it happen i dont know im not sure what robbies plans are robbie you sound like youre old friends we are i met him yesterday but we have traveled a long way together im proud of you keith what you did was crazy but it was also courageous i dont feel brave im not sure what i feel right now more shock than anything else i think im still numb it was a rather unique adventure but we failed you tried keith pulled on a sweater tucked in his shirttail and said i just hope they catch boyette what if he finds another victim come on keith hes a dying man but he left his cane behind dana can you explain that ive been around the guy for five daysseems like a yearand he had trouble walking without the cane why would he leave it behind maybe he thought he would be easier to spot with a cane keith pulled his belt tight and buckled it he was fixated on you dana he mentioned you several times something like that cute little wife of yours im not worried about travis boyette hed be a fool to come back to topeka hes done dumber things look at all the arrests we need to go the game is at i cant wait i need something to distract me do we have a bottle of communion wine around here i think so good i need a drink lets go watch a little soccer then well spend the rest of the night debriefing i want to hear everything chapter the meeting was arranged by judge elias henry and while he did not have the authority to order people around on a friday night his powers of persuasion were more than enough paul koffee and drew kerber arrived in the judges chambers promptly at pm joe radford followed them in and the three sat together on one side of the judges worktable robbie had been there for thirty minutes along with carlos and the atmosphere was already toxic there were no greetings no handshakes no pleasantries a moment later mayor rooney arrived and sat by himself away from the table judge henry as always in a dark suit white shirt and orange tie began solemnly everyone is here mr flak has some information robbie was seated directly across from kerber koffee and radford all three still and subdued as if waiting for a death sentence robbie started by saying we left slone this morning around five and drove to newton county missouri travis boyette was with us the trip took just under six hours with boyette giving directions we worked our way through a remote section of the county along back roads then dirt trails then to a place known locally as roops mountain secluded remote overgrown boyette struggled to remember it at times but eventually led us to the place where he claims he buried nicole yarber robbie nodded at carlos who punched a key on his laptop at the far end of the room on a whiteboard a photo of the overgrown clearing appeared robbie continued we found the site and began to dig the next photo was of aaron rey and fred pryor with shovels when boyette was here in slone in the fall of he worked for a company called r s mcguire and sons out of fort smith he kept a large metal box one that was once used for hydraulic tools in the back of his truck and he used it to bury her next photo the top of the orange toolbox the soil was not hard and within ten maybe fifteen minutes we found this next photo the top half of the toolbox with r s mcguire and sons stenciled on it as you can see the toolbox opened from the top with a latch to the side the latch was secured by a combination lock which boyette claimed he bought at a hardware store in springdale arkansas boyette remembered the combination and unlocked it next photo boyette kneeling at the grave handling the lock the color drained from koffees face and kerber had perspiration on his forehead when we opened the box this is what we found next photo the skeleton before we opened it boyette told us there would be a wad of clothing next to her head next photo the clothing next to the skull he also told us that rolled up in the clothing we would find nicoles drivers license and a credit card he was right next photo a closeup of the mastercard also stained but with her name easily readable boyette told us he killed her by choking her with her black leather belt with a silver buckle next photo a length of black leather partially decomposed but with the silver buckle i have a complete set of these photos for you boys to take home and look at all night at this point we called the sheriff of newton county and surrendered the site next photo the sheriff and three of his deputies gawking at the skeletal remains the site was soon crawling with police and investigators and the decision was made to leave her remains in the box and take it to the satellite crime lab there in joplin thats where it is now i gave the authorities a copy of nicoles dental xrays a copy of the same set you boys inadvertently handed over when you were playing games with discovery before the trial i have talked to the crime lab and the case has priority they expect to finish the preliminary identification tonight we are expecting a phone call any moment they will examine everything in the toolbox and hopefully find evidence for dna testing this is a long shot but dna is not crucial its pretty clear who was buried in the box and theres no doubt who did the killing boyette has a lethal brain tumorthats one reason he came forwardand hes subject to violent seizures he collapsed at the site and was taken to a hospital in joplin somehow he managed to leave the hospital without being detected and as of now no one knows where he is hes considered a suspect but he was not under arrest when he disappeared robbie stared at koffee and kerber as he delivered his narrative but they were unable to maintain eye contact koffee was pinching the bridge of his nose while kerber picked his cuticles there were three identical black binders in the center of the table and robbie gently slid them over one each for koffee kerber and radford robbie continued in these you each have a complete set of the photos along with a few other goodiesboyettes arrest record here in slone which proves he was here at the time of the murder in fact you boys actually had him in jail at the same time donte drumm was locked up there is also a copy of his extensive criminal record and history of incarcerations his affidavit is included but you dont really need to read it its a detailed account of the abduction sexual assaults murder and burial the same story you have no doubt seen a dozen times now on television theres also an affidavit signed yesterday by joey gamble in which he says he lied at the trial any questions silence he continued i have chosen to proceed in this manner out of respect for nicoles family i doubt if any of you have the backbone to meet with reeva tonight and tell her the truth but at least you have that option it would be a shame for her to hear it secondhand someone needs to tell her tonight comments anything silence the mayor cleared his throat and asked softly when will this go public i have asked the authorities in missouri to sit on it until tomorrow at nine in the morning im holding a press conference god robbie is that really necessary the mayor blurted its mr flak to you mr mayor and yes it is quite necessary the truth must be told its been buried for nine years by the police and the prosecutor so yes it is time to tell the truth the lies will finally be exposed after nine years and the execution of an innocent man the world will finally know that dontes confession was bogus and ill explain the brutal methods used by detective kerber to obtain it i plan to go into great detail describing the lies used at trialjoey gambles and the jailhouse snitch kerber and koffee rounded up and cut a deal withand ill describe all the dirty tactics used at trial ill probably have the opportunity to remind everyone that mr koffee was sleeping with the judge during the trial just in case anyone has forgotten i wish the bloodhound were still alivewhat was his name yogi carlos said how could i forget i wish ol yogi were still alive so i could show him to the world and call him a stupid son of a bitch again i figure it might be a long press conference you boys are invited questions comments paul koffees mouth opened slightly as if words were being formed but words failed him robbie was far from finished and just so you boys will know whats coming in the next few days ill file at least two lawsuits monday morning one here in state court naming you as defendants along with the city county and half the state another one will be filed in federal court a civilrights action with a long list of allegations you will be named in that one also i might file another one or two if i can find a cause of action i plan to contact the justice department and request an investigation for you koffee i plan to file a complaint with the state bar association for ethics violations not that i expect the state bar to show much of an interest but you will get chewed up in the process you might want to start thinking about a resignation for you kerber early retirement is now a real option you should be fired but i doubt the mayor and the city council have the balls to do that chief you were the assistant chief when this investigation got off track you will be named as a defendant too but dont take it personally im suing everybody the chief slowly stood up and walked toward the door youre leaving mr radford the judge asked in a tone that left no doubt such an abrupt exit would be frowned upon my job does not require me to sit and listen to pompous assholes like robbie flak the chief replied the meeting is not over judge henry said sternly id stay if i were you the mayor said and the chief decided to stay he assumed a position by the door robbie stared at kerber and koffee then said so last night you had a little party by the lake to celebrate now i guess the party is over we always thought drumm had an accomplice koffee managed to blurt out though his words trailed off under the weight of their own absurdity kerber nodded quickly ready to pounce on any new theory that might save them good god paul judge henry roared in disbelief robbie was laughing the mayors jaw had dropped in shock great robbie yelled wonderful brilliant suddenly a new theory one that has never been mentioned before one with absolutely no relation to the truth let the lying begin we have a web site koffee and my sidekick carlos here is going to keep a tally of the lies lies from the two of you from the governor the courts maybe even dear judge vivian grale if we can find her you have lied for nine years in order to kill an innocent man and now that we know the truth now that your lies will be exposed you insist on doing precisely what you have always done lie you make me want to puke koffee judge can we leave now koffee asked just a moment a cell phone rang and carlos grabbed it its the crime lab robbie robbie reached over took the phone the conversation was brief and there were no surprises when it ended robbie said positive id its nicole the room was quiet as they thought about the girl judge henry eventually said i am concerned about her family gentlemen how do we break the news drew kerber was perspiring and appeared to be on the brink of an attack of some variety he was not thinking about nicoles family he had a wife a houseful of kids lots of debts and a reputation paul koffee could not even begin to imagine a conversation with reeva about this little twist to their story no he would not do it he would rather run like a coward than deal with that woman admitting they had prosecuted and executed the wrong man was at that moment far beyond the limits of his imagination there were no volunteers robbie said obviously judge im not the guy i have my own little trip to make over to the drumm home to deliver the news mr kerber the judge asked he shook his head no mr koffee he shook his head no very well i will call her mother myself and break the news how late can you wait judge the mayor asked if this hits the streets tonight then god help us who is in the loop robbie the judge asked my office the seven of us in this room the authorities in missouri we also took a tv crew with us but they wont air anything until i say so its a small world right now ill wait two hours judge henry said this meeting is adjourned roberta drumm was at home with andrea and a few friends the kitchen table and counters were covered with foodcasseroles platters of fried chicken cakes and pies enough food to feed a hundred robbie had forgotten to eat dinner so he snacked as he and martha waited for the friends to leave roberta was thoroughly drained after a day receiving guests at the funeral home and crying with most of them she was emotionally and physically spent and so robbie made things much worse by delivering the news he had no choice he began with the journey to missouri and finished with the meeting in judge henrys office he and martha helped andrea put roberta in bed she was conscious but barely knowing that donte was about to be exonerated and before he was buried was simply too much the sirens were quiet until ten minutes after pm three quick calls got them started the first reported a fire in a shopping center north of town evidently someone tossed a molotov cocktail through the front window of a clothing store and a passing motorist saw flames the second call anonymous reported a burning school bus parked behind the junior high and the third and most ominous was from a fire alarm system at a feed store its owner was wallis pike reevas husband the police and guardsmen already on high alert stepped up their patrols and surveillance and for the third straight night slone endured the sirens and the smoke long after the boys were asleep keith and dana sat in the dark den and sipped wine from coffee cups as keith told his story the details poured out and he remembered facts and sounds and smells for the first time the little things surprised himthe sound of boyette heaving in the grass beside the interstate the lethargy of the state trooper as he went about the task of writing the speeding ticket the stacks of paperwork on the long table in robbies conference room the looks of fear on the faces of his staff the antiseptic smell of the holding room in the death house the ringing in keiths ears as he watched donte die the lurching of the airplane as they flew over texas and on and on dana peppered him with questions random and insightful she was as intrigued by the adventure as keith and at times incredulous when the bottle was empty keith stretched out on the sofa and fell into a deep sleep chapter with judge henrys approval the press conference was held in the main courtroom of the chester county courthouse on main street in downtown slone robbie had planned to hold it in his office but when it became apparent that a mob would attend he changed his mind he wanted to make sure every possible reporter could be accommodated but he didnt want a bunch of curious strangers poking around his train station at am robbie stepped to the podium in front of judge henrys bench and surveyed the throng cameras clicked and tape recorders were turned on to catch every word he wore a dark threepiece suit his finest and though exhausted he was also wired he wasted little time getting to the point good morning and thanks for coming he said the skeletal remains of nicole yarber were found yesterday morning in a remote section of newton county missouri just south of the city of joplin i was there along with members of my staff accompanying a man named travis boyette boyette led us to the site where he buried nicole almost nine years ago two days after he abducted her here in slone using dental records the crime lab in joplin made a positive identification last night the crime lab is working around the clock to examine her remains and their work should be completed in a couple of days he paused took a sip of water and scanned the crowd not a sound im in no hurry folks i plan to go into considerable detail then i will answer all the questions you have he nodded at carlos who was seated nearby with his laptop on a large screen next to the podium a photo of the grave site appeared robbie began a methodical description of what they had found illustrated by one photo after another pursuant to an agreement with the authorities in missouri he did not show the skeletal remains the site was being treated as a crime scene he did use the photos of nicoles drivers license credit card and the belt boyette used to strangle her he talked about boyette and gave a brief explanation of his disappearance there was not yet a warrant for his arrest so boyette wasnt a wanted man it was obvious that robbie was relishing the moment his performance was being broadcast live his audience was captive spellbound and hungry for every detail he could not be interrupted or challenged on any point it was his press conference and he was finally getting the last word the moment was a lawyers dream there would be several points during the morning when robbie belabored a topic beginning with his heartfelt ramblings about donte drumm the audience though refused to be bored he eventually got around to the crime and this prompted a photo of nicole a very pretty wholesome high school girl reeva was watching phone calls had roused her they had been up all night dealing with the fire at the feed store a fire that was contained quickly and couldve been much worse it was certainly arson a criminal act obviously carried out by black thugs seeking revenge against the family of nicole yarber wallis was still there and reeva was alone she cried when she saw her daughters face displayed by a man she loathed she cried and she seethed and she ached reeva was confused tormented thoroughly bewildered the phone call last night from judge henry had spiked her blood pressure and sent her to the emergency room add the fire and reeva was practically delirious she had asked judge henry many questionsnicoles grave skeletal remains her clothing and drivers license belt and credit card and all the way up in missouri she had not been dumped in the red river near rush point and worst of alldrumm was not the killer its true mrs pike the judge said patiently its all true im sorry i know that it is a shock a shock reeva couldnt believe it and for hours refused to believe it shed slept little ate nothing and was still grasping for answers when she turned on the television and there was flak the peacock live on cnn talking about her daughter there were reporters outside in the driveway but the house was locked the curtains drawn the blinds down and one of walliss cousins was on the front porch with a gauge shotgun reeva was fed up with the media she had no comment sean fordyce was holed up in a motel south of town fuming because she would not chat with him on camera he had made a fool of her already he reminded her of their agreement of the signed contract to which she responded just sue me fordyce watching robbie flak reeva for the first time allowed herself to think the unthinkable was drumm innocent had she spent the last nine years hating the wrong person had she watched the wrong man die and what about the funeral now that her baby had been found she would need to be properly buried but the church was gone where would they have the funeral reeva wiped her face with a wet cloth and mumbled to herself eventually robbie moved on to the confession here he picked up steam and was consumed by a controlled rage it was very effective the courtroom was silent carlos projected a photo of detective drew kerber and robbie announced with great drama and here is the principal architect of the wrongful conviction drew kerber was watching at the office he had spent a horrible night at home after leaving judge henrys he had gone for a long drive and tried to imagine a happier ending to this nightmare none appeared around midnight he sat down with his wife at the kitchen table and bared his soul the grave the bones the id the unmentionable idea that evidently they had nailed the wrong guy flak and his lawsuits and his threats of vigilantestyle suing that would follow kerber to his grave and the high probability of future unemployment legal bills and judgments kerber unloaded a mountain of grief upon his poor wife but he did not tell the whole truth detective kerber had never admitted and he never would that he had bullied donte into confessing as a chief detective with sixteen years of experience he earned a year he had three teenagers and a nineyearold a mortgage two car payments an ira with around ten grand and a savings account with if fired or retired he might be entitled to a small pension but he could not survive financially and his days as a police officer would be over drew kerber is a rogue cop with a history of obtaining fake confessions robbie said loudly and kerber flinched he was at his desk in a small locked office all alone he had instructed his wife to keep the tvs off in the house as if they could somehow hide this story from his kids he cursed flak then watched with horror as the slimeball explained to the world exactly how he kerber had obtained the confession kerbers life was over he might handle the ending by himself robbie moved on to the trial he introduced more characterspaul koffee and judge vivian grale photos please on the large screen carlos projected them side by side as if still attached and robbie assailed them for their relationship he mocked the brilliant decision to move the trial all the way to paris texas fortynine miles from here he drove home the point that he tried valiantly to keep the confession away from the jury while koffee fought just as hard to keep it in evidence judge grale sided with the prosecution and her lover the honorable paul koffee paul koffee was watching and seething he was at the cabin by the lake very much alone watching the local stations exclusive live coverage of the robbie flak show when he saw his face next to vivians flak was railing against the jury as white as a klan rally because paul koffee had systematically used his jury strikes to eliminate blacks and of course his girlfriend up on the bench went along with it texasstyle justice robbie lamented over and over he eventually moved away from the more tawdry aspects of the judgeprosecutor relationship and found his rhythm railing against the lack of evidence grales face disappeared from the screen and koffees was enlarged no physical evidence no dead body only a trumpedup confession a jailhouse snitch a bloodhound and a lying witness named joey gamble meanwhile travis boyette was free certainly not worried about getting caught not by these clowns koffee had tried all night to conjure up a revised theory that would somehow link donte drumm and travis boyette but fiction failed him he felt lousy his head ached from too much vodka and his heart pounded as he tried to breathe under the crushing weight of a ruined career he was finished and that troubled him much more than the notion that he had helped kill an innocent young man when he finished with the jailhouse snitch and the bloodhound robbie attacked joey gamble and his fraudulent testimony with perfect timing carlos flashed up gambles affidavit the one signed in houston on thursday an hour before the execution highlighted were joeys statements admitting he lied at trial and admitting he was the first to suggest that donte drumm was the killer joey gamble was watching he was at his mothers house in slone his father was away his mother needed him he had told her the truth and the truth had not been well received now he was shocked to see and hear his transgressions broadcast in such a startling way he had assumed that when he came clean he would be subjected to some level of embarrassment but nothing like this joey gamble lied repeatedly flak announced at full throttle and joey almost reached for the remote and now he admits it joeys mother was upstairs in her bedroom too upset to be around him you helped kill that boy she had said more than once not that joey needed reminding robbie continued moving on from the incompetent investigation the travesty of a trial and the wrongful conviction i would like to now discuss the texas court of criminal appeals this court heard dontes first appeal in february the body of nicole yarber was still missing the court noted that there was no physical evidence in the trial the court seemed slightly bothered by the lies of the jailhouse snitch it nibbled at the edges of dontes confession but refused to criticize judge grale for allowing the jury to hear it it commented on the use of the bloodhound testimony saying perhaps it wasnt the best evidence to use in such a serious trial but all in all the court saw nothing wrong the vote was nine to affirm the conviction zero to overturn it chief justice milton prudlowe was watching a frantic call from his law clerk had alerted him to the press conference and he was with his wife in their small apartment in austin glued to cnn if texas had indeed executed an innocent man he knew his court was in for an avalanche of scorching criticism mr flak seemed prepared to lead the attack last thursday robbie was saying at exactly pm lawyers for donte drumm filed a petition for relief and we included a video that we had just taken of travis boyette confessing to the rape and murder this was two and a half hours before the execution i assume the court considered this matter and was not impressed with the video or the affidavit because an hour later the court denied relief and refused to stop the execution again the vote was nine to zero on cue carlos flashed up the times and actions by the court robbie plowed ahead the court closes for business each day at pm even when an execution is pending our final filing was the lastminute affidavit and recantation by joey gamble in austin attorneys for donte called the court clerk a mr emerson pugh and informed him that they were on their way with the petition he said the court would close at and he was right when the attorneys arrived at the court at the door was locked the petition could not be filed prudlowes wife glared at him and said i hope hes lying prudlowe wanted to assure her that of course this loudmouthed lawyer was lying but he hesitated flak was too shrewd to make such damning statements in public without having the facts to back them up milton tell me this guy is lying well honey im not sure right now youre not sure why would the court close if the lawyers were trying to file something well uh we youre stuttering here milton and that means youre struggling to tell me something that may or may not be entirely accurate did you see boyettes video two hours before the execution yes it was passed oh my god milton then why didnt you stop things for a few days youre the chief justice milton you can do anything you want executions are delayed all the time why not give it another thirty days or a year for that matter we thought it was bogus the guy is a serial rapist with no credibility well right now hes got a helluva lot more credibility than the texas court of criminal appeals the murderer confesses no one believes him so he shows them exactly where he buried the body sounds pretty credible to me robbie paused and took a sip of water as for the governor his office received a copy of the boyette video at thursday afternoon i dont know for sure whether the governor saw the video we do know that at he addressed a crowd of protesters and publicly denied a reprieve for donte the governor was watching he was standing in his office in the governors mansion dressed for a golf game that would not be played with wayne on one side and barry on the other when robbie paused he demanded is that true did we have the video at pm wayne lied first dont know so much stuff was happening they were filing junk by the truckload barry told the second lie this is the first ive heard of it did anyone see the video when it came in he asked his irritation growing by the second dont know boss but well find out barry said the governor stared at the television his mind spinning trying to grasp the severity of what he was hearing robbie was saying even after denying clemency the governor had the right to reconsider and stop the execution he refused to do so the governor hissed the word asshole then yelled get to the bottom of this and now carlos closed his laptop and the screen went blank robbie flipped through his legal pad to make sure hed said enough he lowered his voice and in a grave tone said in closing it is now obvious that we have finally done it those who study the death penalty and those of us who fight it have long feared the day when this would happen when we would wake up to the horrible fact that we have executed an innocent man and that it can be proven by clear and convincing evidence innocent men have been executed before but the proof was not clear with donte there is no doubt a pause the courtroom was still and silent what you will see in the days to come will be a pathetic game of fingerpointing lying and dodging blame i have just given you the names and some of the faces of those responsible go after them listen to their lies this did not have to happen this was not an unavoidable mistake this was a willful disregard for the rights of donte drumm may he rest in peace thank you before the onslaught of questions robbie stepped to the bar and took the hand of roberta drumm she rose and walked stiffly to the podium robbie by her side she pulled the microphone down a bit closer and said my name is roberta drumm donte was my son i have little to say at this moment my family is grieving we are in shock but i beg of you i plead with the people of this town to stop the violence stop the fires and the rock throwing the fighting the threats please stop it it does no good yes we are angry yes we are wounded but the violence serves no purpose i call on my people to lay down your arms to respect everyone and to get off the streets the violence does nothing but harm the honor of my son robbie led her back to her seat then smiled at the crowd and said now does anyone have a question chapter matthew burns joined the schroeder family for a late breakfast of pancakes and sausage the boys ate quickly and returned to their video games dana made more coffee and began clearing the table they discussed the press conference robbies brilliant presentation of the case and robertas poignant remarks matthew was curious about slone the fires and violence but keith had seen little of it he had felt the tension smelled the smoke heard the police helicopter hovering overhead but he had not seen much of the town with fresh coffee the three sat at the table and talked about keiths improbable journey and the whereabouts of travis boyette keith though was growing weary of the details he had other issues and matthew was prepared for the conversation so counselor how much trouble could i be in keith asked the law is not real clear there is no specific prohibition against aiding a convicted felon in his efforts to violate the terms of his parole but its still against the law the applicable code section deals with obstruction of justice which is a huge net for a lot of behavior that would otherwise be difficult to classify by driving boyette out of this jurisdiction and with the knowledge that it was a violation of his parole you violated the law how serious matthew shrugged grimaced stirred his coffee with a spoon its a felony but not a serious one and its not the type of violation that we get excited about we dana asked as in prosecutors the district attorney would have jurisdiction a different office im with the city a felony keith asked probably it appears that your trip to texas has gone unnoticed here in topeka you managed to avoid the cameras and i have yet to see your name in print but you know about it matthew dana said i do and i suppose that technically im expected to inform the police to turn you in but it doesnt work that way we can process only so much crime were forced to pick and choose this is not a violation that any prosecutor would want to deal with but boyette is a famous guy right now dana said its just a matter of time before a reporter here picks up on the story he jumped parole took off to texas and weve seen his face for three days now yes but who can link keith to boyette several folks in texas keith said true but i doubt if they care what happens here and these folks are on our side right i guess so who can make the link did anyone see you with boyette what about the guy at the halfway house dana asked its possible keith said i went there several times looking for boyette i signed the register and there was a guy at the desk rudy i think who knew my name but he didnt see you drive away with boyette late wednesday night no one saw us it was after midnight matthew shrugged satisfied all three worked on their coffee for a moment then keith said i can make the link matthew i knew i was violating the law when i left with boyette because you made things very clear i made a choice at the time i knew i was doing the right thing i have no regrets now so long as boyette is found before he hurts anyone else but if hes not found and if someone gets hurt then ill have a ton of regrets i am not going to live with a possible criminal violation hanging over my head we plan to deal with it now dana and keith were both looking at matthew who said thats sort of what i figured im not running from this keith said and we cant live with the threat of an officer knocking on the door lets get it over with matthew shook his head and said okay but youll need a lawyer what about you dana asked a defense lawyer as in criminal defense me im now on the other side of the street and frankly i can help more over there could keith possibly go to jail she asked get right to the point dont you keith said with a smile dana was not smiling her eyes were moist matthew stretched his arms above his head then leaned forward on his elbows heres my worstcase scenario im not predicting this its just the worst case if you admit your role in taking him to texas get ready for some coverage then if boyette rapes another woman all hell breaks loose i can see the da playing hardball with you but i cannot under any scenario see you going to jail you may have to plead guilty get probation pay a small fine but i doubt it id stand in court in front of a judge and plead guilty thats what usually happens keith took danas hand on the table there was a long moment of reflection then she said what would you do matthew hire a lawyer and pray boyette is either dead or too ill to attack someone at noon the fortyone white members of the slone high football team met in the parking lot of a small elementary school on the edge of town there they quickly boarded a chartered bus and left town their equipment was in a rental van behind the bus an hour later they arrived at mount pleasant population fifteen thousand from there the bus followed a police car to the high school football field the players dressed quickly and hustled to the field for their pregame routines it was odd warming up with no lights and no fans security was tight police cars blocked every possible route to the field the lobos of longview high took the field minutes later there were no cheerleaders no band national anthem pregame prayer or public address announcer as the coin was tossed the slone coach looked across the field at the lobos and wondered how bad the slaughter might be they had eighty players on a roster that was at least percent black slone had not beaten longview since the days of donte drumm and the warriors had no chance today what was happening in slone was being felt throughout east texas if not far beyond slone won the toss and elected to receive it really didnt matter but the slone coach wanted to avoid a long kickoff return and a quick seven points his receiving team took the field and the lobos lined up to kick ten black kids and a white kicker at the whistle the player closest to the ball suddenly stepped forward and grabbed it it was a move that had never been seen before and for a second everyone was startled the ten black members of the kickoff team then yanked off their helmets and laid them on the turf the referees blew their whistles the coaches yelled and for a few seconds there was total confusion on cue the other black longview players walked onto the field dropping their helmets and jerseys as they went the slone players on the field backed away in disbelief the game was over before it began the black players formed a tight circle and sat together at midfield the modernday version of a sitin the officials four white and two black huddled briefly and kept their cool none of the six volunteered to attempt to get the football the longview coach walked to midfield and said what the hell is going on here games over coach said number a pound tackle and cocaptain we aint playing said number the other cocaptain why not its a protest said number were solid with our brothers in slone the coach kicked the turf and weighed his options it was clear that this situation was not about to change not anytime soon well just so you understand what you are doing here this means well have to forfeit which knocks us out of the playoffs and theyll probably find some kind of probation for us that what you guys want all sixty or so said yes in unison the coach threw up his hands walked off the field and sat on the bench the slone coach called his players off the field from both sidelines the white players stared at the black players green lobo jerseys and helmets littered the field the officials retreated to an end zone and watched their day was done minutes passed as reality set in then from the longview sideline number a white backup fullback stepped onto the field removed his helmet and jersey and took a seat on the fortyyard line near his black teammates one by one the other players followed until only the coaches were left on the sideline the slone coach wasnt sure what to do he was thinking that perhaps he had just been handed a victory snatched by a miracle from certain defeat he was about to tell his players to leave the field when number denny weeks the starting tight end and the son of a slone police officer stepped onto the field dropped his helmet and pulled off his jersey he sat on the field with the longview players one of whom reached over and shook his hand one by one the warriors followed until all fortyone had left the sideline at pm the governors office issued a statement for the press drafted by barry ringfield and rewritten by wayne wallcott and the governor himself its final version read governor gill newton is deeply concerned about recent events in the matter of donte drumm the allegations that this office received a videotape of a confession by the alleged killer just before the execution are simply false the governor first saw the video yesterday friday approximately sixteen hours after the execution the governor will be available on monday for additional comments the train station finally closed saturday afternoon aaron rey placed two armed guards on the landing with orders to threaten anyone who came near the flak firm gathered at robbies house for an impromptu party everyone was there along with spouses dede hired a caterer who specialized in barbecue and the rich smell of ribs on the grill wafted over the patio fred pryor manned the bar and the drinks flowed everyone lounged in the pool house and tried to relax the longhorns were playing football and the television drew some interest robbie tried to prohibit any discussion of the drumm case but the conversation drifted there anyway they couldnt help themselves they were exhausted drained and defeated but managed to unwind the booze helped a lot the longview game was making the rounds and they tipped a glass in honor of the sitin fred pryor while bartending monitored the police chatter on his radio the streets of slone were remarkably calm which they attributed to roberta drumms emotional plea they had also heard that roberta marvin cedric and andrea had gone to washington park and pleaded with the people to go home to stop the violence though robbie had ordered all cell phones turned off the call came through anyway carlos received it and relayed the news to a hushed audience the authorities in joplin had expedited their examination and had some interesting news on nicoles underwear they had found a significant semen sample dna testing matched it to travis boyette his dna sample was in the missouri data bank due to a previous conviction there there was reason to celebrate and reason to weep with emotions torn both ways they decided to have another drink chapter sunday what had been probable on thursday even likelier on friday and virtually certain on saturday became the numbing truth during the night so that on sunday morning the country awoke to the sensational reality that an innocent man had been executed led by the new york times and the washington post the big dailies railed and ranted and all reached the same conclusionits time to stop the killing the story was page one in both papers and in dozens of others from boston to san francisco lengthy articles gave the history of the case and the characters were well advertised with robbie flak getting as much attention as donte screeching editorials called for a moratorium on executions there were countless guest columns by legal experts defense lawyers deathpenalty abolitionists professors activists ministers even a couple of men on death row and the same conclusion was reached now that we have unassailable evidence of a wrongful execution the only fair and sensible course is to stop them forever or if that cant be done at least stop them until the death penalty system can be studied and overhauled in texas the houston chronicle a paper that had gradually grown weary of the death penalty but had stopped short of calling for its abolition covered its front page with an unrestrained summary of the case it was a condensed version of robbies press conference with large photographs of donte nicole and robbie on page one and a dozen more on page five the stories all six of them hit hard at the mistakes and peeled skin off drew kerber paul koffee and judge vivian grale the identities of the villains were clear blame was inescapable one reporter was on the trail of the texas court of criminal appeals and it was obvious that there would be no place for the court to hide chief justice milton prudlowe was unavailable for comment as were the other eight justices the clerk of the court mr emerson pugh refused comment however cicely avis the defender group lawyer who tried to enter pughs office at thursday afternoon had plenty to say the details were emerging with more stories sure to come another chronicle reporter was stalking the governor and his staff all evidently in full retreat reactions varied around the state newspapers known to be generally moderate in their politicsthose in austin and san antoniocalled for outright abolition of the death penalty the dallas paper was on record calling for a moratorium newspapers that were firmly on the right went light on the editorials but could not resist fullblown coverage of the events in slone on television the sunday morning talk shows all found room for the story though the presidential campaign was still the main topic on cable donte drumm had been the lead story since robbies press conference twentyfour hours earlier and it showed no signs of slipping to number two at least one of the subplots had been deemed important enough to have its own title the hunt for travis boyette could be seen every thirty minutes on the internet the story was all the rage showing five times more hits than anything else antideathpenalty bloggers railed with uncontrolled fury as tragic as it was the story was a huge gift for those on the left on the right things were predictably quiet those who supported the death penalty were not likely to change not overnight anyway but there seemed to be a general feeling that it was a good time to say nothing the hardright cable shows and am radio commentators simply ignored the story in slone sunday was still a day of worship at the bethel african methodist church a crowd much larger than normal gathered for the am call to worship to be followed by sunday school a mens prayer breakfast choir practice bible lessons coffee and doughnuts and eventually the worship hour which would go on far longer than sixty minutes some were there in hopes of seeing one of the drumms preferably roberta and maybe offering a quiet word of condolence but the drumm family needed rest and stayed at home some were there because they needed to talk to hear the gossip to lend support or to receive it whatever the motive the sanctuary was overflowing when the reverend johnny canty stepped to the pulpit and warmly welcomed the crowd it didnt take long to get to the issue of donte drumm it wouldve been easy to stir up his people to throw gas on the fire to hit all the open targets but reverend canty was not inclined to do so he talked about roberta and her grace under pressure her agony in watching her son die her strength her love for her children he talked about the urge for revenge and how jesus turned the other cheek he prayed for patience and tolerance and the wisdom of good men to deal with what had happened he talked about martin luther king and his courage in bringing about change by eschewing violence its mans nature to strike back but the second blow leads to the third and the fourth he thanked his flock for laying down their arms and getting off the streets remarkably it had been a quiet night in slone canty reminded his people that donte drumms name was now famous it was a symbol that would bring about change let us not smear it with more blood more violence after a thirtyminute warmup the worshippers fanned out through the church to pursue the usual sunday morning activities a mile away members of the first baptist church began arriving for a unique worship experience the rubble of their sanctuary was still lined with yellow police tape still a crime scene under active investigation in a parking lot a large white tent had been erected beneath it were rows of folding chairs and tables covered with food the dress was casual the mood generally upbeat after a quick breakfast they sang hymns oldtime gospel tunes with a beat and lyrics they knew by heart the chairman of the deacons spoke about the fire and more important about the new church they would build they had insurance they had faith they would borrow if necessary but a beautiful new sanctuary would rise from the ashes all to the glory of the lord reeva was not in attendance she had not come out of the house frankly she was hardly missed her friends felt her pain now that her daughter had been found but with reeva the pain had been relentless for nine years her friends could not help but remember the vigils by the red river the marathon prayer sessions the endless tirades in the press the enthusiastic embrace of victimhood all in an effort to extract revenge on that monster donte drumm now that they had executed the wrong monster and with reeva happily watching him die few of her fellow church members wanted to face her fortunately she did not want to face them brother ronnie was a troubled soul he had watched his church burn which was no fault of his but he had also watched donte die and with no small measure of satisfaction there was a sin in there somewhere he was a baptist a breed noted for its creative ways of finding new versions of sin and he needed forgiveness he shared this with his congregation he bared his soul admitted he was wrong and asked them to pray for him he seemed genuinely humbled and distressed arrangements for nicoles funeral were incomplete brother ronnie explained that he had talked with reeva by phoneshe was not taking visitorsand the church web site would post the details when the family made decisions nicole was still in missouri and the authorities there had not said when they would release her the tent was being watched closely across the street on property that did not belong to the church two dozen or so reporters loitered about most with cameras if not for the presence of several quite edgy police officers the reporters would have been under the tent recording every word making a nuisance of themselves slone had never been more divided than on that sunday morning but even at that dark hour there was some circling of the wagons the number of reporters and cameras had steadily increased since thursday and everyone in town felt an element of the siege the man on the street had stopped talking to reporters city officials had nothing but no comment not a single word could be pried out of the courthouse and in certain places the police increased their presence and sharpened their attitude any reporter trying to get near the drumm home was likely to be handled roughly the funeral home where donte was resting was strictly offlimits reevas house was being guarded by cousins and friends but the police were nearby just waiting for some clown with a camera to intrude robbie flak could take care of himself and was doing a fine job of it but his home and office were patrolled every hour and on sunday morning the devoted christians who worshipped at the bethel african methodist church and at the first baptist church were able to do so without intrusion the slone police department made sure of it at st marks lutheran the reverend keith schroeder assumed the pulpit and startled his congregation with the most gripping opening of any sermon yet last thursday the state of texas executed an innocent man if youve missed the story then i dont know where youve been most of you know the facts of the case but what you dont know is that the real killer was here last sunday sitting right over there his name is travis boyette a convicted felon released a few weeks ago from the prison in lansing and assigned to a halfway house on seventeenth street here in topeka no one in the crowd of two hundred seemed to be breathing those who had been planning naps were suddenly wideawake keith was amused at the odd looks he was getting he went on no im not kidding and while i would like to say that mr boyette was attracted to our little church because of its reputation for great preaching the truth is that he came because he was troubled first thing monday morning he was in my study to talk about his problems he then made his way down to texas and tried to stop the execution of donte drumm he was unsuccessful somehow he got away keiths initial plan was to describe his adventures in texas in what would undoubtedly be his most fascinating sermon ever he was not afraid of the truth he wanted it told he assumed his church would find out sooner or later and he was determined to confront the issue headon however dana had maintained that the wiser course was to wait until he met with a lawyer admitting to a crime especially in such a public manner without the advice of counsel seemed risky she prevailed and keith decided on a different message as a minister he steadfastly refused to mix politics and religion in the pulpit he had stayed away from issues such as gay rights abortion and war preferring instead to teach what jesus taughtlove your neighbor help the less fortunate forgive others because you have been forgiven and follow gods laws however after witnessing the execution keith was a different person or at least a different preacher suddenly confronting social injustice was far more important than making his flock feel good each sunday he would begin hitting the issues always from the christian perspective and never from the politicians and if it rankled folks too bad he was tired of playing it safe would jesus witness an execution without trying to stop it he asked would jesus approve of laws that allow us to kill those who have killed the answer to both was no and for a full hour in the longest sermon of his career keith explained why not before dark on sunday afternoon roberta drumm with her three children their spouses and her five grandchildren walked a few blocks to washington park they had made the same walk the day before and for the same purpose they met with the young people congregated there and in oneonone conversations talked about dontes death and what it was doing to all of them the rap was turned off the crowd became quiet and respectful at one point several dozen gathered around roberta and listened as she pleaded for civility in a strong eloquent voice and sometimes pointing for emphasis she said please dont desecrate the memory of my son with more bloodshed i dont want the name of donte drumm to be remembered as the reason for a race riot here in slone nothing you do out here on the streets will help our people violence creates more violence and in the end we lose please go home and hug your mother to his people donte drumm was already a legend the courage of his mother inspired them to go home chapter slone high school did not open monday morning though the tension appeared to be easing the school authorities and the police were still nervous another round of fights and smoke bombs could spill over into the streets and disrupt the fragile truce the white students were ready to return to class to their normal routines and activities as a rule they were shocked even appalled by what had happened over the weekend they were as stunned by the drumm execution as their black friends and they were anxious to confront it discuss it and try to move on the joining of the sitin by the white football players at the longview game was the topic of nonstop chatter around town and that simple act of solidarity was viewed as one huge offer of an apology a momentous mistake had been made but others were to blame lets meet and shake hands and deal with it for most of the black students the thought of continued violence was not appealing they had the same routines and activities as their white friends and they too wanted a return to normalcy the school board met again with the mayor and the police the term powder keg was used often to describe the atmosphere in slone there were enough hotheads on both sides to make trouble anonymous phone calls were still being recorded there were threats of violence as soon as the school reopened in the end it was decided that the safest route was to wait until after the funeral of donte drumm at am the football team met with their coaches in the locker room at the field the meeting was closed the twentyeight black players were there as were their white teammates all fortyone of them the meeting had been suggested by cedric and marvin drumm both of whom had played as warriors though at a level far below their brothers standing side by side they addressed the team they thanked the white players for their courage in joining the longview players in protest they spoke fondly even emotionally of their brother and said that donte would not approve of the divisiveness the football team was the pride of the town and if it managed to heal itself then there was hope for everyone they appealed for unity cedric said when we bury donte i ask that all of you be there it will mean so much to our family and to the rest of our community denny weeks the son of a slone policeman and the first player to remove his helmet and jersey and sit with the longview players asked if he could speak he faced the team and began by describing how sickened he was by the execution and its aftermath he along with most of the whites he knew had felt all along that donte was guilty and getting what he deserved he was wrong so incredibly wrong and he would always carry the guilt he apologized for what hed believed that hed favored the execution denny became emotional and trying to keep his composure finished by saying that he hoped cedric and marvin the rest of the family and his black teammates could find it in their hearts to forgive him other confessionals followed and the meeting became a prolonged and fruitful effort at reconciliation it was a team complete with petty grudges and fierce rivalries but most of the boys had played football together since middle school and knew each other well they had nothing to gain by allowing the bitterness to fester the state officials were still trying to resolve the baffling issues presented by the longview standoff it was generally believed that both teams would be given a forfeit but the regular season would go on there was one game left on the schedule the coach said that it was all or nothingif they could not come together as a team then the last game would be forfeited with cedric and marvin standing before them the players had no choice they could not say no to the brothers of donte drumm after two hours they shook hands and decided to meet that afternoon for a long practice the spirit of reconciliation had not reached the flak law firm and it probably would not energized by a quiet sunday and facing a mountain of work robbie pushed the troops to prepare for an assault on various fronts top priority was the civil litigation robbie was determined to file suit that day both in state and in federal court the state action for wrongful death would be a shotgun blast aimed at the city of slone its police department the county and its district attorney the state and its judges prison officials and appeals court justices the members of the judiciary were immune from liability but robbie planned to sue them anyway he would sue the governor who was absolutely immune much of the lawsuit would be dismantled and eventually dismissed but robbie didnt care he wanted revenge and embarrassing those responsible and forcing them to hire lawyers were things he relished he loved bareknuckle litigation especially when he was throwing the punches and the press was watching his clients the drumms were sincerely opposed to more violence in the streets as was robbie but he knew how to create violence in the courts the litigation would drag on for years and consume him but he was confident of prevailing eventually the lawsuit in federal court would be a civilrights action with many of the same defendants there he would not waste time suing the judges justices and the governor but would hit hard at the city of slone its police and paul koffee in light of what had become obvious he foresaw a lucrative settlement but far down the road the city and county and more important their insurance companies would never run the risk of having their dirty laundry aired before a jury in such a notorious case when they were fully exposed the actions of drew kerber and paul koffee would terrify the wellpaid lawyers for the insurers robbie was obsessed with revenge but he also smelled money other strategies on the table included an ethics complaint against paul koffee a win there could mean disbarment and further humiliation though robbie was not overly optimistic he also made plans to file a complaint against chief justice milton prudlowe with the state commission on judicial conduct but this would take more time so few of the facts surrounding the aborted filing were known it appeared though as if the facts would be forthcoming something akin to a hornets nest of reporters was already attacking the texas court of criminal appeals robbie was content to sit back and watch the press flush out the truth he contacted the justice department in washington he took calls from deathpenalty opponents around the country he chatted with reporters his office was chaos and he thrived on it the law office keith and dana walked into monday morning was far different from the last one keith had seen the flak law firm had been filled with people tension and activity the office of elmo laird was small and quiet matthews scouting report described elmo as a sole practitioner a sixtyyearold veteran of the criminal courts who dispensed solid advice but rarely went to trial he and matthew were friends and more important elmo played golf with the district attorney ive never had a case like this elmo admitted after listening to keith for a few minutes he had done his homework and like everyone who enjoys the morning paper knew the basics of the drumm mess down in texas well its something new for me too keith said theres no clear statute on point you provided assistance to a man who was determined to violate his parole anyway by leaving this jurisdiction its not exactly a major crime but you could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice weve read the statutes dana said matthew sent them over along with a few cases from other states nothing is clear i havent been able to find a similar case in kansas elmo said not that that means anything if the district attorney chooses to prosecute then id say he has a pretty good case youre admitting everything arent you sure keith said then i suggest we explore the possibility of a plea agreement and the sooner the better boyette is on the loose he may strike again maybe not perhaps this week maybe never its to your advantage to cut a deal a good deal before he makes any more trouble if he hurts someone you become more culpable and a simple case could get complicated whats a good deal keith asked no jail and a slap on the wrist elmo said with a shrug and what does that mean not much a quick court appearance a small fine of some sort certainly no time in jail i was hoping you would say that dana said and after some time i could probably get your record expunged elmo added but the conviction would be a public record right keith asked yes and that is worrisome boyette was frontpage news this morning here in topeka and i suspect there will be more about him in the coming days its our own little connection to this sensational episode if a reporter sniffs around he might stumble across your conviction its a pretty good story if you think about it local minister gives assistance to the real killer and so on i can see a big splash in the paper but no permanent damage the bigger story will be written if and when he commits another crime then the prosecutor will take some heat and might be harder to deal with keith and dana exchanged uncertain looks it was their first visit to a law office together and hopefully their last keith said look mr laird i really dont want this hanging over my head im guilty of doing what i did if i committed a crime ill take my punishment our question is simple what now give me a few hours to talk to the district attorney if he agrees then we cut a quick deal and get it over with with some luck youll slide under the radar how soon could this happen another shrug this week and you promise hes not going to jail dana asked almost pleading no promises but its very unlikely lets talk first thing in the morning keith and dana sat in the car outside lairds office and stared at the side of his building i cant believe were here doing this talking about pleading guilty worrying about going to jail she said isnt it great i love it you what i gotta tell you dana other than our honeymoon this past week has been the greatest week of my life youre sick youve spent too much time with boyette i sorta miss travis drive keith youre cracking up the governor was officially hard at work grappling with the states budget he was too busy to comment on the drumm matter the case was closed as far as he was concerned unofficially he was locked in his office with wayne and barry all three dazed and hungover eating ibuprofen and bitching about what to do next reporters were camped outside the buildingtheyd actually filmed him as he left the governors mansion that morning at with his security detail something he did five days a week as if such a movement were now breaking news the office was being flooded with calls faxes emails letters people even packages barry said its a shit storm growing worse by the minute thirtyone editorials yesterday coasttocoast another seventeen today at this rate every newspaper in the country will take a shot nonstop yakking on cable experts popping up by the dozens with advice on what to do next and what should we do next the governor asked moratoriums moratoriums give up capital punishment or at least study it to death polls the polls say we screwed up but its too early for something like this give it a few days let the aftershocks die down then well ease back into the market i suspect well lose a few points but my guess is at least percent are still in favor of the needle wayne wayne was buried in his laptop but not missing a word sixtynine still my favorite number ill split it the governor said sixtyseven all in barry and wayne gave a quick thumbsup the standard polling bet was now in playeach of the three with on the line the governor walked to his favorite window for the hundredth time but saw nothing outside i gotta talk to someone staying in here and ignoring the press makes me look like im hiding you are so hiding barry said find me an interview with someone we can trust theres always fox i talked to chuck monahand two hours ago and he would love to have a chat hes harmless

defendants as well as to every newspaper in the state im immune of course you are but youve been sued anyway barry sat down and began scratching his hair the governor closed his eyes and mumbled to himself wayne gawked at his laptop mouth wide open a bad day just took a turn for the worse chapter keith sat in his office at the church hands locked behind his head shoeless feet on the desk eyes gazing at the ceiling his thoughts still scrambled after all of it once or twice in the past few days his mind had returned to family and church matters but those pleasant diversions were always ruined when he thought of travis boyette loose on the streets keith had reminded himself countless times that he did not help boyette escapethe man was already roaming the streets of topeka a convict whod served his time and was lawfully reentering society he boyette had made the decision to leave anchor house and violate his parole before he convinced keith to become his chauffeur but keith was living with a knot in his stomach a constant nag that assured him he had done something wrong to take a break from boyette he yanked his feet off the desk and turned to face his computer the monitor was showing a web site for the kansas chapter of aadp americans against the death penalty and keith decided to join using his credit card he paid the annual fee now one of three thousand members and as such entitled to the online newsletter a monthly magazine with all the latest and other periodic updates from the staff the group met once a year in wichita details to follow outside of the church it was the first organization hed ever joined out of curiosity he looked at the sites of antideathpenalty groups in texas and found plenty he noticed the names of several groups hed seen in the news coverage the past two days the abolitionists down there were making the most of the drumm execution and there was no shortage of activity execution watch students against the death penalty texas network moratorium talk texans against legalized killing texans for alternatives to the death penalty one familiar name was death penalty focus keith went to its web site and was impressed membership was only keith pulled out his credit card and signed up he was enjoying himself and not thinking about boyette the largest and oldest group in texas was atexx an acronym for abolish texas executions it not only published extensively on the subject of capital punishment but also pushed its policies on the legislature built support groups for the men and women on death row raised money to defend those charged with capital crimes networked with dozens of other groups around the country and most impressively at least in keiths opinion reached out to both familiesthose of the victims and those of the condemned atexx had fifteen thousand members and an annual budget of million and offered membership to anyone willing to pay keith was in the mood and moments later he joined his third group sixty dollars later he felt like a certified abolitionist his intercom beeped and broke the silence charlotte junger announced theres a reporter on the phone i think you should talk to her wheres she from houston and shes not going away thanks he answered the phone this is the reverend keith schroeder reverend schroeder my name is eliza keene im with the houston chronicle her voice was soft her words unhurried her accent similar to the twang keith had heard in slone i have some questions about travis boyette his life flashed before his eyes headlines controversy handcuffs jail keith froze long enough to convince ms keene that she was on the right trail sure he said what was he supposed to say he would not lie and deny knowing boyette for a split second he thought about refusing to talk to her but that would set off alarms do you mind if i record our conversation she asked pleasantly yes no he had no idea well no he said good it helps me keep things accurate just a second a pause now the recorder is on okay keith said but only because it seemed as though something was needed on his end he decided to stall as he tried to gather his thoughts say uh ms keene i dont spend a lot of time talking to reporters is there some way i can verify that you are indeed a reporter for the houston chronicle is your computer on it is then im sending you my bio right now im also sending a photo taken outside the law office of robbie flak it was last thursday as mr flak and his team were leaving there are four people in the photo one wearing a dark jacket and a white collar ill bet thats you keith opened the email checked the attachment it was him he scanned her bio but knew it wasnt necessary nicelooking guy keith said we thought so that you yep did you witness the execution of donte drumm she asked and keiths mouth went dry he grunted cleared his throat and said why do you think i witnessed the execution we have obtained the records from the prison youre listed as a witness for the inmate plus one of the men standing behind you during the execution was a reporter not for us but for another paper he did not get your name i found it what would elmo laird advise him to do at this point stop talking perhaps he wasnt sure but he was impressed if she had the prison records and a photo then what else had she found his curiosity took over then i guess i witnessed the execution he said why would a lutheran minister from topeka witness an execution in texas she asked it was the same question keith had posed to himself at least a thousand times keith forced a chuckle and said its a long story a friend of donte drumms no travis boyette was staying at a halfway house in topeka then he pops up in slone texas any idea how he got there perhaps do you drive a maroon subaru kansas plates registration llz im assuming you have a copy of my registration i do and one of our reporters noticed the car in slone not many kansans stop over in slone any chance boyette hitched a ride with you another chuckle this one for real all right ms keene what do you want from me i want the story reverend schroeder all of it that would take hours and im not willing to spend the time not right now when did you first meet travis boyette one week ago today last monday and at that time did he admit to the murder of nicole yarber surely all confidentiality was gone boyette had broadcast his admissions to the world there werent too many secrets left some things though should be kept private keith wasnt obliged to answer the question or any others for that matter he was not afraid of the truth in fact he was determined not to hide it if his tracks were this easy to follow other reporters would be calling soon lets get it over with this is what im willing to say ms keene travis boyette visited our church sunday of last week he wanted to talk so he came back the following day he confided in me and we eventually made our way down to slone texas arriving last thursday around midday he was determined to stop the execution because donte drumm was innocent boyette went on the air admitted that he was the killer and gave the statement that weve all seen mr flak asked me to travel with him to huntsville i reluctantly said yes and one thing led to another i met donte and quite unexpectedly witnessed the execution the following morning boyette led mr flak and others including me to the place in missouri where hed buried the girl after that boyette fell ill i took him to a hospital in joplin and from there he managed to walk away i drove home ive had no contact with boyette since there was a pause on the other end as she digested this reverend schroeder i have about a thousand questions and im late for soccer practice good day maam keith hung up and hurriedly left the office fordycehitting hard ran a onehour segment during prime time monday night the event had been shamelessly advertised throughout the weekend and sean fordyce spoke to the world live from slone texas where he was still darting around in search of another fire or hopefully a dead body or a bomb blast the first half hour was the reeva show with lots of tears and anticipation of the execution there was footage of nicole as a little girl dancing in a recital and more of her bounding on the sideline as she cheered on the warriors there was a clip of donte mauling a running back and lots of reeva with the highlight being the postexecution interview in light of the obvious she looked foolish almost pathetic and it was obvious fordyce set her up for the kill there were close shots of reeva bawling without restraint then going mute as she watched the tape of boyette for the first time she was visibly shaken when boyette displayed nicoles class ring after that no more reeva in the second half fordyce ran a collage of videos and interviews and produced nothing that wasnt already known the piece was a mess it was ironic that a mouthpiece so enamored of the death penalty was airing an exclusive about a wrongful execution but irony was lost on sean fordyce he cared for nothing but ratings keith and dana watched it during his chaotic hours in slone and the frenzy to actually get there he had seen nothing of nicoles family hed read about reeva online but had not heard her speak at least the fordyce piece was good for something not having dealt with reeva he could easily feel sorry for her there was a phone call he had been delaying for several hours as dana prepped the boys for bed keith retreated to the bedroom and called elmo laird he apologized for disturbing him at home but things were changing rapidly and keith deemed the call important elmo said not to worry after keith explained in detail the conversation with eliza keene elmo suggested that perhaps they should worry probably not a good idea was his first response but she had the story mr laird the facts the paperwork the photo she knew everything i wouldve sounded stupid trying to deny things youre not required to speak to reporters you know i know but im not running from anyone i did what i did the truth is on the table i appreciate that pastor but you hired me to give advice there wouldve been a better time and place to tell your story a setting of our choosing im sorry i dont understand legalities right now im overwhelmed with the law and its endless procedures of course my clients usually are thats why they hire me so i screwed up not necessarily but get ready for all hell to break loose pardon my language pastor i expect coverage of this im not sure the drumm story can take any more ink but your story will certainly be a new wrinkle im confused mr laird help me here how will the coverage affect my case keith come on you really dont have a case there are no charges pending and there may never be i spoke with the district attorney this afternoon he and i are friends and while he was captivated with your story he wasnt gung ho to crank up a prosecution he didnt rule it out and again im afraid boyette is the key hes probably the most famous convict on the loose right now he was indicted for murder in missouri today did you see i saw it a couple of hours ago keith said his face is everywhere so maybe hell be caught i doubt if he comes back to kansas let missouri have him if hes locked up before he hurts someone i think the da here might close the book and the publicity about my involvement well see a lot of people around here will admire you for what you did i cant see much room to criticize you for trying to save donte drumm especially in light of what we know now well ride it out but please no more interviews you got it mr laird chapter keith slept off and on for four hours then finally got out of bed and went to the kitchen he checked cnn saw nothing new then opened his laptop and checked in with houston on chroncom there were several stories with robbie and his lawsuits getting the lead there was a photo of him waving some papers on the steps of the chester county courthouse he was quoted at length with predictable statements about hounding those responsible for the wrongful death of donte drumm to their graves none of the defendants including the governor commented the next story was about the reactions of the various antideathpenalty groups in the state and keith was proud to see atexx taking the lead there were demands for a number of drastic responsesthe usual moratorium on executions investigations of the slone police department the texas court of criminal appeals the governors handling of clemency the trial itself paul koffee and his office and on and on demonstrations were planned for noon tuesday at the state capitol in austin sam houston state university in huntsville texas southern university and a dozen other schools the longestserving member of the texas senate was a feisty black attorney from houston rodger ebbs and he had a lot to say he was demanding that the governor call an emergency session of the legislature so that a special inquiry could be initiated to investigate all aspects of the drumm fiasco ebbs was vice chairman of the senate finance committee and thus had considerable influence over every aspect of the states budget he promised to shut down the state government if a special session did not take place no comment from the governor drifty tucker the next man scheduled to be executed was suddenly in the news his date was november a little over two weeks away and his case dormant for a decade was attracting a lot of attention eliza keenes article was number four on the list keith clicked on it and saw the photo of himself robbie aaron and martha handler all looking quite serious as they left the train station for the trip to huntsville the headline was kansas minister witnessed drumm execution she covered the basics of the story and attributed several quotes to keith she too had witnessed an execution years earlier and was intrigued by how someone could be approved as a witness on such short notice no one from the prison would comment evidently she had contacted the flak law firm for a word or two but found no one willing to talk a counselor at anchor house said that reverend schroeder had stopped by at least twice the previous week looking for boyette he had signed the register boyettes parole officer was mum about half the article dealt with keith and boyette and their mad rush to texas to stop the execution there was a smaller photo of boyette taken when he addressed the reporters the previous thursday the second half of the report took a different turn and dwelled on keiths potential legal problems could the minister be prosecuted for knowingly aiding a felon in his flight to violate parole to get to the bottom of this ms keene called upon some experts a law professor at the university of houston was quoted it was an honorable thing to do but a clear violation of the law now that boyette is at large i suspect the minister might want to consult with a lawyer thanks loudmouth keith said to himself and the violation is anything but clear according to my lawyer perhaps you should do a bit of research before popping off in the press a criminal defense lawyer in houston said there may be a violation but looking at the whole picture i think the guy is a hero i would love to defend him before a jury a jury elmo laird was hoping for a quick quiet little guilty plea with a slap on the wrist thats what keith remembered anyway and to cover all angles ms keene chatted with a former texas prosecutor who was quoted as saying a crime is a crime regardless of the circumstances i would cut him no slack the fact that hes a minister is of no significance the fifth article was a continuation of the ferocious investigation into what happened in the governors office in the waning hours before the execution so far the team of journalists had been unable to smoke out anyone from inside the governors office who would admit to having seen the video of boyette making his confession the email was sent from the flak law firm at pm and robbie certainly made his server records available the governors office did not nothing was forthcoming his close aides and dozens who were not so close were marching in step and saying nothing this would probably change when the investigations began and the subpoenas started flying the fingerpointing would begin at am the phone rang caller id showed it as unknown keith grabbed it before it woke up dana and the boys a man with a thick accent possibly french said he was looking for reverend keith schroeder and who are you my name is antoine didier im with le monde a newspaper in paris i would like to speak about the drumm matter im sorry i have no comment keith hung up and waited for it to ring again it did he grabbed it gave an abrupt no comment sir then hung up again there were four phones in the house and he hurried through and punched do not disturb on all of them in the bedroom dana was coming to life who is calling she asked rubbing her eyes the french the who get up it might be a long day lazarus flint was the first black park ranger in east texas for over thirty years he had supervised the maintenance of rush point along the red river and for the past nine years he and his two staff members had patiently cared for the sacred ground upon which the family and friends of nicole yarber made their treks and conducted their vigils he had watched them for years they showed up every now and then and they would sit at the point near the makeshift cross they would sit and cry and burn candles all the while gazing into the river in the distance as if the river had taken her away as if they knew for certain that was her final resting place and once a year on the anniversary of her disappearance her mother made her annual pilgrimage to rush point always with cameras around her always wailing and carrying on they burned more candles packed flowers around the cross brought mementos and crude artwork and signs with messages they would stay until dark and always left with a prayer at the cross lazarus was from slone and he had never believed donte was guilty one of his nephews was sent away for a burglary he had nothing to do with and lazarus like most blacks in slone had never trusted the police they got the wrong man hed said many times from a distance as he watched nicoles family and friends carry on early tuesday long before anyone arrived at rush point lazarus parked his pickup truck near the shrine and slowly methodically began dismantling the junk he yanked the cross from the groundthere had been several crosses over the years each larger than the last he lifted the waxcovered block of granite upon which they stuck the candles there were four photos of nicole two laminated and two framed in glass a very pretty girl lazarus thought as he placed the photos in his truck a terrible death but then so was dontes he gathered tiny porcelain figures of cheerleaders clay tablets with printed messages bronze works with no discernible meanings baffling works of oil on canvas and bunches of wilted flowers it was a load of trash in his opinion what a waste lazarus said to himself as he drove away wasted effort time tears emotions hatred hope prayers the girl had been more than five hours away buried in the hills of missouri by someone else she had never been near rush point paul koffee entered the chambers of judge henry on tuesday at though it was lunchtime there was no food in sight judge henry stayed behind his desk and koffee sat in a deep leather chair one he knew well koffee had not left his cabin since friday night on monday he had not called his office and his staff knew nothing of his whereabouts his two court appearances both in front of judge henry had been postponed he looked gaunt tired pale with even deeper circles under his eyes his customary prosecutors swagger had vanished how are you doing these days paul the judge began pleasantly ive been better im sure you have are you and your staff still working on the theory that drumm and boyette were in cahoots were giving that some thought koffee said while staring out a window to his left eye contact was difficult for koffee but not for judge henry perhaps i can help here paul you and i and the rest of the world at this moment know full well that such a ridiculous theory is nothing but a sick lame desperate attempt to save your ass paul listen to me your ass cannot be saved nothing can save you and if you trot out this codefendant theory you will be laughed out of town worse it will only create more tension its not going to fly paul dont pursue it dont file anything because if you do ill dismiss it immediately forget about it paul forget about everything in your office right now are you telling me to quit yes immediately your career will end in disgrace get it over with paul until you step down the blacks will be in the streets suppose i dont want to resign i cant make you but i can make you wish you had im your judge paul i rule on every motion in every case i preside over every trial as long as you are the district attorney your office gets nothing out of me dont even file a motion because i wont consider it dont indict anyone ill quash the indictments dont ask for a trial because im busy that week nothing paul nothing you and your staff will be able to do nothing koffee was breathing through his mouth frowning at the judge trying to digest what hed just heard thats pretty severe judge if thats what it takes to get you out of office i could file a complaint judge henry laughed im eightyone years old and retiring i dont care koffee slowly got to his feet and walked to a window he spoke with his back to the judge i dont care either elias to be honest i just want to get outta here take a break run away im only fiftysix still young enough to do something else a long pause as koffee rubbed a pane of glass with a finger god i cant believe this judge how did this happen everybody got careless bad police work when theres no evidence the easiest way to solve a crime is to get a confession koffee turned around and took a few steps to the edge of the desk his eyes were moist his hands trembled i cant lie judge i feel rotten i understand im sure i would too under the circumstances koffee stared at his feet for a long time finally he said ill quit elias if thats what it takes i guess that means a special election eventually but i have a suggestion when you resign put grimshaw in charge hes the best of your assistants call in the grand jury and indict boyette for the crime the faster the better its a wonderfully symbolic actwe the judicial system in effect admit our mistake and we are now trying to rectify it by prosecuting the real killer our admission will do much to soothe feelings in slone koffee nodded and shook the judges hand keiths office at st marks received numerous calls throughout the day charlotte junger fielded them all explaining that the reverend was unavailable for comment keith finally arrived late in the afternoon he had been hiding at the hospital all day visiting the sick far away from phones and nosy reporters at his request charlotte had kept a log of all callers and keith studied it in his office door locked phone unplugged the reporters were from everywhere from san diego to boston miami to portland six of the thirtynine were from european papers eleven from texas one reporter said he was from chile though charlotte wasnt sure because of the accent three members of st marks had called to complain they did not like the fact that their pastor was accused of violating the law indeed he seemed to be admitting it two members called to express their admiration and support the story though had not yet made it to the topeka morning paper that would happen the next day and keith expected the same photo to be splashed all over his hometown luke the sixyearold had a soccer game under the lights and since it was tuesday the schroeder family ate at their favorite pizza place the boys were in bed by keith and dana by they debated whether to keep the phones silent but in the end agreed to remove the do not disturb hold and hope for the best if one reporter called they would silence the phones at the phone rang keith still awake grabbed it and said hello pastor pastor how are we it was travis boyette in anticipation of this unlikely event keith had rigged a small recorder to his phone he pushed record and said hello travis and dana came to life she scrambled out of bed flipped on a light switch grabbed her cell phone and began punching the number of a detective lang a man they had met with twice what are you doing these days keith asked just a couple of old friends lang had told him to keep boyette on the line as long as possible moving around cant stay in one place too long his tongue was thick his words slow still in missouri naw i left missouri before you did pastor im here and there you forgot your cane travis left it on the bed why did you do that dont need it never did i exaggerated a little bit pastor please forgive me i got a tumor but its been with me for a long time meningioma not a glioblastoma grade one benign little fella it acts up every now and then but i doubt if it will kill me the cane was a weapon pastor something i used for selfdefense you live with a bunch of thugs in a halfway house and you just never know when you might need a weapon country music was in the background he was probably in a seedy lounge but you had a limp well come on pastor if youre using a cane you need a little limp dont you think i wouldnt know travis you got some folks looking for you the story of my life theyll never find me just like they never found nicole have they buried her yet pastor no her funeral is thursday dontes is tomorrow i might sneak around and watch nicoles whatta you think about that pastor great idea they would not only catch him but probably beat him i think you should travis youre the reason for the funeral seems fitting hows that cute little wife of yours pastor bet you guys are having fun shes so fine knock it off travis keep him on the line you thought much about donte drumm not really we shouldve known those people down there wouldnt listen to us they would have travis if you had come forward earlier if we had found the body first the execution would not have happened still blaming me huh who else travis i guess youre still the victim right i dont know what i am tell you what though pastor i gotta find a woman know what i mean listen to me travis tell me where you are and ill come get you and bring you back to topeka ill leave right now well do another road trip just the two of us i dont care where you are youll be locked up here and then theyll extradite you to missouri do whats right for once travis and nobody else will get hurt lets do it pal i dont like prison pastor ive seen enough to know but youre tired of hurting people travis i know you are you told me so i guess i gotta go pastor call me anytime travis im not tracing these calls i just want to talk to you the phone line was dead an hour later detective lang was at the house listening to the recording they had been able to trace the call to the owner of a stolen cell phone in lincoln nebraska chapter the memorial service for donte drumm was to be held in the sanctuary of the bethel african methodist church regular capacity of but if folding chairs were wedged into every possible crevice and the choir loft was packed and the elders and young men stood two deep along the walls the capacity might reach when it was announced late tuesday night that classes would not resume phone calls were made plans were changed the service was moved to the high school gymnasium capacity of the time was set at pm with dontes burial to follow immediately thereafter at the greenwood cemetery next to his father by noon there were at least two thousand people inside the gym and more waiting patiently to get in dontes casket was placed at one end under a raised backboard and goal and it was surrounded by a massive sea of beautiful flower arrangements on a screen above his casket his handsome smiling face greeted those who had come to say goodbye his family sat in the front row in folding chairs and as the crowd moved in they gamely held on greeting friends hugging strangers trying to keep their composure a choir from his church stood near the flowers singing and humming soft comforting spirituals miss daphne dellmore a saintly spinster who had once tried quite unsuccessfully to teach donte drumm the basics of the piano accompanied the choir on an old upright baldwin to the right of the casket was a small elevated stage with a podium and a microphone and before it in rows of folding chairs the slone warriors sat together every player present along with their coaches and trainers they proudly wore their blue home jerseys other than the football players there were a few white faces sprinkled about but not many the media had been put in a box literally under the stern direction of marvin drumm the reporters and their cameras were bunched into a tight pack at the opposite end of the building under the opposing backboard and they were sealed off by a row of chairs laced with yellow police tape large young black men in dark suits stood next to the tape watching the reporters who had been warned not to make a sound any violation would lead to expulsion and quite possibly a broken leg out in the parking lot the family was sick of reporters as was most of the town roberta had wisely decided to close the coffin she did not want the last image of donte to be that of a lifeless corpse she understood that a lot of people would be watching and she preferred a smiling donte at twenty minutes after one the gym was completely packed the doors were closed the choir stopped and the reverend johnny canty stepped to the podium we are here to celebrate a life he said not to mourn a death it sounded good and there were a lot of amens but the mood was far from celebratory the air was heavy with sadness but not the sadness that comes from loss this was a sadness born of anger and injustice the first prayer was offered by the reverend wilbur woods the white pastor of the first united methodist church of slone cedric drumm had called him with the invitation which he readily accepted he gave a lovely prayer one that dwelled on love and forgiveness and most important justice the oppressed shall not remain the oppressed those responsible for injustice must one day face justice themselves reverend woodss voice was soft but strong and his words calmed the crowd the sight of a white pastor standing on the stage with his eyes closed his arms uplifted his soul bared for all to see soothed a lot of raw feelings if only for the moment donte had never discussed his funeral therefore his mother chose the music the speakers and the order of the service and it would reflect the strong christian faith of her family donte claimed to have given up his faith but his mother had never believed it the choir sang just a closer walk with thee and the tears flowed there were breakdowns loud emotional bursts followed by sobbing and wailing when things settled down two eulogies followed the first was by one of dontes teammates a young man who was now a doctor in dallas the second was by robbie flak when robbie walked to the podium the crowd instantly stood and began a restrained applause this was a church service clapping and cheering were frowned on but some things cannot be helped robbie stood for a long time on the stage nodding at the crowd wiping tears acknowledging the admiration wishing he didnt have to be there for a man whod spent the past few days raging at the world and suing anyone who crossed his path his comments were remarkably tame he had never understood the loveandforgiveness routine retaliation was what drove him but he sensed that at least for this moment he should tone down his pugilistic instincts and just try to be nice it was difficult he talked about donte in prison their many visits and even managed to get a laugh when recounting dontes description of the food on death row he read from two of dontes letters and again found humor he closed by describing his last few moments with donte he said dontes last wish was that one day when the truth was known when nicoles killer was identified one day when he was exonerated and his name was forever cleared his family and friends would meet at his grave in the cemetery throw a party and tell the world that donte drumm is an innocent man donte we are planning the party cedrics fourteenyearold son emmitt read a letter from the family a long gutwrenching farewell to donte and did so with a composure that was startling there was another hymn then reverend canty preached for an hour keith and dana watched the funeral live on cable from her mothers home in lawrence kansas the town of her youth danas father was deceased and her mother was a retired professor of accounting at the university of kansas after dropping the boys off at school keith and dana decided to hit the road to take a day trip and get out of town reporters were dropping by the church the phones were ringing the photo of him robbie martha and aaron was on the front page of the topeka paper that morning and keith was weary of the attention and the questions plus boyette was out there fantasizing about his wife and keith just wanted her close billie his motherinlaw offered to fix lunch and the offer was immediately accepted as they watched the funeral billie kept saying i cant believe you were there keith neither can i neither can i it was so far away and so long ago yet keith could close his eyes and smell the disinfectant used to clean the holding cell where donte waited and he could hear the gasps as the curtains flew open and the family saw him on the gurney tubes already in his veins as he watched the funeral his eyes moistened when he saw robbie so warmly received and he wept when dontes nephew said goodbye for the first time since leaving texas keith had the urge to go back donte was laid to rest on the side of a long sloping hill in greenwood cemetery where most of the blacks were buried in slone the afternoon had become overcast and chilly and as his pallbearers strained to carry him the last fifty yards a drum corps led the casket stepbystep its steady perfect rhythm echoing through the damp air the family followed the casket until it was carefully placed on top of the grave then settled into velvetcovered chairs inches from the fresh dirt the mourners gathered tightly around the purple funeral tent reverend canty said a few words read some scripture then gave the final farewell to their fallen brother donte was lowered into the ground next to his father an hour passed and the crowd drifted away roberta and the family remained behind under the tent staring at the lowered casket and the dirt scattered on top of it robbie stayed with them the only nonfamily member to do so at pm on wednesday the slone city council met in an executive session to discuss the future of detective drew kerber who was made aware of the meeting but not invited the door was locked only the six councilmen the mayor the city attorney and a clerk were present the lone black councilman mr varner began by demanding that kerber be fired immediately and that the city unanimously adopt a resolution condemning itself for its handling of the donte drumm affair it became readily apparent that nothing would be unanimous with some difficulty the council decided to postpone if briefly the passing of any resolutions they would take these delicate matters one step at a time the city attorney cautioned against the immediate firing of kerber as everyone knew mr flak had filed a mammoth lawsuit against the city and the firing of kerber would be tantamount to an admission of liability can we offer him early retirement hes only been here sixteen years doesnt qualify we cant keep him on the police force can we transfer him to parks amp rec for a year or two that ignores what he did in the drumm case yes it does he needs to be fired and so i take it that we the city plan to contest the allegations of the lawsuit are we seriously going to claim we have no liability thats the initial position of our insurance lawyers then fire them and lets find some lawyers with good sense the thing for us to do is to admit our police were wrong and settle this case the sooner the better why are you so sure our police were wrong do you read newspapers do you own a television i dont think its that clear thats because youve never seen the obvious i resent that resent all you want if you think we should defend the city against the drumm family then youre incompetent and you should resign i may resign anyway great and take drew kerber with you kerber has a long record of bad behavior he shouldve never been hired and he shouldve been fired years ago its the citys fault hes still around and im sure this will come out in court right oh yes court is anyone here in favor of going to court in this case if so then you need an iq test the debate raged out of control for two hours at times all six seemed to be talking at once there were threats insults lots of namecalling and flipflopping and no consensus though it was generally felt that the city should do whatever possible to avoid a trial they finally votedthree to terminate kerber three to wait and see as the tiebreaker the mayor voted to get rid of him detectives jim morrissey and nick needham had taken part in the marathon interrogation that produced the fateful confession but both had left slone and moved on to police departments in bigger cities chief joe radford had been the assistant chief nine years earlier and as such had almost no involvement in the yarber investigation a motion was made to fire him too and it failed for lack of a second mr varner then raised the issue of the teargas assault in civitan park the previous thursday night and demanded that the city condemn its use after another hour of hot debate they decided to postpone further discussion the streets were clear and quiet late wednesday night after a week of gathering protesting partying and in some cases breaking laws the demonstrators protesters guerrillas fighterswhatever they called themselveswere tired they could burn the entire town and disrupt life for a year but donte would remain peacefully at rest in greenwood cemetery a few gathered in washington park to drink beer and listen to music but even they had lost interest in throwing rocks and cursing the police at midnight the orders were given and the national guardsmen made a quick and silent exit from slone chapter the summons from the bishop came by email early thursday morning and was confirmed by a brief phone conversation in which nothing of substance was discussed by am keith and dana were once again on the road this time headed southwest on interstate to wichita as he drove keith recalled the same journey only a week earlier same car same radio station but with a very different passenger he had finally convinced dana that boyette was crazy enough to stalk her the man had been arrested innumerable times so he wasnt the craftiest criminal on the prowl until he was caught keith would not let his wife out of his sight keith was ignoring the office and the church danas nonprofit work and jampacked daily planners had been placed aside only the family mattered at the moment if they had the flexibility and the money keith and dana would have loaded up the boys and taken a long trip she was concerned about her husband he had witnessed a uniquely disturbing event a tragedy that would haunt him forever and though hed been thoroughly unable to stop it or intervene in any manner he was nonetheless burdened by it he had told her several times how dirty he felt when the execution was over how he wanted to go somewhere and take a shower to cleanse himself of the perspiration and grime and fatigue and complicity he wasnt sleeping and he wasnt eating and around the boys he worked hard to carry on the usual banter and games but it was forced keith was detached and as the days passed she was beginning to realize that he was not snapping out of it he seemed to have forgotten about the church he had not mentioned a sermon or anything related to the upcoming sunday there was a pile of phone messages on his desk all waiting to be returned hed corralled their assistant minister into presiding over the wednesday night dinner blaming it on a migraine hed never had a migraine never faked being ill and never asked someone to pinchhit in any situation when he wasnt reading about the drumm case or researching the death penalty he was watching cable news some of the same segments over and over something was brewing the bishop was a man named simon priester a huge round ball of an old man who was married to the church and had absolutely nothing else to do but micromanage those under him though only in his early fifties he looked and acted much older with no hair except matching white patches above the ears and a grotesque abdomen that bulged out and hung grossly over the hips there had never been a wife to scold him about his weight or make sure his socks matched or do something about the stains on his shirt he spoke in soft slow words hands usually clasped in front of him as if waiting for every word to come from above behind his back he was known as the monk usually in an affectionate tone though often otherwise twice a year on the second sunday in march and the third sunday in september the monk insisted on preaching at st marks in topeka he was a crowd killer the few who came to hear him were the hardiest of the flock but even they had to be cajoled into attending by keith dana and the staff because of the slim crowds the monk was overly concerned about the health of st marks if you only knew thought keith who couldnt imagine larger crowds at other churches on the monks tour the meeting was not urgent though the initial email began with dear keith i am deeply concerned simon had suggested a possible lunch his favorite pastime sometime the following week but keith had little else to do in truth a quick trip to wichita gave him an excuse to leave town and spend the day with dana im sure youve seen this simon said after they were properly arranged at a small table with coffee and frozen croissants it was a copy of an editorial in the morning edition of the topeka paper something keith had read three times before sunrise i have keith said with the monk it was always safer to use as few words as possible he was brilliant in taking the loose ones piecing them together and tying them around your neck hands clasped after a bite of croissant that had not been fully consumed because a large crumb was stuck on his lower lip the monk said dont get me wrong here keith we are quite proud of you what courage you threw caution to the wind and raced off to a war zone to save a mans life dazzling actually thank you simon but i dont remember feeling that brave i just reacted right right but you mustve been terrified what was it like keith the violence death row being with boyette mustve been horrible the last thing keith wanted to do was tell the story but the monk looked so eager come on simon youve read the papers keith tried to protest you know what happened keith humor me what really happened so keith bored himself while humoring the monk who added to the narrative every fifteen seconds with a bewildered unbelievable or a clucking my my once while he was shaking his head the crumb was dislodged and fell into his coffee but the monk did not notice in this rendition keith chose the chilling phone call from boyette as the final chapter my my typical of the monk they had begun with the unpleasantthe editorialthen switched to the enjoyablekeiths brave journey southand suddenly it was back to the real purpose of the meeting the first two paragraphs of the editorial commended keith on his courage but that was just the warmup the remainder chastised him for knowingly violating the law though the editors like the lawyers struggled to set forth the exact violation i assume youre getting topnotch legal advice the monk said obviously anxious to give his version of the necessary advice if keith would only ask i have a good lawyer and come on simon you understand the nature of confidential relationships the monks overloaded spine managed to stiffen chastised he plowed on of course i didnt mean to pry but this does have our attention keith there is the suggestion that there could be a criminal investigation that you could be in hot water so to speak and so on this is hardly private im guilty of something simon i did it plain and simple my lawyer thinks that i may one day find it necessary to plead guilty to some vague obstruction of justice charge no jail small fine record to be expunged later there the monk ate the last of his croissant with one savage bite and chewed on matters for a while he washed it down with a slug of coffee he wiped his mouth with a paper napkin and when everything was properly cleared said assume you plead guilty to something keith what would you expect from the church nothing nothing i had two choices simon play it safe stay in kansas and hope for the best or i could do what i did imagine for a moment simon if i had done otherwise if i had known the truth about who killed the girl and i had been too timid to move they execute the wrong man they find the body and for the rest of my life i carry the guilt of not trying to intervene what would you have done simon we admire you keith honestly the monk replied softly completely ducking the question what concerns us though is the prospect of a prosecution one of our ministers accused of a crime and in a very public way the monk often used the word us when driving home a point as if all the important leaders in the christian world were focused on whatever pressing matter the monk had on his agenda and if i plead guilty keith asked that should be avoided if at all possible and if im forced to the monk shifted his sizable frame yanked on the sagging lobe of his left ear then reclasped his hands as if ready to pray our synodical policies would require the initiating of a disciplinary procedure any criminal conviction would mandate this keith im sure you understand we cant have our ministers going to court with their lawyers standing before judges pleading guilty getting sentenced with the media stumbling all over themselves especially in a case like this think about the church keith how would i be punished its all premature keith lets worry about it later i just wanted to have the first conversation thats all i want to get this straight simon i stand a very good chance of being disciplined whether suspended placed on leave perhaps defrocked for doing something that you deem admirable and the church is very proud of right right keith but lets not jump the gun here if you can avoid prosecution the problem is averted happily ever after something like that just keep us in the loop we prefer to hear the news from you not the newspaper keith nodded his mind already drifting away classes resumed without incident thursday morning at the high school when the students arrived they were greeted by the football team again wearing their home jerseys the coaches and cheerleaders were there too at the main entrance smiling and shaking hands and trying to set a mood of reconciliation inside in the lobby roberta cedric marvin and andrea chatted with the students and teachers nicole yarber was buried in a private ceremony at on thursday afternoon almost exactly one week after the execution of donte drumm there was no formal funeral or memorial service reeva simply wasnt up to it she was advised by two close friends that a large showy service would not be well attended unless reporters were allowed besides the first baptist church had no sanctuary and the thought of borrowing one from a rival denomination was not appealing a strong police presence kept the cameras far away reeva was sick of those people for the first time in nine years she ran from publicity she and wallis invited close to a hundred family members and friends and virtually all showed up there were a few prominent noshows nicoles father was excluded because he had not bothered to witness the execution though as reeva was forced to admit to herself in hindsight she wished that she had not witnessed it either things had become quite complicated in reevas world and not inviting cliff yarber seemed appropriate at that moment she would regret it later she would not regret excluding drew kerber and paul koffee two men she now loathed they had misled her betrayed her and wounded her so deeply that she would never recover as the architects of the wrongful conviction kerber and koffee had a list of victims that was growing steadily reeva and her family had been added brother ronnie who was as weary of reeva as he was of the media presided with a subdued dignity that fitted the occasion he spoke and read scripture and as he did so he noticed the perplexed and stunned faces of those in attendance all were white and all had been convinced beyond any doubt that the remains in the bronze coffin before them had been swept away by the red river years earlier if any had ever felt the slightest sympathy for donte drumm and his family they had kept it from their pastor they had relished the thought of retribution and execution as had he brother ronnie was trying to make peace with god and find forgiveness he wondered how many of those present were doing the same however he did not wish to offend anyone especially reeva so his message was on the lighter side he had never known nicole but he managed to recount her life with stories shared by her friends he assured everyone that nicole had been with her father in heaven all these years in heaven there is no sorrow so she was oblivious to the suffering of the loved ones she left behind a hymn a solo another reading of scripture and the service ended in less than an hour nicole yarber finally received a proper burial paul koffee waited until after dark to slip into his office he typed a terse letter of resignation and emailed it to judge henry with a copy to the clerk of the court he typed a slightly longer explanation to his staff and emailed it without bothering to check for typos he hurriedly dumped the contents of his center desk drawer into a box then grabbed whatever valuables he could carry an hour later he walked out of his office for the last time his car was packed and he was headed west a long road trip with alaska as the likely destination he had no itinerary no real plans no desire to return to slone in the near future ideally he would never return but with flak breathing fire down his neck he knew that was not possible he would be dragged back for all manner of abusean arduous deposition that would go on for days a likely date with a disciplinary committee from the state bar perhaps a punishing ordeal with federal investigators his future would not be pretty he was fairly certain he would not face the prospect of jail but he also knew he could not survive financially and professionally paul koffee was ruined and he knew it chapter every store in the mall closed at pm and by lilly reed had turned off the registers punched the time clock engaged the alarm system and locked both doors of the ladies boutique where she worked as an assistant manager she left the mall through a service door and walked quickly to her car a vw beetle which was parked in an area designated for employees she was in a hurry her boyfriend was waiting at a sports bar half a mile away as she was opening the door to her car she felt something move behind her and heard a footstep then a strange male voice said hey lilly in a split second lilly knew she was in trouble she turned got a glimpse of the black handgun saw a face she would never forget and tried to scream with astonishing speed he slapped a hand over her mouth said get in the car and shoved her inside he slammed the drivers door slapped her hard across the face then stuck the gun barrel in her left ear not a sound he hissed and get your head down almost too horrified to move she did as she was told he started the engine enrico munez had been napping on and off for half an hour as he waited for his wife to finish her shift at a family restaurant in the malls food court he was parked between two other cars in a row of empty vehicles he was still halfasleep and he was sitting low in the seat when he saw the attack the man seemed to appear from nowhere and knew what he was doing he displayed the gun but didnt wave it around he overwhelmed the girl who was too stunned to react as soon as the beetle lurched forward with the attacker at the wheel enrico reacted instinctively he started the engine of his pickup truck lunged into reverse backed up then sped forward he caught the beetle as it was turning at the end of the row and understanding the gravity of the situation did not hesitate to crash into it he managed to avoid the passenger door where the girl was and plowed into the right front tire immediately upon impact enrico thought about the pistol and realized he had left his at home he reached under his seat grabbed a sawedoff baseball bat he kept just in case jumped across the top of the beetle and as the man was getting out enrico slammed the bat into the back of his shiny slick head he would later tell his friends it was like smashing a melon the man was flailing on the asphalt and enrico hit him again for good measure the pistol was only a toy but it looked authentic lilly was hysterical the entire episode lasted less than a minute but she was already bracing herself for a nightmare she scrambled out of her car and began running the commotion attracted others mall security arrived in minutes then the police and an ambulance enrico relinquished his prisoner who was still on the ground and began telling what happened the attacker had no wallet no identification nothing in his pockets but in cash he refused to give his name at the hospital xrays revealed a hairline crack of the skull thanks to enrico and a brain tumor the size of an egg he was treated and placed in a secured room investigators collected fingerprint samples and detectives attempted to interrogate him he was wounded and drugged and gave them nothing several policemen and detectives were in and out of the room and one finally made the connection i think its that boyette character he whispered and suddenly everyone else thought so too but the man denied it two hours later the fingerprints were matched and his identity was confirmed ten hours earlier on the other side of the world two black hawk helicopters collided over the desert near fallujah in central iraq killing nineteen members of a texas national guard unit the tragedy was just what governor newton needed with barry and wayne in neareuphoric agreement they decided the governor should dash off to iraq and show real leadership in the war on terror the trip would also push him onto a larger stage and provide great footage for future use and most important it would get his ass out of texas his staff worked frantically to rearrange schedules get military clearance make sure the press was properly alerted and sweat the rest of the details for the trip early friday morning the governor wayne and barry met for a briefing they caught boyette last night wayne said looking at his laptop he jumped a girl outside a mall in overland park kansas no sexual assault hes in custody he was in kansas the governor asked yep bright boy the governor shook his head in disbelief fifty states and he stays in kansas a moron whats the latest from slone barry said guards all gone da resigned last night all bodies buried streets are quiet no fires classes resumed yesterday without incident and the football team plays on the road tonight against lufkin go warriors the governor picked up a report barry was burning up his laptop all three were haggard and spent testy and slightly hungover they gulped coffee chewed their nails and never thought they would be so excited about a trip to iraq we have an execution in twelve days gentlemen the governor said whats the plan wayne replied proudly got it all worked out ive had drinks with a senior law clerk at the court of appeals obviously theyd prefer to postpone the next one for a while i told him we are in no hurry either word is being routed to the lawyer for drifty tucker that he should file something anything just dream up some wild claim for relief and get it filed preferably before pm the court will show unusual interest in mr tuckers case and issue an order no opinion attached but will stay the execution until some undetermined point in the future theyll bury tuckers case one day hell probably read our obituaries i like it the governor said smiling and when is the next one not until july eight months away eight months wow yep we got lucky the governor looked at barry and said how are things this morning here or national barry asked both here the big story is of course the black hawks in iraq but drumm is still frontpage news they buried the girl yesterday front page on a dozen papers more editorials everybody wants a moratorium the deathpenalty folks are insane they are expecting twentyfive thousand at a rally here on sunday where at the capitol across the street itll be a zoo and well be in lovely fallujah the governor said i cant wait wayne said barry continued on the national front its more of the same rants by the left not much on the right the governors of ohio and pennsylvania are talking openly about moratoriums until the death penalty can be studied some more thats about right newton mumbled a lot of noise from the abolitionists but its all beginning to sound the same theres so much overkill that the screaming is becoming monotonous what about the polls barry stood and stretched his legs i talked to wilson early this morning weve lost ten points on the issue with percent of the registered voters in texas still in favor looks like i win the bet boys pay up the surprising numbers are on the issue of a moratorium sixtyone percent want the death penalty but almost percent favor a hiatus of some sort thatll go down wayne said with authority let the shock wear off wait till theres another home invasion with an innocent family murdered and folks will forget about drumm theyll forget about a moratorium and remember why they favor the death penalty the governor stood and walked to his favorite window there were protesters on the street below holding signs and parading back and forth along the sidewalk they were everywhere it seemed outside the governors mansion on every lawn of the capitol and in front of the entrance to the court of appeals with signs that screamed we close at five go to hell from aging hippies to students against the death penalty they crossed all ethnic and social lines he loathed them they were not his people gentlemen ive made a decision newton said gravely im not in favor of a moratorium and im not calling a special session of the legislature to deal with it to do so would create a spectacle we have enough facing us already we dont need the legislature creating another circus we need to inform the media barry said prepare a statement release it after we take off for iraq friday afternoon keith went to elmo lairds office for a short meeting dana was busy hauling kids and couldnt be there not that she really wanted to be with boyette in custody keith was willing to let go of her and she needed a few hours away from her husband boyettes final assault and subsequent arrest were being widely covered and keith was taking some shots lillys father was quoted as saying some of the blame lies with that lutheran minister in topeka and that angle to the story had gained momentum in light of boyettes record lilly reeds family was relieved that the assault had gone no further but still angry that such a career rapist was free and able to traumatize their daughter the early reports slanted the story to read as though keith had busted boyette out of prison and fled with him to texas elmo explained that he had talked to the da and while there were still no immediate plans to prosecute keith the situation was fluid no decisions had been made the da was getting calls from reporters and taking some heat whats your best guess keith asked same plan keith ill keep chatting with the da and if he moves forward we will work out a plea agreement a fine but no jail if i plead guilty ill probably face some type of disciplinary action by the church anything serious nothing is clear as of now they agreed to meet again in a few days keith drove to st marks and locked himself in his office he had no idea what his sermon would be on sunday and was not in the mood to work on one there was a pile of phone messages on his desk most from reporters the monk had called an hour earlier and keith felt obliged to see what he wanted they talked for a few minutes long enough for keith to get the message the church was deeply concerned about the publicity and the likelihood that one of its ministers would face charges the conversation was brief and ended with the agreement that keith would go to wichita on the following tuesday for another meeting with the monk later as keith was tidying up his desk and preparing to leave for the weekend his secretary buzzed and said a man with abolish texas executions was on the line keith sat down and picked up the phone his name was terry mueller the executive director of atexx and he began by thanking keith for joining the organization they were delighted to have him on board especially in light of his involvement in the drumm case so you were there when he died mueller said obviously intrigued and fishing for a few details keith hit the high points of the story in a quick summary and to change subjects asked about atexx and its current activities as the conversation went on mueller mentioned that he was a member of the unity lutheran church in austin its an independent church spun off from the missouri synod a decade ago he explained downtown close to the capitol a very active congregation we would love to have you come speak sometime thats very kind keith replied the idea that he would be sought as a speaker caught him off guard after they hung up keith went to the churchs web site and killed an hour unity lutheran was well established over four hundred members and its imposing chapel was built of red texas granite same as the state capitol building it was politically and socially active with workshops and lectures ranging from eliminating homelessness in austin to fighting the persecution of christians in indonesia its senior pastor was retiring chapter the schroeders celebrated thanksgiving with danas mother in lawrence early the following morning keith and dana left the boys at their grandmothers and flew from kansas city to dallas where they rented a car and drove three hours to slone they roamed around the town looking for points of interestthe baptist church the football field with a new press box under construction the charred remains of a few empty buildings the courthouse and robbies office at the old train station slone seemed very much at peace with city crews stringing christmas decorations back and forth over main street from his first visit two weeks earlier keith remembered little about the town itself he described to dana the everpresent smoke and the constant wail of sirens but looking back he had been in such a state of shock that everything had been a blur at the time the thought of returning never entered his mind he was in charge of boyette there was an execution pending a body to locate reporters everywhere it had been frantic chaos and his senses could only handle so much now driving the shaded streets of downtown he found it difficult to believe that slone had recently been occupied by the national guard the feast began around five and since the temperature was in the high sixties they gathered beside the pool where robbie had rented tables and chairs for the occasion his entire firm was there with spouses and partners judge and mrs henry arrived early the entire drumm clan at least twenty in number including small children arrived in one wave keith sat next to roberta though they had been in the same witness room when donte died they had never actually met what do you say at first the conversation was awkward but before long they were on the subject of her grandchildren she smiled often though it was obvious her thoughts were elsewhere two weeks after losing donte the family was still in mourning but they worked hard to enjoy the moment robbie proposed a toast a lengthy tribute to friendship and a brief memorial to donte he was so grateful that keith and dana could join them all the way from kansas and this brought light applause within the drumm family keiths mad dash south in an effort to stop the execution was already a legend when robbie finally sat down judge henry stood up and tapped his wineglass his toast was to the courage of roberta and her family and he ended by saying that something good comes from every tragedy when the speeches were over the caterers began serving thick sirloins smothered in mushroom gravy with more sides than could possibly fit on a plate they ate well into the night and though roberta drank only tea the rest of the adults enjoyed the fine wine robbie had shipped in for the occasion keith and dana slept in the guest room and left early the next morning to eat breakfast in a main street cafe known for its pecan waffles then they drove again using robbies directions they found the greenwood cemetery behind a church at the edge of town the grave will be easy to find robbie had said just follow the path until you see fresh dirt the footpath was grass that had been worn thin ahead a group of ten or so pilgrims were holding hands around the grave and having a prayer keith and dana pretended to look for other headstones until they cleared out dontes grave was a neat pile of red dirt ringed by dozens of bouquets of flowers his large headstone read donte lamar drumm born september wrongfully executed by the state of texas on november here lies an innocent man in the center was an eightbyten engraved color photo of donte in shoulder pads and blue jersey all suited up and ready to play keith knelt by the headstone closed his eyes and offered a long prayer dana looked on her feelings were a mix of grief for the tragic loss sympathy for her husband and an ongoing confusion about what they were doing at that moment before they left keith snapped a quick photo of the grave he wanted a memento something to keep on his desk the conference room at the train station hadnt changed robbie and carlos were toiling away on a saturday morning with files and stacks of paper scattered among plastic coffee cups and empty pastry wrappers robbie gave dana the grand tour complete with an overblown history that keith had managed to avoid on his first visit their first farewell had been deep in the woods at roops mountain and at the time they were not sure if they would ever see each other again now two weeks later when they embraced they knew it would not be for the last time robbie thanked keith again for his heroic effort keith demurred and said that robbie was the real hero both agreed that they had not done enough though they knew they had done everything possible the drive to austin took seven hours on sunday keith spoke to an overflow crowd at unity lutheran church he told the story of his improbable journey to slone and then to huntsville to the death chamber he dwelled on the death penalty attacked it on all fronts and got the clear impression he was preaching to the choir since it was an official trial sermon the church covered all of the expenses for the trip after the service keith and dana lunched with the pastor search committee and the reverend dr marcus collins the retiring senior minister and a muchrevered leader during lunch it became obvious that the church was enamored of the schroeders later as the prolonged goodbyes were under way dr collins whispered to keith youll find a wonderful home here epilogue on december the chester county grand jury called in session for a rare saturday meeting indicted travis boyette for the abduction sexual assault and murder of nicole yarber the interim da mike grimshaw had assumed his responsibilities with strict orders from judge elias henry to get the indictment the day had been carefully chosen by judge henry to coincide with the ninth anniversary of the arrest of donte drumm at one oclock that afternoon a crowd gathered in his courtroom for an unusual hearing robbie had filed a motion to declare donte not guilty and exonerated and the state acting through grimshaw was not contesting the motion judge henry wanted the event covered and publicized but he detested the notion of cameras in his courtroom several reporters were present but none with cameras it was another robbie flak show for an hour he went through the facts as they were now known and clicked off the mistakes lies coverups and such with the outcome of the hearing certain he did not belabor any point when he finished mike grimshaw stood and announced your honor the state of texas does not dispute anything mr flak has said judge henry then read a short order that he had obviously prepared long before the hearing its final sentence read this court hereby finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant donte l drumm is not guilty of all charges is absolutely innocent of all charges and is hereby fully and completely exonerated his conviction is hereby reversed and his record is expunged on behalf of this court and on behalf of the state of texas i offer a sincere and thoroughly inadequate apology to the drumm family with great drama judge henry signed his order then handed it down to robbie as scripted robbie walked to the bar and handed it to roberta drumm in the first row the texas court of criminal appeals was still in its bunker a mole had begun whispering and when news broke about the duty judge the story hit page one though the court did indeed close at pm even on execution days chief justice prudlowe assigned one of the nine as a duty judge who was actually inside the building and supposedly monitoring the lastminute appeals in theory a frantic lawyer could call the duty judge and get some type of response from the court it was a reasonable idea and not unusual for courts weighing life and death however the story exploded when it was learned that deathpenalty lawyers in texas knew nothing about the courts use of duty judges their existence was kept quiet by the court itself so when cicely avis arrived at the texas court of criminal appeals at on the day of dontes execution one hand holding a box of papers and the other hand banging on the locked door there was actually a justice upstairs in his office ostensibly on guard the court announced that it was adopting the electronic filing of all petitions and pleadings but denied that this change in procedure was a result of the drumm case a complaint against prudlowe was filed by the state commission on judicial conduct two years would pass before the commission ruled that while his conduct was unprofessional he did not engage in serious wrongdoing and he should keep his job the petition that did not get filed included the affidavit signed by joey gamble the only alleged eyewitness at the trial legal experts debated the significance of his lastminute recantation and what the court should have or would have done with it joey left slone then texas he blamed himself for what happened to donte and found solace only in the bottle on december the last friday in keith and dana walked into an empty courtroom in topeka at pm and were met by elmo laird matthew burns showed up for moral support though keith needed none a judge appeared then an assistant prosecutor in less than ten minutes keith pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction of justice he was fined given one year of probation and one year of unsupervised parole elmo laird was confident that within three years his record would be expunged when asked by the judge if he had anything to say keith replied yes your honor i would do the same thing again if presented with the opportunity to which the judge said god bless you as expected the monk informed keith that he was immediately being placed on a leave of absence keith said not to botherhe was resigning on sunday keith announced to his congregation at st marks that he was leaving to become the senior minister at unity lutheran church in austin texas travis boyette now faced life in kansas death in missouri and death in texas for a year the three states wrangled often publicly about what to do with him when he told a kansas judge that he strangled nicole in missouri the judge ordered him transferred to newton county since he had confessed repeatedly he had no desire to defend himself in a trial sixteen months after his trip to slone he was sentenced to death by lethal injection and sent to the potosi correctional center paul koffee was eventually disbarred by a state ethics panel he left slone and became a bail bondsman in waco drew kerber filed for bankruptcy and moved his family to texas city where he found a job on an offshore oil rig martha handler won the race to the printing press and published the first of what promised to be a flood of books about the drumm case her book was on the bestseller lists for almost a year her relationship with robbie and the drumm family soured when they could not agree on splitting the money the indictment of travis boyette and the exoneration of donte drumm put even more pressure on governor gill newton to summon the legislature to austin to deal with the aftermath of the execution the governor and his advisers had hoped the passage of time would erode interest in the matter but that was not happening deathpenalty opponents were ramping up their efforts and sharpening their tactics and they were being cheered on by much of the national press the black caucus led by senator rodger ebbs of houston had only grown louder their vow of closing down the states government until a special session was held appeared more and more likely and the poll numbers were not trending the governors way a clear majority of texans wanted the state to take a hard look at its execution business they still wanted the death penalty and by a wide margin but they wanted some assurance that its use would be limited to those who were actually guilty the idea of a moratorium was so widely discussed that it was gaining support finally the poll numbers got the best of him and governor newton called the senators and house members to the capitol since he dictated the limits of what could be considered the agenda would be a resolution on drumm a moratorium on executions and the creation of an innocence commission to study the problems it took three days to pass the resolution which upon final approval declared donte exonerated of all guilt and awarded million to his family when filed and every member of the black caucus was a cosponsor the bill called for an award of million but the legislative process had whittled away all but a million the governor a tightfisted fiscal hawk at least on the campaign trail expressed his usual concern over excessive government spending when the houston chronicle ran its frontpage story it included the fact that the governor and his staff had spent over on their recent trip fighting terror in fallujah the moratorium bill ignited a political war its original language sought a twoyear stop on all executions during which time the death penalty would be studied from all angles and by all manner of panels and experts committee hearings were televised witnesses included retired judges radical activists wellknown researchers even three men who had spent years on death row before being exonerated outside the capitol rowdy demonstrations were held virtually every day violence erupted on several occasions when deathpenalty proponents got too close to its opponents the very circus the governor feared had come to town since the moratorium fight originated in the senate the house began work on what was initially known as the donte drumm commission on innocence as conceived it would be a fulltime commission with nine members who would study the roots of wrongful convictions and work to correct the problems at the time texas had seen thirtythree exonerations most by dna evidence with an alarming number from dallas county another series of committee hearings were held with no shortage of enthusiastic witnesses after settling into their new home in late january keith and dana went to the capitol often to watch the proceedings they were in the crowd during several protests and they watched the legislature suffer through the tortured process of coming to grips with a major problem they along with most observers soon had the impression that nothing was going to change as the special session dragged on the name of adam flores began to appear in the news after twentyseven years on death row flores was to be executed on july in another life he had been a petty drug dealer who had killed another petty drug dealer during a bad night his appeals were ancient history he had no lawyer the legislature recessed in late march then reconvened the first week in may after months of bitter infighting the obvious had become even more so it was time to forget this little war and go home on final passage the moratorium failed in the senate by a vote of twelve in favor and nineteen against all votes along party lines two hours later the house voted seventyseven to seventythree against the creation of the innocence commission on july adam flores was escorted to huntsville and met by warden ben jeter he was placed in the holding cell and counseled by the prison chaplain he ate his last mealfried catfishand said his last prayer at precisely pm he made the short walk to the death chamber and twenty minutes later he was pronounced dead he had no witnesses and there were none for his victim there was no one to claim his body so adam flores was buried in the prison cemetery alongside dozens of other unclaimed death row inmates dress up the facts im afraid the mistakes will continue my hope is that the errors are insignificant in nature
