the old mythology by brian w aldiss the seepers weebed down on the tall sides of every urbhive hundreds thousands ceased their scootering to gaze upwards in delight envy or catatonia at the radiant female face glowing on their windowfree walls the entire urbstack was alight with the eyes the pert nose the pink gums and immaculate teeth of doradeen englaston she spoke soon i will become day just plain day i am just so excited because of all this and this luck that has just happened to me here we are on the very first day of the wonderful twentysecond century and i have won lucky me the just first prize in the competition my prize is that i just get to be projected on the tdp the fantabulous temporal displacement projector wow zoom zoom went the mecheye until it was almost lost between those tender red lips cosying up to the epic epiglottis the tdp is just going to send me back to any place in time i choose when i will wind up in the character of a chosen person of the chosen period isnt that just cute the machine is switching on right now doradeen had been an actor in a supersoap there was hardly a sincere bone left in her body that body now began to writhe as the tdp gained power golly gosh it feels so strange im definitely on my way now the event horizons of past time fluttered past her oh yes why there just goes the british empire and golly gosh the romans greece who are they the cythians never heard ofcythians her voice was fainter now her image on the urbstack walls smaller oh am i glad to escape the horrors of my own century the commercialism the shootings the hair dyes the drugs and above all else just the miseries of family life wow thats why im going back to the eolithic when the world was new before we weebed at all i want to belong to an ordinary decent stoneage family with a kind father and lots of affectionate siblings theres a new just horizon ahead bounding with love and simple oldfashioned family values doradeens voice faded below scooting resumed all about stretched a great forest no man could tell where lay its limits the great trees ran until rank on rank they reached the oceans here and there small communities had been established in one community pigs rooted and grunted tied by their legs to stakes their lives were as frugal as those of their human captors they chuntered their dislike of domesticity where once this clearing stood is now a place of highways sweeping into the distance filling stations and gigantic urbstacks the butterflies have gone together with the little blueeyed flowers much has changed but not the family life that doradeen craved harmon preened himself in preparation for the feast his sons had announced this feast to be a celebration of his power he trimmed his whiskers with the edge of a shell he anointed his shoulders with oil crushed from a rare herb he secured a bright feather in his hair he put on a new gown tying it so that it covered his stomach and lower regions he looked every inch a lord then he set forth walking stiffly clouds loomed overhead the day was as yet hardly spent the sun god had spread layers of mist to hang close to the ground the mists curled away as harmon progressed through them towards the meeting ground constant bird song was interrupted by a distant bugle note in the clearing a wooden throne had been erected harmons three daughters were taking up positions by the throne decoratively on either side of it the daughters were young and scantily clad in the elaborately dressed hair of their heads they wore orange flowers and in the hair upon their mounds of venus one wore small blue flowers and the second small red flowers and the third day wore a sprig of laurel in the vital places the dark daughter was by name via the fair one roa they beckoned to their father with formal waves of their hands so did brunette day a little uncertainly for she had once been doradeen so long ago it seemed like a fairy tale harmon paused scenting danger he gripped more firmly the staff he carried he looked about him moving his old shaggy head from side to side there seemed no reason for alarm slowly he approached the throne his kissed first roa then via then day on their cheeks the girls expressed no emotion only day thought to herself this is just fun wow back in the stone age with my new sisters im already getting into character they inclined their faces to receive his prickly old kisses harmon gathered the folds of his robe about him and seated himself on the throne which until recently had been a log the bugle note sounded again he spoke with a hint of impatience to his daughters where is the feast to which my sons invited me wait a little father said roa try to be patient you will soon get all you deserve father said via just somethings bound to happen thought day she gave a little wriggle from different parts of the great forest three youths emerged they carried in outstretched arms before them in the gesture of those bearing gifts a sword a dagger and an axe he who carried the sword was by name woundrel he who carried the dagger was by name cedred he who carried the axe was by name aledref aledref cedred and woundrel came dressed only in loinskirts with horned black leather caps on their heads aledref carried a bugle slung over one shoulder these were the sons of harmon young ferocious alert they approached their father their weapons they laid by their own feet they bowed to harmon who received them with courtesy so my sons i greet you warmly growled harmon looking more displeased than his words might suggest although you are late what is this ceremony i expected to be feted here by feasting by food and flagons of wine why bring me weapons when i wish for a young virgin why bring me such faces as yours wearing mirthless expressions we come to kill you father said aledref our weapons are for death not celebration said cedred but first we will hear what you have to say said woundrel say ive nothing to say roared harmon dont you dare speak of killing ive always been a good father to you and to the girls fed you wiped your dirty little bottoms when you were babies carried you on my back when you were toddlers let you swarm all over me taught you how to run how to fight told you stories of my own youth how i killed that dragon cedred said ah you never killed no dragon you made that up son you dont know what naked courage means by jarl what a life you led me what a damned nuisance you were spoiling my sleep ruining my siestas wrecking my love life even when i had managed to get your mother down on her back and we dont want to hear shouted aledref harmon pointed a quivering finger at him oh you can smirk aledref but you were the worst a stupid arrogant kid yet i sacrificed years to your welfare aledref spoke with chill in his voice our complaint is not with what you did or did not do father but with what you are oh and what am i exactly in your thickheaded estimation cedred answered his voice as cold as his elder brothers you are a nonentity father thats what we most resent thats why we are about to kill you me a nonentity why you fool im the source of your life im known all about for my martial skills do i not laugh weep bleed pee with some force and splendour and many other things a non what i never heard such nonsense i wouldnt think you three added up to much either didnt i invent that flying machine it crashed father said aledref only because you did not flap the wings rapidly enough thats enough talk father cedred said glancing at aledref for approval youre full of bluster as usual now its time to kill you woundrel intervened saying let father make a last sacrifice to the sun god before he dies bugger the sun god roared harmon ill knock your blocks off with my staff if you dare come near me turning to his daughters via roa and day he said what do you think your poor dead mother would say if she could hear these impertinences girls via laughed oh shed say like father like sons i imagine youve always made light of things you little bitch said harmon he turned to roa have you got a good word for me roa dear you know how ive always loved you the best of the lot really dad yet you forgot my birthdays you were always away when i wanted you wouldnt come near me when i was ill you were always a sickly little creature sickly i was undernourished you have always given precedence to these three greedy pigs of boys made me wait on them and clean up after them although it must have been obvious even to you that i was far more intelligent than they were who was it who first thought of cooking and flavouring meat with herbs why me of course mother had the idea for the herbs said day quietly and congratulated herself for having slipped in the remark mother exclaimed roa with disgust mother what did she ever do a useless bit of goods personally father i think you chose to mate with her because she was so stupid you really really needed someone who was more stupid than you no wonder your sons turned out to be such morons look whos talking exclaimed aledref who accidentally sat on a python who invented dresses who fell in the stream and had to be rescued when she was a girl roa retorted angrily i fell in because you deliberately let go of my hand as i was leaning over the river bank and what was i doing trying to teach you how to tickle a trout but no you and those stupid moronic brothers of yours could not learn the art just as youve never learnt to fish with a line as for stop it roared harmon shut up this instant all of you youre always bickering you always bickered you always will bicker youre all a pain in my neck between you youve made my life miserable ive never married again because you lot were always around so the argument continued the sun god rose pale and etiolated while the family brought up old grudges and rehearsed them once silence fell when the children of harmon lay in the damp grass trying to remember other older grievances harmon it was who leaning on his staff arose sighing deeply and brushing dirt from his robe well old as i am im off im going to leave you to your own devices im going to enjoy a real life in my declining years aledref picked up the axe which had lain at his feet throughout the morning you dont escape from us that easily father youd always be hanging about somewhere trying to mess up our lives not no more are you ready boys woundrel held up a hand no lets not be too hasty aledref i mean when you think of it theres something in what father says about our always bickering i wondered but were not always bickering cedred exclaimed youre the one who bickers when did i bicker i always keep my trap shut otherwise aledref hits me i havent hit you for years but you are a bit of a thug lets face it im not im your protector who fought off that baboon last week i was trying to make a pet of it oh jarl you two creeps exclaimed woundrel breaking into this dialogue roa is right we certainly behave like morons roa is more intelligent and certainly nicer looking roa blew woundrel a kiss come to bed with me again tonight my darling brother she called right thats enough said harmon i declare the meeting closed its getting near lunchtime lets go via prepare us something simple dont go to too much trouble no more of that iguana with larks thrust down its throat and lets all have a pleasant afternoon you could go down by the river bank with no bickering all friendly together at his words aledref immediately seized his axe and cedred his dagger you dont get away like that were going to kill you you nonentity right now via jumped forward waving her hands in distress she stood in front of her father confronting her brothers wait i know perhaps father deserves to be killed for all the awful things he has done and for the good things he failed to do like at least in my case educating me but you might have the goodness to kill him honestly forget all this nonentity business were all nonentities oh yes we are aledref or else why would we still be living in this miserable forest why have i got no decent flowers to stick in my hair we are a bit primitive said day laughing nervously the others ignored her jarl how the girl goes on exclaimed aledref sneering at via get out of the way darling or you may be killed too if you wish to come back into my bed tonight you had better listen to what i have to say via told him flaunting her hips she walked over to her father and put an arm condescendingly on his shoulder father these silly boys are unable to tell you why they are about to kill you their powers of analysis are limited so i will tell you the truth is that whatever they do they feel themselves stifled by your presence they cant have a mature life until you have gone you may or may not be a nonentity but it is your life your being on earth which stifles their existence harmon had cowered on his improvised throne before his sons threats now he had collected himself he answered his daughter calmly in a quiet voice no that is not the truth of the matter i do not stifle their lives this feeling stifled is an expression of their own inadequacy it has little to do with me in fact i am their hope your hope aledrefs cedreds woundrels roas days and yours my dear good via because when i am transfixed by the sun gods arrows when i am gone from this world into the arms of the sun god then you will find that his gaze will be fixed on you you will be the next generation to depart as long as i am here walking about boozing sweating chasing women swearing shitting whatever it is you most dislike about me you can feel safe once im gone well those golden arrows will be aimed at your miserable selfish hearts a silence fell as his words sunk in even aledref turned his fierce gaze to the ground as he attempted to think it was as if he already felt that golden bow drawn and that arrow which brought death turned in the direction of his vitals day gathered courage to speak we cant just kill pa just like that there has to be a proper trial besides what would mother think of us you know its possible she is watching us from well just from another sphere maybe she is looking down on us even now i have a theory that she simply turned into a deer and just ran off into the forest roa laughed scornfully turned into a hippo more like but day would not be deflected she told them that there was a spiritual aspect to all of what she called the silly talk of killing she told them that they must realise that their father if just murdered might become an even worse threat to their wellbeing and his ghost returnto haunt them maybe the ghost she said would poison the water hole or infest just the hut with cockroaches woundrel told her loftily that cockroaches had yet to evolve the things crawling about were trilobites he stamped on one as it went past it seemed to day that there were certain conditions here she might easily improve while they were on the subject of housing she said it was just very unhealthy to have a wood fire in the middle of the hut it was smoky and smoking was bad for them she rounded on her brothers asking them why they just did not build a stove and a chimney instead of lying around all day were tired said cedred its the malnutrition i cant quite visualise a chimney said woundrel im thinking of getting married said aledref harmon was thoughtfully regarding his toes i have never married again you lot were always hanging around with your miserable disparaging remarks bickering always bickering now im going to leave you to your own devices my declining years are to be spent in real independence oh dear oh golly gosh exclaimed day are you always so cruel to each other it makes the twentysecond century seem just nice how do i get back there i wonder via clouted her for talking nonsense day burst into tears which served to make the others laugh well ive had my say now im off said harmon with a sigh as he rose from his seat aledref barred his way he said that as long as his father was alive he would always be somewhere in the neighbourhood making them feel inferior he turned to his brothers to run a finger suggestively across his throat woundrel told him to wait claiming that there was after all something in what their father said about them always bickering cedred denied they were always bickering in any case youre the one who bickers when did i ever bicker woundrel asked angrily if i dont keep my trap shut aledref hits me aledref denied it he had not hit woundrel in years cedred told him that nevertheless he was a thug aledref denied that too had he not been cedreds protector he had fought off the baboon attacking cedred only a week ago you scared it off yes said cedred but i was trying to make a pet of it youre always interfering in my life woundrel was lying on his back trying to make a daisy chain with his feet and toes he glanced scornfully at his brothers you two creeps are always yakking on roa was right when she said we were morons we certainly behave like morons roa is much more intelligent than we will ever be besides which she smells nicer and is nicer looking roa blew woundrel a kiss and invited him to come into her bed again at nightfall didnt we go through all this before asked day uneasily their memories seemed alarmingly short harmon clapped his hands and declared the meeting closed turning to day he ordered her to go and prepare the sort of delicacy he had been hoping for such as baked lizard with thrushes stuffed down its throat day recoiled at the mere suggestion she blew her nose on a leaf as harmon rose shifting uneasily from one foot to the other aledref picked up his axe and cedred his dagger they advanced on their father calling him a nonentity and saying they were about to strike via moved protectively in front of him wait she said i know father deserves all he gets not only for the bad things he has done but for the good things he failed to do such as not teaching me astronomy or giving me an education ive no idea what twice two could be but after all we are nonentities ourselves the very dregs of evolution oh thats just not true day interposed at least i dont think its true id guess you are homo erectus perhaps that was a blind just alley dont talk rubbish said aledref pushing her aside i dont know about you girls but ive evolved from an ape a higher ape out of the way kids or youll get yourselves killed via kicked him in the shin youd better listen to me if you want to come into my bed tonight so shut up she turned to her father doing creepy movements with hands outspread on either side of her head to hold his attention father these stupid boys of yours dare not let on about the real reasons why they want to kill you so i will tell you the truth is they feel stifled by your presence they feel they cant lead a mature life until you are dead and gone the words made harmon explode seldom had he heard such nonsense he said he had never tried to stifle anyone whereas his own father had always tried to stifle him they were just inadequate that was the truth and were looking for excuses in fact he was their only hope their one and only hope what day exclaimed doesnt religion come into the picture you must have some religion surely harmon ordered her to keep the sun god out of the argument now im off he said making to go no please wait father said woundrel coming forward laying a hand on his fathers arm i dont see this matter quite as via does theres some truth in what she says but shes only a girl and things are easier for girls dont you believe it shrieked roa pig but woundrel was not to be deflected and continued to speak in a quiet voice you see as long as you are still swaggering about well aledref and cedred and i dont well were just sons i mean we are no more than sons youre my sons the old man said proudly thats the problem we want to be men not sons you are men pretty feeble men what are you talking about harmon glared at his son why has no one invented psychiatry what i am trying to say is that we shall feel ourselves to be real men only when you have gone from the earth killing you is necessary for us to live as men free mature in control of our own destinies in other words killing you is a sort of initiation rite explained aledref like this raising the axe above his head he brought the blade down on his fathers shoulder close to his left ear harmon uttered a cry he endeavoured to swing his staff but cedred rushed in and sank his dagger into his fathers stomach as harmon fell backwards his staff went flying through the air to fall some feet away roa seized it ran forward and smashed it against her fathers skull take that for all your wickedness she cried the three of them aledref cedred and roa beat at the old man as he rolled over on to his stomach he attempted to rise drawing himself to his knees but they smashed him down again with axe dagger and staff they worked away cursing and gasping long after harmons soul had fled into the arms of the sun god jarl thats enough cried aledref exhausted were men now the three of us after clasping roas and cedreds hands he sat down on his fathers crumpled body and wiped the sweat from his brow dont sit there like that cried roa youll get all bloody and then wholl have to wash your loinskirt coming forward woundrel appealed to aledref so youve done the deed at least lets have the decency to eat him now forget it what did he ever do for us turning to his other brother and to roa aledref clicked his fingers he rose pushing woundrel aside day was shrieking horror horror she cried and my family were baptists just they severed their fathers head and his genitals and buried them in the clearing from his stomach they pulled out his intestines and threw the length of them into the forest woundrel stood watching the proceedings in silence pale of face via burst into tears and ran from the clearing that night preparing their supper eyes still blinded by tears she accidentally plucked a poisonous herb with which to flavour the stew they all became sick when the sun god next spread his cloth of dawn over the world all the children of harmon were lifeless but from the buried head of harmon grew the tree of knowledge and from his buried genitals two persons were created a man and a woman and from the intestines lying in the forest a serpent was created and the man and woman innocent in their nakedness looked on the world and found it good at least until the serpent turned up and so a new myth was born
