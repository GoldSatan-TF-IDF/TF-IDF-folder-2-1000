two women brian freemantle we will use the full weight of the law to expose and root out corruption when abuses like this begin to surface in the corporate world it is time to reaffirm the basic values that make capitalism work there can be no capitalism without conscience no wealth without character us president george w bush demanding new ethics of personal responsibility from american business leaders after a series of wall street scandals july one a lice said its all right its not i love you we dont have to make love every time to prove were in love that just makes it screwing ugly john carver turned away his back to her she said its not just this is it this didnt help do you want to talk about it its business boring businesss never boring alice belling had graduated from harvard business school with a letter of introduction to a boston stockbroking firm and the overly confident and quirky idea of turning her degree thesis on corporate avarice eroding american entrepreneurialism into an oped commentary for the wall street journal unable to decide which to try first she wrote off to both at the same time the oped piece which prompted two more articles and two days of topofthepage correspondence was published three days before alice got an invitation to join the stockbrokers her choice was a freelance media career specializing in analyses and commentary on global finance and corporate stock market movements and trends in the past year shed exposed insider dealing and profit inflation in two multinationals just prior to new bond issues business and family further qualified carver involving jane its complicated turn around and talk to me properly insisted alice and hold me i like it when you hold me he turned back reaching out for her and she came easily comfortably into his arms she said youre wonderful so are you you know what id like what to go up to the cabin again soon ive got the annual conference i didnt mean now just soon its been more than two months theyd taken a long time finding the perfect woodbuilt cabin in the bearfort mountains alongside a small river feeding into one of the west milford lakes on the bedroom bureau alice had a timerelease photograph of herself and carver there she with her hand in front of her face because she hadnt been ready when the shutter clicked and another in the living room carver was by himself in that shot wearing a lumberjack shirt and hiking boots and proudly displaying the fish hed caught his first ever on their initial visit lets get the conference out of the way one or two other things well make a long weekend out of it and you can take the toy one of the rituals involved in the visits to the catskills was their going in alices carefully preserved volkswagen her proudest souvenir of her college days thank you and you can fish again im sorry that today stop it you know what i wish i dont want to go that route either refused alice you cant we both know it and i accept it im happy the way things are with us its enough she clamped his leg between both of hers bringing them tightly together she slightly on top of him how was georges birthday this weekend george w northcote was carvers fatherinlaw and founder of the wall street accountancy firm that bore his name and represented a fortyyear symbol of propriety and rectitude carver said he came over for dinner jane gave him some golf clubs which he looked at as if theyd come out of an egyptian tomb how is he the affair between carver and alice had developed from their meeting when she had come to wall street to interview northcote for a profile for forbes magazine northcote had a copy framed not so good he even sometimes forgets the end of his sentences and gets mad when anyone tries to help he told me he was frightened of retiring of atrophying with nothing to do alice remembered from their interview the problem is his still trying to do too much hes refusing to let go of a few clients to give himself the reason to come into the city at least two days a week his firm his name she anticipated no one can ever be as good as he is in george w northcotes opinion carver agreed holding her like he was naked was enough for him today too what are the other partners saying so far there havent been any major mistakes for them to discover but i am going to have to keep a check on what he does to make sure it stays that way he hasnt yet realized im doing it but i feel like a goddamned spy going behind his back conspiring against him youre talking the firm his firm with his name on it thats exactly what im talking about agreed carver again a firm he might be endangering youre just putting off confronting him postponing it they never discussed it secure as they were with each other but alice knew that despite selfconfidence verging on arrogance carver would always be intimidated by the overwhelming personality of george northcote the sheer physical presence even of someone tall and weighing almost lbs you imagine i havent worked that out theyd never before seriously argued fallen out and alice who had never felt intimidated by anyone was unsettled by the unexpected vehemence in his voice so whens it going to happen maybe even today hes in town and there are things he needs to explain then demand an explanation i will you talked to jane about it not like this alice felt a brief warmth of intimacy shouldnt you shes his daughter shes been proposed for the charity secretaryship at the country club hes agreed to help her with the accounts thats what the golf clubs were for to try to get him to spend more time at the club itll get in the way of his other hobby one of the accompanying photographs in alices forbes profile had portrayed northcote in bibandbrace overalls astride a tractor mower on which he frequently relaxed supervising the gardeners at his weekend estate in upstate new york the caption had given his wall street nickname of farmer george janes not happy at his doing that any more either thinks its dangerous at his age you dont think golfs going to be the alternative he hasnt played regularly for years he hesitated charity secretary will mean jane staying up in the country more alice didnt say anything i could stay over sometimes id like that would you you know i would when will she know soon certainly by the fifteenth lets hope she gets it its pretty guaranteed can you make friday he shook his head all the overseas executives are starting to arrive from wednesday onwards for the conference ive got another forbes commission i can work on youre soon going to need your own accountant i thought i had one you have call me let me know what we can fix of course and its a promise about the cabin she shifted slightly looking beyond him to the bedside table its gone three already these business lunches get longer and longer you should be going and i should be working im sorry i stop it ive got a feeling that theres a serious problem he suddenly blurted alice pulled away from him what i want to be sure first youre not making sense thats the problem it doesnt make sense she separated from him entirely going up on one elbow the sheet fell away from her but she didnt try to cover herself has george made a bad mistake shed eulogized him in the profile put her own judgement on the line he could have done then youve got to talk to him today i know he had chosen to talk it through with her decided alice feeling a warm intimacy again can you put it right i dont know not yet it might help if you told me about it and we tried to think of a way together i cant involve you darling what is it he shook his head not speaking so its bad it could be could you be in serious trouble it depends what i do you know the answer to that youve got to do the right thing thats all you can do it might not be that simple please let me help i wont involve you any more than i already have he refused again he twisted abruptly out of the bed but stayed sitting on its edge his back towards her again i shouldnt have said anything but you did now its stupid to stop ive got to speak to george then will you speak to me i dont know it depends on what too many things that even i dont know about not yet youve frightened me that wasnt true she was irritated at his refusal im sorry i didnt mean oh shit we are going to talk about it alice insisted if not now then soon talk about it and fix it id like to think we could that i could we can i have to go talk to him this afternoon yes call me later if you can if i can alice remained in bed watching him dress loving him as he moved to leave she said whatever it is it cant be the end of the world carver kissed her holding her tightly against him for several moments but left without replying with the concentration upon the annual conference it was easier than usual for carver to plan his days to include alice leaving himself with only two easily satisfied clients and the mornings dictated letters to sign when he called his fatherinlaw george northcote said you just caught me got a meeting here in town tonight staying over we need to talk george tomorrow my meetings at six so well talk tomorrow lunch maybe now george insisted carver its important what the hell are you talking about you me the firm everything thats what i think im talking about everything two thered better be a hell of a good reason for this greeted northcote the voice was big like everything about the man he remained seated at the antique desk hunched over it bullshouldered beneath a mane of white hair it was a familiar confrontational pose carver had seen the other man adopt dozens of times with irs inspectors and company tax lawyers and opposition challenging accountants i think there is said carver or was he overinterpreting imagining an aggressive defensiveness about the older man maybe or maybe not there was enough for him to question this man who had always been unquestionable again the qualification came the problem was that there wasnt enough there was a huge gaping black hole that had to be filled with something he could understand what carver lowered himself into a facing buttonbacked chair i happened upon some current working figures for three of our oldest clients your oldest clients companies that for years have made up the bedrock of our business he hesitated at the moment of commitment mulder incorporated encomp innsflow international a flush began to suffuse northcotes face accentuated by the pure whiteness of his hair but when he spoke the loudness had gone from his voice none of your business how in the vaults your safe was open and it is my business because im taking over this business which i intend to do as a memorial to you spy accused the other man i went to close it properly which you hadnt done my personal clients the unaccustomedly subdued voice trailed away yes george picked up carver always your personal clients and still your personal clients whom no one else had anything to do with retained with the full agreement of the partners yourself my successor as senior partner included in signed minutes why wondered carver had northcote felt it necessary to remind him of his succession to the chairmanship upon his fatherinlaws semiretirement or of the minutes acknowledging northcotes continued handling of the three accounts being officially signed and recorded they never went through general audit havent done for years always your personal audit and you always personally signed them off there is no regulation security exchange commission or otherwise requiring that they should go through general audit everything was perfectly legal carver decided that northcote wasnt sufficiently outraged offended at his having gone into a safe to which he officially had no right wasnt even asking the proper questions all three are offshore which is declared there is no contravention of any regulation theyve all grown since their formation all those years ago wellrun wellaudited and wellaccounted companies all grow and return profits mulder inc has a seven hundred and fifty million dollar entertainment investment worldwide encomp has five hundred and fifty million dollars of utilities supply portfolios again worldwide innsflow international is diversified into publishing hotels and entertainment in europe the far east and even russia youve spent a lot of time checking on me there was still no outrage i did check george inhouse called them up on the computer theyre on the client list but thats all just listed as names and holdings there arent any details apart from that theyre offshore there dont need to be computer records any records on file for offshore countries carver sighed heavily feeling like an irritating fly bouncing from impenetrable window to impenetrable window youre a legend on wall street george i want it to stay that way you deserve for it to stay that way im still waiting for you to make your point the figures dont add up not the ones you left in your open safe they do on whats been submitted by their accountants for independent audit by you and which youve signed off but they dont if theyre audited properly youve legally attested their accuracy and by doing so exposed this firm your firm to criminal investigation youve sanctioned a massive profitinflating operation on a scale that i havent been able yet to calculate am frightened to calculate theyre being floated right blown up to suck in the punters open at ten finish the week at two hundred insider traders getting out with enough to buy the villa in the caribbean or south of france before the bubble pops northcote snorted a laugh you want my advice on that assessment dont try to calculate anything its not advice i want its explanation i told you we were talking about you me and the firm about everything and thats precisely it if this ever became public if carver actually just stopped himself from saying that if it ever became an innuendo in the sort of financial commentary alice belling was so adept at compiling the house this house all our houses would come tumbling down you think started northcote lost his way and then managed believe i havent worked all that out id like to know exactly very exactly what you have worked out and where you where we all are going from here nowhere declared northcote thats precisely and exactly where were going nowhere at the annual meeting i am going to announce the reluctant severing with this firm of mulder incorporated encomp and innsflow international their choosing alternative independent auditing accountants will be based upon their longstanding personal relationship with me which the partners already know about and recognize and which is being brought to an end by my finally and fully retiring northcote smiled at last which is what i am going to do live in the country cut my grass help jane with her charity fundraising and start playing with my new golf clubs just like that said carver snapping his fingers just like that echoed northcote mocking the finger snap with one of his own whats it all about george you dont need to know that i do if i am going to protect this firm keep it safe im protecting the firm who are they you dont need to know that either they know what youre going to do thats why i stayed on for the extra year to tidy things up and to bring it all to an end you think i there was another familiar hesitation its all going to be resolved going to be seized carver at once hasnt it been yet its my problem im sorting it out carver gazed around northcotes mahoganypanelled leatherchesterfielded office with its cornerwindow glimpse of battery park city and the intervening pillared monuments to wealth and power and corporate cunning for once for the first time not feeling the comfort and the pride of being part of it he said im aware of a possible criminal activity there are regulations governing that quite a lot in fact northcote looked blankly at him then indignantly close to being bigvoiced again he said dont be ridiculous im being professional in everything youve said every inference youve made youve assumed ill go along with what youve got in mind everything youve got in mind but wont tell me northcote held up a hand a long time ago when i was first starting out and needed every break i could get the block came but he made jerky gestures with the still raised hand against carver intruding i got caught up in a situation which developed as it did innocently caught up with no idea what was happening until i was involved couldnt get out ive lived with it all these years now its over im promising you that its over im leaving you with one of the foremost accountancy firms in the financial world youre already a rich man and youre going to become richer youve got it all and not just because im handing it over to you because youre good the successor i hoped you would be and because you deserve it i you he stumbled once more to a halt you earned it you trying to tell me youre now going to tear it all down pull all the houses down to use your words by going to the sec or whoever to put the gun into your own mouth and pull the trigger at that moment carver wasnt sure what he was telling anyone and certainly not what he was being told were involved with organized crime the mafia northcote took a long time to reply finally he said im handling it you going to be able to give me an unbreakable assurance that by friday itll all be over what was he saying why was he accepting it dead and buried insisted northcote at once who im seeing tonight is their representative he looked at his watch and im already late there was another brief smile i telephoned to warn him hell be waiting i want to come with you announced carver northcote snorted yet another dismissive laugh it began and it ends with me only me the protection for this firm and for you is your knowing nothing your meeting no one i do know youre staying away out of it you said you were staying over tonight yes we have to talk tomorrow i need a lot more guarantees youve got them tomorrow insisted carver tomorrow we talk specifics lunch agreed northcote itll be our own farewell celebration nothing had emerged the way it should have done the way hed wanted what hed wanted fervently hoped for was boomingvoiced offence and a provable pointbypoint figurebyfigure denunciation of his every suspicion what hed got instead amounted to a confirmation a nearimmediate admission of fraud and false accounting and involvement in organized crime which meant mafia and criminal conspiracy and criminal complicity and probably a lot more indictments he couldnt and most certainly didnt want to think of it was all too much too overwhelming to contemplate what did he want to think of the best answer or was it the right answer and was the best and right answer the easiest way out or the most difficult hed examined george northcotes argument from every which way and from every which way what the older man had said about bringing the house down around him throwing his own words back at him made the only logical sense of course he would prove his professional integrity and rectitude by disclosing the indications of crime to the sec to every governing authority but in so doing hed bring about the collapse of one of wall streets most prestigious and internationally trusted financial names every sort of criminal and governingbody investigation would take months during which they would most likely be suspended and during which any proper work would in any case be impossible and there would also be the personal fallout no matter how right and correct his actions he would publicly be seen and despised as a man totally destroying his own fatherinlaw by exposing the man at the age of sixtyseven to inevitable imprisonment and an inevitable multimilliondollar fine and even if george northcote accepted every responsibility in wall street in the global financial village the mud would stick and those clients who didnt despise him personally would rush to wash their hands of all and every association george w northcote international would be relegated as another greeddriven illegally operating financial pariah hello my names jane and im your wife so engrossed was he that carver physically started at his wifes voice smiling apologetically across the dinner table sorry i was thinking darling you were so deep in thought you were out of sight you havent said a word for at least the last thirty minutes or eaten a thing carver sipped his wine setting his knife and fork aside i ate a big lunch he lied how would their marriage withstand his blowing the whistle on her father her mother had died when jane was fourteen and practically from the time she was sixteen until their marriage and even after jane had been at her fathers side at all the charity events hed sponsored and hosted which were literally beyond count the feeling the bond between father and daughter was umbilical jane whom carver sometimes thought to be even stronger than her father would be the person to despise him the most i dont ever remember you like this trying to sort out one or two things in my mind making choices involving me she asked with coquettish confidence you know the answer to that he smiled back trying to match her lightness there was no feeling of hypocrisy or guilt both of which hed long ago rationalized as he had all the uncertainties about morality john carver was not a promiscuous man indeed hed sometimes considered himself undersexed his affair with alice was his first and he was sure it would be his last and hopefully lasting hed never consciously set out to seduce alice belling nor she him george northcote had introduced them when alice had come for the first interview session and hed asked carver to handle any subsequent questions which he did on three occasions twice over lunch the fourth occasion at her apartment on the west side had been to read the finished article which was immaculately factual and in his opinion brilliantly written which he told her and her intended joking kiss of gratitude had become something more when hed inadvertently turned towards her shed said why did you do that and hed said why did you do that and theyd kissed again intentionally this time and after theyd made love theyd solemnly agreed it was one of those unexpected accidental things that had been wonderful and should be immediately forgotten hed telephoned the following day and theyd lunched together and gone to bed together and the excitement the flattery of his first sexual dalliance had become a deeply loving affair which was what it was quite simply he loved two women neither of whom were endangered by the other carver would never leave jane nor did he want nor intend ever to leave alice if their relationship ended it would be alices decision which she insisted shed never make and if she did he knew he would consider it an unsought and very much unwanted divorce the word divorce lodged in his mind refocusing it carver was sure jane loved him as much as she was able as she ever would maybe even that there would be love bruised wounded but still some love if jane ever learned about him and alice but he was equally sure surer even she wouldnt be able to love him stay married to him if he were responsible for publicly ruining and humiliating a father she adored at once the conviction that jane would reject him overwhelmed his fear of what effect any disclosure would have upon the firm and even more upon him personally it must be important for you to be like this im sorry he repeated not knowing what else to say you want to tell me about it ive gotten things out of proportion he said shaking his head thats what i meant about making choices which wasnt it at all im trying to balance things he never compared jane with alice or alice with jane because they were incomparable but physically they were remarkably similar except for the most obvious difference of jane being naturally deep brunette against alices blondness again natural there was nothing to choose a wrong word because he would never choose between them in height nor in their smallbusted slimness the difference was in their personalities their imbued motivations jane had always been cared for cosseted accustomed from childhood to the best although she had by no judgement or criticism certainly not by him grown from a spoiled child into a spoiled woman jane was someone grateful of her privileged upbringing recognizing her advantages and working always to give back which she did sometimes with an almost relentless determination better fitted to a business environment than a charity organizer indeed carver had occasionally wondered why northcote had not groomed jane to take over the firm upon his retirement carvers reflection stopped at the thought knowing what little he did now about george northcotes criminal involvement was the most likely answer to that uncertainty alices character had come from a similar but cracked mould as far as carver understood although it was not a biography hed deeply explored her parents had at one time briefly been even richer and she more indulgently cared for than jane but her father had been a bullandbearmarket gambler whose fortunes appropriately rose and fell upon his prediction of which way the market would go his disastrously misplaced switch between bull and bear when the markets were going in the opposite direction and not reversing when hed further invested in the expectation that they would financially ruined alices family alice was left with a suicide note of apology a final year at harvard business school a roller coaster personal awareness that money was a buyorsell marketable commodity not the green stuff in her purse and a street savvy to invest her way extremely comfortably to her graduation ceremony unrecorded upon that graduation certificate although an indication perhaps of how successfully she would later pursue her chosen headsortails career was that alice belling was not just a woman totally emancipated in mind body and attitude but more inherently streetwise than her finally unabletocope father hello again shit thought carver its not my best night is it is it a big problem whatever it is i dont bring work home remember that wasnt even true you just did lets forget it jane she looked surprised at the tone in his voice its nothing to do with us is it absolutely not promise i promise he should have handled everything better than this did you see dad today briefly hes going back up to litchfield tomorrow i know it had been janes urging that they buy a weekend house less than five miles from her father in litchfield county both close to woodridge lake i thought i might drive up with him for company why dont you do that manuel came enquiringly into the dining room and jane said to carver do you want anything else dessert he shook his head im full thats a lie but ok to the butler she said after youve cleared away we shant need you any more tonight thank you tell luisa it was a wonderful meal as usual but we werent hungry neither manuel nor his wife who cooked lived in den or where she asked carver den he decided following her along the linking corridor the eightroom duplex on east nd street had been her fathers wedding present you want a brandy no thanks im worried about dad she announced worried how so often losing the thread of what hes saying thats why i want to go up with him tomorrow persuade him to see dr jamieson itll take some persuading i want you to help me how i want him to stop work completely thatll be twice as difficult as getting him to see a doctor but im asking you to try ill do my best said carver i really will stanley burcher was unique and knew it and was not concerned that no one else ever would because fame or rather notoriety held no interest for him the total opposite in fact stanley burcher prided himself upon being the person no one ever saw or noticed he was a totally asexual bachelor whose only sensuality came from his association with the people for whom he practised and the knowledge of their criminality total evilness and the people he acted for in such an unusual way were totally evil fascinated him as anthropologists are fascinated by unknown species which burcher recognized himself to be too because he was not revulsed by anything they did burcher maintained a small house on the unfashionable north side of grand cayman in the caribbean and a boxnumbered office in the capital georgetown because grand cayman was the taxavoidance haven in which the people he represented hid their vast fortunes however he lived for the majority of the time in distinguished but discreet hotels throughout the world ensuring that the affairs of his exclusive clients never attracted public attention most particularly from any lawenforcement authority the harvard club in which he waited that night just off new yorks fifth avenue represented an unaccustomed luxury as did most of his regular meeting places with george northcote burcher liked the meetings and he liked northcote northcote was a man who like himself had been presented long ago with an opportunity taken it and prospered he was surprised at northcotes lateness northcote had never before delayed an appointment and was now running later than the rescheduled time but at that moment he appeared at the maitre ds station sorry im so damned late apologized northcote approaching with his hand outstretched in greeting not a problem insisted the quietly spoken burcher who represented through their combined consigliori the five mafia families of new york three george northcote was a meticulous dawn starter i originated the earlyworm philosophy but when carver made his first attempt at nine thirty he was told northcote hadnt arrived thered been no warning of a delay either carver was told the same when he called fifteen minutes later and again at ten carver telephoned northcotes apartment on west th street to be told by jack jennings the butler that hed missed northcote by minutes but that he was on his way northcote came on to carvers interoffice phone at ten thirty sorry im late whats the problem there isnt one george you know damned well there is a problem a big one why are you signing off doubleaccounted figures if the companies arent going public its totally the opposite to what you think what you imagine youve worked out which isnt important ive said im resolving it im looking forward to hearing how it went there was a pause in the still subdued nolonger hectoring voice i think it would be a good idea to postpone lunch i dont nothings being postponed george ive made the reservation and were going to keep it and youre going to tell me what the hells going on you think you can talk to me like this in these circumstances yes you feel good the rumblevoiced belligerence too long in coming momentarily silenced carver before giving him his platform no george i dont feel good about any of this you know how i feel i feel so sick so deep in my stomach that any moment i might physically throw up you watch and listen to too much television stop it george were not talking television were talking one great heap of shit youve gotten this firm yourself us all into carver stopped as the thought came to him and gotten jane into as well the bookings for one oclock at the club ive things to do ill see you there carver gave way to his anger dont be late george i dont want anything to be too late northcote wasnt late the meticulous timekeeper was actually early but carver was intentionally ahead of him by more than thirty minutes ensuring their table was beyond overhearing nursing his mineral water until his fatherinlaw arrived trying to rehearse himself for a scene for which there was no script too late acknowledging the emptiness of the gesture to be just that empty he matched northcotes previous days refusal to stand northcote compounded carvers belated embarrassment by pointedly standing beside their table refusing the chair withheld as an invitation to sit from the frowning maitre d as he finally sat northcote said to the man ill have macallan large with a water back carver said gin martini large straight up with a twist fatherinlaw and soninlaw remained looking at each other unspeaking for several minutes before carver said so tell me theres a few things that still need sorting out not a problem im getting a little tired of being told there isnt a problem and im getting tired of telling you there isnt one what are the few things still needing to be sorted out understandings they pulled back for their drinks to be served carver said whats understandings mean agreements with whom about what the dissolution for fucks sake george talk in words that make sense are you the firm out there are still some things that need to be agreed there was another long silence carver said they dont let you go these people do they theyre going to i dont believe you you dont believe yourself without knowing what it was they both disinterestedly ordered that days special when the head waiter returned and at the same time nodded to the house claret they dont have a choice george ive got to know northcote shook his head gesturing for another whisky there was a tremble in his hand of which carver hadnt been aware before dont overinterpret carver told himself george they know its all over insisted northcote they want all the files and records the block came the the evidence finished carver he nodded again in acceptance of the wine without tasting it it solves the problem thats how it was always going to be separating the firm no evidence either way for a moment carver could not respond silenced by the other mans seemingly easy acceptance of what he considered a disaster threatening even impending so you give them all our records dating back carver paused stopped by an abrupt question dating back how long george when did it all start a long time ago said northcote and it took a lot more years to build up to what it became there arent many records with us any longer but enough where demanded carver remembering his fruitless computer search safe what was missing from the older mans voice carver asked himself guilt remorse embarrassment acknowledgement of wrongdoing all of them carver decided if there was an intonation it was of pride in whatever it was he had created hed always accepted that his fatherinlaw was selfconfident to the point of overwhelming arrogance which alice had more than once accused him of being as well but this went beyond that but then carver further asked himself how could northcote be otherwise after the unstoppable international success hed achieved now with offices in every one of the worlds financial capitals but this carver was stopped again by another numbing unthinkable uncertainty you told me you were trapped into it that you didnt realize it was criminal thats what it was how it happened when remember were talking precisely exactly did you realize what you were into it wasnt like that george for fucks carver abruptly stopped with the arrival of their food which they discovered to be rack of lamb as soon as the waiter was out of earshot carver said george tell me true dont tell me things werent like i imagine them to be or that im misunderstanding or that i shouldnt be as pigsick worried as im worried at this moment how long ago maybe twenty years how long ago persisted carver precisely exactly twentytwo but it was a longer evolving process to get everything set up the attitude reflected in the voice now was truculence carver recognized it was a different story from that northcote had first offered of a struggling accountant just starting out howd they keep you in line they blackmail you tell you how youd be debarred if you didnt go along with everything northcote moved his meat around his plate eating none of it saying nothing carver completed his own noneating carousel despising himself for matching the earlier verbal mockery then he said theyve had you george havent they for most of your career theyve had you just like this carver closed his hand as if crushing something i could handle it then can still handle it now insisted the other man pushing his plate aside carver said hows about this hows about a stomachagainsthisspine hungry guy who got initially caught but who then went with the flow paddled the boat even you had the choice all those years ago of blowing the whistle but you stayed with the system their system your system same system everyone gets rich and you additionally got protected wasnt that how it ran george you their willing guy all the way along the line northcotes face flushed redder than the previous night i didnt have a choice the voice the anger was cracked carver waved for their untouched meal to be taken away waiting until it was you did a faust on everyone george you sold out to the devil he sniggered a laugh how about that you sold out to the underworld isnt that how it was how it is you got the joys of this life leaving those who inherit to pay your dues northcote shook his head against the new approach from the waiter to carver he said what the fuck would you have done dirt poor knowing you could climb the mountain but not knowing how which way to go not knowing then even which way you were going you want to tell me that no i cant tell you that admitted carver totally honest id have certainly been frightened tempted too maybe even have been eager but mostly tempted i guess i dont know so thats how it is said northcote no refused carver thats how it was now is how it is tell me about last night i told you about last night george i wont let them win beat me theyd won made this man their own mobbacked wall street colossus carver accepted his numbness growing into a tingling feeling of total unreality theyve owned you george owned the firm owned all of us from the word go how could he be talking like this in an ordinary manner conversationally like everyone else around him in this safe protected uninvadible bastion of total privileged security theres a way declared northcote what way which way i kept some records the records you no one was ever supposed to find i they carver seized the stumble janice what does janice know janice snow was northcotes black permanently weightwatching but constantly failing personal assistant who averaged lbs when she followed the regime and ballooned way above when she didnt which was most of the time shed been with northcote before carver had entered the firm it had been janice whod earlier insisted northcote hadnt arrived in the office when he clearly had absolutely nothing only that theyre my personal accounts how many are they demanded carver determined to discover as much as he could from a man who was clearly as determined not to volunteer anything how many more companies are there than mulder encomp and innsflow none i have your word on that what the fuck use was the word of a man whod been a mafia puppet yet again carvers mind stopped at a conclusion he didnt want to reach but had to because it was the only one possible they were talking conversationally quietvoiced howwastheweekend wheresthisyearsvacation about the mafia you have my word recited northcote in immediate reply he despised this man carver abruptly decided it was as much a shock as all the other revelations of the last thirtysix hours maybe even greater until now he had been in awe in trepidation of this lion of a man with a lions mane but a bulls shoulders who had dominated his life and janes life and so many other lives but whom he was now coming to regard as nothing more than a clay effigy a hollow clay effigy at that of the supposed colossus who could not have stood guard legs astride over any empire most certainly and provably not over his own which wasnt his at all but which had been allowed and granted him in return for his usefulness youre going to give them all the records itself a criminal certainly a professional offence but that no longer seemed a consideration yes but youre making copies yes over so long youre talking in tons things went back after the statutory limitation its just whats in my personal section of the vault where are the copies carver repeated safe insisted northcote where are the copies persisted carver not all together yet youll know when they are and where they are dont you think theyll expect suspect at least youll do this theres no reason why they should everythings amicable both men shook their heads to the offered humidor but both ordered brandy carver deciding he genuinely needed it he said only for as long as they choose to let it be amicable i told you you watch too much television carver had to push the calmness into his voice george dont you have any idea how serious dangerously serious all this is this is not chicago in the twenties al capone and machine guns i know these people have done over a lot of years he was wasting his time carver realized incredulously ill need more than the location what names itll involve you i am involved for christs sake said carver in continued exasperation let me think on it northcote smiled abruptly over his brandy snifter im driving up with jane this afternoon i know what about friday itll all be settled by then you got everything in hand carver didnt answer looking across the table at his fatherinlaw who stared back finally northcote said ill make the formal retirement announcement in the keynote speech everything will be confirmed by friday carver acknowledged that hed condoned a crime crime after crime after crime more crimes than could be counted which had astonishingly been easy all so logical all so acceptable all all and every aspect of it so illegal was he prepared to go with that was he ready prepared to be superman in the red shorts or eliot ness or john carver trying to preserve an empire from crumbling he said you were my icon you were janes icon everyones icon god grow up john i just have said carver i didnt enjoy it alice was already at their table at their place the place in the village he couldnt remember choosing for those early lunches but which had become their place since everyone called everyone by their first names the moment they were regulars a very different club from the harvard a preferred club even in which he felt comfortable easy here despite the suit in which he definitely felt un comfortable he was john anonymous john no one john in the harvard club he was mr carver or more often sir rich soninlaw of richer fatherinlaw both of whom could order as they had carelessly ordered lunches and not eat anything nor drink more than a token sip of their matchingly expensive wine alice was drinking beer he said sorry im late she shrugged not a problem how many more times was that phrase going to jar through his mind beer i was thirsty ok ok you look fantastic she did wearing blue jeans a white shirt and with a blue sweater as a wrap around her shoulders you dont you look like shit on a stick whats up the waiter whod had a walkon part in a movie that no one could remember but who called himself an actor said hi john you wanna cocktail straight up gin martini a twist please added alice before the man left to carver she said theres bad days and theres bad days this was a very bad day right the baddest day in the history of bad days that sounded flip like a joke and the last thing in which he imagined himself was a flip oneliner joke scenario so yet again do you want to talk about it he did decided carver he couldnt to jane because he would be talking about her father and he shouldnt to alice who was a financial even an investigative journalist but he needed had to talk to someone and he trusted alice as much as he trusted jane just as he trusted jane as much as he trusted alice it would not occur to alice to use anything he told her professionally doing so would risk exposing their relationship his martini arrived and he said thanks and sorry about before and the waiter smiled and shook his head to alice carver said im going to tell you something you wont believe that i dont want to believe but which has happened i he shook his head a lost man not knowing his direction just listen which alice belling did through two noddedfor replacement drinks and headshaking against menu offers and when carver finished alice whod held back her impatience said this is absolutely fucking unbelievable i thought id said that already more than once it needed saying again carver said youre the guy on the white horse wielding the sword of truth what would you have done im not going to become your conscience darling or your reassurance youre old enough to go to the bathroom by yourself you decide which way to piss ive decided it hadnt ever seemed like a decision nothing more than a natural progression he raised and dropped his arms the stupidity of the gesture heightening his embarrassment it was like like the obvious thing to do you know youve compromised me yes bastard their passing waiter said nothings terminal guys picking up the remark alice said this could be it was the only way i could go is the only way i can go briefly they enclosed themselves in their own silence alice said thank you for what trusting me so completely didnt you think i did not this much i do im sorry about that compromise shit im not compromised you are but thank you you told me everything everything that i so far know i still dont understand what the scam is just that there is one very very bigtime indeed or why are the figures being massaged like they are if the companies arent being floated i want to know whether george w northcote was an entrapped innocent like he says or is longestablished mafia bigtime i cant decide that either said carver he would though hed understand it all and resolve it all and keep the firm he was destined to inherit safe from whatever northcote had involved it in in new york the mafia despite some investigative setbacks remains a pyramid structure the five predominant families of bonanno luchese gambino genovese and colombo at the pinnacle with minor although named families permitted to exist and operate beneath them sometimes paying tributes and sometimes providing services the delioci clan were the most entrepreneurial and successful of those minor groups largely because it was emilio delioci who had all those years ago enmeshed george northcote and originally sold his moneylaundering services to all of the five although because of the accountants importance to the five northcotes individual control had passed to burcher mafia protocol decreed that any working difficulty had first to be raised with the delioci family before any reference to new yorks ruling mafia commission and that was why burcher that day drove over the east river to queens to meet the elderly whitehaired emilio delioci burcher didnt like operating with minor groups they were unpredictable nearly always imagining they were more important than they were and there had been no attempt to hide the delioci resentment when at the superior families insistence he became liaison between them and northcote nor was there now when he was ushered into the inevitable back room of the delioci headquarters in the inevitable restaurant on thomson avenue to what do we owe this rare honour wheezed the asthmatic don a problem that at first has to be discussed with you said burcher he was glad he had advised the consiglieri of all five new york families of the visit and was able to indicate at once that the resolve could easily be taken away from the deliocis four john carver had cleared his diary to give himself a final review before the scheduled arrival of their overseas chief executives the head of the tokyo office was arriving that night all the others some time during the following day carver strictly determinedly maintained his already planned agenda obviously unable to forget his one overpowering concern but managing mostly to relegate it sufficiently to concentrate upon the annual international conference with the financial director he went through the countrybycountry performance of each of their overseas divisions before analysing their own twelvemonth growth and underscoring new yorks per cent increase over the previous year per cent higher than any of the subsidiaries for particular mention in his speech which was to be the expanded global overview immediately following george northcotes now limited farewell keynote address carver physically shifted in flushed discomfort at the directors urging him to include instructions to all their overseas divisions to take particular care essentially with new clients against inadvertently becoming caught up even by accident or inference in the sort of financial manipulation that had so disastrously tainted wall street hurriedly insisting it was already his intention which it hadnt been until that moment to close the discussion with that imperative warning carver personally checked the boardroom seating arrangements which put northcote for the last time in the ultimate position of authority and had the technician test the projection equipment for the visual presentation to accompany what he had to say which he still only had in draft form but which was already fairly well established in his mind corporate and accountancy fraud warning was the only addition and he made a mental note to alert northcote in advance to avoid any wrong interpretation but more importantly wrong reaction from the other man his personal assistant a greyhaired spinster named hilda bennett whose english accent had survived thirty years in manhattan as had her demeanour of a publicschool matron met him there clipboard and itineraries in hand all the hotel suite reservations had already been doubly checked and confirmed the floral displays were predominantly roses she had already established there were no cultural difficulties in the choice of flowers for the tokyo managers japanese wife for whom floral tributes might have had unintended connotations roses were good flowers also doubly checked were the already approved seating plans as well as the special dietary requests for thursdays welcoming dinner and fridays formal gala the gold gift pins for the wives and cufflinks for the men the cufflinks in the shape of the northcote logo were being delivered from tiffanys that afternoon shed personally gone through every detail of the sunday brunch party at mr northcotes litchfield estate with janice snow helicopters had been laid on from the east th street helipad every guest had guaranteed they had no difficulty with helicopter travel both she and janice would be on hand throughout to handle any unexpected problems she had made up a personalized dossier with details of every arrangement for mrs carver when she got back from the country the following day to host the arrival cocktail party seven limousines were on permanent standby to chauffeur wives on shopping expeditions while their husbands were in conference it took carver an hour to dictate the speech hed imagined he had fixed in his mind and less than fifteen minutes to realize when it was typed that it wasnt fixed at all his difficulty unsurprisingly was the corporate scandal warning which didnt seem to fit logically wherever he tried to introduce it after once removing it altogether he reinserted it where hed slotted it in the first place jane came on to his private direct line just after lunch which he hadnt bothered to eat to say shed just heard shed been unanimously elected the charityfund organizer carver said congratulations that was hardly effusive it was pretty much a shooin wasnt it ive just told dad he said its going to be great our working together he seemed very excited coming up yesterday said you and he had talked and he was definitely going to quit so thank you darling i didnt think persuading him was going to be that easy what about getting him to see dr jamieson another surprise he went this morning said he had a lot of tests and there should be some results next week thats good what did you do last night worked on my speech for friday lied carver that was certainly what he would have to do tonight what he had at the moment wasnt an address from the head of an international accountancy conglomerate his first harvard attempt at keynesian philosophy which had been rejected with the demand to try again had been better than this and this wasnt keynesian philosophy im coming down with dad obviously hildas got you a bunch of stuff i could be in manhattan by lunch time call me from the car we could eat maybe i should look over what hildas done first ill leave it up to you i love you i love you too carver tried to rework his speech but wasnt any better satisfied and decided he really would have to work on it that night at home there were enough excuses to call his fatherinlaw but carver held back from telephoning confronting another doubt the conference organizing was his responsibility so there was absolutely no reason why northcote shouldnt have gone up to litchfield but carver couldnt remember the man ever doing so before with everyone arriving from all over the world which surely wasnt the main consideration in the circumstances the people from whom northcote was supposedly extricating himself extricating himself and the firm and everyone else were presumably here in new york this is where theyd met earlier in the week so how could northcote be so sure that by friday it would all be over was he lying avoiding as hed lied and avoided for so long long enough to have become a world expert carver remained staring at the telephone but still made no effort to pick it up if thats what northcote were doing there was absolutely nothing he could do about it apart from one thing the one thing hed already decided against doing couldnt do carver felt a wash of impotence which was the word that came into his mind and he wished it hadnt because of its reminder of his difficulty with alice last night he hadnt suggested going back to her apartment neither had she instead of calling northcote he dialled alices number but got the answering machine he left a message that hed call later from home as he went uptown he decided to see alice after polishing the friday speech theyd eat in the village again if he reached her early enough so he told manuel he didnt want dinner and that he and luisa could leave early carver got alices answering machine on his next two attempts in between which he worked on the speech and decided it was getting better he knew it wasnt alice when the telephone rang because she never called the apartment so he was half expecting janes voice but not the hysteria what is it he said trying to talk over her jane i cant understand what youre saying slower speak slower dad she sobbed theres been an accident she choked to a stop and then she wailed dads dead murdered thought carver at once george w northcote had been murdered killed for transgressing whatever code these bastards these sons of bitches obeyed a code he didnt know which clearly george northcote hadnt known or understood either carver felt physically paralysed his arms and legs incapable of movement but they had to move everything had to work he had to had to what he didnt know carver accepted he felt the acid of vomit and fear rise in his throat and thought please help me god and hoped god was listening he brought forward one of the already chartered helicopters which was waiting for him by the time he reached th street it was normally a familiar way of his getting up to litchfield so familiar that the procedure was virtually automatic but this early evening it wasnt normal he read the cab drivers displayed id trying to remember the number actually comparing the photograph and questioned the trafficjam detour for what was a direct downtown drive and while they were blocked tried and failed to reach jane from his cellphone he tried alice too and once more got the answering machine he said george northcote was dead and hed call as soon as he could and wished that instead of a recording he could have heard alices voice from her own mouth and all the time couldnt stop couldnt coordinate the turmoil in his mind carver had always had a problem with coincidence which made it seem impossible george northcotes death could be anything but murder there had to have been a reason what the fuck reason for northcote going up to litchfield risking jane for christs sake but he didnt know would now never know what it was one of the eight trillion things he had to work out the handing over of the incriminating documentation that surely could be the only purpose or was it why why litchfield why do it in the boondocks instead of in manhattan where this weeks meeting had been between northcote and and who where oh dear god where were the supposedly protective copies of all the incriminating evidence very much supposedly because they hadnt protected northcote had to have existed somewhere he tried to reassure himself but where northcotes personal safe within the firms vault had to be the place the place that had remained closed since that one time which carver knew because hed gone into the vaults to check and if northcotes personal safe had been open he would have gone far more intently through whatever was there than he had on the first discovery he most definitely had to get back in go through everything that was there janice snow would have access and now he had the authority the unarguable right to insist she open it for him that was the obvious place for it to be the only place for it to be what was he going to do with it when he got it he didnt know not yet but from whatever there was hed be finally able to get names what the fuck protection was that it was an objective question but he didnt have an objective answer any more than he had to all or any of the rest why did you do it george why did you leave me so many others exposed like this you bastard you absolute pigfucking bastard why it would carver accepted always remain the biggest question of all which would never be resolved the flight only took half an hour and there was still sufficient light when they reached the lakeshore estate for carver to look down upon the scene which was additionally illuminated by emergency lighting rigged to a generator van it was nearer the lake than the main rambling house complex a limprotored medivac helicopter was already on the ground although at a distance from everything else there were an ambulance and two police cars their coloured bar lights still revolving and reflecting off other vehicles which prompted carvers illogical immediately embarrassed impression of a funfair attraction roll up roll up and see what happens to someone who thinks he can stiffmiddlefinger the mafia there were two other cars and a completing the semicircle around a piece of equipment carver couldnt at first identify but then he realized it was a small crane its hawsers strained around what became visible as they descended further northcotes familiar tractor mower carver didnt bother to count the figures concentrated around it there were certainly a lot but then george w northcote had been the leading figure and a generous benefactor in the community which deserved an unnecessary medivac helicopter an ambulance two police cars and a crane that appeared to have been designed like a crab with its legs splayed carvers helicopter put down some way away to avoid downdraught and carver was out in a crouched run before the rotors stopped when he straightened he saw people already coming towards him and recognized al hibbert the sheriff in the lead with his hand already outstretched bad business john greeted the bulgebellied balding man damned bad business he wore a holstered pistol and his badge of office on the shirt of his official uniform wheres jane up in the house dr jamieson is looking after her hibbert turned to the second man you know pete simpson what happened demanded carver shaking the medical examiners hand as he walked towards the brightly lighted scene still piecing it together with jack here said hibbert as they got to the vehicles jack jennings had been george northcotes majordomo for fifteen years controlling a staff of eight between the litchfield estate and the manhattan apartment he was a tall whitehaired black man whom carver couldnt ever remember seeing in anything but striped trousers black jacket and white shirt it was the uniform he was wearing now the man said so sorry mr carver so very very sorry his voice was thick lets start again shall we jack said the sheriff jennings coughed after lunch mr northcote said he was going to drive the mower a little he smiled at carver you know how he used to like to do that haul the cutters around the lower paddocks said it relaxed him and that he needed to relax with what was coming up this week whats that mean broke in the sheriff weve got the annual conference people flying in from all over supplied carver which is what i am going to do live in the country cut my grass he remembered northcotes statement as clearly as he remembered the photograph that accompanied alices profile thats what he said agreed jennings his voice still thick despite the constant coughing he was in the study all morning working on his speech he had to see that speech as soon as possible carver decided and go through the study with a toothcomb thered be a safe would jennings know the combination or where the key was kept go on urged hibbert it wasnt unusual for him to stay out all afternoon picked up the man i looked out for him around five thats about the time he likes a macallan when hes up here in the country when he wasnt back by five thirty i came out looking in the golf buggy heres where i found him the man choked to a halt god it was awful what persisted carver see that dip there hibbert took over moving closer to the rim of the depression and the crane with its legs spidered to support the dangling tractor mower carver did see it and saw for the first time too that hanging down from the tractor itself was the separate multibladed attachment that cut a swathe at least six feet wide on each traverse the way it looks he took the tractor too close to the edge so it tilted that threw him backwards into the blade and then the whole rig turned over on top of him hibbert nodded to a photographer of whom carver had until that moment been unaware taking shots of the suspended machine we got pictures he was trapped underneath the tractor itself said jennings crushed i tried to get to him but i thought it all might topple further on to me i called out but he didnt say anything i couldnt hear him breathing i went back to the house and called emergency then i called mrs carver the injuries are bad threw in the medical examiner i wont know until i complete the autopsy whether he died from blood loss from going into those sharpashell blades or from being crushed by the tractor his chest is virtually gone it took a time to get the lifting gear here to get it off him said hibbert as if in apology wheres the body now asked carver on the way to the morgue said hibbert jane wanted to see him but i said no i didnt know how long it was going to take you to get here didnt think of the helo so i decided it was better to get the body away thank you said carver theres supposed to be an official identification but i know began hibbert but carver talked over him ill do it tomorrow ok just give me a call said hibbert he shook his head one hell of an accident one hell of an accident echoed carver if only you knew he thought if only you knew that george northcote had been murdered by people who wouldnt let him go but what people and what were they going to do next john carver supposed what he was feeling was fear total numbing skintingling stomachemptying fear five jane was cried out of tears but dry sobs still shuddered through her and the first time it happened carver was frightened she wouldnt catch her breath and would choke which wasnt his only fear she sat stiffly upright on the very edge of the lounge chair her eyes blinking but unfocused seemingly unaware of anything or anyone around her charles jamieson the litchfield family doctor called it deep shock and asked where they would be staying that night and before carver could reply jane said so loudly and unexpectedly that both men jumped here with dad then well put you to bed announced the doctor recovering before carver jane let herself be led upstairs to the room she and carver always occupied when they stayed over which they often did carver and the doctor undressed her between them and obediently she took the sedatives jamieson gave her but remained staring up at the ceiling still occasionally racked by a breathsnatching sob carver felt the doctors pressure on his arm and followed the man from the bedroom in the downstairs lounge jamieson a fat haphazardly dressed man said its not going to be easy for her they were very close its most likely she wont accept it at first talk as if hes still alive what should i do let it go for a little while you going to stay up here carver hesitated i cant i have to go back to the city there were a lot of calls he had to make so much he had to do so much somehow somewhere he had to find or discover what northcote had promised to give him had to be here somewhere because the intention had been for the man to come direct from here for their meeting but what where you got staff in manhattan yes live in no frowned carver what the hell does that mean it means you should take her with you but that for a few days i dont think she should be left by herself you mean she might harm herself no said jamieson impatiently just that she shouldnt be alone ill get nurses in that would be good manhattan would be good itll get her away from here what time are you leaving tomorrow he had to make the formal identification of the body remembered carver late morning well fly he should have arranged it before dismissing the helicopter he was going to have to speak to hilda shortly it could be added to the list of all the other things that had to be done ill call by around nine see how she is jane told me youd examined george the doctor nodded he told me he was giving up entirely and i told him it was a damned good idea his blood pressure was sky high i put him on immediate medication it could even have been a stroke that made him fall off the tractor he was slowed by a thought maybe i should mention it to pete simpson maybe you should agreed carver he had to end this conversation and this encounter get on with all the other things but at the same time irrationally he didnt want the doctor to go although it was a tragedy a tragic accident in everyones opinion except his there was a normality about talking with the other man but when jamieson went it wouldnt be normal any more what he had to do the calls he had to make the arranging and rearranging that had to be done would be normal in the circumstances of a tragedy but in this case he would be involved was involved in murder mob murder organized crime murder onceyoureinyoureneverout murder or was he could despite everything he knew or thought he knew george northcote have genuinely suffered a stroke because of skyhigh blood pressure and toppled backwards into the multiple spinning blades of a mowing machine could a stroke be even why northcote went too close to the depression in the ground he would have known all too well to be there and to be dangerous because he was unconscious in those last few badly steered seconds only george northcote had known that he knew the firms northcotes link with organized crime and george northcote was dead and that knowledge would have died with him he knew the names of the companies that had to be divested and that could be would be easily achieved by the excuse of northcotes death the words and the phrases began to move through carvers mind retrenchment necessary reorganization after the death of such a dominant leading corporate figure no one any longer available to provide the personalized service that george w northcote provided with obvious regret it fitted fitted perfectly theyd all be out out home free no connection no association no danger if ill just look in now before i go said jamieson and so lost was he in thought that carver was actually startled although he didnt think it showed lets both look in he said jane was lying as theyd left her on her back but was deeply asleep snuffling soft occasional snores although once another sob shuddered through her at jamiesons gesture they backed out of the bedroom without speaking until they got outside in the hallway jamieson said thats good i didnt want to have to give her anything stronger carver met jennings as he turned from seeing jamieson out anticipating the man before he spoke i dont want anything to eat theres too much to do ill be in the study everyones together in the kitchen if you want anything ill let you know said carver already walking towards what he considered the most obvious place to find what it was essential he locate carver pressed the door closed behind him but remained against it confronting his first awareness which was not within the room at all the windows looked directly out in the direction of the depression in which the tractor and mower had overturned it was dark now but beyond the slope there was still a glow from the generator lights illuminating the lifting of the unseen machinery on to an equally unseen removal truck and the word unseen fixed itself in carvers mind where northcote had died couldnt be seen from the house couldnt be seen from anywhere making it the perfect place for murder carver brought himself back inside the room as heavily mahoganypanelled as the manhattan office unsure where how to start where where would northcote have kept hidden sufficient secrets to protect the firm the computer blankeyed on its own workstation beside the desk antique again like its twin in manhattan was obvious but northcote had a latestarters problems with electronic technology and they dealt in printed written words and figures thats what it had been in northcotes safe written printed incrimination so the computer the computer hed already accessed and found nothing but titles on the client list with no crossreferenced file records was not at all the logical initial search the desk itself then but not at once frustrating though it was to delay calls arrangements had the priority or did they carver saw the neatly stacked paper as he approached and realized as he lowered himself into the padded leather chair that it was northcotes intended valedictory speech for a moment carver hesitated as hed hesitated going into northcotes personal safe in the firms basement vault but then abruptly he snatched it up it was comparatively short and easily legible in northcotes neat round handwriting it really was a genuine farewell address he was a proud man northcote had written he was finally irrevocably leaving the firm at the peak of its international success and prestige it was due to the financial business ability and acumen of their overseas divisions as much as to that of the wall street head office command centre northcote had written with a question mark beside it that they had survived the market upheavals that had affected in some instances destroyed other firms of less able people in entrusting the future ultimate control to john carver my worthy and deserving successor and the new york partners an unrivalled team on any continent he was assuring the continued success of george northcote international he wished them well and goodbye carver laid the three sheets directly in front of two silverframed photographs of northcote with muriel his wife who had died eighteen years earlier and two others of northcote with jane one in her graduation robes hed take the speech back to manhattan carver decided have it duplicated to be shown to everyone gathering for the conference less than a week ago he would have been moved by the words applauded with the rest of the people for whom they were intended and shaken northcotes hand and maybe even needed to clear his throat before he could respond now he felt nothing not contempt nor sadness and certainly not admiration it was as if george northcote had been a total stranger and then surprised carver belatedly acknowledged that was exactly what george northcote had been someone with whom he had been in daily contact and whose daughter hed married but whom he had known not at all a man playing performing a part hilda bennett answered his call on the second ring and said oh my god when carver told her hesitating fractionally when he used the word accident he wanted all the overseas executives advised the moment they arrived she was to call the tokyo manager as soon as their conversation ended and a full meeting convened for the following afternoon the cocktail party that jane had been scheduled to host was cancelled as well as fridays gala banquet and the planned reception at litchfield the welcoming dinner would however still take place he expected all the incoming delegates to attend the funeral so hotel reservations had to be extended she was to advise the funeral directors that northcote would be buried in the same vault as his wife there were still legalities to be completed he had the following morning formally to identify the body so it was not yet possible to suggest a specific date for the interment he would speak separately with the firms lawyer with whom she should liaise the following morning about death notices and obituaries he would also speak separately to his own staff at the east nd street apartment to move them in permanently but wanted her additionally to arrange a twentyfourhour nursing staff there to care for jane hed talk personally with their manhattan doctor and put the man in contact with dr jamieson up here in litchfield he wanted the helicopter to collect them at noon from the northcote estate he couldnt think of anything else that had immediately to be initiated but if he did hed call back providing it wasnt too late hilda said it didnt matter how late she probably wouldnt sleep anyway should she tell janice snow carver told her to wait fifteen minutes for him to break the news to northcotes personal assistant janice snow broke down at once and kept asking what she should do and carver started to suggest she work with hilda on the arrangements hed already asked hilda to make but suddenly stopped realizing his oversight he allowed himself a rehearsing pause before asking if janice had personally programmed northcotes computer his irritation at himself transferring itself to janices reply that it was one of her daily functions mr northcote hadnt liked or understood computers scarcely known properly how to operate one just as promptly without the need for any reference she gave him what she insisted were all george northcotes entry codes and passwords carver remained undecided for a few moments before saying this may seem a strange question in the circumstances but its extremely important is there a special code or password that george used for extremely sensitive stuff secret stuff in fact now the hesitation came from the woman youve got them all they all duplicate with manhattan of course in which file or folder of those youve given me would georges personal accounts have been kept the curiosity was discernible in janice snows voice i already told you mr carver he didnt work like that you telling me there isnt one thats very much what im telling you that there isnt a specific one could janice snow be part of it whatever it was shed have to be if she was the person whod entered all northcotes computer information would northcote have told janice what he knew hed be exposing himself disclosing names to her but only if she were part of it was complicit if she wasnt it would be an enquiry that only had relevance to him he said ive some names i want to put to you do you know where the files are on a company named mulder inc janice gave time for her answer no have you ever handled accounts on behalf of george for mulder inc ive typed completion letters to them in the caymans after an audit to go with the returns there was another hesitation they were sent separately so how were the returns made i dont know you dont know mr northcote had a special way of working with some clients mulder was one of them there were a lot of personal meetings you know the names of some mulder executives their inhouse accountants no she had to be part of it thought carver did george ever have you computerize any details of mulder no what about anyone else on his personal staff other girls i did all that what about a company named encomp there was a further pause ive typed some signoff letters to grand cayman again but no returns no what about innsflow the same there was no purpose in continuing this longdistance conversation with the passwords he could make a computer check of his own despite what janice had told him i want you to help hilda like i said well talk some more about georges personal files when i get back ok if the woman were involved his asking about them would give her all the time in the world to hide or destroy everything is there something wrong demanded janice openly nothing wrong at all said carver with everyone here in new york with meetings and discussions to be held im trying to bring myself as fully up to date as possible as quickly as possible ill have it done by the time you get here tomorrow promised the woman now with increasing impatience carver endured fifteen minutes going through what the firms lawyer thought important to emphasize in the death notices and obituaries which mostly concerned the assurance that carvers already agreed succession would ensure the uninterrupted business continuity of george w northcote international manuel said he and his wife would return to east nd street that night to ensure that everything would be ready before anyone arrived he was very sorry about mr george it was terrible alice started lightly i thought youd forgotten me but at once became subdued when he talked over her to tell her what had happened she said shit and then an accident thats what its going to be described as do you really think he was killed the doctor says he could have suffered a stroke from high blood pressure that it could have been the cause of his falling into the blades i asked what you thought persisted alice i dont want to but i think he was killed said carver hearing the casual conversational tone of his own voice he was talking of murder as if it was a normal topic like the weather or some commuter gridlock and wasnt manhattan a shitty place to try to get around in this doesnt seem real sound real said alice matching his thinking which she often did no what are you going to do i cant think of anything to do he didnt give you what you asked for no but it should be here somewhere carver was impatient to get off the line hows jane sedated it wont be easy for us to meet now it was alice who sounded remarkably sanguine unmoved but then although shed been impressed by the man wrongly as it transpired shed only met george northcote two or three times not over the next few days he agreed call me when you can when i can and be careful darling i will said carver wishing he knew how to be carver pushed the chair slightly back with the same motion of replacing the telephone momentarily looking between the desk and the workstation before deciding he couldnt wait for janices search the following morning that he had to look try to look for himself the moment he booted up he recognized the duplication with the manhattan office curious that northcote had required the copies here in the country in view of his operating difficulties carver scrolled his way through every one of northcotes personal files and accessed every password and entry code each time carefully entering the names of the three hovering criminal and incriminating companies none registered he turned hurriedly to the desk the top lefthand drawer contained receipted bills each annotated with the number and date of the cheque that had settled it the one below that cheque books with the stubs meticulously completed and coordinated with the invoices above the bottom drawer held only stationery the diary a duplicate of the appointments book from which they all worked in wall street was in the top righthand drawer carver momentarily hesitated before picking it up aware as he did so of the shake in his hand reminding himself how important it was going to be when he reached the office the following day to retrieve northcotes office copy carver initially held it up by its spine hopefully shaking it but it concealed nothing loose after that he turned at once to the day northcote had been in new york for the supposedly severing encounter with his mob controllers the entry read sb dinner harvard there was a dash between the two letters and against the name of the club there was an asterisk there was also an asterisk against todays entry which simply read j when according to jennings northcote was on his tractor hauling across a field completely hidden from anyones view the cutting machine beneath which hed fallen it took carver more than an hour painstakingly to go through every entry which northcote appeared always to do by initials never recording a name those of sb appeared a total of six times always marked by asterisks and by carefully going back through the marked pages carver calculated the meetings were regularly once a month nearly always the last tuesday they were always for lunch and never at the same restaurant this week had been the first time the harvard club was mentioned where would northcotes diaries for the previous years be carver wondered the mans personal safe in the vault another check for the following day in another righthand drawer carver found a cuttings book of newspaper and magazine articles on northcote the long admiring feature by alice was quite near the top even more recent was a wall street journal interview in which northcote had urged tighter financial supervision by the sec and all the other authorities governing accountancy both locally in new york as well as federally neatly arranged in a multisectioned tray in the bottom righthand drawer was a selection of keys some the countryclub locker and spare sets for the cars for instance clearly labelled others not the age and model and insecurity of the safe surprised carver when he found it it was floormounted inside one of the cupboards beneath the bookcase and was key not combination locked it took carver less than fifteen minutes to find the key that fitted from among those unmarked in the bottom drawer the safe was only about a quarter full all of it easily carried in a single trip back to the desk carver began to go through the contents in the order in which they had been stored which was with the money on top of the pile he didnt bother to count but guessed there were several thousand dollars in newly issued uncreased onehundreddollar bills there were three personal insurance policies in total with a face sum of but in the one he glanced through there was an endorsement increasing the value in the event of accidental death there was a stock portfolio of perhaps twenty certificates which carver scanned through not even registering their valuations interested only in any possible mention of the three companies once more there was none george northcotes will was unexpectedly brief apart from bequests to the staff for jack jennings the bulk of northcotes entire estate went to jane passing to carver if she predeceased him in northcotes lifetime the only exception was a single legacy of to carver if she did inherit in the event of their both predeceasing northcote the estate was to be divided equally between any surviving children the will had been made soon after their marriage carver saw from its date long before the difficulty of jane conceiving had been realized there was a codicil attested just one week after the partners meeting at which carver had been proposed by northcote and unanimously approved by the partners as northcotes successor appointing carver the sole and absolute executor of the will the only things remaining in front of carver when he put the portfolio aside were a small selection of photographs the first easily identifiable as northcote with jane when she was a child and with his wife one showing muriel actually on their wedding day in her wedding dress which had to have been taken at least thirty if not more years ago carver didnt recognize the woman in the last four photographs although it was very clearly not muriel northcote each was inscribed on the back with a date a twoweek period in when carver knew northcote to have been married and muriel to be still alive and locations capri and madrid there was also a name anna one showed she and northcote openly embracing two more with their arms entwined the fourth holding hands each was a picture of two very happy people very much in love george northcotes bedroom was once again heavily furnished the bed and dressingroom wardrobes thick dark wood although carver didnt think it was mahogany he imagined he could detect the smell of the man a musky cologne mixed vaguely with cigars but decided in the pristine surroundings that was what it had to be imagination he supposed the neatness was not northcotes but one of the staff maybe even jennings there was what was clearly pocket contents in a segregated tray on the nightstand house keys a cigar cutter and lighter a wad of money hundreddollar notes on the outside in a silver clip and a snakeskin wallet one half of the wallet was a personalized weekbyweek diary the entries for that week were identical to those in the larger version downstairs even to the entry for this day simply reading there was a selection of credit and business cards in their separate pockets at the top of the opposing side with a slim jotting pad at its bottom it was blank carver felt a quick flare of hope when he opened the nightstand door and saw the bundle of finelined accountancy sheets lifting them all out and laying them on the bed to hurry through his first awareness was that they were old files all dated five years earlier his second was that none contained any references to mulder encomp or innsflow they were the accounts of two companies bhyf and noxt neither of which carver could remember discussing personally with northcote nor more generally at partners meetings and he was sure they hadnt shown on the computer search hed attempted downstairs of northcotes personally handled accounts more mob companies his unavoidable question which prompted another why left like this not in the downstairs safe because incredibly unbelievably northcote had believed he was safe that there was no need for security could they be even part maybe even all of what northcote had planned to give him the insurance against the firms destruction carver wanted to believe it wanted to believe it more than anything hed wanted to believe in his life whatever they were potentially the most important discovery hed made that night there was a bedside table on the opposite side from the nightstand free of anything except a biography of maynard keynes and carver carefully stacked the sheets there to go downstairs with everything else hed already set aside to take back to manhattan carver went painstakingly through all the drawers in northcotes dressing room discovering nothing more in any of them but the expected underwear linen and shirts he actually explored every pocket of every one of the twelve suits that hung from the dressingroom rails as well as the two topcoats carver had half hoped for another betterhidden safe but he didnt find one despite looking behind every picture for something wallmounted checking every cupboard and recess for an upright model to match that downstairs and finally scuffing his feet across the carpet as he had in the study searching for a security vault sunk into the floor there was no telltale unevenness wherever he looked or felt enough carver decided he ached with tiredness ached so much he couldnt think straight could hardly see straight it had to be bhyf and noxt he didnt know how or where to take it forward from here but there had to be some significance would janice snow know or rather would janice snow show him a way forward at that moment he thought of one himself feeling another spurt of selfcriticism that it hadnt occurred to him before northcotes bank that had to be a source whatever the importance of bhyf and noxt it was unimaginable like so much else was unimaginable that northcote didnt have a safedeposit facility several safedeposit facilities in manhattan banks what better place what more obvious place to hide secrets but in a bank safedeposit box carver was so tired he had literally to force himself to move simply to walk back into the dressing room where he found by feel more than sight the valise in which he packed the fiveyearold files from the nightstand and stumbled back downstairs into the study to add the will diary and the four photographs of the laughing darkhaired girl named anna jane still lay on her back but there werent any more sobs he let his clothes lie where they fell and eased as carefully as he could into bed beside her anxious to avoid movement or contact that might awaken her there was no instinctive automatic shift at his presence who wondered carver was anna so what the hell happened demanded burcher the soft voice unaccustomedly loud he wasnt up to it he croaked said a crinklehaired heavily built man who are you said burcher who wants to know i want to know because the families want to know because theyre not happy burcher thought again how wise hed been letting the people he represented know that he was strictly adhering to the pyramid procedure there were far more people in the restaurant back room than when hed last been there the attitudes and atmosphere were bravado hes my caporegime paulo brescia wheezed emilio delioci were you there burcher asked the man and knew at once from the discomfited shift that he hadnt been i sent people burcher let the silence build and when he spoke he was quietvoiced again but sounded every word as if he were tasting it as he wanted them to taste it arent you aware of how important george northcote was to the families he was ours said emilio delioci burcher shook his head you were allowed to believe that as a mark of respect northcote created a system that benefited not just new york but every other family in this country and so every other family in this country is going to be as sore as they are in new york and thats as sore as hell youre close to being put out of business you cant threaten us like that asshole said brescia you want to put that to the test asshole challenged burcher lets all of us get something very straight and very clearly understood what i say is what new york say you insult me like some bit player in the godfather you insult new york and if they feel like it if they feel you are not doing what youve been asked to do then burcher extended his hand towards brescia and snapped his fingers dismissively youre gone history that no one remembers have i made that very straight and very clear to everyone here i dont want any misunderstandings said delioci neither do i said burcher so ill ask again what happened my people told northcote they wanted what hed held back said brescia all the truculence gone he said hed given you the message that that was how it was going to be they tried to persuade him he suddenly went stiff and died on them they made it look like an accident thats how the local radio and newspapers are reporting it so somewhere theres a load of stuff that could cause us a lot of harm the capo smirked and burcher realized the man was playing to the rest of the audience in the room brescia said he was being persuaded theres a guy taking over the firm married to northcotes daughter carver he knows all about it and a woman janice snow did the computer entries it could all be turned into a coup burcher decided and if it could be it would be his coup not that of these halfassed smalltimers what about the material northcote was holding back i told you he passed out before they could get that out of him what about in the house theres staff we couldnt get near it heres what youre going to do said burcher youre going to send people back to litchfield to find some way in youre going to find out everything i need to know about this carver guy use a legitimate private detective agency in the city and youre going to find out how much the woman janice snow knows all that very straight and very clear i dont enjoy disrespect mr burcher said delioci i mean no disrespect to you said the lawyer i was told very specifically to pass on the feelings of those to whom we are all answerable and most specifically of all to ensure that everybody understood there are to be no more mistakes i think you have done that said the old man then its been a good meeting said burcher how much more to his personal benefit could he manipulate it he wondered six john carver thought hed prepared himself for what he had to do but he hadnt he gasped aloud and felt his legs begin to go at the sight of george northcotes body on the gurney he instinctively snatched out for the table upon which the body actually lay pulling further aside even more of the covering sheet and seeing more awfulness and when he tried to speak he couldnt what he tried to say came out as an unintelligible hiss he finally managed oh dear god his voice still a dry whisper he felt al hibberts supportive hand at his elbow the sheriff said easy john take it easy im ok croaked carver his voice better but only just stronger still he said what the hell happened to him its like its like hes been flayed northcotes face was practically nonexistent and there was virtually no skin and most of the lions mane had been torn off scalping the man there seemed to be no skin either on much of northcotes chest from which carver had tugged the sheet it was flat not a body shape at all and there was a lot of bone and grey slimed viscera the mower got him first then the tractor said hibbert no refused carver it isnt possible i saw the rig the mower blades were covered shielded against just such an accident if he fell backwards he wouldnt have been cut skinned like that hed have maybe broken an arm or a leg on the protective covering but thats all and going backwards would have taken him away from the tractor when it tipped over not underneath it thats what pete and i thought at first said hibbert nodding to simpson on the other side of the slab we stayed up there past midnight last night got engineers in heres how we worked it out george goes too close to the dip throwing the tractor sideways the force of it going tips the mowing rig which runs on its own motor when george hits it its upside down the blades going full belt does that to him the mower is wider than the tractor thats pulling it for a moment or two god knows how long it prevents the tractor going right over but swings it back towards where george has been tossed he would have most likely been dead by then unconscious certainly broke in simpson belatedly the medical examiner put the sheet back over the corpse this is an odd one sure but i get a dozen accidents like this every year guys driving operating machinery theyre not used to something goes wrong bang theyre dead the tractor is heavier than the rig finally makes it give way weve got photographs of how it bent when it finally wasnt able to stop it going right over picked up hibbert and when it goes theres george right under the whole fucking thing the perfect murder thought carver the absolute totally unprovable perfect murder once youre in theres only one way out out like george in front of him although covered again by an inadequate sheet skinned alive not actually alive skinned by being thrust in and out of the mower blades to an agonizingly slow death would he have told them given them what they wanted he would have screamed been demented carver went to simpson charlie jamieson examined him day before yesterday says his blood pressure was so high he could have had a heart attack charlie called me at breakfast said simpson georges readings were at recordbook levels carver was sure he was snatching at straws but would have been glad of one no matter how slender could he have had a stroke because of it could that have been the reason he went too close to the dip and turned over both men the sheriff and the examiner looked emptily back at carver hibbert said im sorry john i just cant quite get your point it was a point he couldnt make carver realized he felt physically encased as if his ribcage was being crushed by his impotence like that of the man lying flatchested on the metal table in front of him george knew his land knew where he couldnt take his rig knew how to handle it too there must have been a reason for his going too close this time why was he saying this in front of a law officer what selfjustification was he trying to make to absolve himself from the selfrecrimination of not having tried to have george northcotes death properly investigated which he well knew couldnt be properly investigated it happened because he knew his land so well said hibbert he wasnt thinking wasnt taking enough care because hed done it a hundred times before all it needed was inches to make the mistake he made the engineers we had up there last night are professionals ill show you the photographs the way theyre sure it happened the way it had been intended to be worked out thought carver there going to be an inquest into what john demanded hibbert theres nothing officially to inquire into carver felt the impotent straightjacketed constriction again i can go ahead with the funeral arrangements then as and when you wish assured hibbert as if he were giving away a raffle prize its gotta be a shock john hang in there carvers feeling now was of burning irritation at the filedaway cliches thats what ill do al hang in there hang in where with whom hibbert said im sorry but i officially need to hear the words is the body youve just seen that of george northcote of course it was but then again it wasnt wasnt the bullshouldered most certainly not the bullchested lionsmaned founder of the best known most prestigious accountancy firm on wall street thats the body of george northcote hibbert said i hate this of all the things i have officially to do i hate this the most me too said simpson im sorry to have put you through it apologized hibbert i tried to indicate last night i know stopped carver its ok we lost a good man here said simpson the best thats what he was hibbert hurried on the best were sure as hell glad you and jane are still here in the community to carry on carry on what wondered carver near to cliche himself he said were still here how is jane asked simpson charlie told me there was pretty heavy shock she was still sedated when i left said carver charlies with her but i need to get back is there anything else were through declared hibbert simpson said ill tell my guys to expect a call from your funeral directors itll come sometime today promised carver an evenvoiced calm conversational exchange he thought were talking about a murder you fucking idiots a murder committed by people professional enough to be able to skin a man alive but make it appear to these boondock boneheads a typical country mishap i get a dozen accidents like this every year just another one of those accident stories to go into the litchfield folklore anything i can do to help john you just call thats all it needs a call i appreciate that i mean it i know you do the sheriff and the medical examiner both solicitously escorted carver from the building and stood together as he drove away simpson said that guys suffering shock just like his wife worse maybe his is delayed itll properly hit him in a couple of days i must admit ive never seen anyone quite so badly hurt as george from falling into mower blades said hibbert simpson shook his head a patronizing youdontknow gesture happens all the time carver drove home by the longer roundabout route that took him by the bottom of the lake a way they rarely used intent upon landmarks when he approached northcotes estate and grunting with empty satisfaction when he identified what he was looking for the hollow into which george northcote had been tipped was invisible from the house but it was very much in view from this rarely used back road in view and easily reached through the simple pale fencing and from where he was standing the mowline was distinctly marked going from this boundary up the incline but stopping at the hollow into which it had tipped carver remembered quite clearly that when hed been there the previous evening all the talk all the indications had been that the rig had come in the opposite direction down the incline from the moment of entering financial journalism through a fluke of shallishanti timing alice belling had recognized that the world wide web was the trampoline upon which to bounce anywhere she chose through cyberspace and had become a far more expert and adept surfer than any on wakiki beach there were few firewalls she could not electronically scale or burrow beneath or systems she couldnt hack into she justified the intrusion to her own satisfaction by only ever using what she discovered to expose financial wrongdoings never valid business manoeuvrings it was an operating integrity with which she had no difficulty and would have been uninterested in that of others had others known which none did not even john carver from whom she had no other secrets normally she roamed the world and its web from the comfort and convenience of her soho apartment on princes street today persuaded by what carver told her she decided against working from home even though she always avoided the possibility of inadvertently leaving her own electronic fingerprint on any detection equipment or device with which she was unfamiliar by never going direct into a target system but always hacking first into an unsuspecting intermediary business or organization to make her penetration via their site alice set out early and was at the door of the space for space cybercafe on canal and west broadway when it opened to ensure she didnt have to queue for a station she surfed and at random chose the european headquarters booking system of an international hotel chain based in the southernenglish town of basingstoke to be her cutout host isolating their password after just five attempted hits and within minutes established her trojan horse her personal passwordaccessed site undetectable within the chains mainframe into which she could come and go without their having the slightest knowledge of her presence the obvious search was for the three names carver had given her alice selected mulder first in a global sweep and was startled by the number of immediate hits just as quickly recognizing the names to be the parent company registration in grand cayman she began the familiar password hunt and after thirty minutes became irritated as well as impatient at the repeated rejections from grand cayman frustrated she scrolled through the other listings which curiously covered a large number of the american states with the addition of overseas subsidiaries in a matching number of european and asian countries obeying the hackers lore when confronted with initial refusal she closed down on mulder moving at once to encomp and got what appeared to be a virtually identical number of hits with the same american state and worldwide spread innsflow international matched the preceding two she spent more than an hour trying to get into encomp and innsflow in grand cayman and was consistently rejected mystery upon mystery she said at once embarrassed at having spoken aloud although she often did when upon such expeditions from her princes street apartment she answered the managers enquiring look with a half wave and a gesture towards her empty coffee cup genuinely needing a refill after being so effectively and irritatingly defeated knowing the frequency with which initial registrations were often used as cutouts in much the same way as she was using the hotel chains computer setup she surfed all the caribbean offshore islands for minimal variations on the three parent companies she was trying to penetrate but found nothing she considered a possibility alice spread the search further afield to switzerland and israel but found nothing she entered the market registrations in london frankfurt tokyo singapore and on wall street even though any listing should have shown with her first search entry of the names with the same lack of success which was the same when she hacked into the newspaper reference archives of the wall street journal the new york times and the times in london the washington post londons financial times fortune and forbes alice recognized that the surfeit of subsidiary but linked names risked overwhelming her certainly in such public surroundings she needed the quiet reflective security of princes street and to try to evolve a way to get past the grand cayman hacking shield as she with forced patience printed out the statebystate and international listings alice conceded to herself that it was not the first time shed drawn such a total blank but she couldnt remember it happening more than twice before and both of those had eventually emerged under police investigation to be criminal enterprises which objectively she further acknowledged had no real bearing on this attempt but which nevertheless inclined her to regard it in that light it took her a further thirty minutes to print out as alice paid for her time the manager said youve been working hard not sure what ive got complained alice theres good days and bad days todays a confused day come back again better luck next time i think im going to have to come back a lot said alice after all she had a new trojan horse password in an unsuspecting host system and john might come up with something that would give her a short cut how long would it be before she and john could get together again not long she hoped jack jennings was in the hallway waiting for him when carver got back and he said at once mrs carvers just woken up the doctors with her and manhattan called the helicopter will be here by eleven thirty carver held back from going directly upstairs instead gesturing the other man towards the study and going immediately to the desk holding the unidentified keys which he laid out close to the wedding photograph of muriel northcote i need your help with these jack you know what the unidentified ones fit jennings stared down for several moments separating some from others with a finger before isolating a second countryclub locker the pool house and several gardenequipment outhouses one had housed the fatal tractor three were left unnamed and carver thought one oddly coloured red could have been a safe deposit or leftluggage locker carver said you dont know these three jennings shook his head dont mean anything at all something else encouraged carver where did mr northcote keep things things that needed to be carefully looked after jennings indicated the bookcase cupboard the safe i guess nowhere else no special place there was another head shake no sir nothing like that what about yesterday persisted carver sure he was right about how northcote had been tortured its a long way from the house i know but i think you might have heard if mr northcote yelled out when he fell if he had and id heard it if anyone had heard it id have gone looking i didnt hear any cry for help nor obviously did anyone else in the house anyone visit mr northcote yesterday a stranger maybe someone you didnt know no sir no one came all day so there was nothing the other man considered the question there was a phone call what phone call just after lunch it was a man who said he wanted to talk to mr northcote i asked for a name but he said it didnt matter that mr northcote was expecting the call which seemed to be right mr northcote heard the phone and came out into the hall behind me would have got it first if i hadnt already been there did you hear the conversation the butlers face stiffened i dont listen to other peoples telephone conversations mr carver anyway mr northcote took it in here in the study had he told you before then that he was going to take the mower out jennings frowned in recollection no not before then so he wasnt dressed for it wasnt in his usual work overalls no howd he seem after the call jennings shrugged just like always were you with him when he left the house see him jennings looked curiously at carver i wasnt with him i saw him through the kitchen going towards the tractor lockup was he carrying anything anything like an envelope the man paused has something come up with the sheriff mr carver no said carver just one or two things i need to get sorted out in my mind when jennings didnt speak carver said so was he carrying anything like an envelope in his hand no sir said the other man he was just setting out to drive his tractor jane was still in bed propped up against the backboard when carver got to the room jamieson was in a chair alongside she smiled up wanly and said hello hello you ok yeah it all go ok i guess she nodded towards jamieson and said theres a helicopter coming everyones coming in for the conference sure i dont want to leave you here by yourself i dont want to stay here by myself take your time there was at least an hour carver knew without needing to consult his watch how was it carver instinctively looked to the doctor for guidance jamieson remained turned too far away for any facial hint i had to say it was george thats all a formality would it have been bad there were no tears and her voice was quite even it almost sounded like a casual enquiry pete simpson was positive about that carver nodded to the halfturned figure of the local doctor charlie thinks its possible your father had a stroke that thats how the accident happened if it wasnt that way he would have been knocked out hitting the cover guard of the mower either way he wouldnt have felt a thing it was blood pressure came in jamieson supportive at last it was bad im glad he wouldnt have felt any pain jane straightened against the headboard if ive got to get dressed i need space outside in the corridor where theyd been the previous night carver said she seems ok looks ok remember what i said about denial this it id have liked her to be more obviously grieving maybe shes more resilient than you guessed than any of us guessed maybe said the doctor doubtfully you examined her physically shes fine jane came downstairs with the arrival of the helicopter as they walked out towards it she said weve got a lot to talk about with the exception of one subject thought carver stanley burcher had a trained lawyers objectivity and from every angle from which he examined the idea that had immediately come to him in the queens restaurant the more he became convinced that it was perfect he had actually raised with the consiglieri of the new york families the problem of northcotes age and impending retirement now there was no longer a problem northcotes informed and therefore complicit successor could simply continue to act as northcote had acted for so long in the past the man more than likely knew where northcote had kept the withheld documentation too it was tempting to tell the consiglieri how perfect his resolution was but burcher decided to wait until hed confronted carver he wondered if he would enjoy his association with the man as much as he had in the past with northcote until that very last meeting northcote had been stupid imagining he could behave as he had seven it was not until jack jennings asked if he and the housekeeper were to fly back to manhattan with him that carver remembered that despite his earlier dismissal of there being any further possible hiding places apart from banks george northcote had another home in which the protective secrets could be concealed that realization triggered more the most pertinent a correction to another earlier misbelief as george northcotes already acknowledged successor he did have the right of access to each and any safedeposit vaults in all if any company vaults or additional banks in which although he had not yet properly looked it was inconceivable that northcote would have deposited any incriminating material aware it would be too easily discovered but knowing as carver did know from the will he was taking with him back to the city that jane was the controlling beneficiary carver accepted that he had no legal right to access any private security facility in any personal bank account george northcote held the only person who held that right under the terms of the will was jane how much more convoluted spinning in upon itself could this become carver told the man that of course they should come and thanked him for suggesting something that had not occurred to him accustomed to commuting back and forth between the city and the country both jennings and the housekeeper had clothes permanently in each so there were only a few things necessary for them to pack while they did so carver assembled what he had put aside from his search of the litchfield house as they walked out to the helicopter jane nodded to the valise into which carver had packed his previous nights discoveries and said whats in there stuff i think i might need anything i should look at nothing at all insisted carver she obviously knew of her inheritance but not he guessed anything about the laughing somuchinlove photographs of her father and anna which were in the case inside the aircraft jennings and the housekeeper determinedly placed themselves at a distance on the opposite side of the passenger cabin an unnecessary but thoughtful courtesy directly after liftoff jane said tell me what i need to know everything thats happening they were practically over the city before carver finished his strictly edited account calmly with no catch in her voice jane said you havent spoken to the funeral director yourself hildas setting everything up for me ill take over the funeral arrangements all of it announced jane are you sure started carver but jane stopped him ill do it her voice was still calm without a hint of hysteria but at the same time positive allowing no argument ok what about burt elliott hes on my list for today elliott was the family lawyer another likely secrets repository carver thought but one to which jane again had access over him ill do that too declared jane in the same noargument tone let it go carver decided nodding in agreement better for jane to occupy herself with as much activity as possible than to retreat within herself amateur psychology he recognized but it seemed to fit to serve a purpose ive got manuel and luisa staying permanently at the apartment for a while carver said thatll probably be useful with everyone in town accepted jane and some nurses he added not looking directly at her some what jane demanded her voice rising for the first time charlie jamieson thought it would be a good idea i dont cancel it its fixed now lets see how it goes i dont want to see how anything goes im ok really ok i want them around insisted carver jane turned more fully in her seat to look at him is it important to you its important to me it isnt to me because i dont need nursing ill give them their minimum week and thatll be the end of it ill take care of that too thats good if there was going to be a mood swing a switch in her reaction it would surely be during the next nervestretched week reminded carver said jamiesons also going to talk to dr newton paul newton was their manhattan physician i dont need a doctor and i dont need nurses you dont know that i do know that charlies only going to tell paul what happened so hes in the picture we all know what happened dad had an accident and got killed under an overturned tractor its right that paul should know one doctor to another i dont want to see him i dont need anyone on the other side of the cabin jennings shifted uncomfortably he needed to be told and i told you im quite all right im not honestly admitted carver deflating her vehemence at the th street helipad the reception committee was made up of the company lawyer the two most senior partners below carver hilda bennett and janice snow and unexpectedly a media contingent photographers and two journalists whose questions the sound of words not their content were the first things of which carver became aware when they cleared the noise of the helicopter he moved to shield jane but she shrugged him aside stopping both for questions and pictures a wall street legend had been taken from them she said they were all devastated it was a mark of her fathers professionalism that the future of the firm that bore his name had been guaranteed before his death by his personal choice of successor her husband the firm of george w northcote would be the memorial to the man who founded it carver and jane went into the lead car of their crosstown cavalcade with the lawyer beside carver and the two personal assistants facing them from the jump seats as they began to move carver said how the hell was that allowed to happen the lawyer geoffrey davis said its not something we anticipated or could have prevented its all right said jane from the other side of the car across carver the lawyer said if youll allow me mrs carver you did very well thank you belatedly carver realized that from his unspeaking part in the impromptu press conference he would appear very much the puppet there been a lot of media coverage just the formal announcement so far said davis it was late janice snow said ive got a list of interview requests carver at once wondered if alices was one of them and even more quickly was angry at the stupidity of the thought hed have to try to call her im not sure if therell be time today ill do them declared jane beside him its got to be done today well do it together carver recovered to hilda he said whats the schedule the matronly woman said partners at three overseas people at four thirty drinks in the boardroom at five thirty carver said set up a press conference for me at six fifteen for both of us broke in jane addressing hilda im staying at the office she nodded to the cellphone on its central pod perhaps youd call the funeral director now fix a meeting there for me at four she paused ill use fathers rooms is that carver started but stopped jane said heavy in rebuke thank you there was a stir throughout the car with hilda looking imperceptibly at carver who hoped she noticed his equally imperceptible nod to indicate that jane had to be humoured in everything he wouldnt be able to continue his intended search with jane occupying her fathers office to his personal assistant he said perhaps hilda youd help mrs carver you can be with me today janice both women nodded hilda at the same time reaching out for the consolemounted telephone janice said everything you asked for last night has been fixed as vital as it was he wouldnt anyway have had time today to go through northcotes office and personal vault safe carver acknowledged but jane wouldnt be in the office tomorrow nor would it have been possible for him to have got to northcotes apartment where hed told jennings to disturb nothing just tidy whatever needed tidying would there be a safe or a hidden place there that would open to one of the unidentified litchfield keys at the bottom of the valise securely clamped between his legs deciding that it was a question that wouldnt upset jane he said whats the reaction been there was a hesitancy between the lawyer and the two women finally davis said overwhelming weve got two girls listing the calls i guess therell be as many letters in tomorrows mail to hilda who was replacing the car phone jane said ill personally sign the reply to each one hilda looked to carver for another nod of agreement to jane she said fours fine for the funeral people and ill keep a note of the letters and messages jane separated with hilda the moment they reached the executive floor walking with carver to his office suite the lawyer said janes standing up remarkably well remarkably well agreed carver for how much longer he wondered within fifteen minutes of settling behind his own desk carver fully realized just how impractical his idea of searching northcotes office had been even if hed known exactly what he was looking for he handed his diary over to janice to rearrange his appointments over the next week together with northcotes valedictory address to be copied in time for the partners meeting which she managed along with more than sufficient duplicates for the following overseas assembly the partners meeting inevitably began with the ritual of condolences with which carver supposed he and jane would become all too familiar over the coming days at the company secretarys insistence the partners took a formal vote of acceptance of northcotes posthumous speech which was repeated later at the gathering of the overseas chief executives also attended by the american partners at the combined meeting there was the additional formality again insisted upon by the company secretary although this time endorsed by the lawyer of another vote unanimously accepting carvers succession carver hadnt anticipated the need to make this speech and in effect didnt he thanked them for their support and confidence and in a jumble of cliches pleaded his inadequacy to fill northcotes place but pledged to do his utmost to try which would need the help and assistance of them all there were grunts and mumbles of assurance when he said he hoped he would get that help and assistance jane was waiting in his office and announced at once that the funeral would be in three days shed agreed the flowers and the limousines and booked the wake at the plaza hotel there was to be a memorial service at litchfield at the end of the month and as he had already instructed her father was to be interred alongside his late wife the will was going to be read in burt elliotts office which the household staff needed to attend to hear about their inheritances shed already told jennings here in manhattan to arrange that the remaining staff at litchfield were coming down in the morning shed called al hibbert to warn him there would be no one at the estate there was no hesitation or question in her accompanying carver to the boardroom drinks gathering where she spoke individually to practically everyone and called for silence to thank them for their condolences and to announce that the cocktail party at east nd street which had been cancelled was going to be held after all and she looked forward to meeting the wives there its what my father would have expected of me she concluded jane was totally composed at the press conference and although she deferred to carver for most of it she was always ready when a question was directed personally at her on their way uptown afterwards carver said i didnt think youd want the cocktail party like i said its what he would have expected ive organized caterers and warned manuel to expect their call were having steak tonight incidentally it was the easiest thing i could think of with the uncertainty of our not knowing what time wed be back were actually much earlier than i expected youve pretty much filled your day said carver in terms of actual achievement shed accomplished far more than he had how are you feeling me said carver surprised youre the numero uno now he refused to recognize the real meaning of her question ive been practising for over a year frightened she demanded openly of course im not carver lied although still not in direct answer to her intended question why should i be its a responsibility youve got an empire to protect and people will expect you to build another to prove yourself if only she knew what he had to protect like i said ive had time to prepare im going to be right behind you all of the way at the apartment jane thanked the senior nurse for their attendance but announced at once that they had been engaged prematurely and wouldnt be required beyond the contractually agreed first week she didnt need painkillers for a headache or any other discomfort nor would she require sedatives later as they ate jane said she patronized me expects me to collapse by the way i spoke to paul newton told him i was all right and that it wasnt necessary for him to come over she would collapse carver guessed not immediately for the moment for the coming days she was going to be wired by all the things that shed determined personally to do the breakdown would come when it all quietened after the memorial service perhaps hed speak to newton tomorrow and quietly to the nurses too carver reached out consolingly to her when they got into bed that night and didnt anticipate her immediate expectation that they would make love and was even more astonished that he was able to and that it was as good as it was afterwards she said dad had a saying that theres always a birth to make up for a death carver shifted unsure what to say i never heard it we should have a baby john weve talked about it reminded carver but not recently he reminded himself hed actually put the thought out of his mind and didnt in the present circumstances welcome its return not properly like we havent tried properly i want to undergo ivf treatment if she could become pregnant she would be continuing her fathers bloodline she wanted very much to do that well talk about it later said carver youre patronizing me like the nurse this isnt hysteria ive been thinking about it for a long time nows the right time it wasnt thought carver now wasnt the right time for anything people who deal in them accountants financiers bankers mathematicians can see a beauty in figures and the patterns that their controlling logic dictates but it was not actually a pattern of figures that alice belling believed she saw when she began going through the printouts of all the worldwide subsidiaries of mulder inc encomp and innsflow international to confirm it she hauled a world atlas on to her desk and was sure she was right as far as the united states was concerned which if she were right made them very united indeed and the templates first of europe and then of asia were sufficient further to convince her the temptation to start at once from her terminal in princes street was very strong but prudence won over impatience using the cybercafe gave her a second cutout and considering the organization she believed she had discovered alice acknowledged that she needed to continue as carefully and as protectively as possible which meant waiting until tomorrow even though the cafe didnt open until ten she was still up by seven determined not to forget anything because today was going to be a long one john carver was up by seven too so he was fully awake when al hibbert telephoned from litchfield hibbert said everythings wrecked john ive never seen a place stripped like it its terrible bastards stanley burcher was irritated at the need constantly to cross the river to meet the deliocis but acknowledged that he had to show the respect of going to them on their territory he also acknowledged that hed gone too far confronting the old man as he had at the last encounter he knew the new york families would back him if emilio delioci protested but theyd be unsettled by the way hed spoken to a don even a minor one it was essential that he recover by replacing northcote with carver to keep the system working smoothly the thomson avenue restaurant wasnt open but they were waiting for him in the back room the old man the elder son and family heir enrico delioci and paolo brescia burcher wondered idly if they had cots in a closet somewhere so that they were able to sleep in the damned place he said so what did you find nothing it was enrico who replied to spare his father the embarrassment nothing echoed burcher disbelieving there must have been something it would be he who switched the operation to john carver so there wouldnt be any need in the future to deal with this amateur crew who believed muscle was the answer to everything in future it would just be he and carver and all the powerbyassociation that the arrangement would give him i was there said brescia we took the place apart everything kept the cash and valuables to make it look like a burglary but there was none of the documentation or the names you gave us then whos got it demanded burcher maybe it wasnt there wheezed emilio delioci burcher looked at the son you made the call telling him you were sending collectors right right agreed the darkly saturnine man what did he say the exact words that hed talked it all out with you that there wasnt any point in our coming because there was nothing to collect what about when your people were trying to persuade him brescia said he died without saying anything about documents but carver knows thats what northcote said carver knows lets not forget the woman the personal assistant said enrico you want we should ask her a trick burcher instantly realized they were putting the responsibility on to him covering themselves if anything went wrong as it had up in litchfield not like you asked northcote looks like you got away with it but i dont want to stretch coincidence unless we have to what then demanded the old man another trick thought burcher it really hadnt been a mistake insisting his word was the word of the families burcher said i guess i and the people i speak for have to get personally involved as much as he wanted to do that and pick up the recognition burcher felt a stir of uncertainty as he spoke eight jack jennings flew with them and as they began to descend over the litchfield estate carver gazed down at the assembled police vehicles with a feeling of deja vu the impression was heightened by it being the same pilot in the same helicopter and of their landing almost in the same place as before to avoid those on the ground being disturbed by the down draught and as before al hibbert was already on his way towards them when they hurried from the machine the sheriff said this sure as hell isnt what you needed on top of everything else when he saw jane he said sorry mrs carver didnt realize it was you jane shook her head impatiently and said how bad is it as bad as ive ever seen around these parts worse said hibbert the place the house as well as the outhouses the pool house and all the staff quarters hasnt just been turned over to get anything and everything thats valuable its been totally trashed it had very little furniture in any of the rooms remained intact seats and cushions were slashed apart and the frames and coverings of couches and formal and easy chairs dismembered every drawer of every desk and cabinet had been taken out upended and then broken into pieces northcotes antique study desk had been crowbarred apart into something close to matchwood and the heavy buttonbacked desk chair disembowelled every book on the shelves had been taken down and its leaves torn out and strewn across the floor the doors of the cupboards below had been wrenched off their hinges the safe gaped open empty the drapes hung in shreds carver was glad hed salvaged northcotes family photographs every one that remained had been smashed the devastation through which protectively whiteoveralled forensic specialists were working was repeated throughout the ground floor it was only when they reached the sprawling splitlevel drawing room that carver realized through the mess that no antique ornament or any of the silver that northcote had collected remained nor did any of the paintings prints or original nineteenthcentury photographs of early american settlers and native american tribes a collection in itself unique if not antique the kitchen and staff accommodation had been overturned in some instances literally three huge freestanding fridge freezers had been thrown forward off their feet but only after the doors had been opened for their contents to smash and now seep over the floor the same destruction had been carried out on two separate smaller refrigerators every single thing in every storage cupboard had been heaped smashed on the floor to mix with the seepage from the freezers what wine and spirits had not been taken from the cellar were smashed and soaked the floor every room in the staff wing was demolished apart from the shell itself even to every article of clothing being slashed beyond repair and every personal item photographs ornaments momentoes smashed because there was so much soft furnishing and bedding the havoc appeared worse upstairs because every piece bed coverings duvets pillows mattresses couches and easy chairs had been eviscerated the carpet had even been lifted in northcotes bedroom and adjoining dressing room where all his suits hung in tatters from their rails and in the middle of which were piled slashed shirts and sweaters hibbert said its the same in the outhouses everything cars equipment totally wrecked carver saw that jennings was standing with a handkerchief to his face silently crying jane was gazing around face unmoving quite emotionless his voice muffled the butler said everythings gone theres nothing left this wasnt local insisted hibbert defensively i know the people around here particularly the bad ones they burglarize sure but not much and when they do they dont do this heres how i see it theres a lot of publicity in the city its a professional gang and got to be a heavy gang of four five maybe more guys to do all this overturn things like the freezers downstairs and tear off doors as they did they decide on a big hit they drive up it would need a truck obviously and see the staff go its in the papers that everyones going to manhattan for the funeral with the staff gone theyve got the whole place to themselves to do with what they want would they have found what he hadnt wondered carver impatiently uninterested in the country sheriffs failed theorizing it would have been impossible for anything anywhere here to have remained undiscovered stirring himself if only for another token protest he said why trash it why not do what you think your locals would have done simply steal whats valuable looking for something that wasnt so obviously sitting around to be snatched said hibbert with unwitting perceptiveness what about the burglar alarm demanded jane speaking at last proof that theyre professionals like their being able to open the safe said the sheriff at once place as remote from any utilities as this has to be an individual electricity supply a polemounted cable coming off the main supply way down in the lane by the lake and then carried here through two other pole mountings with transformer boosting forensics have already found the gizmo a bypass clamp between the input cable and the transformer on the last pole the cables cut in between immobilizing the system but the alarm that should go off precisely when the cable is cut doesnt operate because its still got a local battery supply a system like that has to be at least thirty years old exclaimed jane maybe more at least agreed hibbert shaking his head litchfields a peaceful place most times folks around here dont think much of updating their equipment once its in northcote hadnt bothered to hide the still unstudied bhyf and noxt documents that had been in the nightstand remembered carver carelessness like not bothering about an outofdate alarm system or complacency northcotes belief after so many unthreatened unendangered years that he had mob protection far more effective than anything electrical carver said perhaps now they will forensics are going through the place as minutely as the burglars did promised the sheriff they couldnt have done all this without leaving something behind well find it that kitchen floors a mess reminded carver difficult not to have left a footprint i would have thought why was he bothering he asked himself again now maybe agreed hibbert it would have taken time for it all to leak out like it has by then they would have moved on i already thought about it he deserved that putdown for attempting to play sherlock holmes carver accepted if there was no burglar alarm how come you discovered the breakin the bigbellied man nodded towards jane mrs carvers call yesterday telling me that the staff were all going early into the city told one of my car patrols to drive by every so often when one did first time this morning the front door was wide open he didnt need to go in and see the state of the place to work out what had happened theres nothing left to steal declared jane decisively well go back to new york do what we have to do there ill tell the insurance people and perhaps youll come back directly after the funeral to be here jack she paused looking around the destroyed bedroom when you come back youll need to bring a sleeping bag you got any idea what might be missing mrs carver asked hibbert its important for the crime report absolutely none at all said jane uncaringly it could be listed on the insurance details ill get the underwriters to contact you id appreciate it in the helicopter on the way back yet again to the city carver said hibbert was right we didnt need that so much was crowding in on him that carver found it difficult to get his thoughts in sequence in any order at all he needed space an uninterrupted hour to think its a decision reached for us announced jane conclusively the house would have been sold anyway i certainly wouldnt have wanted to keep it after what happened now we just throw everything out for garbage and call in the realtor if thats what you want said carver jane said i wonder what they were looking for as he unlocked the door the cybercafe manager said here again bright and early and alice remembered that during her interview with george northcote hed told her his work adage had always been that the early bird caught the fattest worms and hoped he was right in her case she said i told you yesterday ive got a lot to do she set out to work alphabetically state by state through her american subsidiary company listings for mulder inc encomp and innsflow international which started her in alabama where mulder supplies inc was headquartered in birmingham with ten outlets throughout the state she spent a firewallblocked hour passwordprobing which by hacking standards was hardly any time at all but which alice calculated against the number of sites she wanted to penetrate would take her two months working eight hours a day seven days a week and then only if she allowed herself two hours successfully to get into each one it was far easier taking just ten minutes getting into alabamas state tax records there were filedaheadoftime returns for mulder supplies inc for the past five years each showing a rising aftertax profit the first had been the last it took alice less time just five minutes to find the password into the local companies register to confirm the trading designation for mulder supplies inc was as a blank video tape provider to mulders entertainment division the history of which was in the so far impenetrable grand cayman parent company files she tried again and failed to get into mulder supplies headquarters before strictly according to her alphabetical schedule moving as far north as it was possible to get to anchorage alaska she gave herself another hour to get undetected into mulder marine and was again defeated but got into the state tax files just as easily as she had in alabama and they were again immaculate once more although this time for only three of the last trading years they showed an everincreasing aftertax profit that of the last year the companies register listed the business with five separately managed companies listed as seafood providers to mulders restaurant and hotel division once more disappearing into the cayman parent company alice had drunk her way through five cups of coffee by midday and was hot with the frustration of not being able to get where and what she wanted what she did have were the immaculately kept financial records of a pyramid of seemingly superbly managed companies which never suffered financial setback and whose profits climbed each year to new heights it was far too soon to reach even ballpark conclusions but calculated against the minimum aftertax returns shed so far accessed alice estimated that if every subsidiary of mulder inc showed annually cleared profits of the yearly income into the tax exempt grand cayman was in excess of a billion dollars and conceivably could if she worked her way through all the subsidiaries and their associated companies be double even treble that all legal except that it wasnt legal if what she believed she was seeing had been true for god knows how many years millions trillions had been laundered sparkling white but there was no proof no evidence why for fucks sake hadnt john carver demanded northcotes personal files straight away but john always expected rectitude or something close she always expected the wrong the sly the manipulative and the questionable the dichotomy hadnt arisen between them before but now john financially brilliant but alice hesitated at continuing the judgement but then did because it needed to be continued naive in the back alleys of the professional money netherworld was potentially being sucked down into a blackness hed never known and one from which he was going to need help to find his way out her help what in which direction was her way the way she needed to go to find the allimportant sofar missing conduit which there had to be a pathway along those black alleys through which those millions were carried to be untraceably lost in the sunshine of the caribbean england it was a logical choice because alice didnt speak any of the languages of the other european or asian countries although she was more than able to interpret their figures and hopefully the patterns they made in england mulder inc was registered ironically in cheapside london and predictably she was defeated attempting to break into their caribbean system using their local password she found english subsidiaries for mulder encomp and innsflow spread throughout the country from brighton and bristol in the south to manchester liverpool and newcastle in the north it was in liverpool that she penetrated the local tax office and pulled up the returns for the previous seven years which predictably again showed a rising aftertax profit in the last full financial year it had been but at last there was more the liverpool company mulder enterprises was listed as a video and cd supply company owned again by the cayman parent company but also recorded on the tax return was importation from the alabama supply company through an importexport company named as bhyf international the companies register recorded a branch office in london with headquarters in toronto canada there were subsidiaries in paris berlin rome and tokyo it took alice four further hours to penetrate every relevant british tax office and in every case their overseas trade was conducted through bhyf international alice hadnt realized it was dark until the cafe manager whod provided her with coffee and offered sandwiches which shed declined appeared at her elbow and said were closing in an hour you seemed kind of engrossed it happens once you get caught up in the web it was a line hed used before she guessed she said thanks i guess ill need the hour maybe a lot more which she almost at once realized she would for that last hour she computed every password she could think of for encomp and was consistently rejected which by now was not an unfamiliar experience as she paid the manager said ive seen some concentration youre way up at the top alice said i dont like being at the bottom the man whom she guessed to be around thirty said thats not my speed either hurts too much but maybe youd get the cramp out if i bought you a drink that most definitely was a line hed used before she decided at the same time as accepting that she was cramped over her back and shoulders thanks but no its been a long day that a drink wont fix another time maybe maybe am i going to see you tomorrow dont be late opening up im bill by the way he said invitingly alice look forward to seeing you tomorrow alice jane was the superlative hostess at the welcoming cocktail party people arrived protectively en masse with obvious preplanning and in the first minutes remained respectfully subdued jane quickly put people at their ease circulating among the couples as easily as she had earlier moved among the overseas executives chatting laughing occasionally and towards the end making the briefest of announcements that she would regard the following nights dinner as a tribute to her father not his wake carver was anxious for the reception to end and the moment it did announced there were things he had to do and locked himself into his study hesitating before picking up the telephone to call alice never before having called her from the apartment while jane was there alice picked up the telephone on its second ring and the moment she recognized his voice she said where are you at the apartment wheres jane here it isnt a good idea just listen he insisted which she did without interruption as he told her about the ransacking of northcotes litchfield house her reaction was not what he expected instead of expressing surprise she said quietvoiced we need to meet it would mean finally disclosing her hacking but things were happening too fast too dangerously for that any longer to be a consideration you know i cant now you listen i think ive got something what about those companies i told you not to do anything why had he been stupid enough to tell her in the first place its quite safe you know damned well its not youll understand when i explain stop it whatever it is youre doing i think i know how its done maybe even how george set it up its brilliant alice darling please dont do anything else anything more until we meet when not until after the funeral it gave her a lot of time alice calculated although he was the liaison between all five new york families stanley burcher reported directly to the consigliere of the genovese organization charlie petrie was a nonitalian like burcher and like burcher a qualified lawyer there was no regular pattern of contact between them but petrie always knew when burcher was in manhattan and where to find him if there was a need burcher liked the algonquin both for its history and for its discretion burchers automatic thought when petries call came was that there had been a complaint against him from the delioci people and he was early for their appointment in the lounge mentally rehearsing his responses to the expected accusations petrie was early too a conservatively dressed undistinguished man but unlike burcher someone who occasionally attracted the sort of attention burcher shunned exuding the confidence that came from being imbued with power it occurred now in the quickness with which a waiter was at their side before theyd finished shaking hands they ordered coffee burcher had selected a table and chairs beyond the hearing of anyone else in the lounge petrie said were getting some worried calls from around the country the deliocis made a total mess said burcher deciding upon attack for defence their capo didnt even go personally to make the collection from northcote do you tell him to careful thought burcher and then quickly came up with the perfect response i didnt have the authority to tell them when i arranged the collection that would have been disrespectful he was sure the smile was properly apologetic which im afraid i was when i heard what happened petrie shook his head dismissively hows it all going to be sorted burcher accepted he was going to have to commit himself before he died northcote told them his successor knew all about it which is perfect he just carries on where northcote literally stopped everything goes on uninterrupted petrie smiled thats good this is why i called you to hear how it goes on weve got other outside accountants sure but no one with northcotes overview you think northcote trained the new guy up now it was burcher who shook his head no as weve already said when we met that last time he was stupid said hed held things back that would be embarrassing for everybody and that it was his insurance against the firm being involved any more i told him not to be ridiculous and that he had to return everything hed kept he said he was going up to the country so i told him wed pick it up there our accountants inside should have picked up what he was doing conceded petrie it was too sweet for too long said burcher everyone got sloppy how you going to bring the new guy into line if he thinks he can say no working on it said burcher theres another problem announced petrie doesnt involve you but you should know about it like you said people were getting sloppy theres been a tightening up one of our electronic whizzkids picked up someone trying to hack into our subsidiaries happens a lot but this seems to have happened too much like they were being targeted wheres the hacking from england but our guys dont think thats the origin he shrugged i dont understand what the hell theyre talking about they say they can find out where though i thought there were ways of making that impossible so did i its a problem people not doing the job theyre paid to do nine the entire litchfield staff under the autocratic command of jack jennings was already assembled at the lawyers office when carver and jane arrived also early for the reading of the will the atmosphere in the shuffling nearsilent anteroom was palpably a mixture of uncertainty selfrecrimination and embarrassment at once jane said lets get a few things out of the way before we go in firstly the robbery whats happened up at litchfield is not anybodys fault or responsibility i brought you back here and i am glad i did people who did what they did to dads home would have badly hurt anyone who had been there in their way not hurt thought carver killed if thered been a caretaker despite whatever had been published in the newspapers whod emerged at whatever period of the invasion he or she would have been killed feeling he should contribute carver said thats absolutely right we youve been lucky by not being there like i said jane cut him off thats the first thing heres the second it gets rid of the place which i would obviously have done anyway the pause was perfectly theatrically timed youre here to hear my fathers gratitude which i want to extend thank you for looking after him as well and as faithfully as you did for so many years he loved you all as much as you loved and cared for him the next pause was just as well staged now we come to the third point i want to make no ones job goes youre all going to be absorbed between our place here in manhattan and our place in litchfield we all stay together ok the relieved acceptance was as palpable as the earlier ambience thats how its going to be but if any of you wish to leave after today then of course you go with our love and best wishes and with the best references its possible for me to give you before there could be any response burt elliotts secretary appeared to usher them into a room in which chairs were already set out in rows the lawyer came forward at once to greet carver and jane and personally led them towards two larger widearmed and highbacked chairs which segregated them from everyone else carver sat selfconsciously jane showed no discomfort elliott a large bulbousfeatured man began with the prepared expressions of sympathy and regret to which carver closed himself off not hearing the words but watching the man and his attitude particularly towards jane burt elliott could be the person with whom northcote had deposited the firms escape nothing elliott could read obviously a discreet sealed envelope or package thats what lawyers were for discreet exchanges of discreet information jane would demand to know what it was if he were handed something today there would be an evasion of sorts in his dismissing it as something involving the firm although logically that would have been deposited with the firms lawyer not burt elliott personal insurance that protected the company mentally snatched carver it wasnt good hardly good enough at all confronted by janes newly emerged attitude but he arranged such schemes every week and he was sure he could talk convincingly enough to satisfy janes curiosity elliott had got to the bequests now itemizing the individual legacies the housekeeper and the cook were already crying and jennings broke down too when the amount of his gift was declared there are individual personal letters of gratitude to each of you from mr northcote said the lawyer offering envelopes to each there were still some remaining when he finished and the lawyer said to carver there are also some bestowals for his personal staff at the firm with instructions that they should be handed to you to be dispersed of course accepted carver needing physically to stop himself grabbing out for the envelopes and further restraining himself from at once searching through for one addressed to him he delayed until a disruption was caused by the staff withdrawing at elliotts suggestion to the anteroom while the family details of the will were read there were envelopes for janice snow and northcotes secretarial staff but nothing in carvers name the rest of the meeting was brief jane who already knew accepted without any reaction whatsoever that she was a millionairess in her own right carvers instinctive thought at the declaration of his gift was that northcote the consummate accountant had taken every measure to prevent either he or jane paying more than the absolute minimum in tax carver seized his opportunity when jane preceded him out into the anteroom to more tears and individual thanks from the stillassembled staff he stopped at the communicating door of the office blocking the escorting elliott and said wasnt there anything else for me anything else frowned the lawyer a package maybe an envelope elliott shook his head youve got all there was what were you expecting something to do with the firm said carver using the avoidance hed planned for jane elliott shook his head again sorry carver got to janes side as jennings was announcing that with almost twentyfour hours before the funeral he intended returning to litchfield with the housekeeper and the gardener to continue the clearingout when he asked if she were quite sure she wanted everything thrown away jane said i never want to see the place again or anything that was in it as they drove back to wall street carver said you didnt tell me we were going to take everyone on i didnt decide myself until we were on our way to hear the will were stretched with our own place at litchfield as well as the apartment here weve managed well enough so far therell probably be a lot more entertaining now that youve properly taken over before we were married and i was living at home there were times when we had people in every night would northcotes real paymasters have been among the guests wondered carver they cant all live in here in manhattan jane turned more fully towards him is there a problem none i just think you might have mentioned it to me first i told you i didnt decide until we were on our way to burt elliotts office im sorry she didnt sound it thought carver so where will they live we keep on the apartments dad set up for them here in manhattan its taxdeductible isnt it ill have to see the scheme he used if dad devised it it works so were agreed theres no problem ok what were you talking about to burt as we left thanking him thats all said carver carver endured more tears and gratitude from northcotes office staff and asked janice snow to stay when everyone else began filing out of the office their bequest envelopes in hand janice said im glad we can talk the girls are worried about whats going to happen to them and id like to know whats going to happen too he should have anticipated it accepted carver but it was a convenient opening i havent had time to discuss it with the other partners but im not planning to let anyone go most certainly not you youre going to have to help me a whole lot for the transition to be as seamless as possible what about hilda well have to work it out improvised carver off the top of my head i dont see why you cant both work in tandem the works going to be there im grateful very grateful the girls will be too as she made to stand carver said thats not all i want to talk about and placed northcotes three unidentified keys on the desk between them you recognize any of these the woman did get up to pick through the tiny collection she at once separated one and said thats his personal safe key in the vault downstairs she isolated another and thats my safe key here in the office id got another from security thinking id lost it i dont know what he was doing with it she smiled up he was getting very absentminded about things lately leaving things unlocked didnt he know it thought carver feeling a warmth of satisfaction surge through him everything had to be in northcotes personal safe thats where hed seen the inflated draft accounts for mulder encomp and innsflow and thats where theyd still be when he found with difficulty carver halted the thought bringing himself back to the woman whod sat down again what hed imagined at litchfield to be a security key remained unidentified on the desk you dont know that one ive never seen it before said janice positively genuine ignorance or what hed suspected to be avoidance on the telephone carver breathed in deeply preparing the new approach i want to talk some more about those three companies that george kept very much to himself there were others announced janice at once ones called bhyf the other noxt she wouldnt have offered them like that if she were part of it carver thought five in all thats all ive checked anything retained of georges copies not on the computer i did the computer filing for him remember i would have known what about hard copies theyd be in his personal safe in the vault if there are any he would have run them off himself if hed wanted to you havent looked the woman shook her head with so much uncertainty now i waited for you to come back good nodded carver to do the independent audit george would have needed the books invoices how did they get here i dont know you dont know you dealt with all his mail all his deliveries didnt you i never received anything in the mail or by personal delivery mr northcote met a lot of clients personally i told you that on the telephone i always assumed thats how he got the accounts handed over personally you handled his appointments diary which i need to go through with you so how often did the mulder people come here to see george i dont remember anyone actually coming here to the office although it could easily have happened people often gave just their names without saying who they represented or even initials like sb and rarely lunched with northcote in the same place twice thought carver why are you asking me about these special clients janice demanded abruptly because they are special different from the rest said carver deciding he was giving nothing away by being honest i need to know why they were dealt with like this which isnt usual he hesitated i got the impression that george was thinking of ending the firms association he say anything about that to you never said janice he was trying too hard too quickly unless that is janice snow was part of the conspiracy it would make sense to have someone else in the firm ensuring northcote stayed in line and explain her vagueness now despite her earlier giving him the names of the last two companies who had been northcotes pa before janice and how had janice snow come to be employed personnel would have her records maybe even those of her predecessor and if carver once more consciously halted the drift realizing how easy it was becoming to make shapes out of shadows george northcotes personal office safe wasnt in the shadows any more the key was right there in front of him on the desk waiting to be used he said its going to take a while for me to understand how george worked to understand his special relationship with his special clients time we havent got today why dont you go and tell the girls that theyre all ok and try to remember some names you think you could do that im sure i could promised janice and thank you again it was not until he actually got to the gates of the vault that the analogy occurred to carver they were exactly that floortoceiling metalbarred gates that looked unnervingly like the cell doors in every prison movie hed ever seen quite often with a man shouting through them that he was innocent or had been framed for the first time carver realized that george northcotes personal safe was an oldfashioned keyoperated twin to that in litchfield differing only in the shape and cut of the key that opened it all the other safes worked by combination standing like an honour guard beside it in the vault carver had every right to be going through northcotes personal records but he still looked uncertainly around the vault even though he already knew himself to be alone and even turned to the similarly empty corridor before turning back to the heavy safe casing secured to the floor the door swung easily soundlessly open to reveal a halffilled interior the shelves much more tidily arranged than he remembered from his accidentally stumbledupon discovery a few short days ago the files then for mulder inc encomp and innsflow international had been strewn haphazardly upon the uppermost shelf they werent now carver worked his way methodically through everything page by individual page to ensure a cover or a section hadnt been utilized to hide what he was looking for none had refusing to accept defeat refusing in his switchbacking desperation to accept northcote had denied him yet again carver went just as carefully through every manila folder binder and paper yet again recognizing each totally legitimate client carver slammed the safe door closed so violently that it bounced open again unsecured and was at once embarrassed at his own petulance although the fury still burned through him as he closed and locked the door more properly he thought why why having promised given an undertaking at least to provide the documentary protection had northcote reneged exposing them all to danger because hed thought he had time carver supposed insufficient everything was insufficient what he knew or didnt know was insufficient and ways to find what he didnt know and how to protect the firm and jane and himself were insufficient alice too he supposed although she was not directly in danger what about the handwritten still unread notes in northcotes nightstand hurriedly angered at himself for not including it in his previous searches carver went yet again through everything in the safe seeking references to companies named bhyf and noxt once more there was nothing nothing that is in this halffilled safe there might just might be in the firms records though there were still places to look computer avenues to follow and a computer in northcotes office along which to travel them but jane was waiting there when he got back upstairs she said ive gone through everything for tomorrow with the funeral director arranged for the insurance company to send their inventory for litchfield and arranged a meeting there with the loss adjuster the day after tomorrow im seeing the realtor then too and im up to date with the condolence letters dont you think you should slow down just a little ill slow down when everythings done we should leave now if were going to be on time for tonight hed forgotten the rescheduled dinner carver realized im ready when you are as they got into the elevator jane said janice told me youre keeping all dads office staff on they can be absorbed through the firm easily enough im glad youve done that it was almost as if jane saw herself with a place in the firm carver said i thought you would be jane came to an abrupt stop at the door to their car that the driver held open on the pavement outside the northcote office block i forgot janice said she didnt know what to do with the valise youd left in dads office i told her to put it in her own office safe was that right carvers sensation was of his stomach being hollowed out fine he managed that the one you brought back from litchfield yes you never did tell me what was in it some stuff hed taken home to work on would it still be there if janice snow was involved in it all alice belling didnt have it all didnt think she had half of it but she had the exhausted satisfaction of believing that she had almost enough to understand and the other linked companies shed abandoned the repeated efforts to get into the mulder inc subsidiaries spread throughout america instead using the local tax offices and local company registers in twentysix of the states shed so far covered in abilene kansas shed found another reference to the romebased bhyf international independence missouri had given her noxt again headquarters in cheapside london england and as with bhyf it defeated her attempts to hack into it as she paid the persistent manager said changed your mind about that drink alice she shook her head smiling got a big day tomorrow more to do here a funeral she had every reason to go shed met george northcote and liked him she supposed she should have warned john but she hadnt decided when hed called from east nd street and now there was no way she could call him back anyone close she shook her head again someone i thought i knew thought you knew queried the man frowning misspoken she said it actually wasnt misspoken at all she thought stanley burcher decided it was time to identify john carver who shortly was to become his obedient marionette dancing whenever he pulled a string and what better and more unobtrusive way than becoming a mourner at a funeral that would be attended by so many it was even right that he should attend burcher decided he had known properly known george northcote better than anyone who would be there ten alice was at the rear of the cathedral and carver saw her the moment he entered jane at his side disdaining his supporting arm as shed rejected dr newtons offer of tranquillizers either for the earlier private entombment or for this very public ceremony alice smiled faintly carver showed no recognition although he could have done theyd officially publicly met more than once during her article preparation on northcote he realized it was the first time that the two women he loved had been together in the same place the first time also that alice had seen jane although that might be difficult through janes dark veil despite the rationalizing he waited for the discomfort there wasnt any he wished hed responded to alices smile but it was too late now he was long past her pew more than halfway along the nave an estimate was difficult but carver guessed there were at least a thousand mourners maybe more maybe among them were he hadnt paused at seeing alice hadnt needed to but he came close now the briefest easily hidden stumble of course they would be here somewhere whoever they were what did they look like mob guys did they wear fivehundred a thousand dollar suits permanent dark glasses not move without b bodyguards around them or were they or those who represented them quite ordinary the sort of people you never noticed on the streets or on the subway never saw anywhere anywhen because they were professionally and physically so inconspicuous as to be invisible carver actually looked around more intently at the crowd than hed looked at alice and saw no one no face he could have remembered no thousanddollar suits no dark glasses nothing but he was sure theyd be there he was so enclosed in his own thoughts that there was almost another stumble when he momentarily failed to recognize their pew from which he only recovered by ushering jane in ahead of him but so engrossed did carver remain that everything the service and the hymns and the eulogy seemed to be on a suspended outofbody level until it was his moment to give the second of the readings from corinthians it was as if his steps ascending to the pulpit awoke him although it was only when he started reading that he appreciated the hypocrisy of the passage he began render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due the cough was disguisable like everything else fear to whom fear honour to whom honour carver managed to complete the full text without any further hesitation wondering as he spoke how many sharks out there in the sea of unseen faces were recognizing as he was recognizing the irony of the meaningless words he was mouthing when he got back to his place jane felt across and squeezed his hand and whispered that was wonderful darling thank you there was a second eulogy from the bishop in which he referred to northcotes financial support for a drug rehabilitation centre in harlem of which until that moment carver had been unaware and two more hymns before the procession out of the cathedral as he passed where alice stood carver smiled at her now she remained expressionless towards him stanley burcher stood anonymous as always within the crush of people watching the man he now knew to be john carver caringly although not touchingly escort his wife from the cathedral not as dominantly commanding as george northcote not as physically big but certainly imposing tailored to illustrate the broadshouldered straightbacked stature tight crinkled hair like a tight cap heavynosed face no jewellery not even a wedding band in closer proximity burcher guessed carver would emanate the same instinctive ambience of power that came from charlie petrie burcher was turning with the existing procession and intently studied the congregation to try to locate whoever it was to whom carver had so briefly smiled if the deliocis had done as they were told there should be somewhere among this train of people someone preparing for him as full a profile as possible upon john carver he hoped he was wrong about his impression that the man had the arrogance of power hed declared himself and his idea for continuity now hed lose face if he didnt come through but then how could he fail to come through with the backing he had he didnt need to go to the wake hed shown sufficient respect for george northcotes passing if the stupid bastard hadnt behaved in the totally unexpected way that he had hed still be cutting the grass of his litchfield pastures the receiving line at the plaza was so interminable that carver decided hed miscalculated his one thousand mourners estimate by at least half and he stood constantly surreptitiously looking beyond the person he was immediately greeting and introducing to jane for the initial sight of alice for the first time at last experiencing a discomfort he expected to become guilt which he knew although he didnt want to accept was a feeling he deserved but never felt because alice never appeared in the line discomfited though he was carver still felt a lurch of disappointment which increased his discomfort even more he and jane split to circulate which carver realized he would normally have accepted as a necessary duty which it still was because the majority of the people with whom he exchanged empty pleasantries were existing clients but now his concentration was absolute entirely different from what it once would have been he was intent upon every name trying to remember it from the client list and when he didnt know one he stopped longer waiting for one of the company names constantly echoing in his mind not knowing what he would do if he heard it which he didnt it was almost thirty minutes before he reached jack jennings grouped with the house and office staff carver only intended a passing greeting but jennings separated himself from the others and said everythings out of the house for when mrs carver needs to come with the realtor im grateful thanked carver and sheriff hibbert stopped by he says he cant understand it but his forensics guys havent picked up a single clue from the way the house was trashed he asked me to tell you tell you he was sorry and that hed see you up in litchfield there was really nothing hibbert could have told him thought carver he looked beyond jennings to the office staff wheres janice she got upset at the service said hilda shes gone home security would have the combination code to her safe carver guessed he couldnt wait until the following day to retrieve the valise or finally to go through its contents to understand if he could the importance of bhyf and noxt carver tensed for jane to say she would return to wall street with him but she didnt accepting his promise not to be longer than an hour security did have the code and carvers relief began at the sight of the valise and settled when inside his own locked office he found what he initially believed to be everything intact it only took him fifteen minutes to realize it wasnt hed counted the folios he had taken from northcotes nightstand and the six spreadsheets were there but they in themselves were incomplete for both bhyf and noxt there was though a pattern it was classic doubleaccounting with sufficient reworked figures to see that alreadysubstantial profits were being hugely inflated doubling or even trebling the returns which didnt make sense these were the sort of massaged fraudulent figures that hed accused northcote of creating when theyd had their confrontation over the three other companies meant to be produced at a stockholders meeting or just prior to a flotation to boost share prices and investors confidence but bhyf and noxt were clearly shown on the papers in front of him to be private nonstockholder companies with inaccessible registrations in grand cayman certainly not businesses about to offer themselves on a publicly scrutinized monitored market it was a jigsaw a jigsaw with too many pieces still missing hed only skimmed the other spreadsheets in northcotes safe everything far too brief to learn what he needed to know his linking denominator in all five companies was this inexplicable inflation where was the bridge the conduit joining it all together making it understandable still hidden he answered himself geoffrey davis the firms lawyer answered the internal telephone himself and said at once i didnt expect you back this afternoon one or two things to look at said carver lets talk about the chase what about it do we have a safedeposit facility there as well as the firms account george did after so many blocked alleys carvers feeling was more of hope than expectation in his name or the firms the firms so ive authority to access it might be an idea to advise their security director you want me to do that right away said carver too late today tomorrow ok first thing said carver it was time to get back to as much normality as possible carver decided replacing the telephone hilda had to reestablish his diary and devise a way for her and janice snow to work together and he had to see alice with more reason than normal he needed to hear what she was so excited about she must have been directly beside the telephone from the quickness with which she picked it up id hoped it would be you she said kind of expected it she wouldnt tell him on the phone how much more shed discovered one of the few rules between them the most important rule of all was always to be honest and she hadnt been not exactly dishonest not talking to him about how she learned some of the things that had made her successful still better disclosed when they were face to face i certainly didnt expect to see you there today janes very beautiful i dont want to go this route alices phrase he remembered sorry you ok no theres a lot i want to talk to you about a lot i want to talk about to you too tomorrow when early ive got to go to the chase in the morning i could come straight on from there still nothing carver hesitated in some manner somehow shed involved herself obviously wanting to help but potentially endangering herself which in every way at all costs he had to stop her doing things still to check out you havent done anything more have you now the hesitation was from her end im looking forward to our talking tomorrow that isnt an answer i think i know how its done which was more than he did you told me that already and i told you to stop what time tomorrow just stay in the apartment until i get there and dont do anything else until i do how about i love you i love you so please do as i ask i love you too that wasnt a proper answer either thought carver he was soon to find others though some of which he wanted to know and others which he didnt jack jennings was waiting at northcotes west th street apartment as theyd arranged and said at once i think ive found what youre looking for which he had the safe was in northcotes study fitted behind a cupboard as it had been in litchfield this was a much more modern model although still keyoperated and the last remaining unidentified litchfield key the odd red one fitted perfectly it contained far more than litchfield although it took carver far less time to absorb there were a lot more photographs of northcote and the unknown anna whose surname he discovered from three of the accompanying documents to be simpson and other photographs he looked at intently but failed to recognize and there were five spreadsheets which he guessed without comparing to be part of what hed found in the nightstand at litchfield carver sat at northcotes desk almost too long the bhyf and noxt material of least interest as he realized it couldnt be taken from here not tonight at least when he told jennings hed be back early the following morning the butler said he hoped everything was all right and carver said he hoped it was too with the extra staff and the nurses who were still there the east nd street apartment seemed very overcrowded when carver went to enter the dining room that night one of the litchfield maids helping manuel stood aside to let him in as he held back to let her out and manuel completed the confusion by colliding into her from behind jane said im taking four back to litchfield with me thatll help they can livein there but you need to check the apartments here i know hed actually forgotten remembering was part of returning to normality he told himself manuel led the maid back in with the serving trays his irritation obvious at what he clearly regarded as an intrusion on to his territory jane said i thought meat loaf was the easiest i didnt know how today was going to turn out meat loafs fine carver took a token portion to rearrange on his plate i talked with rosemary when i got back this afternoon rosemary pritchard was janes gynaecologist alices too upon johns recommendation when shed had an irregularity problem which rosemary pritchard had rectified to the point of alices complacency it would have been fatuous to ask what about what did she say that thered have to be some tests obviously but if theyre ok i can start ivf right away jane ate with her head over her plate not looking at him she asked what you thought about it she looked up at last so how do you feel about it carver sipped his wine delaying about our having a baby i feel fine about rushing into it now as if we have something to prove like its a race im not so sure rosemary told me it nearly always takes time so were not rushing into it maybe we should talk to rosemary about it together other people perhaps other people like psychiatrists perhaps she said in echo i didnt mean other people like psychiatrists he lied what other people then she demanded trapping him i wasnt thinking any further than paul newton whos a medical doctor whos overcrowded this apartment with nurses i dont want or need and who are leaving the very moment their seven days are up carver pushed the meal away i wont let this get into a fight its not a situation to fight about ill come up to litchfield at the weekend and well talk more about it and then well go to see rosemary together and work it out you started jane but stopped carver waited but she didnt continue instead she said i forgot you didnt like meat loaf i wasnt hungry anyway stanley burcher heard his telephone as he walked along the corridor to his room and finished at a run snatching it off its cradle at what he guessed would have been its last ring the voice he recognized at once to be enrico deliocis said she knows too much she stop insisted burcher where are you with her in her apartment using her phone mine cellphone said the other man heavily patronizing burcher breathed out heavily thered still be a trace to the algonquin on the cellphone whats she know the names of all the companies that records were never kept after she wrote up the official returns from northcotes handwritten originals she also told us carver brought a bunch of stuff back with him from litchfield needed a valise to carry it and hes been asking her questions about it all burchers mind was leapfrogging ahead of all that was happening trying to keep everything in its proper order this looked like another fuckup worse maybe than litchfield she hurt you told us to find out what she knew she wouldnt tell us at first the bastards were setting him up making him responsible there has to be another accident get it wrong and therell be a lot more eleven carver carried the coffee that jack jennings had waiting for him into the west th street study where the previous night hed made the most unexpected discoveries of all and sat sipping it at northcotes desk looking more carefully through everything he took once more from the safe it was easy to divide the papers between the two attache cases carver had brought having been mentally able to plan overnight the personal material and photographs took up more room in one than the additional inflated calculations for bhyf and noxt in the other and carver gave himself time to finish his coffee and study them more carefully than he had the first time they unquestionably formed the missing section of what hed found in the litchfield nightstand and carver wondered why northcote had worked like this piecemeal leaving documents behind him like a paperchase which in fact it was and then he remembered northcotes difficulties at the end with holding thoughts and words and decided the older mans problems had been greater than any of them had suspected or maybe it was intentional dividing what hed withheld to save some if he lost or was forced to surrender part whatever it was timewasting speculation with what he now had and whatever alice had possibly unearthed he now had virtually all he needed to get rid of the unwanted clients and protect the firm there was an internal email from geoffrey davis when he arrived in wall street advising him that the chase manhattan security manager was expecting him at ten and reminding him that he would need the second key for the unlocking procedure it was the same customary system for his safedeposit facility at citibank just two blocks further up along wall street the key for which was already in his pocket but daviss reminder surprised him ive got no keys unaccounted for i thought it would be here he told the lawyer on the internal telephone i dont have it maybe janice keeps it suggested davis which was how carver learned from hilda bennett that janice snow had not arrived for work that morning you said yesterday she was upset maybe shes taking the day off i called theres no reply and no answering machine to leave a message call again now im looking for a key hilda did hanging on for a full five minutes before shaking her head and replacing the receiver hilda identified all the keys they found going through janices desk drawers and finally impatiently carver called davis back and told him to alert the bank security manager that he did not have the necessary duplicate before he left his own office carver carefully locked the two attache cases into his private safe carver arrived at the chase manhattan imagining that the warning in advance would be sufficient but was irritated at the extent of the officialdom even though the vice president in charge of the division had met carver both in the plaza receiving line and later during carvers dutiful mingling at the reception the man still insisted upon geoffrey davis personally bringing from the northcote offices the most recent boardroom minutes unanimously accepting carvers appointment and even then he weakly protested that there should have been supporting legal proof of carvers accession before a duplicate key could be issued the approval was finally agreed when a senior vice president accepted daviss argument that he physically represented legal proof carver thanked the lawyer for his help but said there was no need for him to stay for the opening of the box it contained half a million dollars in easily counted onethousanddollar bills individually bound in tenthousanddollar bundles yellowing certificates and diplomas confirming george northcotes professional qualifications two photographs along with the lease of northcotes original wall street building before its demolition for replacement by the present skyscraper and three more prints with handwritten annotation of anna and northcotes italian and spanish visit each yet again showed to carvers eye two people blissfully in love unlike those hed discovered in litchfield each of the three clearly showed anna wearing a wedding ring there was nothing else despite the west th street findings and his deciding earlier that morning that he had sufficient carver was disappointed that the box was empty of anything other than more personal memorabilia had anna simpson been in yesterdays cathedral congregation or the later receiving line of a thousand empty faces the one mystery figure who from all the photographs hed now seen he might have identified what could would he have done if he had recognized her there would have been nothing he could have done in the church little with jane so close beside him but there would have been a chance for something as he moved about the room an urgent whisper for her to call him an equally urgent demand for a way to contact her for what far better left in the past a successfully and properly lost secret he had to decide what to do with all the personal material once hed resolved the more important problem carver straightened from the box but paused uncertainly before taking out the photographs and putting them into his briefcase he secured it and rang for a security official to complete the necessary double locking and let him out of the vault it was the vice president in charge of the division who responded a young fairhaired man as they went through the procedure the man said i was not being intentionally awkward earlier mr carver i was strictly following regulations you should always do that said carver we value your business here at the bank thered probably been some rebuke thats good to hear is there anything else i can do nothing thank you the man smiled just one more regulation you need to sign yourself out on the register against the box number it was not until he was bending over the bound book that the idea came to carver and he covered the quick examination by pretending to fumble with the pen its ten fortyfive offered the young man for the required departure time carver nodded intent upon george northcotes signature at the bottom of the preceding page george northcotes departure from the safedeposit vault was timed at elevenfiftyfive and dated five days earlier the day hed had lunch at the harvard club with a person or persons designated in his diary as sb alice said its been longer before but this seems the longest carver said its been a lifetime in days they stood strangely awkward in front of each other carver reached out and she came to him and they kissed and held each other for several moments before separating again theres coffee or do you want something else it still wasnt noon but carver said something else i mixed some just in case she poured the martinis straight without ice as she handed him his drink she said you found anything she had to be kept out of it kept out and kept safe he was the only person capable of sorting everything out of keeping everyone safe carver shook his head nothing that properly helps but you told me you knew what it was all about now alice shook her head im only guessing what its all about i think i know how it works carver sat drink in hand waiting he had to get everything there was to get from her and then work from that foundation youre going to be angry disappointed in me please dont be she drank deeply the martini made more for her benefit than for his it was an attitude a meekness carver hadnt known in alice before why dont you just tell me shed rehearsed it several different ways but the admission of her hacking still came disjointedly and when she had finished alice wasnt sure that shed explained it as fully or as understandably as shed intended carver remained unspeaking for several minutes his own martini untouched then quietvoiced he said for two days longer youve been hacking into their systems into irs records company registrations not just here in america in other countries too yes she confessed simply carver shook his head in genuine disbelief his thoughts still coming out in bursts i cant begin to guess no one can how many laws youve broken not just broken here broken internationally no one will ever find out can ever find out she insisted its going to be all right carver wasnt angry disappointed either and although hed said it as if it was his major fear he wasnt thinking of the law either what if they detected you the people who did what they did to george i told you how ive made sure they cant one hundred and one per cent nopossibilityofbeingwrong sure absolutely ive read heard that its possible for hackers to be caught that there are devices i didnt use my own terminal here i used the double cutout of a computer cafe and someone elses system further to hide myself carver didnt properly understand what she was telling him but he thought because it was what he wanted to think that maybe it would be ok it sounded as if she knew what she was doing kids of fifteen had got in and out of the pentagon and nasa systems without being detected no more promise me give me your word and mean it that you wont do any more i promise mean it this time he insisted not like before alice didnt want to stop there really wasnt a chance of her ever being discovered and to prove shed guessed the scam correctly she needed to get into one of the systems so far denying her entry i wont do it again so what is it he finally demanded money laundering pure and simple but absolutely brilliant show me she did literally leading him to her desk upon which she had all the computer printouts sequentially arranged country by country america dominant with grand cayman at the very pinnacle well go left to right read it like a book which i think we can she declared what were looking at is a global shell game things being moved so far so fast theres no chance to see which cup the peas under we start with five organizedcrime mafia offshore companies out of reach and out of sight of any law criminal or civil into them we have to channel also out of reach and out of sight all the illegal proceeds of every crime the families commit drugs pornography prostitution loan sharking protection the lot and if my theory is right it is a lot billions of dollars you with me so far carver nodded pouring fresh drinks for them both following the electronic footsteps through the printouts heres how they do it alice picked up mulder inc encomp and innsflow international establish dozens of subsidiaries here in america state by state internationally country by country the trick and i think initially its a quite legal trick is trading only between each other state by state and country by country but never through their own subsidiaries mulder switches through encomp encomp through mulder and each through innsflow to do that they need a conduit again quite simply a very efficient internationally established importexport organization which theyve done with bhyf and noxt whose records and nearincalculable profits are also ultimately lost in the golden sand of the cayman islands using the same shellgame technique by constantly juggling the deals they avoid the legal requirement particularly necessary in england to record the tradings as a relatedparty transaction isnt that brilliant the missing parts of his jigsaw identified carver excitement moving through him and interlocking perfectly with the handwritten incomplete calculations from northcotes nightstand offshore is tax evasion and avoidance but they dont care about paying tax not in the process smiled alice virtually everything mulder encomp and innsflow and their subsidiaries trade in is consumerorientated cashorientated she smiled again and all sharing two remarkable similarities there are skyhigh supply costs which continue to soar all the way along the statebystate countrybycountry supply route and matchingly high management building and plant maintenance and depreciation costs to account for the dirty money being pumped in anticipated carver exactly said alice the genuine cost of what theyre moving between subsidiaries and states and countries has to be a fraction of what the books show on every record ive managed to get into take blank videos for instance they start off charging one dollar each for bulk orders of up to ten thousand cassettes by the time it passes through bhyf or noxt its up to seven dollars sometimes even ten no bona fide business could afford to buy or trade at supply costs like that no bona fide business would accept supply costs like that but mulder encomp and innsflow do buy for cents fractions of cents and pad it up into dollars and then tens of dollars and then hundreds of dollars all the way along the chain accepted carver they boost true costs of say ten thousand dollars up to an inflated hundred thousand pay forty thousand in tax and theyve laundered fifty thousand dollars worth of dirty money completed alice multiply that by the number of subsidiaries throughout every state in this country and all the international locations just those that we know about by the way and youve got your billions or more agreed carver reflectively until that moment hed had no conception of how big almost literally how cosmic the operation was you think george devised the whole thing carver decided against a third martini he said it had taken a long time to set up but although its simple like you said no one man could operate and control such a system and there are different tax laws in different countries it wouldnt take many suggested alice remember its basically done inhouse by their own accountants they only need to go outside for the legally required independent audits to keep the wheels moving and those wheels move damned fast the subsidiaries never deal with each other within the states in which theyre established theyre spread oh so very cleverly spread throughout the regional centres none impacting in such a way to enable crossreferencing so no one local tax authority sees a return that can be compared to show how the costs are being inflated with dirty money carver snorted a humourless laugh i wonder if theyll use what happened to george what they did to george as an example to any others who want to get out something else well never know said alice she left the desk and her printouts leading carver back to the couch she nodded to the martini pitcher you want any more yes but i wont he said so where does all this take us it takes you nowhere decided carver positively where did it take him coupled with everything else hed assembled the squaring of the circle it was unquestionably enough to give to the fbi to initiate an investigation into offsheet double accounting but as hed known from the beginning doing that would destroy in ignominy and disgrace the firm of george w northcote international it would also mean alices arrest on countless charges a second reason why the fbi was not an option but he could meet the men whod controlled and manipulated george if such an encounter ever occurred with the ground level knowing enough to confront them and if it got bad make the threat of going to the fbi create a standoff on his own terms could that is if he had the courage to do so and he did have that courage and that determination george had failed because george was old and failing and fallible not up to confronting anyone but he was carver knew it wasnt the arrogance that alice even jane sometimes accused him of he was the only person who was up to it could do it he limited his answer to confirming that hed found incomplete outofdate bhyf and noxt spreadsheets missing out any mention of the photographs of anna if there was anything else at litchfield it would have been found she persisted unquestionably so everything could be all right if they found whatever they forced george northcote to disclose lead them to theyve got no reason to pressure you or the firm how many times had he tried to reassure himself with that thought theyre still on the client list which youre having to adjust and reduce because of georges death youve had that as your out from the beginning would he really be able brave enough strong enough convincing enough to meet the situation if it came to a confrontation preempt it he thought there were the post office box numbers in georgetown on grand cayman on the client list against all five companies hed write that afternoon severing all and every connection it didnt need to come down or more accurately escalate to confrontation and threats just a simple business disassociation the sort of thing that happened all the time he said i want to take everything youve turned up alice looked back to the desk why to prevent you being a target carver thought and then he thought why not be honest youve stopped now havent you yes said alice only just avoiding the hesitation there are some things i havent had time properly to look at assess yet it might interface with what youve accessed and downloaded make everything complete i wont know if it does unless i have your stuff why not bring what youve got back here and well go through all of it together alice attempted to bargain you know why i am involved not any longer people this clever theyve got ways thats ridiculous their first argument about anything recognized carver he wondered if alice recognized it too he said i want to take away with me everything youve got weve already agreed at least ive decided that we cant count the number of laws youve broken getting what you have let alone the other risks there could be i dont want any arguments about no one ever being able to find out and trace you he hesitated deciding to continue the honesty im not angry or disappointed im frightened very very frightened and i dont even know completely what im frightened about at the moment all i can think of is containing things and containing taking away from you all thats on that desk over there is the most important containment there is at this precise moment she could get it all again thought alice that and more it would be tiresome and time consuming but she knew the electronic doors through which she could go in and out as she pleased and just to allay his fears not that hed ever know when she finished shed leave behind a trigger word to selfdestruct her hidden presence when it was entered into the machine she got up gathered together everything from the desk and silently handed it to him then she said that was our first row i already worked that out im glad it wasnt a serious one so am i can you stay longer tonight well eat somewhere in the village tonight then leave it alone now darling i thank you love you for helping for working it out when i was approaching from entirely the wrong direction but now i dont want you to do anything more i already promised said alice when she was a child and made a promise she knew she wouldnt keep shed crossed her fingers behind her back because then broken promises didnt count she crossed her fingers now carver walked back to the office glad he was on foot because as usual soho was virtually gridlocked it still took him almost half an hour because the sidewalks werent much better the groundfloor receptionist said people are looking for you mr carver and hilda redeyed was waiting outside the elevator doors when it reached his floor your cellphones off what he demanded janice hanged herself said the woman there wasnt any risk of her being discovered which meant there was no reason for john to be frightened she hadnt liked his admitting being frightened shed recognized hed been overwhelmed by george northcote but george northcote had been a physically overwhelming man and being overwhelmed wasnt being frightened it was still only one fifteen more than enough time to duplicate what shed surrendered and carry on pricking at the sites and their local tax and company registration offices to colour in more of the incomplete picture thought youd deserted me protested the space for space manager never alice flirted back feeling thirsty yet you never know depends how hard i have to work her favourite station the one at the end of the line where there was least chance of her screen being read over her shoulder was empty she logged on dialled the hotel reservation chain fingers poised to complete her entry with her trojan horse password and was confronted on the screen by the message remoterequested access refused no problem she told herself inexplicable glitches happened all the time but rarely four more times she tried one more time before quickly disconnecting their mainframe could have crashed or there could have been a power interruption although in the past shed found the english grid system more reliable than american electricity suppliers the screen glowed at her invitingly from his counter the manager called out you gotta problem no denied alice she used the google search engine to find that the local newspaper was the basingstoke gazette and accessed its website in seconds its front page was dominated by a photograph of a fireblackened shell police were treating as murder the deaths of a caretaker and two earlyshift cleaners in the arson attack that had totally destroyed the european headquarters of the hotel chains reservations site there had been four different seats of fire all caused by explosions of what forensic experts had already established to be incendiary material most likely phosphorous the possibility of terrorism had not been ruled out although there was nothing to explain why the building or the hotel corporation had been targeted alice turned off the machine and fumbled for her users fee the manager said whats the problem here something unexpected came up said alice throughout his journeying up and down town carver had been unaware of the two men alternating their surveillance but then they were professionals both former policemen it only cost one of them to learn the name of alice belling from the janitor at princes street their instructions were to pursue carver which meant neither followed alice to the cybercafe to get a visual identification twelve carver waited two hours and was about to follow geoffrey davis and james parker the personnel director out to janices brooklyn apartment when the lawyer called to say they were on their way back into manhattan it was another thirty minutes before they arrived daviss normally florid face was pale parkers was ashen as he came into carvers office parker a thin bespectacled man said as if he needed to explain ive never seen a dead body before not dead like that davis said we stayed on to identify the body to save janices mother although it was she who found janice from the beginning insisted carver parker looked to the older man and davis said janice didnt come in this morning as hilda told you hilda kept calling and getting no reply then she got a call from janices mother shed gone around to janices apartment when she didnt get a reply either she let herself in with her own key and found janice dead dead how broke in carver strangled according to the medical officer although its obvious she tried to hang herself from some loftbed stairs the rope broke said parker thats how she got injured carver shifted irritably you think we could get some coherence into this i want to know what happened and im finding it difficult davis looked surprised last night janice phoned her mother in tears she was upset by the funeral said she didnt know what was going to happen to her she knew what was going to happen to her interrupted carver again i told her she was being kept on working with hilda that no one was being let go hilda told me said the lawyer and i got your memo with a confirming copy to her said parker people get confused in grief said davis shed been with george for a long time knew his ways perhaps she knew more than his ways thought carver her being upset certainly wasnt because she was frightened of losing her job the mother gets into janices apartment with her own key it wasnt locked chained from the inside apparently not said the lawyer janice hanged herself from a rope knotted to the topmost rung of the loft ladder it was there that the rope snapped quite close to the top the medical examiner doesnt think it happened immediately his sequence is that she kicked away the stool shed stood on and for a while the rope held thats how she strangled herself he thinks she probably struggled the moment she did it according to the medical examiner people do that when they begin to strangle the rope only broke when she literally became a dead weight what injuries prompted carver surprisingly extensive said davis she came down awkwardly trapped her left arm underneath her breaking it and three fingers on that hand and her left leg that twisted under her too how highs the stool davis looked at parker to be reminded parker said eighteen inches two feet maybe i didnt pay much attention to it neither did i admitted davis from a drop of eighteen inches to two feet she breaks an arm a leg and three fingers queried carver davis frowned what are you suggesting john that the extent of her injuries really is surprising the doctor says strange things happen sometimes said parker it certainly did here janice left a note disclosed davis she must have written it soon after she spoke to her mother shed been dead for almost twenty hours before she was found she wrote that she was sorry for what she was doing but that everything was going to be turned upside down by georges death she repeated that she didnt know what was going to happen to her that everything was over they would have been standing over her had probably already started the torture breaking the fingers of her left hand but leaving her right so that she could write what she was being told what was the apartment like like again the lawyer frowned carver stopped just short of using the word trashed tidy or untidy i didnt pay much attention to that either but it seemed pretty together to me said the personnel director there was some uncomfortable body language thats my recollection too said davis then he said you implying something different from what the police say it is the suicide of a mentally upset woman which i also believe it to be having been there and talked with them a mentally upset woman who didnt bolt or chain her door carver once again felt restricted physically straitjacketed by an impotence far worse far different from that hed felt with alice after discovering northcotes criminality there was another expression of surprise from the lawyer a woman intending to kill herself who knew people would have to get in to find her all so logically so easily acceptable by police probably working ten a hundred more obvious homicide cases would janice brutalized bewildered already griefstricken have told them given them what they wanted had she known it had it even she surely wouldnt have endured so much torture if she had it proved he accepted that she hadnt been part of any moborchestrated conspiracy there was a sudden physical chill it proved even more positively that they hadnt found whatever it was of which the nightstand contents could be a part when theyd ransacked northcotes house in litchfield and if janice hadnt had it then theyd go on looking and torturing and killing the chill became even more physically intense at a sudden new awareness would she have told them of the valise hed brought back from litchfield before the burglary carver thought he would have done if his fingers and arms and legs were being broken forcing himself on he said how olds the mother old judged parker mid eighties id guess married or widowed i dont know admitted parker find out ordered carver find out if janice financially supported her too look after the funeral everything he looked to davis if theres a will ensure its administered if there isnt apply to administer what there is of janices estate well switch janices pension to the mother thats a very generous package said davis no reason why i cant do it is there carver was aware of the truculent bravado i think you might run it by the other partners suggested the lawyer i will but start on it right away said carver can we get the medical report on janice davis shook his head as much in a gesture of bewilderment as in refusal were not next of kin and in these sort of circumstances im not sure that even next of kin are allowed access few of them would want what youre asking for try i want to see it why he asked himself to what purpose something else he added looking back to the personnel director i want to see janices file and that of her predecessor if we still have it i dont think we would have it said parker look just in case ordered carver you sure theres nothing you want to talk to me about john demanded davis openly you imagining theres some link with the litchfield robbery because if you are i cant see where youre getting the slightest connection from no one was supposed to thought carver just both see what you can do ok ill try promised the lawyer doubtfully so will i undertook the younger man shouldnt he have told geoffrey davis set out all he knew shown the man alices printouts and the roughly worked inflated calculations from litchfield to explore all or any legal salvation there might be i think you might run it by the other partners echoed in carvers mind that would be the lawyers inevitable responsible reaction after going through and realizing and agonizing over all the devastating implications of exactly what he was being told seeing and realizing that there wasnt any blinding light to mark an end to the tunnel but only that of the approaching train to insist upon telling the partners would in fact be geoffrey daviss personal and professional salvation initiating in turn the personal and professional salvation of them all they provably didnt know and were therefore provably legally innocent of any misdemeanour or crime their recourse would be could only be to call in the police and the fbi he supposed and the security exchange commission and anyone else they could think of and then stand up dazzlingly white in the equally dazzling light of the hurtling train having done the right thing as well as having exonerated themselves from any misconduct guilt or censure which he could still do carver thought at that moment wanted to do to walk away to escape and start again could he could any of them start again wouldnt there always be despite any and every exoneration the stain of association upon them did he personally need to start again he was a millionaire in his own right jane was a millionaire in her own right he could quite literally walk away from it all the deafening warning bell sounded once more in his mind walk away with whom not with jane with alice certainly easily but not with jane who as hed decided when it had all first begun seven days ago seven years ago seven hundred years ago would hate him and abandon him if he exposed the firm and her father and he didnt want to be hated or abandoned by jane as he didnt want to be abandoned by alice another circle squared why had he allowed himself the reflection knowing its conclusion before he started desperation he supposed not knowing not properly safely knowing where to look where to go what to do not being not feeling adequate but that was how he had to be adequate not with geoffrey daviss involvement help or advice or the partners involvement help or advice not with anyones involvement clang went the bell alice was involved if she hadnt involved herself as deeply as cleverly as she had he wouldnt have been able to confront an approach he hoped never to meet but they didnt know about alice never would so it came back as it would always come back to him back to how strong he was capable of being when she responded to his summons carver let hilda say what she wanted to say about death and tragedies and not knowing people at all when you believed you did before dictating the severance letter already so well rehearsed and prepared in his mind to bhyf noxt mulder incorporated encomp and innsflow international he said and erase them from the clients list today you mean today confirmed carver my mother always said misfortune came in threes i hope she was wrong so do i said carver alice said she didnt want to go out to eat and was thinking of omelettes and carver said there were things to talk about first until that moment alice had wavered undecided now abruptly she blurted ive got something to tell you too you first no you she refused already regretting her decision wanting to get out of it but stood unmoving wine unopened in her hand as he told her when he had finished she handed him the bottle and the corkscrew she said you think she was murdered like george of course she was he said almost impatiently tortured to begin with jesus it was right that she tell him about the bombing in england she said they would have known who she was from george seen her if they ever came to the office they could have thought she knew more than she did perhaps she did know more than she admitted to me he drank deeply there were some things i brought back from litchfield in a valise janice put it in her office safe one night if she was tortured she would have told them said alice at once understanding yes as well as telling them about his specifically asking about the five companies he thought alice momentarily couldnt speak her already existing terror doubled she said oh shit and then she said what a stupid ridiculous thing to say carver said you had something to tell me she did as calmly as possible but hearing the words reverberate in her ears and thinking you caused it to happen you caused it to happen he said three people died i killed them caused them to be murdered you said it couldnt happen for fucks sake that no one would ever find you ordinarily theyre not supposed to be able to what about extra ordinarily you need to be brilliant to recover an internet protocol these people are brilliant absolutely fucking brilliant there was a hesitation of awareness how do you know i wanted to find out more to get through their firewalls carver looked at alice letting the silence widen between them and when she finally looked away he said you gave me your word with my fingers crossed she thought which now seemed was so fatuous there wasnt enough i have enough so you lied to me too she seized i was trying to protect you to keep you safe i was trying to protect you to keep you safe she echoed we dont know what were trying to do do we asked carver rhetorically theyre better bigger than we are and i always thought there wasnt anything i couldnt handle you know what i think demanded alice i think weve still got time to go clean get out get help and protection youre right were in way above our heads so thats what we need help and protection youd go to jail id get a deal i dont know if what youve got what ive got to go with it is sufficient for a fuller investigation what have you got to go with it she pounced he didnt immediately reply calculations some of georges rough calculations where safe where she repeated where it needs to be to protect us was his office vault secure enough for the time being until he could think of something else something better darling george who thought he had something whatever it was to protect himself is dead his face literally chopped meat janice is dead because she wouldnt tell you what she knew if she knew anything at all or tell them if she knew anything at all in some halfassed english town or village or whatever the hell basingstoke is three people are dead leaving kids and husbands and wives we cant do this by ourselves any more were not good enough clever enough weve got to go to alice stopped still not sure what they had to do to guard themselves the fbi theyll do a deal with us in return for our evidence we go to the fbi tell them what we know ill admit everything ive done and do the deal carver gave himself more wine accepting so much too much but not enough of what alice said like their not being good enough or clever enough i told you i am not sure what we have is sufficient for an fbi investigation what you got illegally hacking into irs offices and company registration records cant be the basis for an investigation a defence from people this good would have it ruled inadmissible before it got anywhere near a court or a grand jury what i got from litchfield although explaining your inadmissible findings isnt sufficient by itself whatever whichever way an fbi investigation went the firm would be destroyed whatever deal you cut with the bureau your career and reputation would be wiped out id be alive for fucks sake youd be alive i dont want to say the rest you dont have to say the rest ok jane would be devastated but shed be alive all three of us with different identities living existing in some godforsaken country never sure when they might find us were not sure now for christs sake were totally unsure and terrified i am at least the five companies we know about were all george kept in the last six months alice sat empty glass in hand waiting so there arent any more continued carver whats your point i severed the firms connection with the five today there was another moment of silence then alice said how official letters she regarded him with further disbelief you think thats it if janice told them about a valise you brought back from litchfield where they clearly found nothing what are you saying trying to say john ill give it to them more silence longer than any before spacing her words alice said give them what what they were looking for at litchfield but which i found first was that all you found just rough calculations what about georges bank i havent been to his personal bank you know i went to the chase this morning there was carver stopped shaking his head what she demanded nothing that helps just some personal things what personal things she insisted photographs no one i recognized they were old maybe its someone the fbi would recognize it was a woman her name was anna anna simpson thats all i know why had he told her that if keeping things from her was her protection he was flaking coming apart i want us to get help john proper official professional police help let me think he actually had an idea but decided against sharing it with alice she knew too much already theres nothing to think about apart from staying alive whats an internet protocol he suddenly demanded the address the trace of whoevers got into your system the fingerprint if you like i dont like said carver turning her expression what are the chances of them finding you where you worked from through the english place they bombed i dont know admitted alice honestly out of ten give me a figure a two thats good and even then it wouldnt get them to you personally would it just to the cafe and no one there knew what you were doing did they alice felt a sweep of nausea theyve got to be warned no one knew what you were doing insisted carver of course not how did you pay cash no credit cards or cheques no so no one ever knew your name the memory echoed in her mind im bill by the way and her automatic response alice she said no then theres no way you can be identified even if they did trace back to manhattan what about a warning said alice ill think of something theres nothing to think about an anonymous calls all itll take leave it to me demanded carver and i really mean that leave it to me ok i dont feel hungry he announced no she paused we could go to bed they did and there was the aphrodisiac of fear for both of them and for a long time afterwards they lay silently exhausted together at last he said ive got to go up to litchfield tomorrow im not sure yet what time ill be back when hed telephoned to tell jane of janices death shed been trying to fix the realtors inspection visit for noon he should have called her again before now ill wait to hear from you after carver had gone alice stood with her wine in her hand staring out over the bustle of soho in the direction of the cybercafe the risk was minimal but she hadnt believed theyd locate her trojan horse in the hotel chains booking system the telephone was picked up at once and the voice said here we are ready and waiting to help you is that space for space it is and its bill and i know thats you alice cos i got an ear for voices tell me were going to have that drink at last alice alice hurried the receiver back on its rest the feeling of nausea again blocking her throat stanley burcher extended his hand towards enrico delioci and said id like the phone the dons son frowned in feigned misunderstanding what the cellphone you called me on from the womans apartment the fuck you talking about the phone insisted burcher softvoiced as always and as always hating being on this queens film set i want the phone you called me on from brooklyn why demanded the younger man truculently burcher turned away from him towards the father don emilio this isnt going well for any of us i appeal to you do you not trust us mr burcher i trust you and your son and your family totally and implicitly lied burcher what we cant trust predict is the use the law would make of whatever is stored within the phones memory he slowly reached into his pocket to produce a new cellphone a very recent introduction on to the market from which it was possible to transmit photographs and offered it to enrico there a replacement well destroy the old one said paolo brescia i want it now its memory card or battery or whatever its called intact there was total silence within the room alert though he was burcher did not detect the gesture from father to son enrico delioci rose left the room and returned again within minutes offering the instrument in a hand shaking with fury burcher said thank you there was no guarantee that what hed been given was the telephone upon which hed been called from brooklyn and upon which hed given the order to dispose of northcotes assistant the silence stretched on burcher said now tell me what i need to know about john carver it came tightlipped from brescia again burcher listened dispassionately wishing there were more but conceding there was enough for his intended confrontation with the accountant it wouldnt be the only confrontation burcher decided at that moment when hed established his personal control over john carver hed enjoy telling these people that their usefulness was over there hadnt been any prior telephone call which there always had been before so burchers surprise was tinged with alarm at finding charlie petrie waiting for him at the algonquin you come about brooklyn burcher anticipated petrie shook his head you seen carver yet going to surprise him tomorrow we thought you should hear about the hacking first thirteen i t was more practical his decision about which there was later some ironic even irritated reflection to meet jane at her fathers estate which is what carver did rather than put down at their own country home to drive the ten miles around the separating lake jane hadnt arrived but jack jennings was already there and together they toured the house there wasnt the slightest trace of damage anywhere all the jackhammered doors had been replaced and those torn off their hinges rehung new refrigerators and freezers gleamed in the recesses cracked or too badly stained tiles had been relaid and overbalanced wine racks rebuilt and relabelled although there was obviously no wine george northcotes bedroom and dressing room had been recarpeted the only hint of the work that had gone into redecoration was the faintest smell of paint and a lot of windows open to dispel that carver said in the time youve had youve worked miracles jack mr northcote was well liked around here i called things got done right away the outhouses are the same everything fixed all the damaged machinery gone the man gestured in the direction of the hollow into which the tractor and cutters had flipped there was he stopped seeking the acceptable words some stuff mess there we cleaned that up too what might there have been for a proper forensic examination to find wondered carver youve still done damned well thank you i heard about mr northcotes pa its terrible poor woman terrible echoed carver he wished jane would arrive so they could get it over with and he could get back to new york in the circumstances he supposed he had to be here supporting her but hed had again to reschedule his already rearranged appointments which actually took away the need for any hurried return but he felt cutoff here too far away from things wasnt that what and where he wanted to be he asked himself at once away from it all where no one could find him in truth truth which he forced upon himself carver didnt properly know any more where he wanted to be or what he wanted to be doing there wasnt a road that wasnt blocked no halfformed hope that stood up to examination there was the one hope he hadnt explored he corrected himself the one that had come to him the previous night when he had been with alice which wasnt new it was the one the last one that hed inexplicably forgotten but which to pursue as he had to could be as destructive as everything else closing in around him here they come announced jennings from the newly restored front door barry cox was the senior partner in the realestate firm that bore his name a squat quickly moving man able to smile and talk at the same time which he did constantly he not jane led the tour of the property making quick entries in a small notebook and frequently having jennings secure one end of a long spoolretracting tape to measure the main rooms as they followed the man around jane said im coming back to new york with you i had barry drive me over so we can leave right away you didnt say last night hed somehow make time to see alice he was glad after all that his diary was clear for the afternoon it hadnt been fixed then what hadnt been fixed our first meeting with rosemary she got a cancellation so she called me i tried to catch you at the office but youd already left to come here hilda said she thought it would be all right and theres some more replies to condolence letters i need to sign apparently in future will you personally clear things with me first she looked at him curiously frowning whats the matter i havent done any worthwhile work since i cant remember when in a firm i have now to run i intended trying to fit some things in later today i tried calling you you werent there she said stiffly you knew i was coming here you should have waited there was no purpose in exacerbating it into an argument but he was irritated by her increasingly taking him for granted it occurred to him to tell her that he was in charge of the firm now not her but decided against it im sorry she said in a voice that didnt sound it lets leave it all done declared cox emerging from the main living room at the opportune moment time to talk jane said to jennings who was already withdrawing will you transfer my stuff from barrys car to the helicopter and then to the realtor how long will it take to sell the man gave a professional noncommittal shrug and went into a wellrehearsed speech about market difficulties in an economic recession concluding that it was a very valuable property in the threetofivemillion band which was a big commitment for a person to make not for a person with five million said carver and people who havent got that sort of money dont look at this sort of property youre going to concentrate upon the city cox had three offices there and the reputation of being the best countryhouse salesman operating out of manhattan which was why jane was employing him im going to offer it to as wide an audience as possible mr carver said cox the net with a picture display and digital viewing major prominence in the housing mags all along the east coast right down as far as florida might even consider the caribbean lot of money in places like antigua and the caymans what broke in carver sharply jane and the realtor looked at him with matching frowns im sorry questioned cox why did you suggest the ca carver only just managed to switch to caribbean and knew he sounded as stupid as he looked theres a lot of money there repeated the man its a good marketplace advertise it wherever you judge the most likely places to get a sale instructed jane impatiently put it on for three now the realtor frowned at her that was my bottom figure mrs carver i think we should begin higher people like to bargain think theyre getting a deal starting at threesevenfive would build in the drop to make a buyer think hed got his deal and cover your costs and fees three insisted jane thanks for your time mr cox i look forward to hearing from you in the helicopter their conversation unheard by the earphonewearing pilot jane said what was all that about back there just clarifying some things said carver inadequately sounded more like confusing some things youre giving the place away you know its mine to give away ok ok accepted carver he didnt like the new jane he decided at once he contradicted himself he loved her as much and as deeply as hed ever done what he didnt like was the new attitude perhaps his own wasnt much better rosemary pritchard was a diminutive sharpfeatured woman with the sort of commanding presence that reminded carver of the matronly nononsense hilda bennett the clipped voice fitted too jane said thanks for fitting me in fitting you and john in qualified the gynaecologist ok said jane with a touch of renewed impatience can you help me the break was a speed bump help john and i to have a baby does john want a baby rosemarys quietvoiced question startled both of them jane began of course john before rosemary in turn but much more definitely blocked the response it wasnt your question jane it was johns no thought carver at once and was just as quickly surprised at his reaction of course he wanted a child children he and jane had talked about it planned it or thought they were planning it until the months had stretched into years sixteen in fact but he didnt want a baby now not at this precise moment with so much hanging over them jane had insisted arranged without discussing it with him that he should be here invited him in fact to have his own voice even if she hadnt anticipated what he would say i think were rushing things because of whats happened he was conscious of jane twisting towards him he didnt look back at her she moved to speak but before she could rosemary said what do you think of that jane strangely for someone whod been about to respond so quickly jane didnt answer the gynaecologist said how long have you both been thinking about in vitro fertilization hurrying ahead of her husband again jane said a year at least once more carver ignored her demanding look he said the question was both we havent both been thinking about it for a year at least jane prompted rosemary there was still a hesitation before jane said its time we started a family and maintained the bloodline of a wonderful man she thought is this the time demanded the other woman i came here to talk about having a baby said jane not to be psychoanalysed thats good said rosemary its easy to cross boundaries in this job can we just talk about ivf asked jane sure agreed the other woman easily what do you want to know how quickly easily can i become pregnant the gynaecologist let some silence come between them before straightening and picking up her pen she said i put you on the pill to regularize your periods hopefully to make them more comfortable for you when my periods became easier i found i didnt need it said jane i didnt know youd stopped intruded carver you didnt talk to john about that demanded rosemary no jane admitted and you didnt tell me either did you no everyone lies or avoids the truth with everyone else thought carver until now he wouldnt have believed it from jane or alice but now he knew both had avoided the complete truth the rushed awareness of his own hypocrisy at least towards jane surged through him what had he been doing for the past eighteen months not lying certainly because the question had not been put to him nor avoiding the truth he supposed because again there had been no challenge but he was certainly morally guilty of lying to jane by having the affairs with alice or was the moral lie the one to alice prepared though she insisted she was to live with their arrangement another to join the neverending list of unanswerable questions do you properly know what in vitro fertilization involves beyond what youve read in newspapers asked rosemary no managed carver just ahead of jane who almost as quickly said yes anxious to cover the awkwardness genuinely to help jane carver said id certainly like to know the first the most important thing youve both got to understand is that ivf is not the absolute guarantee of pregnancy said the specialist despite all the claims only one in ten women successfully becomes pregnant at the first attempt by which i mean actually having a baby my personal experience success rate is that just a quarter of my patients ever achieve a full pregnancy that produces a healthy child whats it involve demanded carver he had to find an escape not from ever having a baby a dilemma he had until now refused to contemplate but from even considering it at this time for you a series of tests replied the woman neither of you have undergone fertility exploration have you no said carver quickly again a sperm count for you is the most obvious for you jane a fallopiantube examination and ovulation monitor she hesitated looking directly at jane at this moment maybe for some time in the future im not convinced you two cant create a baby in the normal unaided way and until i am im not even going to begin to consider ivf doctors dont fix arms and legs before theyre broken if john and i were able naturally to have a baby id have become pregnant by now insisted jane theres no logic in that whatsoever dismissed rosemary youve a history of menstrual difficulty simply coming off the pill for however long you have doesnt automatically mean youre going to become pregnant well run the tests on both of you if theres a problem that we cant fix then well move on to ivf when demanded jane when weve discovered if there is a problem rushing into ivf if theres not could actually lessen rather than increase your chances of becoming pregnant when can we start the tests persisted jane all we initially need from john is a specimen i could start with you jane next week its fixed then decided jane were beginning a procedure said the gynaecologist we dont yet know theres anything to fix when next week said jane rising tuesday ten said rosemary and jane what said jane already on her way to the door carver following i am a psychologist as well as a gynaecologist why dont you and john really talk this through jane held back until they got outside then she whirled on carver and said thanks a whole lot dont blame me for what happened back there you fouled it up not me you didnt help you heard what she said why dont we really talk this through which we didnt and havent this is irrational jane i know your grief and i know your loss but this isnt the way to compensate he was aware of curiosity from people having to manoeuvre around them on the sidewalk aware too that this wasnt the time to ask her about any safedeposit facilities in her fathers private bank carvers last hope of a more complete dossier jane began at last to cry but silently and unlike the first day with no racking sobs she let the tears run unchecked her nose too and carver gently wiped her face angry at the now greater curiosity of passing people she said im trying to hang on john im looking for something to hang on to how about me yes she said how about hanging on to you carver had the cab detour to east nd street glad jane changed her mind about returning with him to the office having tried three times to call alice he didnt understand why the message on her answering machine had changed or why even more worryingly she hadnt replied he tried a fourth time from the back of the taxi and got the same strangevoiced reply strangevoiced but to him easily identifiable as her and couldnt comprehend why she didnt confirm her name or number in her message she was a working journalist to whom the telephone was a major source of commissions he was even more unsettled by janes kerbside collapse and her unarguing acceptance of the nurses help when theyd got to the apartment how close was jane to a much more severe breakdown by finally acknowledging the need for nurses jane was acknowledging a problem would she also acknowledge the need for a psychiatrist he could talk to dr newton from the office have newton make a visit to the apartment and if he considered it necessary the doctor could broach the idea to put the thought into janes mind ahead of his suggesting it if there was some mental condition could he risk talking to jane about safedeposit boxes not that there was a risk in talking about such boxes the danger in janes fragile state was what those boxes if they existed might hold and carver wasnt thinking at that precise moment of incriminating evidence of longterm and massive money laundering he was thinking about photographs of a beautiful laughing girl named anna if northcote had left the photographs so easily discovered at litchfield and at west th street needing nostalgically to remind himself carver presumed or in the firms vault what was there likely to be where northcote would have believed only he would ever have access but he had to get to it if it existed and for precisely that reason the more he thought about it the more logical it was that a personal safe deposit was the only place northcote would have believed secure and secret from everyone except himself and there had to be one carver decided letting his speculation run on he knew from the chase manhattan ledger that northcote had been to the firms vault on the day of his harvard club encounter and if hed handed over then what hed retrieved he and janice snow might well still be alive so where else but to his own bank would he have gone in between the chase manhattan at am and the harvard club at pm so engrossed was he that carver physically jumped at the sound of his own cellphone almost dropping it as he fumbled it from his pocket mrs carver told me you would both be coming back said hilda shes not after all said carver im on my way though five blocks maybe but the traffics like it always is i took it upon myself to arrange something knowing youd be here around this time what demanded carver apprehensively there was a call from a lawyer representing those companies mr northcote kept on replied hilda whats the name demanded carver hearing the crack in his own voice he didnt give one although i asked obviously he said it was extremely important that he talk to you as soon as possible but that he was leaving new york tomorrow so i gave him an appointment at five this afternoon youll be here well in time for that run instinctively thought carver then delay delay at least until he could prepare himself get to northcotes personal box he leave a number a way to contact him i asked him for one of course just in case he said he was moving around the city and couldnt be reached carver looked at his watch he had just twentyfive minutes he saw abruptly ahead the traffic cleared fourteen by the time carver reached the office he had fifteen minutes left and the only precaution upon which he had decided took just five of them because everything was already set up all that was left for him to do was wait and try to anticipate which he initially did but quickly gave up because he wasnt anticipating he was imagining and the image upon which his mind settled was the nearfaceless body of george northcote carver forced the panic back consciously breathing deeply as if pulling the courage into himself he could do it if he didnt panic if he didnt conjure up mental horror pictures his stomach churned physically and a few times audibly there was no visible shake when he looked down at his hands lying before him on the desk he lifted them holding them out straight in front of him still no shake he felt his face he wasnt sweating either although he felt hot he wiped a handkerchief across his face all the same knowing he wouldnt be able to do so later he didnt know which was the root of his fear what he was going to be able to do later the lawyer who hadnt left a name arrived precisely on time and as hilda ushered him into carvers room carver thought at once of his memorial service reflection about professionally invisible people in a crowd this man would have been practically seethrough he was medium height and slightly built and everything about him was muted muted grey singlebreasted suit greyongrey patterned tie a white shirt it was impossible to gauge the mans age from the expressionless unlined face there was a strange oddly unmoving smoothness in the manner in which he walked a progress rather than an actual walk the glide of an invisible ghostlike or was it ghostmaking man carver had intended to remain seated as northcote had shown his superiority at their confrontation but had hurriedly to scramble to his feet totally losing the planned impression when the inconspicuous man stopped the offered handshake halfway over the desk making carver rise to it he at once turned to examine available chairs to take the one that put himself directly confrontationally across the desk from carver and said its good of you to see me at such short notice the polite ingratiating voice was soft worryingly close to being inaudible with no discernible accent particularly as you werent able to leave a name carver was pleased at his own hopefully forceful tone evenly pitched but demanding someone unaccustomed to being treated inconsiderately a reasonable attempt at playing the affronted man burcher decided but only just he rose taking a prepared card from his top pocket but offered it across the desk in such a way that carver had once again to stand to accept it he was going up and down like the other mans marionette accepted carver the twoline inscription on the plain pasteboard read stanley burcher attorney at law there was no address or contact details carver at once remembered the regular entries in northcotes diary sb could he have misread the intervening squiggle as an ampersand to mean northcote was meeting two people when it had only been this man stanley burcher the lawyer said the name wouldnt have meant anything i knew the company names would he was unsure how long to permit the accountant to imagine his superiority it was important not to begin wrongly they were going to have to deal with each other for a long time years so there had at least to be an amicable working relationship if not friendship until the very end burcher had imagined something approaching friendship between northcote and himself mutual respect certainly what carver wondered was the other mans real name and how many other people had ever posed themselves the same query impossible probably to guess as so much else everything else in which he was so suddenly and so unwillingly caught up was impossible to guess or to comprehend the thought was abruptly replaced by another far more relevant there had not been time for his severance letters to have reached grand cayman so what had brought this man here today how can i help you mr burcher bullshit politeness to bullshit politeness were quietly talking murder you know your murders yes i know good of you to put it so discreetly burcher allowed a momentary but perceptible hesitation for carvers benefit and carver was pleased misconstruing it as he was intended to then burcher said i dont think either of us needs to perform do we mr carver i dont understand that remark i know we can speak openly declared burcher george northcote told my clients just before he died that you knew everything in which he and my clients were involved which is convenient for us all it involves you makes you complicit after softball comes hardball to let the man know how irrevocable inescapable his position was he had to tread but more importantly to speak with extreme care carver reminded himself i have learned certain things in the last few days things that greatly concern me that knowledge in itself in no way involves me nor makes me complicit with anyone or in any way in anything he felt good equal in this confrontation stupid to have hollowed himself out near mentally as well as physically his stomach most definitely wasnt in turmoil any more all his arguments were ready logical there was an immediate lurch a twitch of contradiction how far from the whirling blades had northcotes face been when hed talked screamed in the frantic terror of realization of longkept secrets no longer being secret too obviously rehearsed but not a bad attempt allowed burcher we both know what we are talking about mr carver we do indeed mr burcher i hope this is not going to become a difficult situation said burcher the voice still politely soft perfectly modulated surely this man wasnt going to be stupid i see no reason why it should said carver he was driving choosing the route there is no reason carver recognized the beginning of a whosgoingtoblinkfirst contest youre obviously not aware of my letters burcher was put off balance by a remark he did not understand but he betrayed no reaction no tell me about your letters and what they said i yesterday sent letters officially severing all connection between george w northcote international and mulder incorporated encomp innsflow international bhyf and noxt enumerated carver with what he judged to be the necessary formality i most certainly didnt know about those letters easily admitted burcher it would have been far better if wed talked before they were sent it looked as if moulding carver as the man had to be moulded was going to be more difficult than hed imagined it had been a mistake to imagine otherwise and burcher didnt like conceding mistakes he was still in charge decided carver i dont see any benefit in my having done that i didnt after all have any idea we were going to meet but why not already knowing of my firms disassociation from your clients are you here today very definitely not as easy as he had imagined burcher recognized those whom i represent no longer appear on your computerized client list i was asked to find out why burcher improvised now it was carver who was tilted hesitating unsure which way to take the conversation cautiously he said ive just told you ive ended my firms involvement with your clients and immediately before any discussion erased them from your records i dont see any point any purpose in our discussing it further the decision has been made its irrevocable i think there is need for further discussion mr carver i repeat that i dont mr burcher there could be some resentment from my clients he had to hear carver out fully discover the reason for the mans confidence knowing as he clearly would what had really happened to northcote and to the woman in brooklyn as i have some resentment at learning that your clients have been illegally monitoring my firms computer system learning that is most definitely a cause for concern picked up burcher heavily im glad you agree with me im not agreeing with you mr carver then i dont understand my clients regard their security the security of their affairs as extremely important as i do with my firm hence my irritation my clients are more than irritated far more than irritated at discovering that very concerted attempts have been made illegally to enter their computerized records both in this country and elsewhere there was an echoing thunder of words in carvers mind no reaction facial or verbal no reaction facial or verbal evenvoiced sure he remained as expressionless as the man facing him carver said then theyll understand how i feel about their illegal entry here i obviously need to update security burcher let a silence grow between them staring directly at carver who stared directly back the lawyer broke it he said are you surprised to hear that efforts were made to intrude into my clients affairs following george northcotes death carver was chilled physically cold but sure he gave no indication as surprised as i was to learn that your clients have been intruding into mine theirs pointedly qualified burcher at once as i am sure you were more aware than i was until very recently no records of your clients affairs were retained here now carver let in the pause which is extremely unusual and not a manner or a practice in which this firm will continue now that i am in control of it the fact that it has been allowed to exist until now was a major factor in my decision to disassociate from your clients we are moving ahead of ourselves going off at tangents protested burcher i dont see that we are we were talking about illegal computer entry hacking i did not think there was anything further to talk about on that said carver the coldness moving through him again but the fact that your clients considered themselves able to do it and you felt able to admit it so readily to me provides a further reason for our parting the hacking attempt upon my clients quite a lot of which they believe to have been successful originated from here from manhattan announced burcher my clients are confident theyll very shortly find out from where and by whom which should enable you to complain to the fbi the face confronting him remained unmoving you disappoint me that wasnt a very clever remark mr carver it depends upon your point of view mine is that there is nothing to be gained for either of us by continuing this conversation ive made my decision communicated it to your clients and consider my letters to be the end of the matter its unfortunate that youve had a wasted journey i am not at all sure that it has been a wasted journey or that it is the end of anything he was arguing as if carver had an argument to put against him burcher realized astonished mr burcher i have told you and tell you again now that the firm of george w northcote international will no longer act for your clients in any capacity or in any way whatsoever that surely is clear enough there was another long silence briefly for the first time burcher broke the fixed gaze in which he had until that moment held carver to look unseeingly down at some spot near the bottom of the desk as if in contemplation hed been badly wrong believing that john carver would roll over at a frontal approach coming up again after several moments the man said the computer intrusion is not my clients greatest concern carver waited actually imagining the beginning of a renewed confidence what did george northcote tell you of his working relationship with my clients hed be losing control temporarily at least by replying to such a direct demand but there was advantage in his doing so carver decided nothing apart from confessing that for a very long time he had acted for companies controlled by organized crime he did not provide any identities i told him i had no intention of continuing which ive also told you today and he said it was a situation that would not arise that his retirement ended the firms association george northcote profited very greatly from his firms connection a benefit limited absolutely between himself and your clients burcher nodded although carver wasnt sure with what the man was agreeing the lawyer said at the end of his life george northcote proved himself a very stupid man i hope my clients hope that you are not going to make the mistakes that he did repeating the mistakes of george northcote is precisely what i do not intend doing carver was satisfied with the retort but the confidence wasnt there any more for the first time there was what carver guessed burcher intended to be a smile lips drawn back from sculpted teeth like the brief opening and closing of a curtain thats good to hear northcotes mistake was breaking a longestablished understanding no records were ever kept here but towards the end maybe over as long as five or six years my clients estimate that northcote retained what built up to be a substantial dossier of original material this should have been prevented by our own people of course but after such a long and satisfactory association theyd grown complacent which was their mistake burcher stopped waiting uncertainty about what to say what to admit and what not to admit surged through carver momentarily he had another mental image of a crushed nearfaceless body he said george told me they were to guarantee the end of the firms links with you aah said burcher stretching the exclamation as if a profound mystery had been explained then after another pause he said how exactly did he intend achieving that guarantee the thin ice was creaking beneath carvers feet again he didnt make that clear i remember him saying that there wasnt going to be a problem wasnt going to be a problem echoed burcher spacing the words to make them into an obvious threat but there was and is a very big and very real problem mr carver my clients gave george northcote the guarantee he asked for and in return he promised to return everything hed retained but he didnt my clients have gone through everything back more than ten years and they know there is still material missing and have even had it confirmed janice snow thought carver immediately how was it confirmed you brought a valise back from litchfield my clients believe that valise contained missing documents that belong to them they will be most distressed if this time they do not get them back all of them back it was not the admission about janice snow that carver had hoped for but this man was too clever for him to try to get it more obviously with another question carver decided hed played enough and achieved enough he said i believe there are some things belonging to your clients not a lot but some the curtain was briefly parted for another grimaced smile burcher thought that maybe it wasnt going to be so difficult after all i am so glad this is going to be resolved amicably sensibly you spoke of your clients having given george guarantees burcher nodded but said nothing forcing carver reluctantly on which was the return of the documentation on the understanding that all links between this firm and your clients are ended there was another nod no words burcher decided it wasnt going to be resolved today but then what was the hurry he and carver had a long life ahead of them carver stopped speaking waiting tensed too against his stomach turmoil becoming audible again there was still no visible shake in his hands seemingly easy upon the desk in front of him he didnt want to risk lifting them from the support as he had before burcher again broke the impasse there is a great deal of annoyance of which in which i am in no way involved nor is the firm only by title which has no relevance any more ill make the argument promised burcher could he make his own argument carver asked himself and followed with the other questions was he brave enough strong enough did he have incrimination enough i need the guarantee i need the missing documentation declared burcher flatly i know that everything insisted the lawyer everything agreed carver have you told anyone your wife for instance carver wasnt sure how much longer he could hold on minutes no more than minutes he moved one hand to cover the other his skin was tingling sensitive to the touch unreal it was all unreal so totally disorientating forcing the steadiness into his voice he said of course not tell his daughter what her father had done what about alice belling carver later thought although never admitting it that if he had not been sitting he might actually have had difficulty in remaining upright staggered at least at the numbing awareness of how completely he was trapped it would be ridiculous to pretend to question absolutely and most definitely not i want you to understand mr carver my clients determination to recover what is rightfully theirs he had to end it soon very soon i hope you understand my equal determination for separation between us id be better able to discuss that with my clients if i left today with what they want carver indulged himself tried to recover with a hint of derision do you honestly imagine that it would be here id certainly imagine that you have safes here a security vault not imagine thought carver hed know know from a bewildered terrified tortured janice snow what you want is divided between bank safedeposit boxes and the banks are now closed ive talked about mistakes mr carver too many totally unnecessary mistakes which ive heard i hope you have mr carver sincerely hope you have you already appear to have a complicated personal life its not one to complicate further this is a situation to be ended as is our connection persisted carver ive given you my guarantee i look forward to yours i want it all by tomorrow demanded the man letting the artificial politeness slip for the first time carvers only need a physically aching need was to end this confrontation end it and escape where can i reach you you cant ill reach you here tomorrow noon youre coming here at noon i didnt say that i said id reach you here at noon ill be waiting we both will it was three hours before carver got to princes street almost one of them spent practically unmoving initially slumped in his chair in the darkened office recovering he was exhausted by the encounter and further drained more so mentally than physically by analysing it all and what he had to do as a result of it hed telephoned warning her and when he entered her apartment alice said jesus i know he stopped her shit on a stick not even close she poured her prepared drinks spilling some in her own nervousness and said so it was bad carver stared into the martini thats the funny thing it didnt seem so when it was happening it was only afterwards thinking about it all listening tell me he did rehearsed wordperfect and alice put her drink aside head bowed she didnt immediately speak when he finished and carver didnt try to prompt her his mind once more analyzing what hed said trying to think of what he might have overlooked or misinterpreted finding nothing there was though still the denouement alice said he knew about me they know about me by name involved with me he didnt associate you with the hacking alice hadnt once personally answered her telephone since the space for space managers recognition of her voice tensed for the man to call back after tracing her number by dialling the lastcall identification code he hadnt her line had gone five times that day twice carver trying to find her the last time warning of his arrival and twice with editorial queries on articles shed written the fifth caller had ominously disconnected without leaving any message shed been too frightened to dial herself to learn who the caller was what did he say that they knew the intrusion originated from here from manhattan that all that they were going to find out who it was which we know they cant because you didnt leave any identification did you alice was on the point of telling him but decided against it what about you and i the threat was there as it was in everything else he said it was the moment to tell her to reassure her in fact he said far too much alice retrieved her drink frowning across at him what do you mean i recorded everything weve had the wiredin system for years for client interviews he smiled i pressed the button and got it all ive even made a copy before i came here tonight and weve got his name or at least the name hes using he might even be the conduit through whom george dealt combined with everything else its the dynamite thatll blow them away alice smiled back and theres going to be a meeting tomorrow hes contacting me at noon to arrange a place which makes it perfect he tells you you tell the bureau and they pick him up with the evidence when he makes the meeting carver looked at her for several moments before saying no what do you mean no that way i lose it all the firm us jane weve talked about it alice put her drink aside again to come over to where carver was sitting she knelt at his feet and took his glass from him so that she could take both his hands in hers she said no john then spacing the words no no no weve also talked about how theyre too big for us to fight they killed george and they killed janice and theyll kill you not when they hear the tape and i tell them ive got a copy of it as well as duplicates of everything else john you cant frighten them im not trying to frighten them im not going to threaten them all i want is severance this is my insurance our insurance alice felt a sweep of helplessness of not knowing what to say what to do and then abruptly she did know i want you to promise me something i want to know where youre going to meet this man burcher why i want to know where youre going to be that youre going to be safe make it somewhere open the park maybe with people all around you not an enclosed office or an apartment or a car where they can take you anywhere they want all right mean it i mean it the demand had been reversed carver realized can you stay not with jane the way she is call me then when the arrangements are fixed ok i love you i love you too its all going to work out fine i know said alice and believed she did stanley burchers irritation was soon subdued by his inherent objectivity he knew what he was going to do and wished he didnt have to use the delioci family to achieve it but his brief final involvement with them wouldnt give them any continuing rights fifteen what sleep she managed was fitful halfawareness briefly broken by horror dreams of men hitting and beating and torturing people of trying to run or escape once it was john very clearly in her mind and another time it was herself and it was so real so painful that alice woke crying out at the hurt she felt physically sick when she finally properly awoke and then she was sick needing to run to the bathroom and as she retched she decided that it was scarcely surprising knowing but even more frighteningly not knowing what she was that day going to start the nausea wasnt helped by her having finished off the martini pitcher without bothering to eat after carver had left the previous night she couldnt remember eating lunch either she forced herself now to eat toast she didnt want and drink coffee that she did to take a headache pill what was she going to start that day too much yet to comprehend or imagine total devastating upheaval the most devastating of all destroying her life with john and it would be destroyed alice forced herself to admit what was actually involved in entering the witness protection programme was another thing she couldnt anticipate apart from being given an entirely new identity possibly in an entirely new country but she didnt believe there would be any chance of retaining contact with john more importantly she didnt believe he would want to be with her know her because what she was going to do would end the firm of george w northcote international and with it most likely johns marriage to jane from the humiliating exposure that would result alice accepted although it was the last thing in the world she wanted to accept that hed hate her for making all that happen despise her for wrecking desolating all their lives but at least they would have lives not be crushed or defaced or throttled and maybe even he would have jane the humiliation of knowing what her father had been and done would not be public in front of all her friends because she wouldnt be able to have those friends any more if she and john could make their peace they could still have each other after all what of her peace alice asked herself the most unknown of all the unknowns she guessed it would take a long time if she ever found it at all so was she prepared to take the first irrevocable step upon the journey on which she was about to embark no not if there had been any other choice if there had been the slenderest of straws she would have grabbed not just clutched at it but there wasnt there were already two tortured bodies to attest to that shed make a third she supposed although mentally agonized not physically broken she hoped it still wasnt fixed yet nothing whatsoever was fixed not in place as logically sequentially as it was in her mind it could actually still go wrong even when it was fixed not go sequentially at all like it did in movies she had to ensure everything was right first time thered be no chance no action replay take two take three rewind for it to be got right as it had to be got right alice was terrified physically mentally in every way possible absolutely terrified which she couldnt be if she let herself be motivated solely by fear another way of saying unthinking panic it wouldnt be right first time disaster would implode upon disaster she would have liked a stiffening drink even with the orange pinkness of dawn still smearing the faraway horizon of new jersey but the thought brought her again too close to retching and she put the unthinkable thought aside because it was unthinkable booze wouldnt help the reverse the only thing the only person who could help her was herself keeping in their strict and proper order in her mind what she had to do and how she had to do it another intrusive irrational thought came to her and she thrust that aside not because it was unthinkable but because it was dangerous and the last thing she could risk was any more danger than she already knew she faced alice carried her coffee from the kitchen to her office to get the telephone number of the fbis manhattan field office on broadways federal plaza from the telephone directory and used a street map to trace a zigzag route back and forth across the city she was unsure whether it would be quicker better to keep her on schedule to use the subway rather than risk buses on gridlocked streets and decided she had an easy choice of alternatives if above ground proved more difficult than below it might actually make sense to dodge up and down they knew shed hacked from manhattan were looking for her here they knew her name was alice so did the overfriendly manager of the cybercafe who might have got her number from the callback service even if he hadnt used it yet but who would volunteer it soon enough scream it over and over again under whatever torture he was subjected to she couldnt wait until the protection programme to disappear she had to do it now that realization prompted another which she at once recognized was going to tighten up her schedule because shed decided she had to be back in princes street by eleven thirty that morning but it was a precaution she most definitely had to take she was pleased it had occurred to her now in time and not as an afterthought when it might have been too late she checked her balance and calculated that even leaving sufficient for her regular payments to be met she had slightly over if she withdrew from her savings as well as her checking account her branch was downtown which would increase the dangerous unnecessary temptation once more she put it to one side alice sat for a long time upon her remade bed knowing she had to make herself invisible as according to john the quiettalking stanley burcher made himself invisible she chose scuffed gym shoes jeans a white tshirt and a kagoul with an allencompassing hood she posed in front of the closet mirror raising and lowering the hood several times to satisfy herself that with it raised she became a wallpaper person she finished the effect with dark glasses and was even more satisfied she decided the necessary satchel completed the impression of an indeterminately aged student it was only when she was actually inside the elevator reaching out for the button that she corrected herself switching from ground to basement level to use the janitors stairs and the delivery entrance to emerge not directly on to princes street but into the side alley which connected with the service lane to greene street she walked with the hood up head bowed dark glasses in place but unhurriedly because shed read somewhere that in observation surveillance a hurrying person attracts more attention than one walking normally alice had known she would do it from the moment the idea first came to her like the proverbial moth to the proverbial flame she flitted through the downtown side streets until she reached that of the space for space cafe only hesitating at the actual moment of emerging on to it then she did her immediate relief absurd because she would have known from the publicity if it had been attacked was that the cybercafe was still there and from what she could see through the window was as busy as ever she couldnt pick out the persistent bill or anything a parked vehicle loitering people to indicate the place was being watched at once alice proud of believing that she totally knew herself and impatient with pretension accepted that she was posturing how could or would she know if the place was being watched she had no special ability no training she moved past forcing the normal pace instead of hurrying which she was desperate to do hunched inside the hooded concealment it had been ridiculous coming here the very opposite of what shed determined not an hour earlier in princes street that she had never to do she turned at the first available intersection and took a circuitous route to get her back towards her bank she chose a desk assistant to make the withdrawal relieved shed anticipated the request for additional proof of identity and brought her passport which from now on she decided she needed permanently to carry thats a lot of money ms belling said the man as he counted it out yes dont you think a bearer cheque would be safer it has to be cash you be careful now i intended to be said alice a remark for her own benefit more than for the man the need occurred to her as she stacked the last of the money into her satchel and i need coin maam frowned the desk assistant nickels and quarters five dollars worth five dollars worth is a lot of coin im on a tight schedule urged alice the man was back in minutes from the counter you sure about a cheque positive and thank you you be careful now you already said alice crossed towards the river and then cut uptown consciously passing three telephone pods knowing she was delaying the moment of commitment from which she would not be able to withdraw the satchel which she wore strapped across her chest was heavy and the coin made a pendulum in her purse banging against her leg as she walked the next telephone she promised herself shed make the call from the very next telephone not put it off any longer she saw the pod on the corner of st and eighth by the post office and walked on by she was being ridiculous she told herself and getting tired with the city still to crisscross and it was already ten twenty she was behind schedule not a lot but behind shed definitely begin at the port authority bus terminal alice found a closed booth and wedged herself in relieved to squeeze out of the satchel and counted some coin on to the ledge she hesitated breathing deeply to calm herself but didnt manage to not in any way she could feel she was hot and had the sensation of hearing her own heart beating it sounded fast abruptly she pumped a quarter into the box almost dropping it on her first attempt with sweatgreased fingers this is the federal bureau of investigation it was a woman black alice guessed from the tone i want to speak to the agentincharge please can i ask whos calling no i want the agentincharge her voice was close to catching at the end hearing the thump of her own heart was disorientating im not sure if hes available right now can i ask what the subject matter is alice breathed in deeply again organized crime murder money laundering can i ask you to hold on for a moment said the woman still flatvoiced before alice could respond the line went dead a minute alice decided able to see the station clock thats all shed give them she didnt know how long it took to put a trace on a call but as computer canny as alice was she guessed it wouldnt be long only minutes with sophisticated electronics and the fbi would surely have the latest sophisticated electronics thirty seconds had to have passed alice waited for the large hand to drop easing down to pick up the satchel maam came a mans voice am i talking to the agentincharge can i ask who you are i want the agentincharge someone in authority two minutes had to have gone by now my names gene do you want to tell me yours well use martha be ready for that name when i call back demanded alice and put the receiver down alice boarded the first crosstown bus she came to easing herself close to the door not bothering to look for a seat west street seemed surprisingly empty which was good she eased the satchel between herself and the side of the bus making it impossible to pick checking her watch as she did so ten thirty if she was going to keep to her eleven thirty downtown return to princes street to be in more than good time for johns call she reckoned she had time for two more calls three at the most to federal plaza she got off at the new york public library stopped at the first street phone she came upon with no hesitation this time hello martha greeted the voice of gene what is it youve got to tell us you aware of the funeral of george w northcote alice stood with her satchel protectively entwined between her feet her wrist tilted to time herself glad that unlike the station clock her sportsmans watch had a calibrated sweeping second hand hard not to be unknown by anyone else in the firm he laundered huge amounts of money billions for organized crime over decades he was murdered up in litchfield it was disguised as an accident when he wanted out you got a family name two minutes calculated alice northcote had a personal assistant janice snow she was killed again disguised as an accident out at park slope in brooklyn they thought she had what they want two minutes thirty seconds what do they want martha the proof that northcote kept back believing it was his leverage to bargain a way out lets take this nice and slow said the man were taking it too slow said alice wait for my next call get on to litchfield the sheriffs named al hibbert and on to brooklyn martha but already alice had replaced the telephone and started to walk with her satchel restrapped across her chest second avenue wasnt as congested as crosstown and alice rode the bus past th street automatically looking towards the east river and the beelike rise and descent of helicopters that since northcotes killing had been so much of john carvers life where would john be now doing what now in his naive and misconceived belief that he could win where and what george had lost was that it she asked herself incredulous at the thought surely john whom shed long ago uncritically judged to be in awe of his fatherinlaw didnt imagine what he was attempting today was a whocouldsurvive contest between a dead man who horrifically hadnt and himself believing that he could surely not she thought again the rhetoric that of anxiously needed reassurance rather than a positive answer which she couldnt anyway have provided and for what to prove what apart from his own stupidity if they were ever together again properly miraculously together after he and jane had been taken out of danger would there be any way she could explain to him that he didnt have hadnt needed to prove himself would there be any benefit any reconciliation in trying of course not by then it would be too late she got off at th street checking her watch once more as she did so ten fifty in good time ahead of schedule now the handset had been ripped from the wall of the first pod she came to approaching union square park there was one that worked at the sixth avenue junction gene answered the call on the first ring he said i think youre jerking us around martha if you believed that you wouldnt have taken this call yourself im not one of your crazies and you know it i want you to come in i want to come in but not yet i cant not yet why not i want to give it all to you the proof their negotiator everything youve got that ill have a meeting place the meeting place where its being handed over to their negotiator who doesnt know everythings been duplicated shed keep the name of stanley burcher back john was most probably right about it being phoney if the bureau checked and couldnt find the name it would be a further reason to dismiss her as a crank handed over by whom someone whos totally innocent who thinks he can handle it all by himself he cant thats why im talking to you three minutes alice saw too long whats your involvement martha complicated youll have to wait for that too how long today thats why im doing this youve got to be ready you know the penalty for wasting bureau time you spoken to litchfield and brooklyn thats not an answer be ready when i call there might not be a lot of time the names not martha by the way it was in fact her mothers name i never thought it was mines gene though gene hanlan wait well wait just make sure its worth our while the tension although not the fear went from alice as she rode downtown her money satchel secure on her lap beneath her cupped hands glad that she hadnt needed to use the subway after all she was by no assessment claustrophobic but she always had the vaguely uneasy impression of being too enclosed when she travelled underground she was pleased too to be ahead of schedule she hoped everything else worked out so well alice was back in soho by eleven twenty and uncomfortably remembering the perils of not eating bought a tuna on rye and a pickle at a deli near the guggenheim and still managed to get into her apartment again through the delivery entrance precisely on schedule she made coffee to drink with the sandwich realizing as she did so that shed have to give the alerting call to federal plaza from her own telephone risking identification but that wouldnt matter she further realized by then with the bureau in place and able to make their seizures shed want to be taken in it was only the thought of telephoning that prompted alice belatedly to look at her answering machine upon which one call was registered panicked imagining that burcher had made the arrangements early alice jabbed at the reply button there was audible breathing vague discordant music but no words before the blank of disconnection alice felt sick again john carver was more confident than he had expected to be and was grateful relieved the feeling was largely predicated upon the early morning meeting with paul newton after the manhattan physicians examination of jane newtons prognosis was that janes symptoms were entirely predictable in someone who had been as close to her father as jane and did not indicate any more deeply rooted mental problem needing psychiatric help hed prescribed something called chlorpromazine which he described as much stronger than the tranquillizers given to her by dr jamieson and in carvers presence briefed the nurses whose attendance jane was no longer resisting upon the possible side effects including disorientation and verbal communication difficulties the idea newton had told carver is to block the recent most painful memories you sure she doesnt need a psychiatrist demanded carver its your choice of course said the doctor i intend to monitor her every day if on any one of those days i or any of the nurses see any change then naturally well react to it at the moment all jane is suffering from is extreme but postponed grief shes run herself dry mentally as well as physically trying to do all that she has since her fathers death how long asked carver ill judge it on a daytoday basis said the doctor maybe as little as a week anything else i need to do to know avoid litchfield going there or talking about it certainly any discussion about the sale of the estate thats where the awfulness happened its that awfulness shes got to adjust to in her mind and therefore this early she doesnt need any reminders carvers mood was also buoyed by listening to the tape which hed played and replayed in his locked office as soon as hed arrived in wall street the tape was the last thing he duplicated after copying everything hed retrieved from litchfield west th street and from alice there was no way burcher or those the lawyer represented could do anything but agree the separation and keep that agreement to the letter carver telephoned the securities manager that he was on his way and easily walked the two blocks to citibank still arriving by nine fortyfive determined to avoid any oversight carver used the entire table in the private safedeposit room laying everything out in two individual piles the third collection was of all the personal and legal documents and photographs concerning northcote and anna simpson and carver was slowed by it wondering if northcote had been as happy with anna as he was with alice wondering too if northcote had rationalized his relationship with her and his wife as he d rationalized his with jane and alice intriguing but unanswerable speculation he acknowledged yet again and therefore pointless just as it was pointless keeping it all he wouldnt carver decided hed get today over removing each and every threat ensure that jane fully recovered even if she needed a psychiatrist which despite dr newtons assurances carver still suspected she might and then destroy this personal hoard in front of him as northcote should have destroyed it when it was no longer relevant he replaced the uncopied material and photographs in the security box first before moving the briefcase alongside it he loaded them one by one original in the briefcase copy back into the box again the last item in each was the tape carver went perfunctorily through the duplicate key relocking and signing out procedure thinking now about alice he wouldnt call her until everything was over shed compounded their problems by her computer trawling and ignored him when hed told her to stop and he was suspicious of her demands the previous night to know precisely when and where he was meeting burcher more than suspicious so if she didnt know she couldnt interfere maybe to put everything at risk he strode purposefully out on to wall street with more than sufficient time before noon to walk the two blocks to his office his mind switching back to jane your choice newton had said so hed make it hed call the doctor and tell him he wanted a second psychiatric opinion the best available he wanted jane well properly completely well as soon as possible good to know that everythings going as it should sensibly said a voice carver recognized at once on his left he was conscious of a close presence at his right too and behind heres the car said burcher and before there was a moment for carver to resist cry out even the inexorable pressure of the three surrounding men turned him towards and then into the open door of the vehicle that pulled up there patronized burcher nows the time to talk properly sixteen heads up demanded gene hanlan what have we got a crazy dismissed ginette smallwood disillusioned from wasting the past four months investigating tipoffs from federal plaza walkins whod turned out to be exactly that initially convincing crazies whod evolved goodsounding stories to get their fifteen minutes of fame and to get her the reputation of someone who couldnt differentiate fact from phoney if shed had pinocchio on her shoulder doesnt sit right dismissed hanlan he twisted to the permanently displayed street map of manhattan on the board behind his desk upon which red marker flags were already displayed we start at the port authority terminal maybe shes an outoftowner or maybe shes an intown uptown girl who chose the terminal for good reason interrupted patrick mckinnon the rotund retirementplanning third field agent maybe an intown girl indeed accepted hanlan still at the wall map he tracked his finger along the electronically traced route that alice belling had taken sure as hell knew the citys transport system according to the timings he turned away from the wall chart gesturing to the separately marked tapes the only incomplete one was alices first before theyd been ready we need to get the official opinion from the mumbojumbo thumbsuckers at quantico but i dont hear any of that as a crazy stressed sure if i didnt think that i would mark her as a crazy and we wouldnt be sitting around here now talking about it lets hold for a moment on quantico suggested ginette among its several disciplines quantico was the fbis maryland installation for offender profiling where most of the psychological ancillaries were concentrated including voiceprint analysts were holding on everything for the moment assured hanlan but ive got a gut feeling the litchfield shitkicking sheriff admits george northcotes death is odd despite what the coroner says the house gets invaded like baghdad on open day and anyone here remember a hanging suicide breaking so many arms and legs from a twofoot fall neither of the other two answered the question the querulous woman said if mysterious martha knows so much how come she doesnt have a family name because she doesnt have a family name threw back mckinnon irritably you heard what she said i read it that she knows some but not all which i also read as meaning we need to get involved here he paused for the effect organized crime murder money laundering you really need me to spell out the career advantages of having our names at the top of the list of this sort of investigation his pension increased by a month if he got promoted one more grade not for a moment grinned hanlan whose mind had begun to calculate that as early as alices second telephone contact whats the essential for the perfect con challenged ginette for fucks sake exploded mckinnon whod spent an unconsummated month hitting on the girl and his exwifes entire months alimony on dinners and broadway theatres before shed told him she was gay youve struck out three times in a row shit happens this could be how you get off the bench and up to bat so what do we do accepted ginette reluctantly she needed an impressive recovery put everything else on hold for today at lease ordered hanlan go through the case notes of litchfield and brooklyn if theyre wired soon enough which was the promise from both whens the last time a local force certainly a local force whove already made up their minds and closed the case cooperated with the bureau demanded ginette who was thirty modelthin blonde and not gay just resentful of the automatic chauvinistic expectation of office affairs northcote was high profile picked up hanlan ignoring the interruption lets see whats in the public domain that route said mckinnon nodding to the map behind the agentincharge goes in a square circle you want to help me with that invited hanlan starts on the west side crosses east goes downtown back west always using phone boxes and obviously public transport shes definitely a local seen too many james bond movies but thats where she lives somewhere downtown she was hurrying home should be easy to find someone calling herself martha who admits its not her real name said ginette downtowns financial said mckinnon northcotes office is on wall street martha could be a northcote employee stumbles upon where the secrets are hidden and the dead bodies agreed ginette less resistant janice snow was an employee maybe she shared what she knew with martha martha doesnt come back to us today as promised we call on george w northcote international tomorrow decided hanlan and ask what questioned mckinnon to look at their client base suggested hanlan northcotes top of the bigtime pyramid warned ginette they got something to hide theyre not going to take kindly to us asking rude questions unless weve got due cause which so far we aint hanlan reached over his desk for the third recording fastforwarding to where he wanted the excerpt began with his own voice handed over by whom then alices someone whos totally innocent who thinks he can handle it all by himself hanlan said its someone in the firm maybe two martha our whistleblower and mr hard guy thinks he can face down the bad guys all by himself whys he doing that the best guess in my book is to keep the firm squeaky clean so hes high a major player maybe even a partner has to be to have discovered whatever he has we go in and we say were not sure about mr northcotes death or that of his personal assistant ms snow ask the partners one by one how they feel about it if theyve got anything theyd like to tell us and watch the body language its a way to start allowed ginette doubtfully its our best shot we dont hear back from martha insisted mckinnon hanlan looked at his watch twelve whatever marthas expecting to happen has got to be lunch time we hope agreed mckinnon shall i get the sandwiches offered ginette no said hanlan like the lady asked we stay ready to go the moment we get her call enrico delioci on his left took the briefcase from carver without speaking and handed it to stanley burcher in the front passenger seat burcher immediately opened it and started fingering through the contents paolo brescia on carvers right rode with his hand casually holding the courtesy loop gazing out at the passing streets he said to the driver the manhattan would probably be better than the brooklyn bridge why pay a toll demanded the driver where are we going said carver glad his voice was steady he wasnt sure if he was physically shaking from the fear pumping through him but hoped he wasnt the men between whom he was too closely hemmed would feel it if he were they did wear dark suits but not shaded glasses like burcher they were inconspicuous walkby people no one replied i asked where we were going carver repeated somewhere quiet said burcher head bowed over the briefcase enjoy the ride said brescia he had an effeminate lisp burcher turned at last grimacing his version of a smile i need to go through it in detail talk about one thing in particular with you but it seems ok i knew we could work together he held up the tape cassette whats this something for us to talk about hed made a mistake carver realized a terrible terrible mistake alice had been right he couldnt face them down but he had to now the terrible mistake was also his only hope the curtain closed on burchers smile so lets talk about it youre among friends we dont have any secrets said brescia carver felt too threatened squashed as he was by even harmlessseeming men in the back of the car that impression brought the awareness that he was in fact physically bigger than any of the other four with whom he was incarcerated which didnt mean anything because he knew what they were capable of what they had done to northcote and janice he was going to feel threatened be threatened wherever he was with them but he didnt want them this close their bodies touching his when he disclosed their entrapment this ends your association with my firm right thats something we need to talk about agreed burcher my people are extremely happy the way things are how theyve been and worked for such a very long time he patted the stillopen briefcase on the car floor at his feet even before you showed how well you understood priorities they asked me to tell you they didnt want things to end that they saw every advantage for all of us in the arrangement continuing exactly as its always been to everyones advantage except burcher thought the delioci family i made it clear to you that thats precisely what i did not want and wouldnt have enrico delioci sniggered a laugh that emerged as a derisive snort they were crossing the brooklyn bridge now the pale sun dappling them with the shadowed patterns of the suspending superstructure burcher said john this is the way it is the way its got to be look what george achieved think about it think what you can achieve all the respect and honour that george attained more youre set up for a happy contented life forever people dont get things made the way youve got it made enjoy they joined the expressway made the left exit and almost at once took the turnoff towards the ferry terminal and turned once more into the lattice of narrow streets on the brooklyn and queens side of the east river once theyve got you they never let you go thought carver there wasnt a definition words that he could find to describe how carver felt frightened certainly acknowledging finally that he was out of his depth with these insignificant but supremely confident people who believed they owned the world which carver supposed they did their world at their allembracing level but strangely despite the definition and the words he couldnt find carver felt suspended above all those mixed impressions beyond these people and beyond their danger making the tape hadnt been a terrible mistake it was going to be his salvation because they couldnt hurt him cause him any physical harm while it existed it was the connection the provable link northcote hadnt had with the documentation at that moment lying beyond their grasp in the citibank safedeposit vault we made a deal i promised to discuss it with my clients which i did now im telling you their decision lied burcher which isnt my decision they were in a carabandoned boardedwindowed labyrinth of rubbishstrewn alleys and streets empty of life apart from an occasional scavenging dog or cat brescia sighed and said why dont we cut the crap youre signed up john whether you like it or not as stans told you learn to like it did that mean that burcher really had given his real name it made it so much better if he had and as ive told stan i dont like it were here announced burcher well talk about it inside the car made an abrupt left then a right and the street into which they emerged was suddenly clean no longer an urban garbage dump to their left was a high chainlink fence sealing off a storage yard for dozens maybe hundreds of ship containers a lot the majority as far as carver could see were marked with the names of the mulder encomp or innsflow companies beyond them over the river carver could see the snagtoothed skyline of manhattan the car threw up a dust plume as it accelerated across the open strip towards warehouses to which as they got closer carver saw was attached a low office block the sign on the side read noxt inc export specialists cars were in tight formation in front but carver couldnt see any people working outside he did through office windows when he got out of the car there was no obvious interest in their arrival carver was relieved to be free from the body contact of the men on either side of him burcher led they went in through a door at the side and immediately up a flight of stairs into rooms fitted out as secretarial suites without secretaries or office staff burcher continued to lead into a more expansive set of rooms with leather furniture and decorative plants the largest room was dominated by an impressive desk but everything looked sterile and unused a stage set sit down ordered burcher contemptuously not looking at carver who did as he was told burcher and delioci went to the desk and unloaded on to it everything from the briefcase from the top righthand door of the desk burcher took two sheets of paper handing them to the other man and together they compared every document against their list carver couldnt hear the mumbled conversation it must have been fifteen minutes before they both straightened turning at last to carver delioci took the seat behind the desk and carver wondered if his authority was greater than that of the lawyer it was burcher though who did the talking he said you did good john were pleased now the few things weve got to sort out get right he made a hand gesture to the papers still lying on the desk before him theyre complete but theres something missing isnt there thats everything i found at litchfield and at georges apartment in town and in his safe deposit at the chase thats not what im talking about said the softly spoken lawyer i told you my clients discovered there were a lot of attempts to hack into their computers some attempts that might have been successful he had to protect alice whatever happened whatever threats were made he couldnt disclose her name or her involvement and i told you i knew nothing about that i know what you told me my clients find that difficult to believe carver shook his head i dont have anything to say to that beyond what ive already told you that i dont know anything about it burcher said if were going to work together theres got to be trust between us if we find youve lied were going to be very upset and we will find out who did it its very important for us that we do carver no longer had the unreal impression of being suspended in midair because of all his conflicting feelings but the fear was stronger now although not for himself he hadnt expected the hacking demand hadnt prepared answers which he accepted he should have done there was only one answer if alice were to be protected total denial which hed already made to repeat it could give the impression that he had some knowledge ive also made it clear that were not going to work together there was another sigh from brescia who was sitting slightly behind carver between him and the door burcher said john you dont have a choice that was made years ago by george northcote youve inherited his firm and youve inherited his responsibilities which youll fulfil this is the end of the discussion theres nothing more to talk about except who got into the computer systems the personal fear at last surged through carver at what he was about to do and say the familiar skintingling stomachhollowing sensation you havent heard the tape the two men at the desk stared initially unspeaking at carver without breaking his gaze delioci told brescia go get a player burcher said you stupid man you idiotically stupid little man he still didnt raise his voice just sounding each sound like a bells funeral toll brescia reentered within minutes with a small cassette player and unasked fitted in the tape and pressed the start button burchers voice echoed into the silent room its good of you to see me at such short notice and then carvers particularly as you werent able to leave a name the recording apparatus throughout the northcote building had been professionally fitted and the quality was perfect still no one spoke or moved the lawyer and delioci looking fixedly at carver as the tape unwound with the identification of the companies and the quietly spoken and intentionally ambiguous innuendoes from burcher it was at carvers denial of any knowledge of the computer hacking that delioci stopped the tape with an impatient finger flick the roared shout youre the total fucking idiot at the lawyer and the fist crashing against the desktop was so unexpected that everyone physically jumped delioci rose leaning towards burcher raging on like a fucking amateur you let yourself get wired like this burcher was ashen and there was a tremor in his hands the middle finger on his left tapping against his thigh as if he were sending a signal how could it have gone this wrong how could everything his coup his dismissal of the deliocis go so wrong deliocis head came around to carver so youve got a copy of the tape which means youve got a copy of everything youve given back today and youre going to tell me that if we dont let go youre going to turn it all over to the feds right i want the separation of my firm rasped carver hoarsely let me tell you what youre going to do said the man controlled again youre going to drive back into manhattan to the bank he nodded towards the fingertapping lawyer youre going to take him with you right into the safedeposit room and completely clear your box i want everything he turned towards burcher you hear that i said everything yes said burcher almost a whisper the man came back to carver and when you get back here im going to tell you how youre going to work for us for the rest of your goddamn fucking life but heres the thing im going to tell you right now give you all the time you need to understand you ever try think of trying another halfassed move like this and youll get a choice the choice will be who gets killed your wife or your girlfriend yours to pick he switched to burcher and when you get back ill have spoken to a lot of people wholl sure as hell want to speak to you with only two of them in the rear of the car there was room for carver to sit apart from brescia and carver did as far as he could burcher hunched forward next to the driver rocking very slightly back and forth brescia said you fucked up big time stan good job were around to look after you it was payback time burcher accepted they were going to make him pay for every insult real or imagined its going to be all right youd better believe it said the other man burcher stopped rocking swivelling almost completely around in his seat to face carver is everything in the box carver nodded not speaking his mind too jumbled to even think of words except those that echoed again and again in his head youre going to work for us for the rest of your goddamn fucking life and then the choice will be who gets killed your wife or your girlfriend you pick the car swept up on to the expressway and began going over the bridge back into manhattan everything that was hacked persisted burcher everything i copied managed carver but the printouts were in the box hed have to say he did it to save alice but theyd ask him how and he didnt know didnt know what alice had meant about using english cutouts what a cutout was even and theyd find out it was alice and theyd kill her because she had knowledge that could destroy them and because theyd imagine it to be a fitting punishment for him i suffer you suffer asshole confirmed burcher it all gets settled today all of it he had to fight determined carver and then at once the questions how with what the bank that was the chance his only chance last chance get burcher into the vault with the security man for the twokey opening procedure jump the lawyer there hold him and yell for the security man to help subdue burcher and call the police the bureau whoever get these other two in the car arrested then the shouting man back in the warehouse get protection alice had been right the only way they turned into wall street carver could see the bank he felt sick hed never fought anyone before not punched a man wanting to hurt him he wanted to hurt burcher hurt him as much and as badly as he could and he could do it he knew he could do it he was physically bigger stronger than burcher it would help that hed seen the security people less than three hours ago they knew who he was would react when he called for help you ready asshole demanded burcher carver nodded he was definitely ready the driver said we get moved on ill go round the block carver saw the blue and white of the police car as he began to get out of theirs it was coming in the opposite direction slowed by other traffic the decision was instant unthinking panicspurred he thrust the waiting burcher as hard as he could out of his way sending the man sprawling on to the pavement and ran around the front of the car waving his arms and shouting seeing the police driver and the observer turn in his direction their lips moving both frowning then carver heard the bellow of the air horn behind him and twisted to see the truck for the briefest second before it hit him knocking him beneath its tandemmounted front wheels which ran completely over his chest crushing it far worse than george northcotes had been crushed the frantically waiting alice belling saw the coverage on live at five the story angled on the astonishing coincidence of the fatalities she ran literally grabbing a case already packed she didnt know how theyd done it to look like yet another accident all she could think of was that they knew her name and that she would be next on the list seventeen the uniformed sergeant frowned up at hanlans entry gesturing to a chair already set out and said the bureau doing traffic accidents these days all kinds of things said hanlan coffee the nameplate on the desk said sergeant p david hopper he was a small man bulged from sitting too long behind a desk and living even longer off relishfilled torpedo sandwiches coffees good accepted hanlan it was like the hundred other police offices in the hundred other police precincts hed ever been in a scuffed chipped overused cell without bars in which people like p david hopper filled the drawers and cabinets with the stuff they brought from the previous scuffed chipped overused cell before moving on to the next hopper didnt have sufficient citations or plaques or souvenirs to cover all the clean patches left by previous occupants leaving the wall pockmarked white the coffee from a percolator on top of a filing cabinet came in an i love ny mug so whats all kinds mean the apparent friendliness and immediate readiness to see him rare from police to bureau and vice versa would be from curiosity hanlan knew thered been a lot of attention as he passed through the front hall and he guessed his presence would already be known about on the top floor john carver hopper shrugged what can i tell you total mystery why it happened how it happened thats what i want to talk about the mystery the frown came back i meant why a guy like carver suddenly runs in front of a thirtyfiveton truck doesnt it seem an odd coincidence that his fatherinlaw died in such a similar accident so very recently hopper shook his head i dont know anything more about litchfield than ive read in the paper and seen on the news but i know about carver because ive got the reports right here in front of me he patted some papers on the right of his desk which youre welcome to see and have a copy ive got eight reliable witnesses two trained squadcar cops from this very precinct whom i know and whose judgement i trust completely all telling roughly the same story for no reason carver suddenly runs off the sidewalk in front of a car yelling and shouting in the direction of the police car the truck driver doesnt stand a chance cant be anything but an accident roughly the same story pressed hanlan couple of the witnesses thought they saw carver push by some guy knock him over the squadcar guys there was another head shake they only saw him when he started coming towards them the two who saw the guy go over heard the first shout hanlan hoped that ginette up in litchfield and mckinnon out in brooklyn were doing better than he was what was the shout the words hopper got up to refill his mug hanlan held up his hand against the gestured offer hopper said no words just the noise what about the guy who might have got pushed over is he one of your witnesses no conceded hopper on balance i dont think there was such a guy you know how it is situation like this guy gets squashed into the ground everyone screaming and shouting peoples memories play tricks what about the car car you said carver ran in front of a car before he went under the truck how come he didnt get hit by the car there was the familiar head shake havent thought about it had time to get by i guess but not the truck i dont see the sequence protested hanlan the truck has to be following the car right so if he gets clear in front of the car how come hes hit by the following truck unless that is the cars stopped and the trucks overtaking any of your witnesses make that clear gene im trying to do all i can to help here i truly am so how about a little in return you want to tell me why the bureaus here making traffic reports hanlan recognized the beginning of the usual resentment we got a tip sounded good bigtime money laundering the northcote firm was referred to we didnt get the promised call back with more information but the new head gets killed not a month after northcote himself what workable evidence you got broke in hopper thats what im trying to find admitted hanlan the uniformed man spread his hands best of luck getting into a firm like northcotes but you aint going to do it with what happened on wall street like i told you i dont know what made john carver jump in front of a truck the size of manhattan itself i guess we never will what i do know is that carvers actual death was a one hundred per cent kosher accident that shrug came again you want me to tell you amazing coincidence stories or do you watch them on television ive got an instinct about the tip run with it then i need more times like this im glad i do what i do and not what you guys do you want i introduce you to our detective division along the corridor the crimes if there are crimes are federal just a thought anything comes up you give me a call nothings going to come up gene i got an armwaving jaywalker didnt look where he was going towards a police car trying to attract their attention best of luck youve got my number hanlan offered his card across the battered desk and heres mine like to think i could help you by calling it said the other man martha hadnt made contact when hanlan reached federal plaza but george mckinnon was back from brooklyn and ginette smallwood had called in to say that she was on her way from litchfield hanlan and mckinnon were just finishing their review of the crime report on janice snows hanging when ginette came into the office and at hanlans insistence they went completely through it again in the hope that ginette would isolate something theyd missed she didnt every time the telephone rang they paused and looked up hopefully and every time got a mouthed no in return from whoever in the support staff answered it took them longer to go through the dossier on george northcotes death because the autopsy report was more detailed and there was the additional housetrashing burglary which they studied just as intently there still hadnt been any contact from martha by the time hanlan reluctantly and finally pushed all the files aside looking from one to the other of the two field agents for a reaction mckinnon said enough for a saturdaynight movie mystery with some mighty jumps of logic to link it all together but not enough objectively for us to initiate an official investigation ginette said i agree i dont know but id sure as hell like to sweat mystery martha to find out how and why she comes on to us two hours before john carver throws himself in front of a truck she waved to the file hanlan had brought back with him but we cant buck the evidence of eight reliable witnesses two of them police officers that thats what happened weve got more than enough for suspicion but not enough to move on it officially i still think we visit the northcote office see how they react to us suggested hanlan however and whichever way they react to us would be or could be explained as the shock of losing their founder and his successor as they have insisted ginette whod gone through all the psychological training courses at quantico we wouldnt be able to make any sort of assessment from whatever anyone said or did what sort of harassment or griefintrusion action can you imagine theyd bring if one of us said something just a tad wrong or out of line demanded mckinnon his retirement benefits in mind hanlan tapped the carver file and said to ginette we got the addresses there of the two who say they saw carver push a guy over go see them talk to them again hear it the way they want to tell it ok sighed the woman it was better than chasing all over manhattan trying to catch martha on the telephone she supposed ive got a feeling insisted hanlan then take it to washington dc said mckinnon set it all out let legal counsel decide if we can risk looking at george w northcote international they say no its no but its not our asses on the line if they say yes where the hell is martha said hanlan alice belling was in fact hunched foetuslike in a cushioned chair that smelled of too many previous users in a plywoodfurnished room of a tourist hotel on eighth avenue where security guards confirmed key tags at a turnstile between the reception area and the accommodation and upon every floor of which there were cctv monitors shed balled herself up in the chair with her arms clutched tightly around her unsleeping throughout the previous night for most of it crying so hard and so uncontrollably that her stomach and ribs ached by early morning until then she had refused to think her mind locked on a single awareness john was dead arrogant stubborn stupid wonderful loving john was dead gone forever she didnt have him any more would never have him any more gone no goodbye she couldnt remember if theyd kissed when hed left her apartment for the last time never kiss him again touch him again feel his body again john was dead she had finally to get out of the chair to use the bathroom when she moved her body ached more and she felt sick from not eating something else she couldnt remember when shed last ate her mirrored reflection was almost grotesque her hair was straggled and lank around a face gaunt with grief tearred eyes sunk darkringed into sallow greasy skin it was almost difficult for her to recognize herself it was that thought which brought alice back to something approaching reality looking around the cheap room for the first time trying to remember how shed got there why shed chosen the place she hadnt chosen it those first minutes hours had been driven by panic there was the memory of the live at five coverage with the stills photographs of the partially sheetedoff truck and then a studio portrait of john and the commentary about the tragedy of coincidence and of the unique place in the city held by the firm of george w northcote she had the recollection of fleeing the building but not in blind panic because shed grabbed the packed case still unopened on the bed beside the money satchel how shed got here was a blur it had to have been by cab but she had no memory of it of getting into this room or of trying to curl herself into the smallest ball and closing her eyes and hoping hoping what that shed go to sleep and never wake up again to confront exist with what lay ahead alice sat again in the unsteady chair but properly now with her back against its back so that her face wasnt against its tainted cushions what did lie ahead an impossible far too complicated question but she had to confront it not totally that was definitely impossible isolate the priorities then staying alive she thought at once coherently at last whatever the empty unknown future she was going to live it exist in it endure it not curl up and die who would be pursuing her john had warned her they actually knew her name it was a miracle they hadnt already got to her snatched her whatever it was they did her salvation had to be that their total concentration until less than twelve hours ago had been john not her shed had one miracle she wouldnt get another as shed tried to get across to john who hadnt listened and who was now dead her breath caught and tears welled up and she strained against crying again thered only be one chance so it had to be right more than right she couldnt work it out here in this flea pit where things were literally moving noisily now around her the cabin was the place the cabin which she believed now to have been somewhere in her mind when shed fled princes street the cabin was where she could safely hide until shed completely worked out how to go on living alice knew she should eat something to quell the nauseous hunger pangs but couldnt face the hotels babbling selfservice cafeteria instead she checked out walked past the already assembling city tour buses and found a reasonably clean deli just past a newsstand where she bought the new york times her coffee cooled and the danish stayed virtually uneaten as she read the story and studied the photographs the portrait of john was the same as that used on television the previous evening and she had to swallow heavily using the cover of sipping her nearcold coffee to keep down the emotion there was something about the stills pictures of the scene that alice believed should have some significance but she couldnt decide what and kept the paper with her to study again later alice was sure there was no possibility of her pursuers discovering her longterm parking facility for her precious volkswagen because she had been of no interest to them when shed last used it more than a month earlier she still approached cautiously before recalling her embarrassment at trying to isolate surveillance on the space for space cybercafe but still she didnt hurry lingering on the longstay floor before directly approaching her car she tensed at the slowness with which the engine turned but after two attempts it fired she made the usual stopstart crosstown journey but the flow was easier on west side highway and she crossed the bridge before midday she made paterson her marker and reached it just before two before buying supplies she forced herself to eat scrambled eggs with milk at a drugstore diner there was a newscast on television but this far from the city it was local it was four before she finally reached the cabin and the nostalgia engulfed her the moment she crossed the threshold she let the packages stay where she dropped them slumped in the allencompassing chair in which she and john had wedged themselves together just holding each other the last time they had been there and wept at the memories until she ached again this chair smelled too smelled of him and his cologne and of them together she said aloud i dont know what to do darling im so frightened so very frightened gene hanlan caught an evening shuttle to washington dc the appointment with the regional director and legal counsel arranged for nine the following morning they were back in the rear room of the thomson avenue restaurant in queens but the atmosphere was very different and the phrase payback time echoed in burchers mind like a litany emilio delioci strangely strongvoiced with no hint of asthma conducted the meeting like a trial which burcher supposed it was demanding individual explanations and questioning each of them with the expertise of a trial lawyer burcher recognized the trial lawyers technique of patronizing humiliation in every demand directed at him so in an unreachable new york safedeposit box theres a bomb that could blow into oblivion our entire organization throughout the united states of america judged the old man after an hours inquisition thats exactly it agreed the son at once its a complete fuckup which might have been prevented if youd gone back said the father relentlessly just as the needless killing of northcote might have been prevented if youd moved your ass and gone up to litchfield burcher stirred at the accusation reading from it everyone else in the room was definitely treating this humiliation as his payback time but emilio delioci was assessing it properly as a don should assess it and acknowledged that what remained in carvers safedeposit box did have the destructive capability of more atomic weaponry than existed in the worlds arsenals with himself and his family as the first potential casualties even before it all exploded we have quite rightly had the inquest it was an accident that should have been prevented but wasnt thats in the past now we have to go forward we will go forward declared enrico looking at the lawyer but without you northcote was ours the operation was ours well put it right burcher didnt have to force the derisive laugh thats not a decision for you or for this family don emilio has quite rightly identified the potential risk that exists to every family in this country it is they in the form of the new york ruling families who should decide upon who should resolve the problem he staged the pause and who should not which is why before coming here tonight i requested a meeting with those family representatives you will do nothing until you hear from them through me no one was patronizing him any more burcher recognized just as he recognized that having made the challenge he had to survive it eighteen jane carver knew they were talking about her could hear most of what they were saying and recognized from it that the stranger was irritated with paul newton but it didnt seem to matter although she wished they werent doing it as if she wasnt there nonexistent despite being propped up between them against supporting pillows shed never liked being ignored she disliked even more how their faces kept receding blurring like their words and then coming back so that she could properly see and hear them again it was important to hear what they were saying because it was about her mrs carver jane turned towards the stranger whod sat by the bed it was one of her clear moments and she could see he had a heavy drooping moustache and very thick blackrimmed glasses he was bald at the front but his hair was long at the back mrs carver jane yes can you hear me yes what sort of stupid question was that of course she could hear him now she hoped the words wouldnt drift off making it difficult to hear them again my names mortimer peter mortimer im a psychiatrist jane smiled but didnt bother to say anything she couldnt think of anything to say why was there a psychiatrist as well as paul newton he was their doctor in manhattan not somebody with a drooping moustache and long hair what did i say my name was jane frowned mortimer then she smiled cats name the man smiled back thats good i want to talk to you about something will you talk with me what about an accident theres been an accident janes face creased briefly i know from the other side of the bed newton said i told her last night tried to tell her what do you know asked mortimer ignoring the intervention my father no jane another accident what other accident john johns had a very bad accident she shook her head against the pillow no it was my father hes dead johns dead jane a street accident she shook her head again wishing his face would come back so that she could see and hear him properly it was dad dad died it was his tractor where was john she couldnt remember seeing him last night just the nurses fussing holding her hand stroking her hand talking in low voices that she couldnt hear giving her pills to take she hadnt liked it wheres john dead insisted mortimer it was a bad traffic accident a truck youre not listening to me jane insisted back its dad hes dead what time is it quarter of ten said paul newton from the other side of the bed johns at the office said jane thats where hell be get him there if you want him the man with the moustache stood and went to the end of the bed newton followed mortimer said you see shes blocked chlorpromazine was too strong i thought it was what she needed in the short term said newton i cant hear you protested jane what are you talking about your father avoided mortimer to newton he said everything ive read in her file and that youve told me indicates janes a strongwilled selfreliant woman chlorpromazine is entirely the wrong medication on a strongwilled person its like a medical lobotomy i dont think jane needs medication apart perhaps from the mildest of tranquillizers what she needs is counselling after losing her father and her husband demanded newton resenting the professional criticism although it was he whod called the psychiatrist in as worried as the nurses at janes nearcatatonic reaction to the drug my diagnosis was that her grief needed to be suppressed it didnt rejected mortimer it needed to be faced with the help of counselling we should have talked first now we are talking said the doctor still hostile whats your suggestion getting her off chlorpromazine right away which of course we cant said mortimer weve got to wean her off gradually reducing the dosage he spoke now looking at the duty nurse make sure everyone on your twentyfourhour roster knows reduce by a quarter each day that understood completely said the woman ill come in every day to monitor the withdrawal i want to judge the time when shell comprehend which shes obviously got to do by the time of the funeral ill come in every day too said the family physician anything else we need to do apart from reduce the chlorpromazine asked the nurse get her out of bed said mortimer shes not an invalid just mentally closeddown maybe take her for a walk in the park introduce her to the outside world shes got to get back into therere no relatives said newton shes by herself now so are thousands of people in this city said mortimer adjusting isnt going to be easy i dont know no one knows how long it might take but however long thats what its got to take adult strongwilled adjustment not chemical barriers thats the way to dependency and irrational fixations as closedoff as she is and its a judgement at this early stage largely based upon your case notes i dont have jane carver in my book as a dependent person she wasnt decided jane whod only heard snatches of the exchange and therefore didnt properly understand what they were talking about except that it was about her and that she wasnt included and that not including her was very definitely rude shed complain to john when he got home so howd it go greeted patrick mckinnon as hanlan entered the federal plaza office forewarned it hadnt gone well because hanlan hadnt called before leaving washington officially to establish a formal investigation the agentincharge slumped down into his chair his back to the cacophony of broadway seeking explanations and maybe justifications for himself hopefully hanlan said our girl called no said mckinnon shortly hanlan looked at ginette washington is with you shes a crazy got lucky with coincidence no sanction to proceed any further unless she comes in with a whole bunch of incontrovertible evidence no bullshit with newspaper cuttings or conversations with people she cant identify the usual crazy stuff total refusal of any legal warrant application to look into the activities of george w northcote international washington counsel say a firm with northcotes clout would sue us from here to china with tollbooths on the way he paused its political and it sucks always agreed mckinnon ginette said i found the two witnesses theyre good womans a floor supervisor at macys guys a bank teller both say a guy was definitely pushed over she paused smiling thats their word pushed deliberately not accidentally knocked over when carver ran past and guess what what asked hanlan indulging her the tellers positive carver got out of the car that he ran around in front of the truck which was overtaking and that the guy he pushed over was originally in the car too hanlan came forward in his chair you got statements full and free from both said ginette and both say and this is independent of each other not reminding each other that carver was yelling for help the bank teller insists thats exactly what carver was shouting help me help me what about the guy who got pushed over the car theres the confusion when the truck sounds its air horn and carver goes underneath theyre looking at that obviously but both say the guy gets up off the kerb runs back to the car and the car takes off before the traffic gets blocked which of course it did make queried hanlan blue ford no registration shit the guy small nondescript both said they couldnt make any sort of image reconstruction a description even you did good praised hanlan better than he had he conceded better than good prompted mckinnon shes saved the best for last tell me demanded hanlan wishing they hadnt need for the pretence the teller works at citibank on wall street announced ginette outside of which it all happened he was on his way back in from late lunch i went in on a hunch john carver has an account there and had already been there once that day to the safedeposit vault i should have waited admitted hanlan i went to washington too soon you can always go back said mckinnon not without more than this refused hanlan he had kneejerked too soon and now it was a matter of filed record and the only way to recover was to make the case for that second visit total and irrefutable alice hadnt moved very much from the womblike seat the previous night just to the bathroom and on her way back to raid one of her dropped bags for a cracker from a convenient box but eventually she didnt know when shed gone to bed between sheets that felt damp from not being aired and in which shed last slept with carver and cried again although not a lot at that realization and then surprisingly shed slept uninterrupted until it was fully light and outside she could hear the competing chirping and calls of birds she and carver had bought binoculars and longdiscarded books to identify and failed and leafshuffling moving things shed gone out on to the deck in only the short nightdress she couldnt remember taking from her bag but which was all shed often worn with carver for their breakfast coffee and shed taken hers on the bench theyd always sat on looking over the narrow river and she didnt choke up at that memory which she was glad about the river would be cold as it was always cold because it fed from the bearfort mountain tributaries which theyd discovered when theyd tried the first time theyd used the cabin to skinny dip and had never tried again alice felt safe alone and wanted to feel that way forever never wanted to see manhattan any city again hear its sirens and its jostling people and their noise stay here with the birds and the scurrying in the undergrowth and hide forever live in the past forever this past this very special past only she and john had shared intruded upon by no one else could they find her all alone up here the cabin wasnt in her name or johns john rented it paying cash for an entire year from a distracted bookshop owner in west milford there had to be at least six months left on the rental the phone was in the bookshop owners name so were all the other utilities shed be safe forever here lost forever here alice forced herself out of the fantasy refusing its cocoon there was only one way she could ever be safe lost forever and that was by becoming an entirely new person with a new name and a new but sustainable background and a new passport and all the other new official documentation that said who you were to those who felt it their business to know and who better than she to become a new person alice asked herself she had no one no family no ties and she no longer had john no one at the flick of a pen or a computer command alice belling could disappear forever vaporize to be reborn a new readymade unknown person nothing to look back for nothing either to which to look forward but there was something in the middle something between what she was leaving behind fleeing from and the reborn future revenge alice wanted revenge each and every possible retribution upon whoever it was who had done what they had done to john she was more determined totally to achieve that than shed ever been to achieve anything in her so far totally achieving life and shed opened the way knew the way thats why she was hidden up here not to gaze out over a river and a forest soon to become another memory but to ensure she didnt make any mistakes guiding the fbi towards those who had to be punished so what did she have to guide them not as much as shed hoped less in fact than shed once had because john had taken all her computer printouts could she risk trying to duplicate them as shed told herself she could not the companies theyd have built stronger firewalls almost inevitably set traps and snares to identify her more quickly even if she tried to piggyback internationally as she had before and caused the deaths of three innocent people she reminded herself unnecessarily she was going to have to admit that at some stage and all the hacking not her immediate focus her immediate focus was upon convincing an unconvinced fbi agent in his broadway office that she had evidence of a crime which she didnt actually have alice admitted to herself objectively she had knowledge of crime but no way of proving it yes there was those local irs offices in which lay the proof of the stepbystep money laundering didnt know theyd been accessed no one was looking for her there setting traps and snares she could access them again and download everything shed given to john it wouldnt matter that illegally obtained material wasnt admissible in a court she wouldnt be offering court evidence shed be handing it over as her proof for the bureau to confirm independently and legally alice felt a surge of confidence a welcome difference from the hollow nausea it replaced because the irs were unsuspecting she wouldnt need the protection of a cybercafe either she could work from the cabin although shed take her usual precaution of making her trojan horse entry through someone elses system all she needed was a laptop to replace the one shed left in princes street in her panic to get away the thought of calling the bureaus new york office came as she was driving back down into paterson to distance herself from the cabin before buying the computer it was sensible necessary to keep in touch she was going to need them very soon need them to accept her the moment she made the request which made it vitally important to convince them she was genuine it took alice less than fifteen minutes to buy the computer system she wanted a duplicate of the laptop and printer shed abandoned in new york and she stored both in the volkswagen boot before reentering the mall for the already isolated telephones once more she leaned so that her calibrated watch was in front of her counting off the seconds alice recognized the receptionists voice from her first approach she said this is a and just stopped herself in time martha i want to speak but before she could finish the line went dead and then she heard the other recognizable voice ive been waiting for you martha said hanlan how come you havent got back before now john didnt call to tell me where they were meeting that was our arrangement thats what i was going to tell you where the handover was going to be where is it the stuff that was going to be handed over a minute alice saw i dont know what about citibank i dont know martha i think you know its johns bank and that he was in the securities division earlier that day and that you changed your mind about telling us the photograph in the new york times thats what shed failed to recognize citibank in the background no thats not how it was he didnt tell me thats what i was waiting for for him to tell me whyd he go back with the others a minute and a half i dont know anything about any others i asked you this before and im going to ask you it again what is it you do know i dont want to go on screwing around like this its made me look stupid and i dont like being made to look stupid i want you with a proper name and i want all this evidence that john had that clear im going to get some of it but i need to come into the protection programme they know what ive done whos they i dont know names not yet it sounded bad ridiculous alice recognized what have you done things on her way in from the cabin shed thought she had everything worked out but it was all swirling in the wind again theyd been talking just over two minutes she shouldnt hang on much longer you want to deal well deal but youve got to give me a lot before we even start at the moment were going around in circles and for most of it youre not making sense youve got johns murder as proof for christs sake what ive got are five witnesses each of whom say john ran in front of a truck and died in a complete accident alice slammed the phone down chest tight feeling sick again but she was sufficiently in control to see the newsstand stanley burcher tried to analyse the significance of the meeting being with the consiglieri of the five families not their dons but couldnt not instantly perhaps he thought hed get a guide during the discussion they were in the parkview penthouse suite of an hotel on central park south in which the genovese clan had a concealed investment the six of them grouped around a table there was an array of liquor and mixes on a smaller side table but no one was drinking it would have been presumptuous for burcher to have helped himself perhaps he thought it was presumptuous of him to have expected to meet the dons charlie petrie said its a hell of a mess to clean up but its got to be cleaned up insisted vito craxi the bonanno counsel there isnt a family who havent used the system and paid well for the facility its got to be kept intact whos going to run it asked burcher there was still the opportunity of enormous power being the liaison between these five and whichever accountancy firm was suborned into cooperating its being taken care of said petrie you asked for the meeting reminded bobby gallo representing the gambino clan what have you got in mind he spoke as he got up to go to the drinks table he did so without gesturing an invitation to burcher the only way in to citibank security is through the wife said burcher discomfited at stating the obvious shes the only one with the legal right i might be able to use the severance with the firms lawyer and there could be an advantage in the girlfriend sure carver gave every indication of having everything at the bank but he could have split it up some guys do stupid things pussy prowling he hesitated unsure of the delioci strength ive called the apartment in princes street left messages about an assignment she hasnt been there i guess shes run we need to go into princes street but not like litchfield if she is still around i dont want her to know weve been there if she has gone we need to know where shes gone to the luchese familys gino larocca a thin bespectacled man picked up on the reference to litchfield needing the way in the queensbased clan had operated under the control of the luchese organization the deliocis are out of this out of business they fucked up big time all the way ive been asked to apologize there were nods of acceptance at the apology petrie said theyll be sore they try to do anything smart theyll be dead starting with the old man himself and the son next said larocca thats been made clear we dont want to draw attention at this time taking out known smalltimers warned carlo brookier the colombo family consigliere we all know that said larocca irritably im going to need people to do things starting with getting into princes street how can i do that if delioci isnt involved any more through me announced petrie i want us to stay close on this they didnt trust him any more burcher decided they were excluding him from whatever new arrangements were being made and they were going to monitor everything he did channelling everything through petrie put the genovese family in total control of the money laundering nineteen alice squatted crosslegged on the cabin floor her mind back in synch surrounded by the accounts of johns death with the rest of the newspapers discarded unread shed been lucky picking up newsday at the paterson mall its coverage was much fuller than that in the previous days new york times or anything else shed snatched up the photographs were reproduced bigger too so that it was easier to identify the citibank building the amalgamated stories fitted what shed been told by hanlan certainly about it unquestionably being an accident with witnesses talking of a mystery car that drove away with the addition of john appearing to run towards a police patrol car it was pitifully easy for alice to work out the sequence john had met them somehow shed never know whether hed intended to call or been prevented from doing so and handed over what they wanted and then tried to confront them with the threat of producing his copies what threat would they have made in return jeered at him so arrogantly sure of themselves of their power the most likely would have been to hurt jane kill her even maybe accepted alice for her to be hurt as well they knew about her existence although maybe not yet that she was the hacker they were hunting perhaps they hadnt even bothered with threats mocking him laughing at him they wouldnt have been able to torture him it was a relief to realize that because theyd obviously been taking him back to the bank but there must have been some threat she thought changing her mind otherwise how could they have known citibank was his bank and that he had a safedeposit facility there which was obviously where hed thought what hed kept would be untouchable by anyone except himself how frightened he must have been poor optimistically brave john knotted inside believing in miracles when hed seen the police car yards away from safety and protection prepared at last if hed thought about it which he probably hadnt in those few terrified moments finally to sacrifice his precious inherited firm in exchange for his life which he hadnt saved and which was the bitterest irony of all it hadnt even been necessary for the murdering motherfuckers to stage johns killing as an accident as they had the other two for some reason she couldnt identify didnt need to identify it made alice even more determined to exact her revenge which brought her back in more detail attempted total recall to the conversation with hanlan he was playing hardball with every good reason shed realized as theyd talked how bad how unconvincing shed sounded how many times had she said i dont know without intending any pun alice thought i dont know and didnt think it funny it was difficult to recall the last time shed found anything funny ever would again what did she know alice asked herself unknowingly echoing gene hanlans interrogation that morning she knew how to get into irs files with that unopened laptop over there on the desk and how to download a paper trail of moneylaundering tax returns for five mafiacontrolled companies although she had no proofnor way of obtaining proof that they were mafiacontrolled incomplete though it was would that be sufficient for the demanding gene hanlan irrespective of it being obtained illegally she wouldnt know until she retrieved them and tried to negotiate and she had time now hidden away up here in the mountains where noone could find her it was good to feel safe the feeling lasted until she began gathering up the discarded newspapers and on impulse turned to the public notice sections and found carvers official death notice the funeral was scheduled the day after tomorrow shed have to go alice decided whatever the danger she had to go the return call from the telephone company came as they finished listening for the fourth consecutive time to the taped conversation between alice and hanlan mckinnon took it didnt say anything apart from thanks and turned back into the room paterson shes taken to the hills the catskills arent our territory said ginette at once and just as quickly wished she hadnt i know what our my territory is threw back hanlan we could do a reshoot of the sound of music said mckinnon trying to lessen the tension the hills are alive to the sound of martha where are you martha shut the fuck up said hanlan gene soothed mckinnon jerking a nailbitten finger towards the latest tape still in the player you really want to hear it for the fifth time hear nothing for the fifth time i dont know what this gal thinks shes got he shrugged circumstantially maybe a lot evidentially we dont have diddly squat until she arrives outside here with a uhaul packed with evidence or points us the way were wasting our time now hanlan indicated the tape we almost had her real name there at the beginning the other two regarded him solemnly neither speaking as if a mist distanced them from hanlan hanlan said im not becoming paranoid about this good said mckinnon he thought that was exactly what hanlan was becoming and didnt want any foulups even by association between now and his retirement but theres something here ive got a gut feeling you keep telling us that reminded ginette as concerned as mckinnon the smoothly efficient burglary of alice bellings apartment in princes street did not produce as much as john burcher had hoped although the inscription on the back of the two photographs of carver outside the cabin bearsfort july gave them a possible although too wideranging direction in which to look he was disappointed at alice bellings apparent modesty nowhere among any of the other photographs all copied to hide any evidence of the entry was there the sort of proudparent studio portrait from which carvers mistress could be positively identified the best ironically was a thumbnail image that had accompanied her profile of george northcote in her cuttings book every clip of which had also been copied he picked his way painstakingly through the trawl aware as he did so that the total seemingly snatchedup disorder in which petrie had personally handed over the package an hour earlier in the downstairs lounge wasnt snatchedup disorder at all it would have been gone through still be under examination right now by several people each more than once to ensure nothing was missed but the responsibility for anything missed was his there was a substantial amount of business correspondence none of it relevant two letters confirming assignments that were still on her telephone answering machine burchers attempts to make contact having now been erased there were bank statements up to the previous month showing a comfortable balance and all the womans utility bills were receipted as being paid in full before their due date he was surprised at the total absence of any personal correspondence not even a note that could have been construed to be a love message from carver imagining themselves to be discreet he supposed it was crumpled when he found it crushed in such a way between two of the bank statements he was reexamining that burcher didnt think it had been extracted for copying it was a paidincash receipt for access time upon a computer at a cybercafe named space for space despite the wellremembered rehearsal of her first hacking expedition it still took alice most of that day and well into the night to duplicate her irs evidence herding her trojan horses through the computer system of a hertz carhire outlet in des moines iowa by the time the physical tiredness of unremitting concentration forced her to stop just before nine alice was still short of her original trove and unsure if she might need any more not a decision that needed to be made tonight alice thought carrying her drink more gin than tonic to their onceshared chair time enough tomorrow the following day no hurry now that she was safe the refusal came at once she wasnt safe she was hiding curling up like a baby trying to make herself too small to be seen to be found there was more than enough in what shed already downloaded to illustrate how accounts had been padded from subsidiary to subsidiary and from state to state and country to country all shed achieve by obtaining more apart from postponing her committing physical approach to the fbi would be unnecessary repetition what if it wasnt enough evidentially sufficient maybe for an irs investigation but not for one by the fbi it was an incometax prosecution that nailed al capone she reminded herself but that had been in the s not now now she needed a witness protection programme and only the fbi provided that if only shed had alice didnt complete the thought her mind racing beyond it she hadnt been thinking properly completely just selfishly knowing that she was being pursued for her computer intrusion and desperate only to save herself what about jane jane was the one the only one who could get to whatever john had in the safe deposit at citibank and therefore the one at risk as northcote and john and janice snow had been at risk all of whom were now dead twenty im all right insisted jane relieved her voice hadnt wavered because she wasnt not as all right as she would have liked to be but she didnt want anyone around her to realize it there were still too many moments when her mind blanked midsentence and others when she suffered the audible and visual receding sensation that was the most disconcerting of all but she was sufficiently in control of herself and her surroundings to comprehend what she had been told the previous day and to prepare herself for what was going to happen today john was dead today there was to be his funeral in the same cathedral in which the ceremony for her father had been conducted and after that the wake at the same hotel in which her fathers had been held and johns burial later when shed decided upon where the interment was to be but most important of all she believed herself sufficiently free of the drug now down to its one dose a day minimum to understand although perhaps not properly fully to comprehend that she didnt have john any more didnt have anyone any more that she was all alone shed never imagined being entirely by herself not having anyone to turn to rely upon shed sat on charity committees chaired some of them and raised money to help people bereaved by tragedy or catastrophe and believed shed had some conception of their loss but now despite the responsedulling effects of the medication jane accepted that she had no conception whatsoever at this precise moment probably for some time to come it was too overwhelming for her to conceive to rationalize in any way which was the easiest explanation for why she hadnt collapsed and wept the previous day or wept today although she had awakened early before it was fully light with total recall of the conversation with paul newton and peter mortimer and lain there for more than an hour trying to envisage a future and failed remaining there mummified thoughts images feelings tears refusing to come it went blank again at that moment so that she was not immediately aware of geoffrey davis talking to her i said we could do away with the formal receiving line repeated the firms lawyer i dont want that said jane freshly insisting everything will be done properly as it should be done john would have wanted that for everything to be done properly it was important to remember what john would have wanted expected he would have come round soon enough to wanting a baby as much as she did had wanted she corrected herself robbed of john and robbed of having his baby or was she robbed had he provided the specimen rosemary pritchard had asked for she couldnt remember there was still too much she couldnt remember but if he had there was surely a possibility of it being used to impregnate her once the gynaecologist had corrected her problem something she had to call rosemary about as soon as possible today even when she got back from the wake well be there with you reassured newton i dont want everyone around me exclaimed jane irritably sweeping her hand to encompass the overcrowded east nd street drawing room i want you all to understand that i can manage by myself jane you cant stand there entirely alone protested davis she couldnt jane at once conceded it wouldnt be the proper thing to do you she decided looking at the lawyer you should represent the firm with the most senior partner fred jolly identified the lawyer indicating a balding stooped man beside him whom jane did not recognize although she knew that she should sorry of course with you fred she continued looking around the room if my having some personal support is so important hilda can stay close to me tell me whom im meeting as often as possible that all right hilda of course said carvers matronly personal assistant who had organized this second funeral and who hoped at the actual service shed manage the control jane was showing the reflection reminded her of the sobbing janice snow and she had to swallow heavily tensed against breaking down jane accepted that she might have difficulty retaining some of her thoughts but hoped the receding blurred images or words were diminishing but i dont think i need any support certainly not any further nursing now that youve almost stopped those damned drugs i do i really do challenged newton too quickly what do you think jane asked the psychiatrist well enough aware of the bedside disagreement between the two men youre nearly off the chlorpromazine now agreed mortimer you sure there arent any lingering effects youre watching me listening to me whats your professional opinion demanded jane as the faces of those looking at her blurred she was only distantly aware but aware which was all that mattered of the psychiatrist mortimer said this isnt a consulting session janes vision cleared ive got livein staff and they have all your numbers this is how i want it to be how it will be i appreciate all your care and all your concern from now on i want to handle things by myself and by now i mean just that now it had been an effort to finish but she was sure no one had detected her difficulty she wasnt being stupid or arrogant theyd weaned her off the medication because theyd decided she didnt need it as she hadnt needed medication for her fathers funeral and if she didnt need medication she didnt need nurses to sit around and hold her hand she didnt need anyone to hold her hand when she said goodbye to the best husband it had been possible to have which was the way to think jane told herself not to sink into a slough of selfpity but to think how lucky shed been having him as a loving caring husband for as long as she had shed need to spend a lot of time and effort having johns crypt designed ensure it was a monument to him and speak to rosemary pritchard that was the first priority as they left the apartment newton told mortimer now its you whove made the mistake were going to be there keeping an eye on everything said the psychiatrist there cant be any problems alice hadnt tried to download any more evidence of crossborder invoice padding shed filled the intervening day tidying the cabin eating properly for the first time since she couldnt remember when but shunning alcohol and driving yet again into paterson to buy what she thought she needed for the funeral if those hunting her knew her name she had to assume that they also knew what she looked like had a photograph even which made the need for a disguise more practical than melodramatic the thought of adopting one still embarrassed her the dark wig to conceal her blondness scarcely amounted to a disguise anyway she added to it a hat with a veil longer than that jane had worn at her fathers funeral and remained unsure about dark glasses beneath it deciding to wait until she returned to the cabin to make up her mind the black dress would have benefited from some minimal lifting at the shoulders but without time for alteration and doubting shed wear it ever again alice hid the problem beneath a black jacket that fitted better it was only when she was driving back from paterson that alice finally confronted what she had been refusing until that moment to bring into the forefront of her mind where it should have been from the moment shed acknowledged jane to be in danger the obvious immediate and seemingly only resolution was to involve the police and the fbi protection but upon what evidence came the recurring taunting question shed already decided the irs printouts werent sufficient quite apart from how shed obtained them from the attitude shed encountered the previous day the fbi wouldnt respond without considerably more which she didnt have and shed never get by the desk sergeant in any manhattan precinct house with accounts of murder masked as accident and accident fulfilling doubtless intended murder jane unaware of any danger was the only person who could produce what was necessary to protect herself what john had been taken back to citibank to retrieve unaware yet where or what the secrets were that risked further shattering her already shattered life as alice was finally reconciled to hers being shattered was she thinking only of jane alice asked herself at last demanding personal honesty of course she wasnt thinking only of jane what jane had access to as johns wife would provide her salvation too was it the most obscene unimaginably amoral cynicism even to think as she was thinking no refused alice janes marriage janes security the fulness and completeness of her marriage had never once been threatened by her affair with john shed genuinely totally honestly never seen herself competing with jane alice would never expect anyone to believe her she found it difficult with total objectivity to believe it herself but without ever knowing it without there ever having been a challenge jane had been the one who won so it wasnt amoral or obscene or contemptibly cynical to contemplate although until now climbing the low foothills at last she hadnt allowed herself to contemplate how she could properly guarantee her survival which was all she was thinking about survival for herself and for jane so how was she going to achieve it how was she going to get to jane and talk to jane in such a way in such words that jane would not dismiss her as the fbi had so far dismissed her alice didnt know she could think of no plan no approach that was halfway feasible jane would be in shock grieving to breaking point hello jane you dont know about me but i know everything about you your father who worked for the mafia was murdered john was going to be murdered and weve only got one chance to stop it happening to you and me oh and by the way janice snow was murdered too now heres what weve got to do as she turned off down the track towards the cabin totally hidden in the riverside trees alice sniggered aloud at the sheer absurdity of it but it wasnt couldnt be absurd somehow to keep them both safe she had to produce what john had hidden to guarantee both their survival at the cabin alice modelled her complete outfit in front of the fulllength mirror with and without dark glasses beneath the veiled hat and remained undecided glad of the hat because it lessened what she thought to be the artificiality of the readymade wig although after practice and careful pinning again hidden by the hat she became satisfied that it didnt look as artificial as shed first imagined when she left the cabin early on the morning of the funeral alice still hadnt thought of an approach to jane that she considered remotely practicable and felt sick with the effort of trying alice accepted she couldnt use the garage space reserved in her own name and it took her longer than shed anticipated to find a spot in one on east th although she still had time to walk to the cathedral it was a bright day which justified the dark glasses she arrived with the bulk of the mourners and was grateful for their concealment the two books of condolences on either side of the entrance created a congestion that stretched back to the outer steps but in which it was easy for alice to mingle to avoid signing although she couldnt isolate anyone standing too obviously close to either checking names unwittingly echoing carvers thoughts at northcotes funeral alice told herself that those searching for her would be here somewhere watching looking would they have an identifying photograph of her be comparing every woman coming in the crush of people at that moment would make that impractical she tried to reassure herself although once past the condolence book bottleneck there was almost an immediate thinningout in the vastness of the cathedral she edged into a halffilled pew relieved it was immediately filled behind her by other mourners and at once bowed her head in cupped hands further hiding herself in feigned prayer she waited until she guessed from the noise that the pew behind her was occupied before raising her head she stared directly ahead until she realized that the red clothcovered stand in front of the altar was for the coffin and abruptly looked down at the order of service her fogged eyes unable to focus on anything she sensed the family arrival from the movements of heads in front of her and turning with them she saw jane dressed as shed been dressed for her fathers funeral upright and unaided by those around her whom she recognized from her research visits to the northcote building although she couldnt remember the mens names the other woman in the group was hilda bennett johns pa and then she saw the coffin following and her mind emptied and her eyes filmed and there was the rustle of everyone around her opening their service sheets and she automatically opened hers so did jane who couldnt see the words either all she could see nothing receding and returning receding and returning in crystal clear unwanted clarity was a flowerfestooned box with burnished brass fixtures containing the body of the man to whom she had given herself completely whom she loved completely and whom she could not conceive being without not having any more than she had been able was able to conceive not having her alwayscommanding alwayscontrolling father two indomitable supermen to whom nothing was insurmountable leaving her alone bereft she didnt know what she was going to do how she was going to do it jane anticipated the sitting down without prompting a man she didnt know from the firm she thought but wasnt sure ascended the pulpit and mouthed words she didnt hear because she didnt want to hear she knew how wonderful john had been she didnt need the contrived platitudes and hypocritical insincerity she knew john fully and completely knew john which no one else did he would have made the most wonderfully attentive adoring father which he could still be from beyond the grave not physically attentive or adoring but a father a father for their child she didnt care how many or what operations she had to undergo what discomfort pain she had to endure if john had left a sperm sample shed become pregnant by it was rosemary pritchard here would she be at the wake urged by her own question jane half turned actually to look around the vast building but didnt see anyone properly good today if they could talk not essential though she could definitely make contact tomorrow begin everything tomorrow if it was a boy it had to be a boy shed obviously call it john create an archive of photographs and anecdotes and whatever had been written in the obituaries so that john jr would know what a very special unique father hed had she hoped so much to meet rosemary today there was another ebb and flow of awareness but jane didnt need hildas supporting hand to rise for another unheard hymn or sit for another unheard reading or another unheard sermon about the cruel mysteries of gods will beyond mere mortal understanding she wished shed seen johns body properly said goodbye she wouldnt have been persuaded against doing so if it hadnt been for the goddamned drugs theyd fed her like candy take this madam take that madam she wouldnt take anything when she had johns baby she wanted to feel everything know everything like she knew how completely john had loved her as shed loved him it wouldnt be an empty life from now on shed have johns baby make him so proud of the father hed never know john carver junior it sounded good strong as john had been strong its over whispered the attentive hilda at her elbow no its not smiled jane rising to follow the coffin from the cathedral where was martha wondered gene hanlan watching the procession from the back of the cathedral she had to be here somewhere among all these people hed spent the entire service studying the crowd without knowing what he was looking for a woman crying a woman furtive a woman fitting his mental image of martha for whom he didnt have any proper mental image which made his being there a waste of time hed still go on to the wake hanlan determined it didnt make any more sense to do so than it had to come here but you never knew there might just be something that would instinctively jar although he couldnt imagine what it might be he was curious at the faint smile on jane carvers face as she passed and wondered too why she was looking so intently from side to side of the nave as if she were looking for someone probably the effect of tranquillizers shed need something to get her through the double whammy of losing a father and a husband like she had people rarely pluck a phoney name out of the blue the psychologicalprofile training at quantico was that somewhere there always had to be a subconscious connection like people nine times out of ten choosing phoney names that began with their own initials would jane carver know who might call herself martha a long shot among all the other shots so long they were virtually beyond the horizon certainly one he wasnt going to resolve today hanlan moved as his pew turned to empty emerging into the aisle at virtually the same time as stanley burcher from the other side of the nave burcher hadnt seen anyone resembling the inadequate thumbnail picture of alice belling although the crowd was too great for any proper examination or comparison not everyone in the cathedral would be going back to the wake at the plaza he hadnt bothered with northcotes but there were a lot more pressing reasons for his going this time maybe hed find alice belling there bearfort mountains are new jersey cavalcante territory identified bobby gallo they were again in the hotel penthouse with the view over central park theyve used the system a lot said charlie petrie know its importance we should bring them in suggested the luchese consigliere gino larocca we get a better lead they may have useful people on the payroll i think so too said petrie ill fix it weve agreed the northcote organization is finished said vito craxi the bonanno voice at the meeting whos going to take over im proposing a firm in philadelphia said petrie we got pressure on the president and four directors its worked like clockwork for the past five years you want to use burcher asked gallo i dont think we should said larocca ive apologized for the deliocis but burcher lost the handle on it too let him work his usefulness out here but when its sorted out i think stans time is up more than used up said carlo brookier offering the colombo opinion this should have been settled properly a long time ago anyone disagree invited petrie no one spoke twentyone jane hadnt seen rosemary pritchard on her way out of the cathedral but there had been too many women in the congregation to isolate every one and a lot wore hats some with veils like her own although jane didnt imagine the gynaecologist to be a hatandveil person hilda told her when she asked in the car that there wasnt an attendance list but theyd know later who had been at the service from the condolence books peter mortimer and paul newton were among the first to arrive after her at the plaza mortimer asked how she felt and jane said ok which she was there had only been two ebbandflow sensations in the cathedral both when she was sitting down and none since she was hearing and thinking quite clearly knowing what she had to do eager for everyone to arrive so she could find rosemary it wouldnt be possible for them to talk properly at the receiving line but shed be able to tell rosemary she wanted to see her later and that it was important it was good to be able to think like this not losing the thread halfway through she told hilda she didnt want anything to drink or to go to the bathroom why was it taking so long for everyone to arrive geoffrey davis and the senior partner took their places beside her and jane nodded to the parroted question about how she felt hilda said people are getting here now which they were mortimer standing drink in hand with newton where they had an unbroken view of jane said shes going to be just fine the chlorpromazine didnt hit her as hard as it could have done jack jennings was close enough with the rest of the now dispersed litchfield staff to hear the remark and hoped the psychiatrist was right he thought jane carver looked shaky alice held back wanting the concealment of the crowd that shed had at the cathedral desperately anxiously wishing shed been able to think of a better approach to jane it hardly amounted to an idea at all but it might just get her to jane alone which was as far as alice had taken her thoughts get to jane alone today talk about documents shed been promised by northcote and then by john for the biography of northcote shed agreed to write how was she going to persuade jane convince jane to open the safe deposit she didnt know not yet hadnt worked it out just get them protected that was all she had to do keep them both alive stanley burcher was using the concealment of the crowd too entering the room as part of the line but sidling away almost at once not wanting officially to meet jane carver not yet anyway if he determined upon the proposal taking shape in his mind it might be necessary only once she being the only person with legal access to carvers security facility could he turn that into a mere formality carvers severance letters would be on record in the northcote building the families had the originals carver had written to their registered grand cayman addresses there was every reason for his officially approaching the northcote firm acknowledging the termination and demanding the return of all documentation referring to the five companies arguing that he knew they were being stored privately and not in the firms vaults the danger was that northcote lawyers would examine what was in the box once jane had retrieved it could he extend client confidentiality and insist the contents be returned unexamined they knew from what carver had produced in the noxt building what was duplicated in the citibank vaults and burcher doubted the woman would understand any of it the northcote lawyers would though when they went through it as they inevitably would which way would they jump when they realized the significance like lemmings over the selfexposing selfdestructive cliff to the fbi or more practicably and strictly within the law gratefully accepting they were no longer professionally involved and even more gratefully thrusting upon him carvers incriminating box it was an impossible bet to call but the sensibly practical route the route burcher would have expected any sensible practical lawyer to take would be the latter where in this milling reception room was the northcote lawyer logically he or she had to be close to jane carver reluctantly as he was always reluctant to enter any focus of attention burcher moved towards the receiving group so finally although from a different direction did alice what the fuck was he doing here hanlan asked himself had he expected name tags martha in big letters imagined in this babble that hed hear the voice hed recognize when he wasnt sure hed recognize it anyway stupidly unprofessionally hed let this get to him let instinct gut instinct cloud hardassed reality ginette was right and mckinnon was right and washington was right keep the door or more literally the telephone lines open but dont invest this offthewall situation with importance or priorities it didnt have ok after this he wouldnt any more than hed tell anyone else at federal plaza where hed been or what hed been doing just keep things in order of priority file this at the back of the list hanlan still didnt move from where hed established himself after also slipping out of the receiving line token champagne in hand but undrunk watching martha would be here crazy or not shed have to be according to every quantico rule of psychological profiling a big crowd rich crowd no one certainly no woman looking out of place particularly unusual or attracting attention most likely one of this sort of crowd then but which side the honestly rich side who would have needed northcote and carver to keep them that way or the dirty organizedcrime side who according to martha had found some way to make northcote and carver work for them no way these days of guessing telling everyone at this level looked the same behaved the same rich successful honest a quiet voice said excuse me and hanlan moved aside for burcher to continue on towards where jane carver and her group were standing jane let her mind freefall from everything immediately around her but intentionally not from any legacy of the drug her sole concentration upon finding one person one face which so far she hadnt seen thats all she had to concentrate upon only mary no rosemary pritchard thats the only person she wanted to see to talk to rosemary talk to rosemary everything else was unimportant banal trite words trite responses so sorry a wonderful man tragic loss we must keep in touch lunch thank you very kind yes keep in touch where was rosemary why hadnt she come jane felt tired from standing from shaking hands her back and legs ached and her hand her fingers hurt from being squeezed people thinking the harder they pressed the more sincere they appeared so sorry a brilliant man thank you very kind jane rosemary exclaimed jane then at once no not rosemary she tried to focus but it wasnt easy to see a veiled face through her own veil and then abruptly the womans image faded for the briefest of seconds youre not rosemary who why wasnt it rosemary it had sounded like rosemary we have to talk urged alice conscious of the pressure from people behind its very important about your father and john both of them i thought you were rosemary can we talk can i come to see you to talk its urgent do you know rosemary rosemary pritchard the pressure the intervention was now from the woman whom alice knew to be hilda bennett the woman said to jane are you all right do you want to stop no refused jane fully bringing herself back to where she was what she was doing what was it you said she asked alice we need to meet about your father and john yes of course thank you very kind stanley burcher was merged into another wall studying geoffrey davis who had been pointed out to him as the northcote lawyer by a hovering hotel manager uncharacteristically burcher was tempted to make a direct personal approach quickly dismissing the thought as unprofessional and in entirely the wrong circumstances he thought davis looked a practical levelheaded sort of man but outward appearances were meaningless he hadnt seen anyone resembling the magazine photograph of alice belling who at that moment passed just twenty feet away as she left the reception alice knew who rosemary pritchard was john had recommended the gynaecologist to her why at this moment in time and in these circumstances was rosemary pritchard so important to jane jane was glad at last to be moving relieving the ache in her back and legs and sparing her hand from any more crushing insincerity which was still as crushing without the handshakes appalling tragedy so unfair brilliant husband brilliant father youre very brave couldnt be that brave myself lunch ill call very soon thank you lunch is good ill wait to hear she was learning how to control the ebbs and flows it had come three times while she stood in the receiving line though she was sure no one had suspected because she was always sufficiently aware now in the very few seconds before they washed over her could compensate say the words thank you very kind so good of you to come her back was aching again her legs too she couldnt go on much longer wanted to stop finish now done enough done all she had to hilda said do you want to go home now have i done everything properly youve done everything exactly right jane was startled by mortimers reassurance unaware until he spoke that the man was walking the room with her then yes id like to go home no one knew no one suspected she had had to do what couldnt remember she would though soon enough just needed a moment get her thoughts together what was it she had to do it was important more people in the way fine man brilliant mind such a loss thank you so kind thank you jane couldnt remember getting into the car they were going back across town hilda was talking just the odd word initially then connected making sense a lot to do letters things like that not tomorrow if you dont feel like it whenever but ill get the condolence books now if youre all right for a moment ill go get them then ill come back i want that jane heard herself saying like before thats what i thought i expected that you would there must be other things i have to do proper things formal everythings on hold until youre ready not today no agreed the older woman nothing more today today youve done enough the car turned into east nd street and hilda said here we are home jane welcomed the sudden clarity not aching now not even feeling tired not home she contradicted john isnt here any more alice hadnt intended to be there shed left the plaza to retrieve her car and get back as soon as she could to the safety of the cabin in the bearfort mountains it was only when she drove out of the lot that she decided to go to east nd street initially with no thought in her mind of actually approaching jane not knowing even why she was doing what she was doing she tried the melrose hotel to isolate any obvious attention upon johns apartment building from both the bar and reception but couldnt see sufficiently from either it was when she was outside in the street again that she saw jane helped from her car by hilda bennett and sat undecided upon a bench at the second avenue junction and was glad she did because the older woman left after just fifteen minutes why not this afternoon alice suddenly asked herself and just as quickly answered herself why not twentytwo neither was it a conscious intention it hadnt crossed her mind to say what she did until alice entered the building and realized she had to negotiate reception security to get to the sixth floor where she knew johns apartment to be nor most stupid of all had it occurred to her that there would obviously be cctv cameras the man smiled at her approach and asked who she was visiting and alice said mrs carvers expecting me its about rosemary pritchard shes just got back from her husbands funeral frowned the man so have i what was she doing here saying here this was kneejerk unthoughtout madness of course he said looking more closely at alices veiled appearance i was told to expect some people rosemary pritchard you say thats right not a direct lie by no means the truth either but the best probably her only chance of getting past the foyer to see jane who wouldnt have responded had her staff respond if shed correctly identified herself which was unthinkable anyway which people were expected she was thinking on her feet now intuitively snatching at each and any opportunity easy enough to claim a misunderstanding it didnt matter all that mattered was getting to jane she heard the man recite the gynaecologists name into the internal telephone her breath tight and saw the mans unthinking nod of acceptance youre to go up he told alice who was already moving towards the elevator it would have been manuel whod answered she supposed or jennings john had talked of the staff transfers after northcotes death would either know what rosemary pritchard looked like it was doubtful as far as alice was aware rosemary pritchard didnt make house calls shed get to jane ok now nothing to stop her to say what she still wasnt sure retained research material didnt sound good enough any more not now she was actually here never really had sounded right so what was she going to say she didnt know couldnt think of anything which could make this a bad mistake ruining everything coming full frontal on to jane like this with stories of murder and blackmail and christ knows what else not could be a bad mistake would be a bad mistake because she couldnt tell jane anything of why she was here whatever story she tried to tell would be gibberish the ramblings of a lunatic the elevator stopped at six johns floor janes floor she corrected herself john didnt live here any more never would ever again or in princes street or in the cabin the elevator doors sighed closed behind her but alice didnt move she most definitely shouldnt have come like this this was panicked ridiculous jane wouldnt understand a thing she said about being in danger have her thrown out seized maybe by the security man downstairs she should have gone from the funeral to federal plaza and surrendered herself to someone called gene hanlan and persuaded him to come here with her that would have made the approach official to be taken seriously if that is hanlan could have been persuaded and not gone on demanding convincing proof of her claims before confronting a widow on the day of her husbands funeral which alice was sure he wouldnt conceivably have done there were three doors off the corridor in which she was standing but she knew from john that the one into the apartment was directly ahead at the corridors end it was pale green janes favourite colour chosen by her like the decor inside pale green offset by cream dark green for contrast in the carpets and drapes john had liked it too called jane artistic she should leave alice told herself call the elevator back and get out before she was trapped by whoever else was expected she couldnt have gained more than fifteen minutes leaving the wake early insane to be here like this she had to take a chance with the fbi agent it was her only chance it might have helped if shed brought the irs printouts from the cabin insufficient by themselves but at least something perhaps not go to the fbi at all not yet but when she wouldnt be gaining anything by waiting to get any more tax records so she wouldnt wait she had to live survive not wait the palegreen door was opened by manuel whom she recognized from johns description of the darkhaired darkskinned butler a mexican with a mexican wife resenting the intrusion of others alice said the lobby called up manuel nodded and said rosemary pritchard mrs carvers expecting me i was expecting dr mortimer people from the firm ive come direct from the funeral get out of the way let me in as if aware of alices thoughts manuel stood aside gesturing alice towards a door to the right the drawing room alice knew holding back for the butler to open it for her but immediately thrusting past before he could block her way jane carver was in a chair by the window looking across the verandah in the direction of the park she turned at manuels voice her features more squinting than frowning because at that moment janes vision was blurred as much from a closetoexhaustion half doze as from the persistent hangover from chlorpromazine what who jane we talked back at the hotel how long would it be before the others arrived behind her minutes probably no more than minutes janes vision cleared yes she said doubtfully something about her father john she wished she didnt feel so tired so disorientated alice was conscious of manuel hovering at the door face creased in uncertainty he said are you all right mrs carver dr mortimers on his way jane roused herself physically straightening in her chair its ok i dozed off i dont want anything thank you as manuel closed the door after himself still frowning jane looked back to alice and said im sorry it had to be the fbi alice decided there was no other choice somehow anyhow she had to get jane to federal plaza talk and plead there until they took her seriously enough to put them both under some sort of protection until jane could get the documents that were going to save them from citibank on wall street it could be done by tomorrow by tomorrow they could be out of danger i want you to come somewhere with me its very important its to do with rosemary pritchard exclaimed jane triumphantly yes of course until that moment alice had been unaware of the depth of janes confusion shed dismissed as understandable janes strangeness during their brief encounter at the plaza the bewilderment of grief and of being among too many people too soon engulfed in that grief but now it was obviously something else something shed been given to help her get through the ordeal dr mortimers on his way manuel had said theyd be here soon the prescribing doctor and people from the firm she couldnt possibly explain to them convince them she couldnt be here when they arrived yes rosemary pritchard are you taking me to her yes thats what i want to do will you come with me now right away of course ive been waiting jane rose but swayed slightly needing the support of the chair back still a bit fuzzy weve got to hurry jane how long had she been in the apartment five minutes ten minutes they had to get out she was taking advantage of someone who didnt know what they were doing she thought forgive me john and then forgive me jane what she was doing was right alice told herself it had to be manuel must have used one of the side doors to get into the entrance lobby of the apartment as they came out of the drawing room he said people are on their way mrs carver i need a coat manuel were going to see dr pritchard the others are coming the butler insisted you should wait they can wait tell them that tell them to wait could you get my coat please the man didnt immediately move he said to alice i thought you were rosemary pritchard no who are you a friend manuel my coat please demanded jane alice couldnt believe the sudden lucidity was worried it might suddenly bring jane back into proper questioning awareness manuel said i think you should wait mrs carver there are people who can wait ill get my damned coat myself manuel got to the closet first the coat was black to match janes funeral clothes jane took it but didnt try to put it on instead throwing it over her arm alices concentration was on the indicator board as they went down the outside corridor alert for an ascending elevator jabbing at the summoning button the moment she reached it manuel was at the still open door of the apartment watching them everythings going to be all right said jane obscurely i know it will be said alice who didnt the lobby was empty the man at the reception desk smiled and said something alice didnt hear jane smiled back at him but didnt say anything outside alice said ive got a car and quickly turned jane away from the direction from which vehicles would approach alice wanted to move faster but jane was unsteady scuffing her feet needing a supporting arm alice could see the volkswagen tantalizingly ahead like a mirage and for a moment like a mirage it didnt seem to be getting any nearer but then it did and she bustled jane into the passenger seat and tightened the safety belt around her as she did so close to the other woman alice saw janes eyes droop then blink open her head jerking back then it fell again alice drove initially without thought grateful shed been facing east making the right on second avenue and staying on it through four intersections before making the crosstown turn wanting to avoid going close to the plaza shed done it shed got jane poor momentarily bewildered and confused jane and through jane the fbi could get what george northcote was murdered for and what janice snow was murdered for and what john had finally too late been so desperately running to the police to preserve which they could get now alice couldnt think didnt want to think beyond that whatever the uncertainties ahead things were going to happen and when they did she had to face them adjust to them it was when alice was actually making the crosstown turn that jane slumped heavily against her and when she was fully halted by the jam at the fifth avenue junction alice turned to see janes head sunk deeply on to her chest bubbling faint snores loudly she said jane but jane didnt stir jane there was still no response it would be whatever jane had been given to get her through the funeral that and the trauma of it all total exhaustion as well alice felt close to total exhaustion herself she wouldnt get what she wanted the acceptance she wanted taking a completely incomprehensible woman to the fbi theyd most likely hospitalize jane separating them before there was any chance of even attempting to explain which would make everything impossible alice didnt turn downtown on broadway but continued on straight across to twelfth avenue to go north on to west side highway she hoped jane would sleep until they got to the cabin shed run into the first of her uncertainties alice realized and still wasnt safe gene hanlan and the fbi became involved so quickly through a coincidental sequence of events geoffrey davis didnt raise the alarm by dialling but called sergeant p david hopper direct with a lawyers recall that the man had been in charge of john carvers accident investigation and hopper remembered hanlans unusual visit to the precinct house and called federal plaza after alerting his own detective division kidnapping is a federal offence and kidnapping had been the word davis had used in their conversation and because it was the word hopper continued to use the nypd detectives were led by a lieutenant a shortcropped trousersuited woman whose id badge said barbara donnelly from the way in which they were trying to assemble people with no interviews started hanlan guessed he was only five minutes behind the detectives i didnt call you the woman greeted hanlan walking away from her team physically separating him from everyone so were saving time said hanlan sergeant hopper had indeed been a rarity this was the sort of instant and instinctive resentment to which he was accustomed howd you find out so quick the voice had a smokers hoarseness the bureau already has an interest hanlan felt he was due the exaggeration if jane carver had indeed been kidnapped there should be a lot of people in the j edgar hoover building eating crow within the next twentyfour hours you want to explain that hanlan looked at the people now waiting on the far side of the apartment close to the balcony window and wondered if they could detect the antagonism between him and the woman in the exchange it would worsen if he reminded her he didnt have to explain anything lowering his voice and putting his back towards them hanlan said you know about the death of george northcote carvers fatherinlaw up in litchfield and of northcotes personal assistant out in brooklyn read something about it after carver got killed allowed the woman so weve got an informant talking organized crime money laundering and murder shit she said the hostility going from the manner in which she was confronting him its federal he pointed out weve got pretty effective murder divisions here in the city if they were murdered theyve been officially accepted as accidents carvers most certainly was theyre out of nypd jurisdiction we going to work together the woman was retreating further i dont see any benefit in working against each other never did said hanlan the detectives with barbara donnelly were shifting impatiently knowing what was going on there was some uncertain movement from near the window too she said lets just run through it see how it goes hanlan turned to the waiting group recognizing the two men and the woman who had stood in the receiving line with jane carver there was one other woman in a severely tailored suit and three other men one with a heavy moustache another in the sort of black suit that staff often wore and the third in a red blazer that also looked like a uniform hanlan introduced himself and asked for the general picture and at once geoffrey davis identified himself by name and position taking control of the group as hanlan hoped he was going to be able to take control of the law enforcement jane became very tired by the end of the reception under a lot of stress she asked to come back so hilda brought her arrangement was that wed give her time to settle down get rested and then wed come by to see she was ok theres a few things ive got to see to willreadings firm insurances and pensions that automatically revert to her im not getting a clear picture here protested barbara looking to one of the women you hilda carvers pa nodded if you came back with her how come you didnt stay until the others arrived hilda said jane told me she wanted to rest that there was something she had to do later shed asked several times earlier about rosemary pritchard she hesitated smiling towards the severely suited woman this is dr pritchard jane wanted to know whether shed been at the funeral i told her that while she was resting id go back to the cathedral and pick up the condolences books she nodded to two bound volumes on a coffee table were going to need them for the letters when i got back shed gone with someone who pretended to be dr pritchard supplied a man in a blazer tom reynolds downstairs security the woman said she was rosemary pritchard and when i called up manuel told me to let her on past but i was began the swarthy man in the black suit but hanlan cut him off ok lets hold it there everyone can make their own contributions later but for the moment lets get some continuity into this you he insisted pointing to davis it came with a lawyers precision and only took minutes davis finished by gesturing towards the gynaecologist and saying dr pritchard was obviously the first person i called when i heard what had happened and i felt i should come straight over said the woman we appreciate that very much thank you said barbara you had no appointment with jane this afternoon no nor arranged to be at the funeral see her there no repeated the doctor were you treating her for anything specific were into patient confidentiality here refused the other woman dr pritchard said the detective lieutenant levelvoiced the way it looks someone who knows you or knows that jane is a patient of yours impersonated you and kidnapped her were not asking you to break any patient confidentiality what we are asking is that you do all you can to help us find her and get her back safely i understand that thats why i came as soon as i got the call jane knew you the woman couldnt have impersonated you said hanlan i asked her if she was rosemary pritchard intruded manuel she said she was a friend a friend of mine or of jane demanded the gynaecologist manuel shrugged and shook his head unknowing how was she asked hanlan she look frightened as if this other woman was threatening her manuel considered the question not really whats not really mean she got angry when i asked her not to leave until dr mortimer and the others got here she didnt usually get angry was jane carver under treatment by you dr pritchard asked barbara rosemary pritchard hesitated i had recently seen her and john how recently demanded hanlan a few days ago lets try to get around this confidentiality problem by how i phrase my question suggested the detective because ive got a problem with jane carver coming home to rest after the ordeal of her husbands funeral then suddenly getting up and leaving if she wasnt under any obvious pressure could whatever you were treating jane for make her vulnerable behave in a way out of the ordinary chlorpromazine could declared peter mortimer whats that asked barbara what she was being given wrongly given to help her over the shock of her fathers death said mortimer it can have bad side effects on certain people and in my professional judgement jane was one such person it had been stopped but there was clearly a residue what sort of bad side effects asked hanlan the psychiatrist shrugged vulnerability to repeat an already used word emotional dependency upon others fixation i think youre solving my problem said barbara all we need now is to know where she is and who shes with added hanlan he looked at the policewoman you think your guys could get the initial statements sure nodded barbara to her waiting squad she said ok guys and followed hanlan towards the window view making room for the other detectives to start work she said to hanlan you going to bring in a big team i dont know yet admitted hanlan what i dont want are any media leaks if shes being held weve got to avoid spooking whoevers got her into doing something in a panic to get rid of her you warn your guys sure agreed the woman again but a thing like this it nearly always gets out lets just do our best if it is a kidnap therell be ransom demands well need to get this place wired people here permanently and the northcote building as well have negotiators there too barbara donnelly looked at him sceptically and you want to keep it under wraps lets just do our best hanlan repeated and he stopped abruptly looking back into the apartment and at the moment were a hell of a long way short of doing that he called out mr reynolds dr pritchard the security guard and the gynaecologist crossed the room together hanlan said downstairs in the lobby theres got to be cctv sure thing agreed the guard and a viewing room of course you mind coming with us dr pritchard no one spoke in the descending lift but barbara donnelly was smiling faintly and when she glanced in his direction hanlan smiled back hopefully there were four monitors in the viewing room but alice was only on the loop of the primary camera directed at the main door the film showed her turning away immediately after her first exchange with reynolds and barbara said shes trying to cover herself seen theres a camera jane was between alice and the camera as they left and the detective said here shes using jane as a shield and look shes holding her arm forcing her along supporting not forcing her qualified hanlan to the gynaecologist he said well do you know her i think i do said rosemary pritchard although with doubtful slowness who demanded barbara eagerly give us her name the gynaecologist shook her head i dont have one im fairly sure that i know her that ive seen her or met her but i cant recognize her give her a name theres something she shrugged something but i dont know what on the second rerun hanlan realized that hed seen her too that morning at john carvers wake at the plaza hotel jane had remained asleep only occasionally stirring during the drive up to the cabin and was very confused when alice tried to rouse her needing all alices support to get her into the cabin so unsteady and still so half asleep that alice continued straight on into the bedroom and laid jane under the comforter only bothering to take off her shoes jane snuffled and shifted for a position but slept on during the drive alice had tried to put some sort of reason into what shed done and justified most of it but not all and the part she couldnt justify was the most important but the major concern was jane herself however exhausted jane might have been by the funeral it was surely unnatural maybe dangerously so to have slept for so long in a jolting car and to go on sleeping now although the bed was far more comfortable than the volkswagens passenger seat jane should be seen by a doctor who would ask questions about medication which alice couldnt answer want to know what jane was doing there and maybe why alice reached out and felt janes forehead jane stirred at the touch but didnt wake up she wasnt running a fever and was breathing quite normally shed wait alice decided sit where she was here in the bedroom alert for any discernible change in jane shed definitely get a doctor if jane became obviously ill but at the moment she wasnt obviously ill just deeply asleep which made alices other difficulty the most important thing shed kept the radio on low throughout the drive tuned to breaking news for the first flash on janes disappearance surprised she hadnt heard it thered be a panic though police and fbi gene hanlan involved almost inevitably it would be a hell of a risk calling from here but she had to do it to stop the panic stop them thinking something bad might have happened to jane it would only take a minute maybe two it would be all right to leave jane alone for just two minutes but alice hesitated at the telephone the federal plaza number beside it and had to force herself to lift up the receiver the moment she said martha into the mouthpiece hanlan was on the line you got her the lobby camera alice knew shes all right you know what youve done hanlan certainly knew what hed done risking his entire career putting everything on hold in expectation of getting this call after seeing the cctv film of course i know why did you do it to get the evidence you said i needed she got it she can get it now heres what youre going to do martha youre going to come in like ive been asking you to all along come in and were going to sort it all out and now i want you to bring jane to the phone so i can talk to her hear that shes ok you cant talk to her shes asleep martha you could be in a whole lot of trouble serious criminal trouble im keeping a very tight lid on everything to protect you but thats what i want protection i know and i promise ill give it to you all youve got to do is come in or tell us where you are and well come and get you shed held on the phone too long ill call again later i want to think martha dont hang up but alice did the bonannos vito craxi said i want to put things on notice here were looking at a fucking disaster a major fucking disaster endorsed carlo brookier no one was admiring the central park view or helping themselves to drinks bobby gallo the gambino consigliere said thats my familys feeling too how we going to get whats in carvers citibank box we dont get it the systems bust its a collapse we dont want and cant have charlie petrie knew clearly enough it wasnt general conversation he in particular and the genovese by unarguable association were being held responsible what about burchers idea going to the firm direct get back what belongs to us after carver wrote his letters we cant be sure we know of everything northcote held back who might be identified warned gino larocca were over a barrel here we gotta shift something insisted gallo ill speak to burcher about a strictly legal approach undertook petrie i think its dangerous protested craxi lets vote on it suggested petrie craxi was the only objector petrie said ill speak to him craxi said after this burcher is superfluous he gets the stuff back from the northcote firm he provides a service said gallo hes still superfluous insisted craxi he gets the stuff back then hes superfluous agreed petrie right now hes got a use twentythree jane awoke in the half light of an uncurtained window immediately aware of being fully dressed beneath the comforter and that because of it she was far too hot it was as she pushed the covering aside her eyes adjusting to the deeply shadowed room that she became aware of a woman slumped in a chair beneath the window breathing heavily asleep there was a vaguely familiar smell from the pillow or from the comforter but she couldnt decide why she recognized it there was no city noise outside just the rustle of trees ruffled by the breeze somewhere in the country then but where who with why jane didnt feel any fear any positive threat shed never known real fear or threat in her protected life her head was clear which was good no sensation of it being stuffed with cotton wool her mind too thick to think properly so think properly johns funeral people a lot of people at the hotel a woman at the apartment this woman maybe too dark to see her face couldnt remember her face the woman said rosemary pritchard that was it the woman was taking her to rosemary pritchard why was she being taken why not just go by herself that didnt make any sense being here somewhere in the country didnt make any sense lying fully dressed in bed didnt make any sense whose bed whose house too much that didnt make sense jane was desperately thirsty she eased herself off the bed from the side furthest from the sleeping woman steadying herself as she stood locating a door ajar in the wall closest to her she went out pulled it fully closed behind her orientating herself to the now shrouded room but at once wondered why she was staying in the dark feeling out instead for the light switch and finding it alongside the door it was a country cabin she instantly recognized blinking in the abrupt light rustic plaid furniture grouped around a huge stone fireplace logs stacked alongside polished wood floor beneath rug throws a computer telephone and a pile of paper on a faraway desk by the door that door obviously led outside she guessed the one opposite was to the kitchen it was only when she was crossing to it that she realized she wasnt wearing shoes looking down at herself jane saw her clothes were concertinaed around her from their having been slept in she felt dirty unwashed too which she doubtlessly was what the hell was she doing here shed wake the woman as soon as shed drunk some water find out what it was all about it was a functional kitchen a stove refrigerator communal refectory table more than big enough for its six surrounding chairs salt pepper and napkins sat on their island in the middle two napkin rings jane drank the first glass without pause only bothering with ice on the second she drained that too like the first and it came up again from a too quickly filled stomach making her feel slightly sick she filled the glass again but sipped this time it was getting lighter outside through the kitchen window she saw a beetleshaped volkswagen then she jumped spilling some of her water at a sudden animal scream a victim of something larger jane felt a familiar dampness and thought damn she was on her way back to the bedroom and the sleeping woman when she saw the corridor to one side of the fireplace and detoured along it she found the bathroom first time wondering if she would have to pad herself relieved when she found one tampon remaining in its box in the bathroom cabinet there were two toothbrushes in the bathroom cup and an electric razor a remington like johns on a side shelf and then jane saw the cologne the cartier that john also used and realized why shed recognized the faint smell when shed first woken that morning beneath the duvet jane jumped again although less violently as she emerged to the unexpected sight of the woman hurrying across the main room towards the kitchen alice saw jane at the same time and appeared just as surprised there was a faint smile jane said i was coming to wake you i didnt hear you get up obviously the other woman was blonde about the same height and weight as she was probably around the same age too she wore jeans and a sports shirt and was barefoot im alice belling there was no possibility of the name meaning anything so long after the profile of janes father she hadnt rehearsed anything worked anything out shed imagined being up moving around working up a passable story in her mind long before jane awoke stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid like so much everything else im due an explanation probably prompted by the reasons for her using the bathroom jane remembered why she was so anxious to talk to the gynaecologist you became unwell after after yesterday floundered alice i was taking you somewhere but decided it was better for you to come here until you recovered she was definitely better jane decided her vision hadnt ebbed and flowed once since shed got up and her head was still ice clear when youre ill you need a doctor ok which is where you said yesterday you were taking me remember she could remember she was beginning to remember everything i was going to get one you went to sleep i thought it was better to leave you alice made a half gesture back towards the bedroom i sat up and went to sleep where the hell are we this was unreal totally unreal she still didnt feel frightened she was irritated annoyed at being bundled about without knowing why like a child that didnt deserve an explanation shed always explain things to her child treat it with the respect it deserved it wasnt difficult to find the edge to janes voice alice said the bearfort mountains the catskills exclaimed jane thats miles from new york what are we doing here why hadnt she thought it out better something anything forced herself to stay awake to get together some halfconvincing story hiding what demanded jane incredulous she shifted slightly the beginning of uncertainty alice recognized the movement desperate for a way forward it had to be a mix of all her halfthoughts and halfideas and halftruths alice belling she repeated i wrote a long profile of your father in forbes he was very flattering about it dont you remember the piece kind of said jane doubtfully the uncertainty was on her face now her head intently to one side he wrote me a couple of times said he wanted a biography written i began working on it researching id met john when id written the profile the arrangement was you knew john jane cut her off alice coughed to cover the need to swallow dear god make me think of something better than this like i said we met when i was doing the profile he handled any queries that came up after my interviews with your father that was how it was to continue for the book john acting as liaison when anything came up that your father was too busy to handle or too busy to handle broke in jane again my father was semiretired for a year it was going horribly appallingly wrong but it didnt matter jane was better now all she had to do was get jane back to manhattan to the fbi once they were safely inside the federal plaza building she didnt have to see jane ever again or perhaps more importantly jane never had to see her ever again alice shrugged it was the way we worked hiding echoed jane she spoke loudly making it a demand your father was tricked a long time ago the indications came up in some papers i came upon old papers they referred to some other documents that john found through them he put them in his safedeposit box in citibank on wall street the people who tricked your father want them back alice needed to move to get away from janes unremitting suspicious stare alice started to pad towards the desk and her new computer beside it the most recent printouts that had to go with the rest of the stuff already in the volkswagen ready to convince the bureau and abruptly saw the photograph it was the one of john the fisherman from their first visit which shed liked so much that shed copied it for princes street it was hidden at that moment behind the printouts but it probably wouldnt be if jane moved any closer alice turned at the desk wedging her hip on its edge her body a barrier an idea thrust into her mind and she grabbed it i know this all sounds preposterous refused jane my father and i were as close as it is possible for a father and daughter to be john and i were as close as its possible for a husband and wife to be if my father had decided upon a biography i would have known about it from him or from john if there was some problem with the firm i would have known about it from my father or from john i dont know who you are or what you want what youre talking about even i am not frightened of you youre going to take me to the nearest town from which i can speak to people do you understand the fbi know youre safe they want to speak to you the telephone was on the desk she had to get the photograph away before bringing jane to the telephone the fbi federal plaza thats all she had to do get them to federal plaza thats what john was doing at citibank on the day of the accident going to his safe deposit to get what hed found to pass it over to the fbi she was too far gone now to worry about count even the lies and the deceits as much for jane as for herself alice thought sorry john ive made a mess of it but jane will be safe the agentincharge is named gene hanlan its too early to call him yet you can speak to him first thing get her out the room on whatever pretext just long enough to get rid of the damned photograph not a damned photograph one of the few physical reminders she had of john shed take it with her to her new life shed ignore them whoever gave her the new identity if they said she couldnt keep it that she had to surrender and abandon all and every trace of her past she had to have that positive memento of john whose cabin is this alices mind was completely skewed by janes unexpected change of direction and without thought without giving herself time to think as she hadnt virtually throughout this disastrous confrontation she blurted mine what about your husband i dont have a husband the sickness was there again the churning low in her stomach growing at the back of her throat jane jerked her head back along the corridor i had to borrow one of your things i didnt realize i was due so much happening i guess there was stuff in the cabinet a razor cologne the nausea worsened alice said a partner didnt work out its only just happened i havent got around to clearing away the memories yet i havent even begun to think about clearing away the memories yet im sorry about john i mean alice forced herself to say today was the end after today it would all be over no embarrassment about hypocrisy about anything not the end alice corrected herself this was the very beginning the beginning of the rest of her life lying pretending being someone she didnt want to be but had to be saying things she didnt want to say but had to say jane looked down at her crumpled self i need to clean up her escape seized alice there was nothing she could do about the razor or the cologne but the photograph was the important thing the only thing why the sudden change in janes attitude it didnt matter getting jane out of the room was all that mattered you know where the bathroom is and then well get going i need to make some calls first i want you to i started jane but stopped what nothing it took alice only seconds to snatch up johns proud jokeofthemoment photograph and stuff it into a side drawer of the desk beneath manuscripts and proofs of articles she had written and which shed worked over every time she and john had been here all part of the fake domesticity his reading by the amber crackling fire while she did her job alice was glad the main bathroom was en suite she couldnt have waited for jane to emerge from the second one before being sick it had been a sleepless but productive night the only potential problem a personal one for gene hanlan within an hour of his cutoff telephone conversation with alice hanlan had organized an fbi plane to take him and a willing rosemary pritchard to washington for the cctv loop to be photographically enhanced it was while that was being done in the j edgar hoover buildings that hanlan endured the selfprotective tirade from his regional supervisor whod failed to react to hanlans previous visit and who argued now that the bureau was inescapably locked into a kidnap investigation that hanlan had decided upon without superior authorization which was against regulations and that his career hung upon the safe return of jane carver the confrontation was shortened by rosemary pritchards positive identification of alice belling from just her features being brought up from beneath the veil without needing to bother with hair colour change the gynaecologist was of course able to provide the princes street address from her patient records and it was still early enough that night to obtain a judges order to enter the apartment hanlan returned to manhattan with a fiveman forensic team and six seconded field agents to join the waiting ginette smallwood and patrick mckinnon and the nypd squad headed by barbara donnelly hanlan had restricted the entry into princes street to just himself and barbara donnelly in addition to the scientists and assigned mckinnon to organize an incident room at federal plaza by the time hanlan and the woman returned there ahead of the scientists computers desks and banks of pinboards had been installed in the conference room for the stilltoarrive clerks and support staff mckinnon had already started the pinboards fixing enlarged photographs of the catskills range and then reducing the focus to the still extensive region dominated by the town of paterson from which they had already traced alices contact call there were also cots available for people to sleep in the mess it was am by coincidence the time jane carver began edging out of bed in the bearfort mountains cabin before the scientists arrived and a further hour before they produced the findings from their mobile laboratory facility during that hour hanlan declared the bearfort mountains their obvious target area after seeing the location on the back of the now greatly enlarged photographs of carver at the cabin so alice knew john carver said mckinnon examining the display ive got five bucks says it was in a kind of a cosy way too that put jane at risk queried barbara at once might have done from the jealous mistress syndrome if carver was still alive agreed ginette but hes not its not unusual for a wife and mistress to know each other said the new york police lieutenant all she keeps saying is that they need protection reminded hanlan so why doesnt she come and get it instead of running demanded mckinnon today could be the day suggested hanlan hopefully to the man leading the scientific team whom he thought looked young enough to be his son hanlan said you got things to tell us worrying things announced the man at once we got there second shit said mckinnon you sure asked hanlan and wished he hadnt from the younger mans sour look very professional entry one of the best ive seen said the scientist we got picklock markings at the mouths of the mortice and the deadlock we dismantled both very definite forcedentry groovings the lobby mailbox had stuff dated more than two weeks ago theres not one single message remaining on the answering machine its been wiped careless remarked mckinnon not if there was a voice that didnt want to be recognized trying to reach her said hanlan were shipping the tape back to washington theyve got higher specification audio equipment than we carry they may be able to pull something up fingerprints asked barbara donnelly just two sets said the scientist always together all old one alices one carvers predicted ginette inevitably agreed hanlan how about untouched valuables stuff worth stealing the scientist nodded some jewellery a diamond ring in an old setting could be a family heirloom some gold chains television video computer were shipping the computer back to washington too to get the hard drive looked at people dont realize how much stays behind even if you think youve deleted it the man hesitated you want my guess the guys who got in before us were doing what were trying to do find alice and jane corrected mckinnon and theres something that just might help offered the scientist turning to the pinboard and the grinning photograph of john carver see this he demanded pointing to an image in the background among the trees doesnt show so well scarcely at all in fact at the size of the prints in the apartment looks like a fallen branch it isnt thats the tail of a volkswagen beetle could be white or grey definitely lightcoloured nothing else visible for a better identification carvers not a volkswagen man declared mckinnon positively no vehicle documentation anywhere in the apartment asked barbara donnelly the forensic expert shook his head and ginette said responsible drivers carry their documents with them hanlan said were on to vehicle registration when the clock strikes which wouldnt be for some hours yet he realized heres how it looks to me said barbara donnelly eager to prove herself crazy though its sounded it looks to me that alice has been telling a reasonable story from the beginning carvers death might have been a definite accident but the other twove got questions she talked about organized crime and we know now other people are looking weve got to get to her and jane carver before they do hanlan decided to let the woman have her moment and hoped she hadnt seen mckinnons patronizing smile hanlan said and heres what were going to do weve got an identifiable picture of alice lifted from the loop and we can get one of jane patersons our marker with the bearfort above it this is the number alice has so i stay here i want everyone else up there by the time people get out of bed showing them the photograph obvious spots stores gas stations ginette you stay here with me work the creditcard companies gas cards we find somewhere shes used more than once weve tightened our focus he jabbed at the map of paterson and the mountains beyond a lot of tracks but not a lot of roads im going to put a bureau prop up something slow enough to be able to carry out aerial observation maybe there wont be a lot of oldstyle volkswagens and well get lucky when we get the registration well alert highway patrol all the local forces without telling them why we draw blanks at paterson we move out further up the mountains he isolated mckinnon you coordinate it pat you need more people which you probably will you call me he hesitated and ill call you if alice comes on youll be right there to pick her up just like in the movies hanlan thought except they werent in the movies working to a script hanlan accepted that after the bawlingout in washington he was going to need all the luck he could get he had a defence and an appeal against anything the assholes there tried to stick on him but disciplinary procedures always left a stain even if they were dismissed and according to the book which those at the j edgar hoover buildings always went by he had broken regulations hanlan looked around the assembled lawenforcement officers anything else carvers safe deposit remembered barbara donnelly thats where the crown jewels are supposed to be according to alice who can surely now be taken seriously why dont we go back to counsel about a court order for access good idea accepted hanlan with his bare ass on the line why hadnt he thought of it first it was the first time theyd had a breakfast meeting and an early one at that close to seven and charlie petrie at once apologized if it was inconvenient he said got some business in jersey want to get ahead of the traffic you got a lead asked burcher at once both men had chosen continental bread and pastries and coffee petrie shook his head covering bases weve agreed your idea of making a formal approach to the northcote firm it would put him in an identifiable position burcher thought he wished now he hadnt suggested it it wont be easy you got a better idea even if their lawyers go for it theyll look to see what it is theyve got to and when they see what it is theyll realize how compromised they are and have been for years it can all be resolved sensibly between reasonable men ill work it out promised burcher petrie poured more coffee for both of them vito craxi was right petrie decided after this burcher was superfluous and he knew far too much he said we know you will stan its been a good and successful relationship stanley burcher thought there was a finality in the way the other man spoke twentyfour yes the voice was relaxed to alices knock alice could imagine jane lying back in the bath soaking im leaving some pants outside the door a sweater and some underwear thats kind were about the same size yes im going to get cleaned up myself now get ready to go all right still relaxed alice had run her own bath before collecting up the change of clothes for jane she lowered herself carefully ribs aching into the water hotter than she normally had it hoping the heat would ease away the discomfort of her retching where would she be sleeping bathing tomorrow morning not this early she hoped but safe both of them hidden away where no one could find them shed handled it very badly alice conceded it was hardly a situation that could have been handled well but she should have done better than she had nothing she could do about it now a pity that john had always insisted on showering and shaving in the second bathroom you need your space in the morning because youre a grouch she didnt think she had been hoped she hadnt there was so much she wished for so much it was impossible to turn back the clock to correct put right alices mind butterflied from thought to thought when was she due she couldnt remember hadnt bothered with notes in diaries because she was always so regular since undergoing treatment by rosemary pritchard every twentyeight days almost always conveniently in the morning maybe a passing twinge but never any serious stomach cramps one of my luckiest patients rosemary pritchard had called her warned her too sometimes when shed admitted being careless about her contraception but she hadnt been careless certainly not before john died as far as she could recall hadnt bothered afterwards no need to bother ever again shed never go with another man the idea revolted her like so much else so easily sickeningly revolted her easy enough to understand why she was being sick the fear from what shed gone through was still going through and she still knew what could happen to her although at that moment she didnt feel frightened she was of course subconsciously thats what it was subconscious justified fear but all about to disappear today alice felt fine not sick at all when she got out of the bath and put her jeans and sweater back on a quarter before eight she saw when she restrapped her watch shed wait until eight to ensure gene hanlan would be at the field office although thered probably be a contact arrangement to reach him at any time should she pack anything it made obvious sense because although she was going to be protected there wouldnt be an opportunity to buy new things so quickly and shed need fresh clothes fresh underwear jane would be able to get what she needed packed for her by one of the staff at east nd street and collected by someone from the bureau no cause to concern herself any more about jane jane was sitting in one of the fireplace chairs barefoot like alice when alice reemerged into the main room and alices first thought was that she was relaxed if she had known it would have all been different jane was looking around her head moving with the intensity with which she was examining everything jane said pity it didnt work out what you and your partner this is the sort of place a couple could be very happy in hidden away from everyone everything we were alices throat was dry what did he do architect said alice the first thing that came into her head in manhattan trenton he has his own practice it would only be for today but she had to remember not change the story he design this place its cute no she said then hurrying ive got eggs and some ham although the breads not fresh you want some breakfast before we go i want to make calls before we go yes of course well call the bureau and rosemary pritchard insisted jane it wasnt intended as a positive deceit although i guess it was said alice youll understand when we get to the bureau i need to understand now lets get breakfast alice tried to avoid lets get breakfast and talk now so ill understand insisted jane bizarrely they prepared breakfast together easily jane setting the table and making the coffee alice putting out the ham and scrambling eggs which meant she could talk mostly turned away from the other woman concentrating upon the stove alice once more referred to northcote being tricked into involvement and used the phrase organized crime and said the details had been in some office archives that had been made available to her shed immediately told john like i said he was the liaison between your father and me and gave him what shed found and she understood hed put them in a safe deposit in citibank alice listened to her own words and decided it was close enough to the truth and sounded a great deal better than her first stumbled attempt what you call a trick you mean my father did some work for gangsters without knowing who or what they were thats what it looked like as soon as i realized the significance i gave it to john without reading it all almost true alice consoled herself a long time ago pressed jane thats what john thought from some other stuff he found and which neither he nor my father told me about but you know all about it alice saw her lifeline and seized it i know about some of it because i was the person who came across it first before i realized the significance i even made a few computer enquiries it could have been embarrassing for the firm thats surely why they didnt tell you until theyd sorted it out the look on janes face on the opposite side of the long table was quizzical but not as openly suspicious as it had been earlier if all this happened a long time ago why are you we hiding now there was an explanation here too i told you before i realized what id come across i made a few computer enquiries they must have picked them up serious organized crime i dont know who they are names i mean but professional certainly how do you know that if you dont have names its what john thought another reason for not telling you not wanting to frighten you what reason would there be for neither my father nor john telling me about this book youre writing the suspicion the disbelief was back i dont know pleading ignorance was all that she could do all that it was safe to do how much have you written none yet i was just collating material alice hoped her face wasnt shiny from the sort of perspiration she could feel on her back you got the material here id like to read it its in new york she had to stop this get away pity id like to have seen it maybe some other time maybe alice thrust up from the table collecting up her plate and mug we should get moving theres a call i need to make two said alice mine first it was time to speak to gene hanlan get everything over with alice was bewildered by what happened how it happened she was conscious of jane behind her as she dialled the federal plaza number but didnt expect the abrupt hand over her shoulder to snatch away the telephone the moment shed finished punching the number by the time that happened alice close enough to hear the answering identification as the fbi herself jane had come from behind to look down at her and alice saw the tension go from janes face my name is jane carver i want the agentincharge and then instantly i want to know your name janes face relaxed even further she said i am all right shes told me who she is a lot of other things there was a pause while she listened and now alice couldnt hear the other end she rose from the desk chair gesturing jane into it it wasnt important who made the contact just that it was made and their being brought in was arranged jane sat alice watched jane said was my father tricked thats what alice says and listened again then was my father murdered my husband janice there was some frowning headshaking at whatever reply hanlan gave jane said only me and then quickly ill call my lawyers to block that so dont try she smiled up at alice and said shes here and handed over the telephone hanlan said what the hells going on you tell me and i mean just that tell me jane had walked away from the desk to be near the outside door but was looking at her intently i told her wed reopened the investigation into the deaths of her father and janice snow but not her husband why to get her in to get you both in we know youre somewhere around bearfort you marked your photographs at princes street someone got there ahead of us they know youre there too theyll be looking were leaving right away dont ill have people at paterson within an hour tell me where you are well come for you four miles out of west milford on the main mountain road its the fourth track unmarked on the left theres a green mailbox the names snelling how long two hours tops hurry two hours whats your telephone number there alice told him and physically sagged with relief as she put down the telephone smiling up at the still expressionless jane theyre on their way all weve got to do is wait how long asked jane echoing alices question two hours west milford is just four miles away we could be there and back in less than an hour there was only one left in your box didnt gene tell you there were people looking for me you any idea of the size of the bearfort range less than an hour please you havent made your call it can wait there was something she could get from a pharmacy too alice thought it was worrying her i dont believe it erupted hanlan i dont fucking believe it what asked ginette smallwood jane carver she doesnt think shes in any danger and when i told her i could get a court order to open her husbands safe deposit she threatened to block me in court i heard what you told her said the woman and had believed it to have been a mistake as the man spoke she said youd better tell washington therell be opposition to cover your ass lets bring them in first ill wait until then before speaking to washington about court orders probably wont even have to after i convince her ive saved her life hanlans irritation deepened when he reached patrick mckinnon on his cellphone to be told that the early morning rush hour had been worse than theyd anticipated and that the fbi team were still at least an hour short of paterson which made west milford nearer two and a half hours away without any allowance for finding the track to the cabin ginette said theyre unpredictable alice certainly better warn them hanlan let the cabin number ring unanswered for five full minutes before slamming the receiver back on the rest he said shit theyve run what the fuck do they think theyre doing the bad guys get them first theyre dead we are too get back to vehicle registration insisted hanlan tell them its become a major emergency ill tell pat which hanlan did and which was how the cavalcante family whod had people using cellphone scanners since the identification of the bearfort area heard for the first time the name jane carver they also heard on hanlans second call the repeated directions to the cabin four miles outside west milford and that alice belling was there too the cavalcante consigliere tony caputo was waiting impatiently for charlie petrie at the topfloor entrance to the elevator in the familyowned office block overlooking the delaware the building was secure enough for caputo to start talking even before they regained his suite by the time they actually reached it petrie knew every detail of the interception hed come all the way from new york because the escalating emergency demanded it but it made him appear like someone at the centre of everything that was happening which was how he wanted to emerge petrie said you did good tony very good caputo who knew very precisely just how well his organization had done said you didnt tell us the fbi were involved because we didnt know admitted petrie it ratcheted up the stakes by at least a per cent there had to be an immediate consiglieri conference as soon as he got back to new york conceivably a full mafia commission gathering attended by as many dons as the capo di tuttii capi decreed it would probably be most of them because most of them had used the northcote laundry at one time or another we get this wrong we got a major nationwide disaster said caputo he was a slightly built compact man who enjoyed the trappings of his unquestioned authority four gold rings to match the gold neckchain and identity bracelet we already knew that before the bureau involvement weve got people closer we should get to the cabin first what do you want we should do when we get them petrie did not respond at once uncomfortable at being the man identifiably making the decisions on behalf of so many just get them away from the cabin and the fbi the carver womans our key literally but how to use her maybe he wouldnt need to if burcher got it right he wouldnt tell the lawyer let him go on as theyd decided that morning what about the other one alice belling weve got to sweat her until she cant be sweated any more to find out what she knows which we think is a hell of a lot weve got to get it all however long it takes and however hard for her it has to be ok accepted caputo and then she gets whacked ordered petrie ok agreed caputo again you want to eat something a drink petrie shook his head i had breakfast twentyfive alice drove as fast as was reasonably possible once they reached the twisting road manoeuvring her wrist familiarly every so often to check the time jane saw the contortion and told her not to worry that they had plenty of time but alice kept doing it even though she knew the other woman was right she got stuck behind a truck which looked similar to the one beneath which john had been crushed and wondered if the same impression had occurred to jane if it had she didnt remark upon it instead as they got closer to west milford jane said i had a stick shift once an mg it was fun ive had this since college its a kind of she hesitated looking for the word a souvenir i guess the volkswagen was the first thing shed bought with her own money after her fathers disgrace and suicide it would have to go along with everything else she supposed would she be able to drive it back to new york probably not shed have to remember to take out the already packed irs and company records printouts of the five mafia firms her overnight case was ready back at the cabin the photograph of john protectively wrapped between two sweaters that was the only souvenir she wanted nothing more jane said you need gas ive got enough to get there and back to the cabin what about back to new york i thought wed probably go in their car it would be a delay if thats not how they plan it irritating i guess youre right agreed jane seeing the shell sign ahead although on the other side of the road she filled up and had to lean back into the car to take cash from her satchel as she got back into the car jane said that bags full of money i left new york in a hurry didnt know at first where i was going what i might need didnt want to use credit cards jane moved as if to say something but didnt alice knew the pharmacy attached to the small supermarket that she and john had used in a mall on the outskirts of the small township as jane paid she said to alice i need to go to the restroom right away ill wait said alice although she didnt shed already isolated the pregnancytesting kits picking the first on the shelf at random and as an afterthought she took up a tube of toothpaste from an adjoining display bought something queried jane when she emerged nodding to the plastic bag in alices hand toothpaste said alice glad she had provided herself with the excuse you know what what jane indicated her own package false alarm just spotting probably everything thats happened thats what i think they walked back out into the car park side by side alice almost automatically checked her watch and jane said weve been gone exactly thirtyfive minutes ok smiled alice thats how she could think now she reassured herself of everything happening and being over in minutes jane said you want to do me a favour let me drive that stick shift i had really was fun its a pretty stiff box still in so much danger it was bizarre standing here in a car park discussing gearboxes come on its only just up the road ok shrugged alice just get everything over thats all she wanted to do just minutes jane couldnt get the car into reverse and ground the gears as she followed alices instructions and the volkswagen shuddered unevenly backwards and then kangarooed forwards when jane selected first gear jane said sorry sorry and got into second and then third much more smoothly she swung easily out on to the mountain road but almost at once at the junction made a left no said alice this isnt the way to the cabin this is the stockholm road i know i saw the sign on the way down which is why ive taken it said jane accelerating eyes fixedly forward were not going back to the cabin not yet anyway i think you and i have got much much more to talk about dont you alice when alice didnt reply jane said when you next speak to gene hanlan you can tell him you were tricked and that now its you whos been kidnapped the fbi spotter plane was disappointing the pilot complained thermal updrafts made it difficult to fly as low as he needed for a satisfactory search which was further hampered by thick forest ground cover over wide tracts of the mountain range neither he nor the observer had seen a single vehicle resembling a volkswagen after two flights hanlan suspended the aerial search but kept the plane on standby it was not until just after nine thirty that hanlan was finally able to relay the licence number and specifications of alices lightgrey vehicle to patrick mckinnon who estimated that they were still thirty minutes short of west milford hanlan duplicated the vehicle details to the relevant highway patrol offices and all police forces in a twentymilewide arc between paterson and west milford he also copied everything to highway patrol and state police headquarters at trenton when mckinnon came back on the line hanlan was telling the northcote firms lawyer geoffrey davis of his conversation with jane carver anxious to discover if she had instructed the man to oppose legal access to the citibank safe deposit which she hadnt hanlan said hed call back they were ahead of us again announced mckinnon they took down the snelling mailbox marker we overshot first time place has been ransacked not as bad as the photographs we saw of litchfield but close any signs of violence blood none there should be forensics though weve driven over their car tracks but there should be something left ill send up the guys we brought back from washington said hanlan theyre due to finish what little was left at litchfield and brooklyn what about the volkswagen nowhere it would be there if theyd been grabbed theyre still running together lets hope youre right said mckinnon what do you want us to do hanlan wished he knew leave a couple of guys to see nothing gets touched make a base in the town ready to move ill put the plane up again hope something comes from the road checks he wished to christ there was something more practical he could do than sit around hoping barbara donnelly said why have they done it maybe its a good job they did said ginette when hanlan recounted his conversation with mckinnon if theyd been there we might have found bodies the forensics team had finished what little was left for them to do because of the initial dismissal of both as accidents the bureau reinvestigation of the deaths of george northcote and janice snow was largely restricted to autopsies although by dismantling the lock of janices apartment as they had in princes street the scientists found unquestionable evidence of the lock having been picked a bureau pathologist at brooklyn also established from the direction of the bonesplintering that it would have been impossible for janice snow to have broken her fingers falling from her supposed hanging the beginning of decomposition made a positive finding difficult but from the detailed medical examination of george northcote it appeared that the multiple lacerations to the face and head wounds which were belatedly discovered to have blinded the man were more likely to have been caused by a blade thinner and sharper than that of the cutting machine into which northcote was alleged to have fallen nothing id like to go into court with but they werent accidents the forensics leader told hanlan what are we looking for in the cabin anything said hanlan exasperated anything at all just make it something i can work from the two mafia consiglieri had been informed of every word exchanged between gene hanlan and patrick mckinnon because the cavalcante searchers in the bearfort mountains were getting perfect scanner reception on mckinnons cellphone it also gave them all the details of alice bellings volkswagen which were duplicated within thirty minutes of hanlan providing them to the highway patrol headquarters at trenton where the cavalcante family had a paid informer in the communications room tony caputo said we cant have missed them by much we still missed them said charlie petrie he needed to stay here in trenton hear at once what was happening but he was desperate to get back to manhattan and convene a conference with the other new york families it was obvious what had to be done with the belling woman but how what pressure could they use to get carvers wife to retrieve what was in the safedeposit vault we wont next time promised the cavalcante lawyer we got everyone out there waiting weve got to move quicker than that insisted petrie there was only one way he could think of and he had to know if it had already been set up when stanley burcher immediately answered his algonquin telephone petrie knew that it hadnt you spoken to northcotes lawyers petrie demanded im still working it out whats to work out ive got to have every answer ready because theyre going to have a lot of questions said the intermediary lawyer the tiredness he felt from a long day had nothing to do with the am breakfast meeting all hed done since then was sit in his hotel room trying but failing to evolve an approach that would not bring him into direct identifiable contact with the northcote firms attorney who had been pointed out to him at the plaza hotel stan heres what youre going to do youre going to call the guy right now this minute you got to get whatevers in that fucking bank you do that and youre going to be a rich and happy man for the rest of your life he was already a rich man burcher reminded himself and what sort of life would he have if he didnt get what carver had copied he could always run burcher told himself it wasnt that hed neglected the possible need for an escape route alice tried at the beginning once briefly breaking down in tears although of frustration not collapse and then in annoyance that shed broken down at all but was finally silenced by janes total refusal to respond or acknowledge alices every insistence upon their physical danger up to and including murder with tortured interrogation in between for almost an hour jane refused to stop despite alices whimpering need for a restroom and by midafternoon they were way beyond the patersonwest milford arc that hanlan had stipulated for his road watch janes eventual halt was at a truck stop like an oasis in reverse among the verdant pines and firs a scouredbald dust bowl of petrol and diesel pumps bordering the road and a stinking cockroachinfested block of excretablocked toilets the stink of which made alices vomiting worse no water came from the taps when she tried to rinse her mouth or wash her hands it was a further hour close to four in the afternoon before jane pulled into another truck stop although at this one an intermittently deadbulbed sign boasted of a payinadvance cashonly motel at its rear your treat jane announced time to make those calls the motel was a singlestorey prefabrication of paintstripped cabins theirs a boxed twinbedded room with opaquely thin curtains and opaquely thin grey sheets beneath candlewick spreads both were patterned by long ago stains mostly brown although sometimes black to match those on the threadbare frayed carpeting the one chair sagged out of any shape its back black from the grease of a thousand unwashed heads the bulb was missing over the processedwood bureau the mirror of which was whorled with verdigris there was a urine smell from the opendoored cockroachscuttling bathroom alice said im not going to stay here this is disgusting jane said youll stay because i say so because this is just the place for us to talk about the things we have to talk about and where no one in their wildest dreams would think of looking for us finding us im protecting you now alice jane turned dismissively away concentrating upon the number she was dialling instinctively smiling at the immediate connection but at once frowning impatiently talking over the babble from the other end the moment she identified herself i know i know ive spoken to him i know im all right rosemary stop talking rosemary listen she looked at alice when the sound stopped from the other end of the line do you mind alice didnt immediately understand and when she did looked uncertainly around the cramped room there was a black scurry underfoot when she went into the bathroom and alice halted just inside the door it was very thin and although alice didnt hear everything she heard enough to understand jane was pregnant what other reason was there for a woman to speak this long with her gynaecologist twentysix john loved me very much alice said nothing jane being pregnant didnt change anything it wasnt something theyd ever talked about it would have been out of bounds but of course john had made love to her it was understood accepted without needing to be said and i loved him very much she was smiling as shed been smiling when shed called alice from the bathroom after her conversation with rosemary pritchard still alice said nothing what would her test show she was anxious but at the same time reluctant to find out surely she had to be what other reason was there for her being so sick so often i saw the photograph the one you tried to hide in the cabin i saw it by the telephone and found where youd hidden it when you were in the bath there was no anger in the flat tone alice finally sat on the collapsing hairgreased chair i know john loved you your marriage was never in any danger thats very generous of you what did you and he do just fuck alice winced can i try to explain i want you to i want very much to have it explained to me all of it i loved john too and he loved you there was a jeer in janes voice yes jane made a balancing gesture with both hands so thats how it was he loved us both fiftyfifty yes i guess but you were his wife would always have been his wife and you would have always been his mistress for as long as he wanted me or until he didnt want me any more that would never have happened tell me you talked about it we did he told me he would never leave you because he loved you and i said i didnt want or expect him to im supposed to believe that its the truth how often once a week twice a week all the time when i was out of town she had the right alice accepted although she didnt feel there was anything to defend herself against we were happy how about the cabin how often did you sneak away to the cabin janes face was set rigid everything shed told jane was the truth there was no guilt just three times the photograph you saw was the first it was back at the cabin packed in her case she abruptly realized whatever happened she had to go back to the cabin to get it jane jerked her head towards the telephone upon which shed made two further calls after that to the gynaecologist did he tell you why we were seeing rosemary alice shook her head i didnt know you were something he didnt actually tell you it was weak sarcasm no we were going to have a baby alice felt a physical lurch at the confirmation but didnt speak how do you feel about that it will be wonderful stumbled alice john would have you will be a wonderful parent the rigid face creased slightly then cleared it wouldnt have made any difference if john was still alive youd have gone on sleeping together yes said alice at once holding the other womans look im not ashamed i know its difficult for you to believe i guess you never will but i was never a threat to you and ive tried to save you literally save your life because you dont know how bad things are she knew that geoffrey davis whom jane had told in another of her calls to block any legal move against johns bank was the firms lawyer presumably burt whose surname jane had never used and to whom shed repeated the blocking instructions was the personal attorney youre right said jane i dont know so tell me about that too all of it because i cant be hurt or betrayed any more any worse than i already have been but she was her face twisting as if she were in genuine pain when alice told her everything alice held nothing back but conscious of janes stricken look said at the end i dont believe john didnt believe that your father did it willingly in the beginning john was sure he was tricked cheated and from then on was blackmailed into carrying on and john tried to face them down believing as he did that dad and janice had been murdered he still tried to face them down yes said alice knowing the other womans need thats how brave john was but he told you not me remembered jane strongervoiced how could he have told you pleaded alice i didnt believe you not any of it before i actually thought you might be mad although i didnt think you were going to harm me but i believe you now all of it jane stopped her voice catching i cried for dad but i didnt cry for john not properly the drugs and now i dont think i can cry for either of them she did though so suddenly that alice jumped at the wail and came forward in her ugly chair watching helplessly as the sobs racked through jane as they had racked through her and finally alice got up and went to the other woman at the first touch jane stiffened and went to pull away but didnt and then she let herself come into alices embracing arm and alice began crying too and both women sat on the hard bed holding each other both weeping for the same man initially there was an embarrassment at their holding each other supporting each other a few moments once they recovered and stopped crying of moving awkwardly around the room neither knowing what to say how to say it so neither at first said anything alice broke the impasse theyll say i kidnapped you you did they both sniggered a laugh although still awkwardly alice said dont hate me jane said i dont know what to feel how to feel right now i dont feel anything about anyone i dont think i know how to hate we both loved john he loved both of us i dont know what to say to that either i dont understand it maybe i never will thats how it is alice insisted wishing it hadnt sounded so flip i suppose i know thats how it was i still dont understand it do you understand accept that we could both be killed if we dont get protection i suppose so jane you cant suppose so you know so surely i jane began then corrected herself yes i know she had to get back to the cabin get johns picture remembered alice why did you drive away like that i told you i didnt believe what you were saying thought you were mad these days have been mad i dont know why i did it at that moment i just did i dont like being manipulated everyone was manipulating me telling me what to do what pills to take like i was a child weve got to go back get safe they can come for us here there are things i want only one thing the thing she couldnt do wouldnt do without her only physical tangible memory we drove for hours i dont even know where the hell we are well go back tomorrow you want to stay here no one knows were here thats what you said its filthy disgusting said jane no one knows were here repeated alice no one would expect us to be in a place like this so no one will look for us in a place like this jane looked around the stained nightdarkening room no no one would she agreed and sniggered again this time in headshaking disbelief tomorrow prompted alice to what after that i dont know admitted alice some sort of life they were still vaguely redeyed but theyd washed their faces and combed their hair and touched up their lipstick which was the only makeup either carried in their bags they were the instant focus of the truckers in the suddenly hushed adjoining diner and to avoid it they took a booth and shrugged off the two direct leering approaches to their table when the waitress with drooping breasts who clearly regarded them as competition tried to deliver two unordered whiskies from a third hopeful alice said take them back and say thanks my friend and i dont need anyone else but each other ok theyll want to save you from yourselves predicted the waitress relieved tell them to go fuck themselves its fun said alice jane looked down to cover the smile as the girl left jane said you know your way around this sort of place i go to the movies a lot you would i suppose with time on your hands jane youre allowed any sort of shot you want i cant think of anything more to say than ive already said lets just get through tonight tomorrow until we get back to where theyre waiting then youll never have to see me ever again itll ruin the firm wont it suddenly demanded jane ruin my fathers reputation thats what both of them dad and john were trying to prevent thats what you said i know what i said acknowledged alice concerned at the conversation i also told you john was convinced your father was murdered and janice theres no way other than going to the bureau we should call them we should agreed alice relaxing not now not right away i want to think jane there really is nothing to think about later insisted the woman the now friendly waitress returned with iced water and place settings she said i got nothing against guys like you ok thanks said alice the woman said take the meat loaf its fresh i wouldnt risk anything else ill have meat loaf said alice as jane nodded acceptance too she said john didnt like meat loaf which was why shed never made it for him remembered alice when demanded gene hanlan two or three hours ago admitted geoffrey davis two or three hours what the hell things happened said the northcote lawyer maybe it wasnt even two or three hours shes under threat stopped hanlan serious physical threat people got to the cabin where she was before us wrecked it like they wrecked litchfield we dont get her soon like immediately shes dead so where is she she didnt say for fucks sake hear me out i dont want to hear you out i want you to hear me out youre a lawyer doesnt matter criminal or civil you know what im saying weve got a bigtime major investigation here we lose getting jane back lose jane im going to charge you with wilful obstruction of justice and anything else i can think of and im going to recommend the bureau move for your disbarment you hear what im saying there was a pause from the other end before davis said calmly now youre going to hear what im saying what shes instructed me to file against any bureau application for access to john carvers estate or private affairs she told me she would do that shes instructed the family lawyer burt elliott too im still listening i had another call continued davis guy said he was a lawyer representing clients for whom george northcote worked exclusively but to whom john had written severance letters i asked around among the partners no one knew anything about it you got names interrupted hanlan anxiously i finally asked hilda bennett johns pa she wrote the letters and kept file copies obviously weve got the names of all five all registered in grand cayman it was doing that which took the time whos the guy who called wouldnt give a name told me id understand when we met when ten thirty tomorrow morning i put it back until then because i thought youd want to know be here waiting hanlan didnt respond for several moments i think i owe you an apology yes said davis i think you do it was late past nine before charlie pedtrie got back from trenton believing he had made all the arrangements possible with the cavalcante consigliere and anxious to meet those of the other four new york families within the hour but stanley burcher had to come first there had been telephone conversations with the other consiglieri from trenton and none of them were happy with what petrie was going to order but no one had been able to come up with an alternative that was better to get back what was in citibank the slight selfeffacing lawyer was waiting patiently in the familiar algonquin lounge the brandy snifter beside the coffee the only thing out of the ordinary for this most ordinarylooking of men petrie ordered brandy for himself needing it and said well fixed for tomorrow morning burcher was frightened of too many things to know precisely about what of the man sitting opposite and what the people he represented could and would do to him also for the first time in his life of openly putting himself forward as an emissary of such people the urge to run to escape from them and from what might happen to him had grown since hed spoken to the northcote lawyer until now it was a knot something he could feel deep inside him why couldnt you go today demanded petrie he couldnt make today im approaching him remember petrie hesitated he didnt want to frighten further the obviously already frightened man but it would be ridiculous sending him in unprepared he said theres a complication what demanded burcher brandy bowl suspended in front of him alice belling somehow snatched jane carver got the carver woman to go with her i dont know how theyre together somewhere in the catskills for several moments burchers mind refused to assimilate what he was being told and what the consequences were then he said but theres no point no purpose in my seeing the northcote lawyer even if he accepted my argument about returning property no longer theirs to keep jane carver is the only person who could legally get it out of her husbands personal deposit box i want you to make the meeting insisted petrie weve got to be ready i dont understand we didnt know there was a relationship between the two women said petrie there obviously is and they obviously know whats in the box the fbi are looking for them but for kidnap according to conversations weve intercepted weve got some inside tracks were going to end this thelma and louise shit by tomorrow maybe even tonight we know the car theyre driving the plate number even we get them we hold alice while jane cooperates meets the lawyer youre going to meet and gets our stuff back what about the fbi alice belling is our insurance the fbi dont get told by anyone that janes back until weve got our stuff when weve got that all the feds have is a kidnap thats nothing to do with us no proof of anything else whats alice belling going to tell them nothing said petrie alice belling isnt going to tell anyone anything she wont be able to neither will jane carver after shes done what shes told it was madness burcher decided he didnt want to get involved in madness neither of them undressed nor got beneath the covers reluctant to have the sheets anywhere around them both spread their jackets over their pillows to keep their faces away from the physical contact and there wasnt much talk after the near argument that erupted when theyd got back to the cabin alice now demanding that they go at once against janes insistence that they were staying i need time to think to think about everything was janes repeated refusal please jane weve had this conversation the morning will be soon enough im the one with the car keys remember now in the darkness alices feelings switchbacked again there was she conceded a peculiar womblike comfort in being in a place even as disgusting as this instead of outside in the unknown blackness of the night hunted by the law and the lawless the morning would be soon enough and she was exhausted not just from this day but from all the days how many days that had gone before in a surprising selfrevelation alice admitted to herself that she was content for jane to make the decisions for the moment at least maybe even that jane was the stronger more forceful personality there was only one thing she wanted to do now was determined to do now and tired though she was she was going to do it now although she was sure she already knew she wanted to feel the excitement the euphoria and to be equal with jane the question intruded abruptly surprising alice that was a jealous question and she wasnt jealous of jane alice lay for a long time waiting for jane to go to sleep before telling herself there was no need for jane to be asleep why shouldnt jane be awake when she went to the bathroom alice didnt put the bedroom light on though feeling her way to where she knew the door to be closing and bolting it behind her there was more black scurrying when she turned the bathroom light on and she flinched away shuddering shed never imagined such filthy places existed were allowed to exist by sanitation authorities not much longer just a few hours the booklet instructions were very simple illustrated even and there was a specimen cup the need for which was obvious but which she had difficulty filling so she had thoroughly to wash her contaminated hands afterwards alices fingers were shaking as she immersed the doublewindowed absorbent tester tube brown for no blue for yes the blue was very bright much brighter than shed expected and at once she thought of the symbolism and thought how fitting how right it would be if johns baby was a son the heir he would have wanted alice flushed away what could be dispersed and returned what couldnt to the pharmacy bag and carefully carried it back into the darkened room to put beneath her jacket on the pillow and then even more carefully lay on her back with her arms wrapped around herself low and protectively around herself because she had so much to protect now she was going to have johns baby johns own real biological baby to take with her to love and to guard and to raise to be the most perfect child there was ever likely to be and whom one day shed tell all there was to tell about its most perfect father alice became aware of janes heavy breathing from the adjoining bed reminding her of her concern at janes delaying insistences jane was going to do something stupid try to protect her fathers name and johns name and the northcote firms future and risk ending up dead and not just risk herself her baby now she couldnt risk ending up dead alice told herself she wasnt simply saving herself any more either she had to save protect forever the baby she was having by john shed done all that she could all that was humanly possible to help jane protect jane from now on jane was on her own whatever jane announced tomorrow didnt matter because she wouldnt be part of it part of anything she had to go with the best she had some criminally incriminating printouts and bargain as best she could and she had a satchel full of money more than sufficient to pay for a cab or a hire car from here wherever here was back to manhattan if jane insisted upon taking the volkswagen to which she was welcome as she was welcome to whatever else alice had more than shed ever wanted ever dreamed of she thought she felt a movement although she knew it was far too early but she smiled enjoying the phantom sensation what name would john have wanted that was very important to get right the name that john might have wanted everything was important getting it right for john since the case began being taken seriously gene hanlan had slept in a messroom cot at federal plaza barbara donnelly behind an inadequate separating screen which was totally unimportant to both all thoughts of gender discarded the advantage was that they were both together able to move at once after geoffrey davis made his call the now permanently assigned bureau plane ferried duplicate originals of the documents on the five companies for the financial directorate to investigate and returned to manhattan with additional agents because at last there was a positive development within nypd jurisdiction barbara donnelly and her team shared in every aspect of the planning together the two of them personally toured the northcote building on wall street with davis their guide ending totally satisfied that once the mystery emissary crossed the threshold escape would be impossible davis provided complete plans of the premises from which hanlan and barbara jointly briefed their combined squads and by midnight additional cctv and audio equipment had been installed and tested in daviss office where the meeting was to take place barbara said scotch was fine which was fortunate because that was all hanlan had in his office at that time of night he touched barbaras glass and said at last something positive this time tomorrow were going to be properly in charge of the whole damned thing the first edition of the following mornings new york daily news hit the streets around am the front page was dominated by a stock photograph of jane carver and the headline used the word kidnapped there were also references to unnamed mafia families and organized crime and to a mystery woman inevitably described as beautiful who was identified as the intermediary who initiated the kidnap just as inevitably she was called the mafia madam there were individual sidebar stories of all three deaths now under fbi reinvestigation an anonymous police spokesman predicted the biggest mafia sensation of the decade where the fuck exploded hanlan hurling the newspaper away from him we did well to cover it for so long said barbara donnelly philosophically and where did it get us demanded hanlan nowhere which is where we still are nofuckingwhere twentyseven they were awake early neither having properly slept alice said hi and jane made a sound and there was the awkwardness of the previous night after theyd both broken down and cried together alice needed to be sick and had to use her toothpastesmeared finger to clean her teeth and her mouth afterwards turning from the basin she trod barefoot on a cockroach which wasnt crushed but whirled underfoot and in jerking away alice hit her stomach without any real force against the sink edge tensing motionless for an internal injury pain that never came she had to learn alice thought happily so very much to learn the awareness stayed she had to learn how to be a mother to be a mother it was going to be so marvellous as she went back into the room alice said i left you the toothpaste youll have to use your finger the waters only tepid even if youre thinking of showering which i wasnt and didnt jane made another sound that alice didnt make out to be a word she was ready the moment jane disappeared into the bathroom letting herself out of the cabin to hurry to a parkinglot garbage can that had been overturned during the night by a forest scavenger strewing its contents all around it she very carefully threw the pharmacy sack holding the brightblue proof of her pregnancy inside the upturned container it was a grey day relentless rain soaking down from lowering clouds everywhere was deserted unmoving alice could hear the wetness hissing against the surrounding trees she was anxious to get away now that it was light away to a new existence just her and john jr the name was instantly adhesive absolutely right she got back to the cabin before jane emerged from the bathroom but when she did jane said at once youre wet where have you been i thought id check the car its raining i guess thats why youre wet and hows the car the tone was mocking ok alice hoped the car really was intact were going to call the fbi i thought you wanted to go back to the cabin i want to get us safe she had a baby now thought alice something someone far more precious and tangible than a photograph she didnt want to bounce for hours in a hardsprung car back up a twisting mountain road shed ask the bureau to get her case their son should know what his father looked like she didnt know how to fish shed have to learn if she were going to teach him so much to learn im not sure i want to go in yet announced jane i am insisted alice im through running i want lawyers guarantees we can get lawyers when were there where no one can get to us jane was being sensible objective alice acknowledged but she didnt want to wait any longer risk anything further im not talking about you im talking about my father and my husband and the firm and me listed jane youve got lawyers you spoke to them yesterday yesterday we hadnt talked completely i didnt know what i know now you know now you could be killed will be killed im going to take proper advice go in to the fbi with lawyers not bareassed naked what about the baby demanded alice openly for the first time youve got the she only just stopped short of calling it a boy baby to think about now jane matched the hesitation before saying its the baby im properly thinking about im going in now there was another hesitation from jane i already told you youre not involved i understand said alice slowly who belatedly did was there enough in the printouts to get her into a protection programme to get an amnesty or whatever the word was for the deaths of three innocent people in england or did she really need jane and whatever else it was john had hidden i could have gone in a long time ago i stayed out to save you for john im grateful thanks the mocking tone was still there jane had the right alice told herself yet again im going to call hanlan to come here and get me ok you want a head start to find somewhere to meet your people you can have the car i guess i dont need it any more just some things that are in the trunk for you john everythings for you and our son jane carver stood regarding alice for several moments ok but id rather you stayed with me that we went in together im looking after myself now its about time everything i told you was the truth about john and you you keep telling me said jane i want you to understand i do finally i understand it all you do hate me dont you i m learning im sorry that you hate me i mean and that youre not waiting for them to come and get us you want to get your stuff out of the car you dont have any money said alice going into her satchel youll need money her hand came out clutching fifties six of them three hundred accepted jane its a loan alice said you think were ever likely to meet again ill get it to you they walked unspeaking through the drizzle to the back of the singlestorey building jane started the engine and ran the wipers before popping the bonnet trunk for alice to retrieve the canvas bag in which shed packed the printouts despite the rain alice didnt move at once watching the volkswagen disappear knowing it would be the last shed ever see of it the beginning of her new life she guessed everything of the old discarded abandoned alice went back to the room and shook as much rain off her coat as she could and dialled reception impatiently waiting what seemed an age for a reply she thought she recognized the voice of the man who had booked them in the previous day before she could speak he said you owe for telephone calls and alice wondered how much he had listened in to the conversations she said im coming to settle i need some help i think we got a little confused on the map yesterday where exactly are we here the man laughed just two miles east of long valley new jersey alice had never heard of it wheres the nearest town of any size that would be morristown ill be by in a minute to settle the charges just one more call to make ill be in the office where the hell are you two exploded hanlan the moment alice was connected in a truckstop motel two miles east of a place called long valley new jersey i dont whyd you run come and get me ill explain everything when you take me in there was a pause of half awareness wheres jane gone she wont come in without her lawyers mary mother of christ moaned hanlan who wasnt catholic whats the matter everythings blown in all the newspapers on every television channel her pictures everywhere what about mine name the pictures bad janes got my car its i know what it is and i know the license im frightened they do too they there was a deja vu about the question they got to the cabin before we did yesterday how howd they know i dont know well find her in your car you just stay like you wanted me to stay in the cabin yesterday where i would have been trapped when they got there before you go kiss my ass gene ill make my own way in so no one knows where im coming from wait tried hanlan but alice didnt she stayed in the room until the man called from the desk to say the taxi shed ordered had arrived and managed to remain expressionless looking at the photograph of jane carver that filled the tv screen behind the man as she paid the telephone bill the one of her was bad a blurred thumbnail from a feature shed written more than a year before there was a stills photograph of her vintage volkswagen too the sound was mute preventing her hearing the commentary you guys have a fight asked the man who definitely was the one who had booked them in kind of guess its difficult sometimes stop by the next time youre passing you hear bet on it promised alice jane carver did finally understand and believed she had everything thought out and balanced in her mind although leaving the filthy motel and alice belling like that hadnt been part of her overnight mental preparation it was a spurofthemoment gesture like hijacking the car the previous day irrational without any positive intention but she had one now spurofthemoment or not driving without particular direction back along the still deserted rainslicked road that had to be the way theyd come but along which so far she hadnt recognized any landmarks she had to have burt elliott and geoffrey davis with her when she met the fbi needed them with her before meeting the fbi to talk everything through maybe discuss it with other more specialized attorneys certainly go through in detail whatever it was john had hidden to assess its importance no not its importance its potential illegality thats what had to be examined and assessed how much and how badly it implicated her father and john and the firm to protect and save them as much as she could a logging truck growled by in the opposite direction spraying water and mud all over the volkswagen and the splash of it startled jane as if waking her up why she suddenly demanded of herself there was every practical reason for trying to spare the firm where according to alice none of the partners had known what was going on but what did she owe her father or john they were the two men whom shed totally loved and totally trusted and whom shed believed loved and trusted her in return the two men these two strangers whom she now accepted shed known not at all so why was she worrying about protecting them and their reputations she asked herself again shouldnt she hate and despise them like she should hate and despise alice belling for all their total deceits and all their total betrayals how did you hate was it a feeling a physical sensation like a pain or an ache or a mental determination to hurt back to cause as much pain and suffering as they caused you an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth jane didnt know didnt think she wanted to know or did she what did she want the memory she supposed as many memories as she could conjure and keep abruptly jane confronted the hardest most scourging reality of all john had loved another woman been happy with another woman shared everything more than with her with another woman had he done with alice belling the special bedroom things hed done with her practised with alice belling learned from her even was it as alice belling had tried to convince her a bizarrely unthreatening menage a trois of which she was always intended to remain the unwitting third part or would jane didnt let the question run because she wasnt unwitting any more a lot of questions she couldnt answer but a lot more that she could most important of all she knew how important she was to alices protection as alice had been to hers into her mind unprompted echoed her own voice its the baby im properly thinking about but she wasnt not thinking properly at all jane waited for a widening of the still empty early morning road to swing around into an almost complete u only needing to reverse once which she managed easily without any grating of the gears very soon the traffic began picking up against her although she wasnt held up by slowmoving trucks like yesterday jane hoped she would get back to the motel before the fbi persuade alice to come with her until shed got hold of attorneys that would be the way convince alice she needed the help and protection of lawyers more than that of the fbi because of what had happened in england it had been ridiculous reacting as she had for the second time in less than twentyfour hours without fully thinking everything through she didnt any longer have the excuse of drugs no excuse at all she was on her own unsupported she needed the professional advice of lawyers certainly but hers had to be the decision how to use that advice like it was her decision to go back as she was now nothing to do with hate for what alice had done or gratitude for what alice had done it was simply how it had to be what was right this time jane didnt bother to conceal the car behind the motel parking in fact in front of the overturned garbagestrewn bin in which alice had thrown her pharmacy bag she strode directly past without seeing it come to make up greeted the clerk she should still be here insisted jane irritated with the mans streetwise pretence she was being collected jane suddenly saw her own face on a silent television screen behind the man and then a picture of the sort of volkswagen parked out in the lot and an unflattering virtually unrecognizable picture of alice dont know about that said the man asked me to call her a cab picked her up about fifteen minutes ago jane felt numb as shed remembered feeling when they were pumping all the drugs into her you know where shes going she asked grateful for the steadiness of her own voice the clerk shook his head didnt say morristown probably she asked about the nearest town of any size how do i get to morristown make a right as you leave here left at the first junction straight run from there thanks said jane already turning away hey stopped the man dont i know you from somewhere jane shook her head without looking back ive got the sort of face people think theyve seen before jane left the truck stop too fast sounding the tyre on the wet road with her too sharp turn and cutting back at once alices change of mind about waiting for the fbi had to do with whatever the mute newscast had been reporting what it didnt matter everything was different now she was identified her face on television screens marked most marked of all by the car she was driving driving where wherever morristown was where she could dump the car hide somewhere another motel or hotel she supposed and call someone to come and get her like alice had been so desperate for the fbi to come to get her burt elliott or geoffrey davis whoever she could reach the quicker shed be able to watch a newscast in an hotel maybe understand better she needed a restroom not desperately but she needed one she could wait until shed dumped the identifying volkswagen definitely a restroom would be necessary before she called the lawyers thered be mirrors there too jane saw the morristown turn at the junction and took it without screaming the tyres this time there were a lot more cars on the road and she was glad of the grey concealing drizzle and hoped it and the mud from that earlier passing lumber truck would have hidden the colour of the car maybe covered the plates which had been printed alongside the tv picture a positive description she decided surely the fbi hadnt issued a kidnap alert after what shed told gene hanlan but they hadnt waited at the cabin no reason then why he should have believed her obviously thought she was talking under duress along with everyone else shed spoken with the town began to build up ahead of her a place planned with care with trees alongside the approach roads and some parks to her immediate right the rushhour traffic was really heavy now slowing her and there were people on the sidewalk she needed a parking lot filling up with other cars where she could lose the volkswagen she came to a junction and stopped behind a black buick a set of lights against them and looked to her left there was a marriott two blocks down but before that a far closer police blue and white at the side of the road the driver turned away from her talking to the observer who was directly facing her jane jerked her head around in the opposite direction her concentration entirely upon the lights still at red come on come on she was ready to go at amber but the buick didnt move even at green she held back from using the horn nervous of attracting attention come on for gods sake move it did at last jane too close behind swerving out at the first gap to get by eyes more on the rearview mirror than the road ahead nothing she let out the pentup breath feeling more relief at the mall to her right the kmart and jc penny and safeway neons blinking invitingly at her the car park already more than half full the buildup greater conveniently close to the stores jane found the perfect gap between a highsided uhaul van and a station wagon a separating wall in front of her concealing the vehicle from three directions she went into the complex through the jc penny entrance remembering to keep her head down and found the toilets on the ground floor she chose the washbasin in the corner with a wall to her right and felt more relief at how she looked she remembered the photograph that had been shown on tv being taken in a professionally lighted studio her makeup and hair longer then than it was now flawless for a portrait for her fathers sixtieth birthday she was sure she didnt now look anything like she did in the photograph what was visible in the mirror of her borrowed shirt and jacket really did look as if it had been slept in and her hair was squashed under alices woollen cap her face was shiny without even lipstick and jane decided that all she needed was a stolen supermarket trolley to be the perfect bag lady good for moving around a crowded store she hoped it wasnt so baglady convincing as to get her refused refuge at the marriott shed isolated a little more than two blocks away she had alices flash deposit if a problem arose the telephone bank was open pods but there was no one else in the line it had to be her own name for the collect call but the operator gave no audible reaction to it although there was from the switchboard girl who immediately accepted at the northcote building on wall street is that you mrs carver get me geoff davis right away said jane its me and im ok where are you demanded the northcote lawyer whats happening the fbi be quiet just listen halted jane listen ok there was still no other caller anywhere along the line of telephones jane talked as quickly as she could while remaining comprehensible she insisted she was physically all right and gave davis the name of the town and said she was going to book into a marriott and wait for him shed call with the address within fifteen minutes he and burt elliott were to get to her as fast as possible hilda bennett had the name of a helicopter company the fbi are here declared davis when jane finally stopped breathless why someones coming about some companies your father handled dont cooperate not yet jane i dont have a choice weve got to talk first the firm could be in trouble all right the lawyer placated her emptily ill come to get you call me from the marriott wheres alice belling not with me any more lets stop talking and get moving i want you and burt here now jane retraced her steps to leave by the same door through which shed entered she was still in the approach corridor when she saw the police car its lamp bar still flashing blocking the volkswagen in its space the highway patrol car doubling the barricade as she watched two more police cars their lights flashing too swept into the lot jane hurried back inside but at once cut left for the next exit guessing the reinforcements were to close the store search it certainly she emerged directly out on to the street without being stopped without seeing a policeman even although she could hear a faraway siren jane kept walking using the crossing further to distance herself from the car park before turning to go back towards the junction where shed first seen the policemen who had obviously seen her or rather the volkswagen and its plate number after all the marriott could only be yards after she took a right at the junction the darksuited man seemed to come out of the rear of the mercedes with the same movement of the door opening completely blocking her path the blow low in her stomach was not hard but professionally expert winding her preventing any protesting shout and doubling her up at the same time so that she was easily thrust into the car with the man tight behind virtually lifting her the mercedes was at the lights before jane could straighten tony caputo the cavalcante consigliere looked back from the front seat and said if you try to scream now youve got your breath back well cut off your tongue mrs carver not completely just about half an inch from its tip youll still be able to speak but youll sound like a retard youre not going to scream are you mrs carver no said jane he wont show declared barbara donnelly we all know he wont show he shows hes pussyface of this or any other year and i didnt think we were dealing with pussies hanlan hadnt heard pussyface before he liked it he said we gotta go with it everything as planned its all weve got they were in the cctv viewing room of the northcote building the fbi installations doubling the number of cameras and monitors the lobby reception staff were doubled too the additions all police the elevators were staffed which they werent normally both with fbi agents there were fbi and police in every office on the floor on which the nervously waiting geoffrey davis had his office with philosophical acceptance hanlan said ok whats our recovery going to be what makes you think theres going to be one thanks for that great encouragement tell lies spread lies suggested the woman lure them out of their dark places my people will never go with it rejected hanlan their escape is entrapment my people will insisted barbara whod lit a cigarette without protest the prosecutions yours federal nypd isnt federal you dont entrap anyone you even say you dont your spokesperson says youve no idea what the claim is all about that puts us not cooperating we dont most times everyone knows that so whats your entrapment defection from a major new york family thats using the daily news invention the investigations concentrated on certain specified companies which it is they wont know who the defector is but mentioning companies will convince them there is one we dont get some playback whispers life aint fair it was your leak to the daily news accused hanlan i could be offended by a question like that are you it could rattle the cages we got two women out there one miscalculation and theyre dead bigtime advantage of the idea argued barbara our family or families think theres an internal source it deflects the attention from jane and alice diffuses it too maybe even redirects resources although i think thats being optimistic youve really thought this through havent you it was better than anything that had occurred to him since the two women had run talking as the ideas come to me insisted barbara donnelly straightfaced they both turned as the door burst open davis said ive just spoken to jane i know where she is before anyone could speak the telephone rang and the lawyer said thatll be her with the address of her hotel but it wasnt when hanlan took the call from federal plaza ginette smallwood said alice bellings just walked in says shes got things for us charlie petries first call to the algonquin was just after nine directly after hearing from caputo that their highway patrol source had come good with the location of the volkswagen and that theyd picked up jane carver and were on their way into manhattan there was no way that stanley burcher would have already left for his meeting with the northcote lawyer that early petrie kept calling every five minutes right up to ten oclock finally slamming the receiver down and saying aloud where the fuck are you stanley at that precise moment in fact stanley burcher was getting off the early new york shuttle to washingtons reagan airport hurrying directly for a cab for dulles airport and his already booked flight to geneva he believed it to have been an elementary precaution to make his escape with such a dogsleg detour just in case petrie suspected he was running and rushed people out to new yorks kennedy terminals to intercept him it was of course unlikely because another precaution had been to leave the algonquin without paying his bill so that callers would be told he was still a resident there burcher had always been a man to take elementary precautions which was why his recent and direct involvement in the northcote business had been so unsettling it had been an elementary precaution years before to obtain a legitimate caymanian passport in the anonymous name of william smith the identity he was now adopting and in which his flight to switzerland was booked another had been even earlier to open a numbered bank account in geneva and regularly transfer his mafia fees into it from his equally untraceable grand cayman account burcher was sure he was going to enjoy his swiss retirement the swiss understood the attraction and the benefits of anonymity twentyeight where is she alice wheres jane demanded hanlan i dont know alice youre in more trouble than you can shake a stick at working from kidnapping down took up barbara donnelly shed come back to federal plaza with hanlan leaving their squads in place after waiting fortyfive minutes beyond the given time for geoffrey daviss unappearing mystery visitor and for jane carvers promised second call which never came throughout that time hanlan had remained constantly on the telephone from the northcote building confirming the finding of the volkswagen but not of jane at morristown and moving mckinnons squad there from west milford he sent with them the fbi forensics team which had completed their examination of the cabin despite its trashing theyd found nothing i told you we split up this morning at the motel she said she wasnt seeing the fbi without her lawyers with her and drove off the way wed come alice was confused by their combined aggression which started with hanlan pedantically advising her of her miranda rights against selfincrimination hanlan acknowledged that fitted with what hed been told by both davis and burt elliott to whom hed also spoken from the northcote building the way you came from west milford doesnt go through morristown which was where your car was found alice shook her head i dont know how it got there i want to tell you what i do know finding jane carvers the priority said barbara find her lawyers its geoffrey davis at the firm theres another named burt i dont know his surname she spoke to both from the motel she spoke to davis from morristown too said hanlan i dont know how she got there what she was doing there how about you took her there challenged barbara we split up she took the car whyd you run from the cabin jane tricked me into running her into town persuaded me into letting her drive back but then took off she hesitated it was all going to come out so there was no point in avoiding it she wanted me to tell her about john and i about what i knew about the firm and the mafia id told her bits but tried to keep some back it didnt make sense i guess was she making any better sense now it didnt seem like it from the attitude of these two in the cramped interview room with the tape machine with its blinking light recording everything please she said urgently let me tell you what its about hanlan looked at barbara in whose manhattan jurisdiction the kidnap had occurred even though it was ultimately a federal crime she shrugged he said to alice ok from the beginning which was how alice told it from her first visit to wall street to interview george northcote she held nothing back about her affair with carver even repeating to barbara donnellys visible scepticism that she was never a threat to the carver marriage alice expected some interjections when she began talking of johns initial discovery of northcotes organizedcrime connection and of northcotes insistence that he could extricate himself but none came and then i got involved declared alice and stopped no way back if she continued talking it was commitment time and she didnt have a lawyer to advise her and shed been read her miranda rights making what she said admissible in court or before a grand jury and from this moment on shed be at the mercy of these unsympathetic investigators if she said anything more or at the mercy of gangsters who didnt know mercy if she said anything less go on encouraged hanlan i found out how it worked insisted alice i did it illegally and i know ive committed criminal offences technically kidnap even although it wasnt but everything i did was to understand and try to sort out what happened to george and janice and then to john i want to cooperate in every way and i want to be taken into the witness protection programme because if im not i know as you know that ill be killed lets hear the story and then well talk about witness protection said hanlan shed jerked him around made him look ridiculous and he didnt intend offering anything until he was as positive as it was possible to be that she wasnt holding out on him not by so much as a single crumb alice eased the canvas bag up from her lap and tentatively put it on the desk between them initially unspeaking she unpacked all the duplicate printouts shed assembled at the cabin with her hurriedly replaced laptop as hanlan and the new york detective frowned down at the jumble alice announced irs records that show how the mafia laundered their money over a very long time obtained how pounced hanlan determined against any more embarrassing foulups hacking admitted alice at once legally inadmissible rejected hanlan an illegal act which hacking is does not provide acceptable evidence of the further illegal act it exposes i know that john and i knew that discussed it im showing you how it was done and how properly and officially you or your financial experts i dont know who for fucks sake can work with the irs and the company registry authorities and get exactly what i got but in a way that is admissible she shouldnt have said fuck she shouldnt have come here like this to be confronted hostilely like this without lawyers telling her what to say and what not to say it irritated her that jane had been right and she had been wrong jane hadnt been right alice decided at once shed kept the baby hers and johns baby safe and jane was missing with her own and johns baby she wouldnt tell them about england alice decided they werent impressed by werent accepting what she was offering admitting any involvement whatsoever in bomboutrage murder would get her publicly charged and publicly exposed a target even if she were in custody which was never an obstacle to the mafia before she could appear before a court to get any sort of public protective stage tell me something i can legally use insisted hanlan the names of the companies through which the laundering worked worldwide snatched alice feeling a flicker of relieved hope i didnt get them by hacking neither did we said hanlan we got them from johns severance letters the bureaus finance and fraud division have been working on them for almost two days now theyre offshore you cant get to them insisted alice the irs route through their supplychain subsidiaries is the only way and you wouldnt have known that if i hadnt shown you hanlan knew she was right was aware too of barbara donnellys shifts of impatience at what he guessed to be irritation at his persistent obduracy whats in carvers safe deposit alice patted the printouts between them a much larger selection of these showing the worldwide spread of the system europe the far east and original stuff that george northcote kept back and a tape recording of john talking to a mob lawyer who wanted it all back which mob came in barbara give us names i dont have any names admitted alice john started to hold back thinking that the more i knew the greater danger i would be in but there are names in the safe deposit persisted the detective lieutenant yes guessed alice she had the right to a lawyer it didnt matter that shed waived her miranda rights by agreeing to talk on the record she had to have an attorney to negotiate for her get her the protection she deserved and without which she and johns baby would die im not going to say any more not without a lawyer what more have you got to say asked hanlan im not going to say any more not without a lawyer doggedly repeated alice she hesitated looking at the recording apparatus except that i think youre a bastard son of a bitch as ginette smallwood led alice away to another room to make her lawyers call in private barbara donnelly said i agree with her youre a bastard son of a bitch shes shown you the way legal or not and you know damned well the bureau and the irs will take it hanlan said do you think we got it all we got enough i want it all it was hanlan thought about time it was the courtesy that frightened jane carver the most the threat to cut off part of her tongue which she hadnt the slightest doubt the man had meant had been made politely and during what little conversation thered been during the journey the one who did the talking had always addressed her as mrs carver the two men sitting either side of her in the rear of the car did so without crowding her and the one whod winded her had apologized unasked the man in the front had said she was being taken to meet someone who would tell her what they wanted and that if she cooperated there wouldnt be what he called unpleasantness no one wanted unpleasantness jane could see the manhattan skyline and the hudson river from the topfloor window of the warehouse office in which theyd locked her thirty minutes before it was bare clearly unused a blank desk without a telephone three upright chairs and a cabinet but there was an adjoining toilet for which she was grateful having sat for so long she was ignoring the chairs standing at the window gazing down at the car park there were a lot of lorries bearing the bhyf logo what was she going to do cooperate obviously tell them whatever they wanted to know but she didnt know anything more than alice had told her would they hurt her do something like maiming her if they asked something she couldnt answer of course they would it had to be the safe deposit if they janes thoughts were broken by the sound of the door opening behind her and she turned to face the two men who entered one was the polite frontseat passenger whod done the talking in the mercedes the other slightly taller bespectacled fair hair just beginning to recede the eyes were unusually upsettingly pale grey more than blue please sit down mrs carver said charlie petrie can we get you anything coffee water still the overwhelming courtesy no thank you jane sat so did the two men on chairs facing her petrie nodded sideways my colleague has spoken to you about cooperation yes it was a croak drythroated she should have asked for water too late now she shouldnt do anything to upset them are you going to cooperate mrs carver yes better this time the fear was taking the feeling from her body she pushed herself very slightly against the chair but could scarcely feel it against her back there was a smile the teeth very even thats good what could she do or say to protect herself help herself i dont know about alice belling we split up shes going to the fbi petrie smiled to caputo and then at jane no shes not he improvised immediately realizing how he could improvise further alice is quite safe with us you found her in morristown yes said petrie she knows more than i do whats she told you were asking the questions mrs carver im sorry she mustnt annoy them they were asking the questions all the questions and she had to get the answers right what had alice told them alice was streetwise better able to look after herself do you know whats in your husbands safe deposit i know you want it do you know whats in the deposit persisted petrie not the details i know its something that my father did for you for your people they couldnt get it without her why hadnt she realized that before because she was too frightened to think of anything but now she had we do want whats in the safe deposit all of it i understand thats what i want you to do mrs carver understand you and i are going to the bank now you are going to authorize my coming into the vault with you along with the banks securities person with the duplicate key itll be just the two of us after its been unlocked you dont open the box i do and i retrieve the material that belongs to us then we leave its all got to be done very quickly no holdups if anyone asks about your being kidnapped you say you are all right safe that its over and that i am your lawyer do you understand all that what happens then petrie smiled you go back to east nd street what about alice belling theres something else you must understand said petrie his second improvisation perfectly thought out if you dont do exactly what i say exactly what ive spelled out alice belling will die die very badly you must understand that most of all i do said jane she was drythroated again youre going to do everything youre told arent you mrs carver yes are we going now right now confirmed petrie can i have a glass of water first as it always appeared to be the manhattan traffic was close to gridlock when they came out of the tunnel and petrie told the driver not to turn immediately but to try the next downtown to wall street he was in the passenger seat now two different men on either side of jane both still giving her leg room petrie felt better than he had at first when hed finally accepted that stanley burcher had run and the other consigliere had insisted he take jane carver to the bank but not that much better petrie had already initiated the search for burcher whose proper function this was and for which hed been paid so much money for so many profitable untroubled years burcher would be found in whatever rathole he was hiding and made to suffer for this suffer more than the motherfucker had ever imagined in his wildest nightmares it was possible to suffer but that was later petries concern was now he calculated he had only fifteen minutes to do all that he had to do at the bank he had the benefit of surprise but someone would raise some sort of alarm after all the publicity about jane carvers disappearance just fifteen minutes they turned on broadway and petrie twisted round and said to jane you got it right yes jane said she was sure she had you worried about your daddys firm thats the only thing theres left to worry about isnt it jane hoped she hadnt sounded too challenging its over now the moment i get what i want its all over the firms safe your daddys reputation is safe everythings all over id like to think so think so she was riding downtown with people who cut out other peoples tongues jane thought did god knows what else people who held alice hostage how much more convoluted who was hostage to whom or for what could this kidnap be you the people you work for entrapped my father didnt you blackmailed him into doing what he did i wasnt involved in the beginning denied petrie who hadnt been the traffic was strangely easier going downtown they joined wall street and jane thought how familiar how safe it all seemed how many times had she come this way past these buildings with her father this was her fathers place her fathers territory everyone on wall street knew her father respected her father george w northcote the king the colossus jane saw the northcote building the faraway monument the citibank closer petrie in the front seat said something to the driver she didnt hear before turning to her he said you tell them im your lawyer coming into the vault with you jane said i know what ive got to say you know what happens you get anything wrong for the first time ever petrie was frightened he wanted to be there watching when they found burcher the car stopped directly outside citibank the unspeaking man to her left got out to open the door to jane even offering his hand which she didnt need petrie was already on the sidewalk coming in close beside her he said remember jane didnt reply it was an expansive crowded lobby the teller area beyond the securities area even further back deep inside the building until that moment jane had forgotten her crumpled sleptin appearance and the television coverage of her supposed kidnap and actually looked around to be recognized she wasnt not until they got to the floor managers desks and even there initially the man at the one they approached frowned up at the way she was dressed not identifying her she said im jane carver get me the securities manager please she was aware of petrie so close beside her she could feel his tension he said dont forget what will happen to alice she said no or what to say no the door behind the desk flurried open and a prematurely balding man hurried out he said mrs carver what jane said dont let this man get out of the building hes kidnapped me hes going to kill me for the briefest moment no one moved spoke petrie appeared frozen then instinctively he turned to run the man at whose desk they were standing pressed the attack button the alarms screamed out the tellers shutters slammed down and the metal gates slid closed in front of all the exit doors petrie zigzagged in total panic going first in the direction of the main already sealed door then to a side exit then back towards the way out into wall street it was at that door he was seized by the uniformed security guards one unnecessarily had his weapon out petrie didnt struggle jane actually walked from where she was standing towards the arresting group very quietly she said to petrie she will die wont she with only two blocks to cover the combined fbi and nypd task force arrived from the northcote building within minutes geoffrey davis was with them as soon as he saw jane he said thank god youre both safe both alice belling gave herself up to the fbi maybe three hours ago twentynine it was jane carvers adamant insistence that they retrace the two blocks to the northcote building where symbolically she took over the office of her dead father over which officially she had no right or authority there she spent almost an hour refusing hanlans repeated telephone calls and then the fbi mans demand to see him upon his arrival with detective lieutenant barbara donnelly while she talked through with geoffrey davis and burt elliott everything alice belling had warned her might be found in her husbands personal security facilities were into damage limitation if thats possible was daviss opinion elliott said i agree but i dont know how what i do know is that its out of my league we need a major bigtime trial lawyer find one the best instructed jane we can explore though suggested elliott find out what we might be up against thats what i want to do said jane whats first establishing the awareness if any of each and every one of the senior partners said davis at once god knows i certainly dont if its possible to save the firm it certainly wont be if even just one other partner was involved if so weve got criminal conspiracy and thats before we know whats in the deposit box which we need to find out right now nothings going to happen to it where it is calmed jane i want to work to an order of priority and thats not my first priority jane much later reflected as she much later reflected on many things that there was inherited proof of her fathers total autocratic control in how still without challenge she was able to summon the senior partners for which she had even less authority there was no objection either to burt elliott accompanying geoffrey davis her kidnap jane insisted was not the point or focus of her gathering them all together it was instead and inadequately because she could not compromise them to advise of a situation that could have serious repercussions upon the firm and therefore logically upon their careers the concentration upon jane carver was absolute and she liked it totally in control and totally in charge which she hadnt been for far too long her only discomfort was looking like a bag lady without a cart but from her command of the meeting she didnt think that was a disadvantage she was going to recite the names of five companies she told them if any of them before this moment had any awareness of the firms involvement with those companies they were to tell her they would be asked again very soon the same question she was posing and more if any lied to her questions not to subsequent ones they would be abandoned to legal process their professional integrity their very future depended upon their replies spacing the presentation allowing silently echoing gaps between each jane recounted the names of the incriminating companies even spelling them out letter by letter and then let further space into the demand finally she said i am going around this room person by person for your individual answers which she did even more adamantly insisting upon a positive verbal denial not a head shake bewildered denials came from every one of them and when she received the final refusal jane warned you are in the coming days going to be questioned by the fbi i believe my father failed you i believe he failed me she had to stop to recover from the admission and he failed john she managed to continue it wont matter a damn to any of you after what might happen in the next weeks and months but i personally want to apologize jane looked nostalgically around the heavy room this cant be a time for questions because at this precise moment i dont have any answers i hope to have very soon the emotion surged up again blocking any more words and jane was angry at the breakdown believing she had steeled herself against it no refused a heavybodied heavyfeatured man directly in front of her this is ridiculous nothing youve said is acceptable what the hell is this all about she still didnt properly know jane accepted a situation i never imagined myself ever being in all i can ask you to do hope you will do is to trust me over the next few days no one was culpable if no one had known so they were personally individually safe even if the firm was not she no longer had any feelings about her fathers reputation where does that leave us demanded another accountant a designersuited black man whom jane remembered her father describing as brilliant and wished she could recall his name uninvolved exonerated responded jane looking invitingly at geoffrey davis i know this is bizarre came in the firms lawyer at once thats exactly what it is totally and utterly bizarre you must believe me that all you can do all any of us can do is hang in there with jane could she remain in charge for and of everything she wanted to do had to do she should feel drained traumatized from what shed already gone through that day but unaccountably she didnt even more unaccountably she felt energized sure she could go on and resolve everything at last she was in a position in a role in which she knew how to perform she was in charge in charge of herself and her surroundings and of what was going to happen today she wished she knew about tomorrow and the day after that the fullfeatured man said what do we do jane said wait say nothing to anybody outside the office certainly not the media but tell the fbi what youve told me open all your accounts to them cooperate in every way youve got nothing to hide well demanded jane when the door closed after the last departing partner i know them all said davis i believe them all they sounded convincingly honest to me endorsed elliott they would wouldnt they said jane you gave them their chance said davis if ones lying they all go down said jane you cant do any more than youve already done on a personal level encouraged elliott she could thought jane but not here and not yet with these two men she said briskly now lets meet the fbi gene hanlan was less able to hide his irritation at being kept waiting than barbara donnelly visibly redfaced he was cursory with the introductions to the two lawyers and said its good of you to see us at last i told your people at the bank i wanted to talk to lawyers before i talked to you jane knew she was treading the slenderest of tightropes not giving in to any bullying but at the same time not completely alienating the man or his organization in the opinion of both davis and elliott she was going to need the fbi as much maybe even more than they needed her there was a slight relaxation from the agent he said to jane you ok jane nodded who were they the people who had me bigtime organized crime predicted barbara the man in the bank is refusing to talk without an attorney the car that was outside the bank took off in too much of a hurry when the alarm sounded right into the side of another car the driver was still unconscious when our traffic guys got to him the other one snapped an ankle and couldnt run there are witnesses to one guy running though the two we got are muscle gofers theyll break you with them against your will asked hanlan damned right i was jane said indignantly they threatened to cut off part of my tongue if i didnt do what they wanted kidnap prima facie declared hanlan now totally relaxed all irritation gone he had a millionaire kidnap and a major mafia investigation under wraps and life looked sweet with the sun on his face and what did they want asked the other woman i thought you knew said jane she had to get more than she volunteered everything depended on it we need to hear it from you said hanlan this is not a formal deposition broke in burt elliott nothing said in this room about anything constitutes a basis of evidence its all privileged hanlan sighed were asking for help not for a formal deposition not yet what happened to alice belling asked jane it was time were going to need a deposition on that too said hanlan what happened to her insisted jane what has she told you that you wouldnt come in without lawyers when she decided to so you took the car and she got a cab into morristown from the truck stop and simply caught a train here some of it doesnt square though like what they were telling her which shed feared they wouldnt how you came to be in morristown where the mafia picked you up when she says you drove off in the opposite direction said barbara what more does she say pressed jane it was hanlan who provided the summary and when he finished jane said she told you all about the hacking she acknowledges that its illegal but said it was the only way to get the proof she and barbara hesitated then plunged on she and your husband needed jane smiled humourlessly i know all about that yes said barbara unembarrassed what does she say about me getting me from the apartment she agrees that technically it was kidnap but that it was to save your life has she asked for the witness protection programme several times said hanlan he looked at the two attorneys something else i guess were going to have to talk about its all going to take time is alice going to get it demanded jane shes with her own lawyer now said hanlan it usually takes a while for our people to decide once weve made our recommendation in your case mrs carver its a forgone conclusion he allowed the gap were expecting your cooperation of course not a foregone conclusion for alice im not sure what shes really offering at the moment what the recommendation will be do i definitely need to go into the programme demanded jane the two lawyers looked uncomfortably at each other so did hanlan and barbara donnelly hanlan said unquestionably with the evidence you are going to be asked to give before a grand jury and then in an open court i want to see alice abruptly declared jane see her alone everyone looked startled hanlan said depending upon your deposition you could be a prosecution witness against her i dont think its a good idea jane said elliott lets get some trial advice thats the deal the only deal insisted jane my cooperation based on whatever legal advice i get in return for my seeing alice belling i dont want us to fall out warned hanlan neither do i said jane so lets not youre going to be very dependent on the bureau in the future continued hanlan the bureaus going to be very dependent upon me right now why dont we see what alices lawyer says suggested elliott anxious to mediate now said jane lets see right now theyd given your miranda why did you say all that the public defence lawyer was a young darkfeatured eager man named joshua dutton who saw his so far impressive success ending as ashes around his feet with this case and was already wondering how he could get out of it he threw aside in theatrical disappointment the transcript of alice bellings earlier recorded interview with hanlan and barbara donnelly i didnt do anything wrong not with any intent to do wrong isnt that a legal principle committing a felony with intent thank god she hadnt said anything about england ms belling you think any court will accept that if they offer half the charges available against you if i am charged with anything will i still be able to get into a protection programme she had to be she had to safeguard the baby dutton shrugged shaking his head at the same time at the moment i dont have the slightest idea itll depend what i can achieve with pleabargaining ill be killed if im not taken in thats my plea said the lawyer everything was going to be an uphill battle he turned at a knock at the door and opened it to ginette smallwood she said mrs carvers lawyer wants to speak with you line three dutton depressed the blinking button listened and then to ensure he hadnt misheard he said do i have any objection to mrs carver meeting ms belling thats what mrs carver wants confirmed burt elliott dutton at once saw the path open up before him covering the mouthpiece with his hand he said to alice she wants to see you what for i dont know but i want you to agree its important will it help me asked alice it could a lot promised dutton all right then agreed the woman dutton took away his covering hand and said right now is fine the moment they met he had unarguable grounds for a mistrial his unblemished record wasnt in danger any more thirty the two women looked at each other jane just inside the door alice at the interview table head low although not quite slumped alice straightened slightly at janes entry neither initially spoke it was alice who finally did pushing herself further back in her chair as she did so we do meet again after all somehow irrationally shed expected jane to be freshly bathed and groomed as shed been in the tv photograph and was glad that she wasnt but instead as dishevelled and crumpled as she was jane came further into the room her hand outstretched heres your three hundred dollars back i got a ride so i didnt need it when alice made no attempt to take the money jane put it on the table i heard im glad youre safe thanks was it bad it could have been but it wasnt jane sat on the facing chair on the other side of the table thats good what did she want wondered alice your cars ok the police or the fbi have got it i dont know which it doesnt matter no i guess it doesnt this was like the strange politeness of the men whod snatched her there was a long silence alice said you wanted to see me hanlan isnt impressed doesnt believe you he told you enough jane hadnt expected alice to look so beaten its true you know its true tell them thats what i want to talk about want to tell them thank you alice smiled the relief moving through her what have they told you about protection lured jane nothing not yet itll be all right when you tell them alice knew hanlan hadnt believed her not completely thought maybe that she was holding something back which of course she was about england at the moment theyre ready to charge you with kidnap announced jane bluntly they want a statement from me alice frowned i know thats why youve got to tell them the truth you havent told them the entire truth have you alice this was the moment when she had to get it absolutely right not give alice the slightest indication she was bluffing yes alice was tensed now fully upright in her chair both hands firmly against the table between them as if needing its support even seated what did you tell them about the hacking come on come on give me the guide i want i admitted it was illegal why i did it alice was frightened the uncertainty churning through her that wasnt the question said jane relentlessly what is the question jane was as sure as she needed to be she had to take the chance what about how you hacked the selfprotective route you took that wasnt so protective for other people what do you want jane why had she told her been so honest about everything what im due declared jane flatly whats that quite a lot you would have been dead if it wasnt for me tried alice i saved myself all by myself the fbi have got three of them and through them theyre going to get a lot more break families im very important to the bureau i wouldnt be here if i wasnt and im guaranteed the witness protection programme youre not though are you i asked you what you wanted the baby johns baby alice stared across at the other woman not comprehending what i want what you have what youre carrying johns baby but youre not pregnant i might have been if john had left a specimen for the tests hed agreed to have we were both going to have but he died before that was possible you any idea of the noise you made throwing up all the time i didnt need the confirmation but i got it in that truckstop shithole while you were throwing up again found the tester you hid under your coat showing positive i was glad then that id pretended to be pregnant convinced you i couldnt have let you beat me that way like you beat me in every other way and then as i drove away i realized how you wouldnt beat me not at all alice couldnt think find the words only one no yes said jane evenvoiced completely sure of herself if i tell the fbi about trojan horses and england which you havent done youll face murder charges there or some indictment it doesnt matter what thats as well as the kidnapping when i swear a deposition how you tricked me into leaving the apartment with you fed me more drugs to keep me at the cabin threatened to kill me for not giving john a divorce so that he could marry you no protested alice again although it was a moan not a shout you cant do this you cant hate me this much yes i can and i do said jane again i got snatched in morristown where your car was found and where you told gene hanlan youd come from to get here howd you imagine the mafia knew i was there and heres another question the real kicker how high would you put your chances of getting into the witness protection programme with all that coming down on you i dont think youd stand a chance in hell do you if i get killed the baby dies too right agreed jane easily think of it as the judgement of solomon i wont let you said alice weakly i know you wont have a termination you wont destroy johns baby yourself and lets be realistic itll be born before all the grand jury hearings and court appearances are over and go for adoption this way the adoption is already properly and legally fixed were surrounded by lawyers and you get to live i dont tell hanlan about england but i do tell him i came with you willingly from the apartment that i truly believe you saved my life and that i wouldnt have known about safedeposit boxes known about anything if you hadnt told me ill even insist you get into the protection programme we just got split up in morristown and im as glad as i can be that you didnt get picked up like i did looking for you youre leaving me with nothing said alice baldly you left me with nothing took everything you expect pity from me i wont do it of course you will your way the baby either dies with you or goes into an orphanage to an unknown life my way the baby lives and is loved and wants for nothing and you live jane smiled its more than the judgement of solomon its the perfect resolution she pushed her chair back ill deny all of this of course if you try and fight me legally no one will believe you against me the amount of trouble youre in how do i know youll love the baby its johns what i inherit from him of course ill love the baby treat him as my own which he will be he challenged alice its going to be a boy said jane positively it was one of the bodyguards the one who had broken his ankle who collapsed almost at once under questioning that night as barbara donnelly had predicted although she hadnt expected it to happen so quickly guaranteed entry into the protection programme a regular pension and paid accommodation ensured he identified the genovese family and charlie petrie as its consigliere he also named the cavalcante family and tony caputo as its consigliere and the man whod personally snatched jane outside the morristown mall theyd had inside information he didnt know from whom hanlan thought he knew and said to barbara that nails alice by nine oclock that night caputo had been seized in a known mafiafavoured restaurant by a task force from the fbis trenton field office caputo smirked and said i dont know what the hell youre talking about who youre talking about the trenton agentincharge said you will when you see her in court like shes going to see and identify you in court as the kidnapper is there the death penalty in new jersey for kidnapping you know i really cant remember maybe your lawyer will remember youre going to need a lot of legal advice tony all the help you can get gene hanlan hadnt expected such an early and certainly not such a sensational breakthrough any more than barbara unlike her he hadnt expected any confession at all although it kept jane pivotal to the investigation and eventual prosecution it took the immediate concentration away from her and took hanlan on to the conveniently retained fbi plane to washington and the j edgar hoover building for a conference that included the director himself it was hanlans assessment of the career potential of what he found himself in charge of that caused him that night to utilize every safe house and apartment available in manhattan brooklyn and queens to accommodate under permanent armed guard not only alice and jane but their lawyers as well he also installed armed protection upon the northcote building citibank and east nd street as he left federal plaza he told barbara donnelly we got the chance to nuke the new york mafias if they dont nuke us first cautioned the detective lieutenant alone in the sterile manhattan apartment assigned to her tauntingly just two blocks from princes street alice belling lay weeping on a cold bed properly experiencing for the first time what life was going to be like in a protection programme thirtyone jane had always been instinctively aware of power and authority of possessing it through her father now it emerged to be no longer subconscious and certainly no longer inherent but hers in her own right so sure of herself did jane feel after alices legal surrender of johns unborn child she refused to let peter mitchell the trial lawyer whose fame had further escalated the overnight media sensation accompany her into the citibank vaults why he demanded although without emotion because peter mitchell never allowed anything he felt to show in how he spoke or looked no matter how irritated as he was now he was a silverhaired urbane man who calculated representing jane carver was worth for which shed receive every conceivable legal guidance for jane carver could be as demanding as she chose jane didnt know why just that after so much and so long in drama not in time she wanted to be by herself quite alone when she finally saw what it had all been about careless of the inadequacy she said because thats how i want it to be she had obviously agreed though to his going with her to citibank along with gene hanlan and barbara donnelly amid the permanent fbi guard which despite acknowledging their necessity at this early stage still made her feel more amused than grateful part of that protection was to arrange the depositbox examination at night after the bank was officially closed with no one inside apart from vetted officials and bank security and uniformed and plainclothes police inside as well as at every exit and with every kerbside approach cordoned off the bank president himself escorted by his three most senior vice presidents awaited them the man silverhaired like mitchell assured the trial lawyer there was an office available for him privately to examine whatever there was in the security vault there was no surprise from any of the bank officials to janes announcement that she was making the initial examination alone one of the senior vice presidents accompanied her and the securities manager no one spoke as they descended after the duplicatekey opening the vice president asked if there was anything else she needed and jane said no shed ring when she wanted the door to be unlocked jane remained for several moments before the numbered box its narrow rectangular door ajar looking too small too insufficient to have caused so much she reached out positively with her newly realized command although aware as she did so that her hands were shaking the box slid out easily but was heavy from its contents when she finally lifted it free and she had to grab it and use two hands to get it to the table so tightly was it packed that the lid came up by itself when she unclasped it the printouts she recognized from what alice had duplicated at the cabin were uppermost neatly folded in what appeared to be some order and beneath them were what jane supposed to be accountancy spreadsheets there were names she recognized from what alice had told her mulder inc and innsflow and addresses throughout the united states but the calculations meant nothing nor did the other figures on other spreadsheets in handwriting she recognized to be johns it was beneath them that the other documentation lay written words she could read and understand even though they were legal and photographs ten in all of her laughing father with a laughing woman whose name was anna from the annotations on the backs in her fathers handwriting with dates and places madrid and capri there were names too on the birth certificate the mothers name was anna simpson the fathers was george northcote and the child a girl was named jane northcote so it was on the adoption papers the sort of adoption papers to which alice had that day attested and sworn and here for the first time appeared the name muriel northcote as well as jane legally getting the northcote surname jane wasnt aware she was crying not until she felt the wetness but didnt bother to wipe her eyes or her nose wanting to cry unchecked at the sadness but most of all most bitterly at the matching irony nothing left she thought nothing that shed believed and trusted and loved wanted to believe and trust and love was left everything she had known everything by which shed felt secure and safe was untrue lies built on lies deceit upon deceit she had johns surrogate baby but she wasnt continuing the bloodline shed cheated and lied to preserve and it was too late now to undo what shed turned herself into a monster to achieve jane wiped her face finally and repacked the box with the photographs and the legal documents of her birth and formal adoption and put it back into the safedeposit slot before ringing the bell for the security official and his duplicate key as she got back into the elevator clutching everything referring to the five mafia companies jane wondered how the person shed believed to be and loved as her mother had felt about the laughing beautiful anna simpson that question inevitably prompted another how or what did she feel about alice belling angry at the deception and humiliation perhaps disbelief at the idea that the woman had never represented a danger to her marriage but not hatred which shed expected waited to feel what then sadness jane decided sadness about too much to examine every reason for it too late to undo she thought again there was one thing one further sadness she could prevent jane realized she wouldnt keep the birth certificate and adoption papers of johns baby where one day his son might find them nothing could be left for johns son to discover that his father hadnt been the most perfect man which was how she planned always to describe him when jane handed what shed collected to peter mitchell the lawyer said ive got your word this is it all there is yes said jane theres nothing left but there was jane corrected herself at once she was going to have johns baby
